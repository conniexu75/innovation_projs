Activation of PPARγ by the naturally occurring ligand, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2), or members of a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, e.g. BRL49653 and ciglitizone, has been linked to adipocyte differentiation, regulation of glucose homeostasis, inhibition of macrophage and monocyte activation, and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Here we report that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) express PPARγ mRNA and protein. Activation of PPARγ by the specific ligands 15d-PGJ2, BRL49653, or ciglitizone, dose dependently suppresses HUVEC differentiation into tube-like structures in three-dimensional collagen gels. In contrast, specific PPARα and -β ligands do not affect tube formation although mRNA for these receptors are expressed in HUVEC. PPARγ ligands also inhibit the proliferative response of HUVEC to exogenous growth factors. Treatment of HUVEC with 15d-PGJ2also reduced mRNA levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptors 1 (Flt-1) and 2 (Flk/KDR) and urokinase plasminogen activator and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA. Finally, administration of 15d-PGJ2 inhibited vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the rat cornea. These observations demonstrate that PPARγ ligands are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that PPARγ may be an important molecular target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is not only critically involved in a number of normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, ovulation, and wound healing, but is also a critical step in many pathological conditions including solid tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7218) Google Scholar). The complex steps involved in new vessel formation have been well characterized in recent years and involve the degradation of the basement membrane by cellular proteases, the penetration and migration of endothelial cells into the extracellular matrix, endothelial proliferation, and the resultant formation of patent, interconnected vascular networks (2Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar, 3Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar). It is now well established that the progression of solid tumor growth and metastasis is dependent on angiogenesis, with the resultant global effort by many laboratories to identify new angiostatic therapies for the treatment of cancer. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 1The abbreviations used are:PPARs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; RXR, retinoid acid receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BrdUrd, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; ITS, insulin, transferrin, and selenium A; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. are members of the steroid receptor superfamily and, as such, are ligand-activated transcription factors (4Issemann I.

Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Three subtypes of PPAR, α, β (also known as δ or NUCI), and γ have been identified and cloned. Like other members of this superfamily, PPARs mediate transcriptional regulation by their central DNA binding domain that recognizes response elements in the promoters of specific target genes (6Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 7Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

Activation of PPARγ has been linked to adipocyte differentiation and regulation of glucose homeostasis in rodents and humans (8Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also shows that the natural receptor ligand for PPARγ, 15d-PGJ2 (9Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M.

PPARγ can heterodimerize with at least one other member of the steroid receptor superfamily, retinoid acid receptor (RXR) (6Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 17Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3483-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific ligands for the PPARγ and RXR have been shown to act synergistically to induce terminal differentiation of human liposarcoma cells (18Tontonoz P. Singer S. Forman B.M. Sarraf P. Fletcher J.A. Fletcher C.D.M. Brun R.P. Mueller E. Altiok S. Oppenheim H. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of PPARα has been demonstrated to mediate lipid catabolism. Treatment of animals with PPARα activators results in the proliferation of peroxisomes and the induction of hepatic genes involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (20Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). Mice that lack functional PPARα accumulate lipid droplets in their livers (21Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Several selective PPARα activators have been described including WY 14643 and clofibrate (22Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Inhibition of human aortic smooth muscle cell activation by PPARα ligands has also been reported recently (13Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. A F. Chinetti G. Fruchart J. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Although PPARβ has been found to be ubiquitously expressed, specific functions for this receptor are not known at the present time. In this study we report on the potent and novel inhibitory activity of PPARγ ligands on HUVEC differentiation into tube-like structures and proliferation in vitro, and the inhibition of VEGF elicited angiogenesis in vivo. These studies demonstrate that PPARγ is an important molecular target for the development of small molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis, which may be useful therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer and other vasculoproliferative disorders. PGA1, PGA2, PGB1, PGB2, PGD1, PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, ciglitizone, WY 14643, clofibrate, and 15d-PGJ2 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). BRL49653 was kindly synthesized at Genentech by Dr. Jim Marsters (South San Francisco, CA). HUVEC were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and maintained in Clonetics EGM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and endothelial cell growth supplements provided by the company. Type I rat tail collagen and recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were purchased from Collaborative Research (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA). Recombinant VEGF was from Genentech. 10× medium 199 (M199) and PMA were purchased from Sigma. FBS was from Hyclone (Logan, Utah). ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenium A), trypsin, and versene were from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse monoclonal antibody to PPARγ (E-8, SC-7273) and goat polyclonal antibodies to PPARα (N-19, SC-1985) and PPARβ (C-20, SC-1983) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Magnetic protein A beads (Dynabeads) were from Dynal (Lake Success, NY). Collagen gels were formed by mixing together ice-cold gelation solution (10× M199, H2O, 0.53m NaHCO3, 200 mm l-glutamine, type I collagen, 0.1 m NaOH, 100:27.2:50:10:750:62.5 by volume) and cells in 1× basal medium (see below) at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml at a ratio of 4 volumes gelation solution:1 volume of cells. After gelation at 37 °C for 30 min, the gels were overlaid with 1× basal medium consisting of M199 supplemented with 1% FBS, 1× ITS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 26.5 mmNaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin supplemented with 40 ng/ml bFGF, 40 ng/ml VEGF, and 80 nm PMA. All drugs were added to the 1× basal medium immediately after gelation. To quantitate tube formation, the number of tubes per high power (20X) field was determined at 48 h after addition of the basal medium. A tube was defined as an elongated structure comprised of one or more endothelial cells that exceeded 100 μm in length (long axis). Five independent fields separated by 100 μm optical sections were assessed for each well, and the average number of tubes/20X field determined. Cytoxicity was assessed using cell proliferation kit II from Boehringer Mannheim. Synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) was performed using 6 μg of total RNA extracted from human liver (positive control) or HUVEC cultured on three-dimensional collagen gels for 24 h by random primer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene Co., San Diego, CA). Subsequent amplifications of the partial cDNA encoding PPARα, β, and γ were performed using different amounts of reverse transcribed mixture (4 μl for liver α, β, and γ and 5 μl for HUVEC α and β and 6 μl for HUVEC γ) as templates with specific oligonucleotide primers as follows: PPARα sense 5′-CCAGTATTTAGGACGCGGTCC-3′ and antisense 5′-AAGTTCTTCAAGTAGGCCTGCG-3′; PPARβ sense 5′-AACTGCAGATGGGCTGTGAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GTCTCGATGTCGTGGATCAC-3′ and PPARγ sense 5′-TCTCTCCGTAATGGAAGACC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCATTATGAGACATCCCCAC-3′. The expected sizes of PCR products for PPAR α, β, and γ were 492, 484, and 474 base pairs, respectively. Negative controls for reverse transcription and PCR amplifications were included. The PCR mixtures were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification by denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), hybridization (30 s at 55 °C), and elongation (45 s at 55 °C). The PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. This technique has been used to quantitatively monitor mRNA expression and has been described in detail previously (26Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Methods. 1996; 6: 986-994Google Scholar, 27Gerber H. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from HUVEC cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels or on collagen-coated flasks for various times in 1× basal medium consisting of M199 supplemented with 1% FBS, 1× ITS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 26.5 mmNaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin supplemented with 40 ng/ml bFGF, 40 ng/ml VEGF, and 80 nm PMA. A gene-specific PCR oligonucleotide primer pair and an oligonucleotide probe labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye at the 5′-end and a quencher fluorescent dye at the 3′-end were designed using the Oligo 4.0 software (National Bioscience, Plymouth, MN) following guidelines suggested in the Taqman Model 7700 sequence detection instrument manual (PE Applied Biosystem). The primers and probes used were as follows: human PPARα gene forward primer 5′-GGACGTGCTTCCTGCTTCAT-3′, reverse primer 5′-CACCATCGCGACCAGATG-3′, and probe 5′-TTGGAGCTCGGCGCACAACCA-3′; human PPARβ gene forward primer 5′-TGACCTGCGGCAACTGG-3′, reverse primer 5′-TTCGGTCTTCTTGATCCGCT-3′, and probe 5′-CACCGAGCACGCCCAGATGATG-3′; human PPARγ gene forward primer 5′-GCCAAGCTGCTCCAGAAAAT-3′, reverse primer 5′-TGATCACCTGCAGTAGCTGCA-3′, and probe 5′-ACAGACCTCAGACAGATTGTCACGGAACAC-3′; human Flk/KDR gene forward primer 5′-CACCACTCAAACGCTGACATGTA-3′, reverse primer 5′-CCAACTGCCAATACCAGTGGA-3′, and probe 5′-TGCCATTCCTCCCCCGCATC-3′; human Flt-1 gene forward primer 5′-ACCCAGATGAAGTTCCTTTGGA-3′, reverse primer 5′-CCCAGTTTAGTCTCTCCCGG-3′, and probe 5′-CCTTATGATGCCAGCAAGTGGGAGTTTG-3′; human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene forward primer 5′-ACGCTTGCTCACCAGAATGA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCGCACACCTGCCCTC-3′, and probe 5′-ATTGCCTTGCTGAAGATCCGTTCCAA-3′; human PAI-1 gene forward primer 5′-TCGTCCAGCGGGATCTGA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GTGCTCCGGAACAGCCTG-3′, and probe 5′-CCAGGGCTTCATGCCCCACTTCT-3′; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene forward 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, reverse 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′, and probe 5′-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-3′. Total RNA (100 ng) was added to a 50-μl RT-PCR reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). The thermal cycling conditions included 1 cycle at 48 °C for 30 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, at 60 °C for 1 min, and finally hold at 25 °C for 2 min. Standard curves for expression of each gene were generated by serial dilution of the total RNA isolated from HUVEC. Expression of GAPDH gene was not significantly altered during the times (up to 48 h) of incubation with drugs and vehicle. Therefore, the relative mRNA expression of each gene was normalized to the level of GAPDH in the same RNA preparation. Confluent HUVEC grown on type I collagen-coated flasks were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then scraped and pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 40 units/ml aprotinin, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.36 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). An aliquot equivalent to 100 μg of protein was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 20 ng of anti-PPAR antibody in a total volume of 500 μl. Protein-A agarose beads (50 μl) were then added, and the mixture incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and the proteins remaining on the beads were solubilized by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer. The precipitated complexes were then analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HUVEC were seeded on collagen-coated 96-well plates at 6,000 cells/cm2 in Clonetics EGM containing endothelial cell growth supplements and 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin and allowed to attach for 4 h. Medium was then replaced with 1× basal medium consisting of M199 supplemented with 1% FBS, 1× ITS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 26.5 mm NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin supplemented with 40 ng/ml bFGF, 40 ng/ml VEGF, and 80 nm PMA. Cells were cultured in the above medium in the presence of drugs or vehicle for 4 h. 5 μl (100 μm) of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added in a final volume of 100 μl/well, and cells were incubated for another 20 h. BrdUrd incorporation was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim. A 1.5-mm incision was made approximately 1 mm from the center of the cornea of isoflurane-ketamine (60–80 mg/kg) xylazine (10–15 mg/kg) anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Using a curved spatula, the incision was bluntly dissected through the stroma toward the outer canthus of the eye. A hydron pellet (2 × 20 mm) containing VEGF (200 ng), sucralfrate (100 ng) with or without (control) 15d-PGJ2 (10 μg/pellet) was inserted into the base of the pocket. After surgery the eyes were coated with gentamicin ointment. Animals were observed at 24–48 h for the occurrence of nonspecific inflammation and then daily thereafter. At day 6, the animals were euthanized and injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran to allow for visualization of the vasculature. Corneal whole mounts were made of the enucleated eyes and analyzed for neovascular area using computer-assisted image analysis (Image Pro-Plus 2.0, Silver Spring, MD). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistic analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (INSTAT, Graph Pad Software, Sorrento Valley, CA). Multiple comparisons against the control were analyzed using Bonferroni modification of Student's t test to determine differences between groups. Ap value < 0.05 was accepted as significant. In this study we used a model of in vitroangiogenesis initially described by Davis et al. (23Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this model, endothelial cells suspended in three-dimensional collagen lattices comprised of type I collagen in the presence of VEGF, bFGF, and PMA undergo rapid morphogenesis. Numerous vacuoles are observed in the majority of endothelial cells within 4 h; the formation of tube-like structures can be observed at 24 h, and an interconnected network of tube-like structures is observed (Fig.1 A) at 48 h. Inhibitors of mRNA synthesis (actinomycin D) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide) completely blocked the formation of tube-like structures (data not shown), demonstrating the requirement for new mRNA and protein synthesis. It has recently been shown that a number of eicosanoid metabolites can serve as PPAR ligands (8Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 9Kliewer S.A.

To determine whether PPARs could affect HUVEC differentiation, we investigated the effect of 15d-PGJ2, a naturally occurring endogenous ligand of PPARγ on HUVEC tube formation. HUVEC were grown in three-dimensional collagen gels in medium containing VEGF, bFGF and PMA with addition of 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm) for 48 h and were analyzed for tube formation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, 15d-PGJ2 markedly reduced HUVEC tube formation. The majority of cells in the gels remained rounded and devoid of vacuoles or lumen-like structures. Vehicle-treated control groups did not show any significant inhibitory effect (data not shown). We extended our observations to a variety of metabolites of 20:4 and 20:3 fatty acids for their ability to inhibit tube formation in three-dimensional collagen gels (Fig. 1 C). PGJ2 and PGD2 and their derivatives/analogs demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tube formation over the concentration range of 1 to 100 μm. PGB1 and PGB2 possessed only weak inhibitory effects. In contrast, two prostanoids known to activate cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors, namely PGE1 and PGE2, had no significant effect over this concentration range. Among the tested drugs, 15d-PGJ2 was the most potent inhibitor of HUVEC tube formation. Data from parallel cytotoxicity assays indicated that none of the tested prostanoids exhibited significant toxicity over the time course (48 h) of the experiment (data not shown). Previous studies (24Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Giles H. Leff P. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PGD2 can spontaneously convert to PGJ2, and in the presence of serum or albumin, to 15d-PGJ2, a natural selective ligand for PPARγ. Therefore, activation of PPARγ may modulate endothelial morphogenesis. RT-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of all three PPAR (α, β, and γ) mRNAs in HUVEC cultured in the three-dimensional collagen gels. In two independent experiments conducted with different HUVEC populations derived from different donors, the mRNA expression of three isoforms of PPAR were demonstrated (Fig. 2 A). By using real time quantitative RT-PCR (Taqman) (26Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Methods. 1996; 6: 986-994Google Scholar, 27Gerber H. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), the relative mRNA expression levels of each isoform were determined to be PPARβ > PPARα > PPARγ (Fig. 2B). Preliminary observations also suggested that expression of PPARγ mRNA was not altered in medium containing VEGF, bFGF and PMA at 4, 24 or 48 h of incubation with 15d-PGJ2 or vehicle in HUVEC cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels or on collagen-coated surfaces (data not shown). The expression of PPARγ protein in HUVEC was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 C), and PPARγ protein levels were not significantly altered by the growth factor mixture when HUVEC were cultured on collagen-coated surfaces (Fig. 2 C). Using commercially available antibodies, we were unable to demonstrate protein expression of PPARα and -β in HUVEC (data not shown). The expression of PPARα mRNA in HUVEC has been previously reported (28Inoue I. Shino K. Noji S. Awata T. Katayama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); however, this study demonstrates for the first time the expression of PPARγ mRNA and protein and PPARβ mRNA by HUVEC. To determine which PPAR isoform(s) mediated the inhibition of HUVEC tube formation, the effect of specific PPAR ligands was assessed. As shown in Fig.3 A, treatment of HUVEC with the specific PPARγ ligands, 15d-PGJ2, BRL49653, and ciglitizone, dose dependently inhibited tube formation with half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 2.8, 6.2, and 2.7 μm, respectively. In contrast, the selective agonists for PPARα (WY 14643 and clofibrate) and PPARβ (erucic acid) (29Johnson T.E. Holloway M.K. Vogel R. Rutledge S.J. Perkins J.J. Rodan G.A. Schmidt A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) did not significantly inhibit tube formation (Fig.3 B). These observations demonstrated that activation of PPARγ results in inhibition of endothelial cell differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. We further investigated whether PPARγ ligands also regulate the proliferative response of HUVEC to growth factors. BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed to detect proliferation of HUVEC cultured on type I collagen-coated surface in medium containing VEGF, bFGF, and PMA in the presence of vehicle or PPARγ ligands. As shown in Fig. 3 C, 15d-PGJ2 and BRL49653 dose dependently inhibited HUVEC proliferation with IC50 of 2.4 and 15.7 μm, respectively. In contrast, PGE1 and PGE2 did not affect HUVEC proliferation (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PPARγ ligands also repress growth factor-induced HUVEC proliferation in vitro. Flk/KDR and Flt-1 are two structurally related endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptors for VEGF. The importance of these two receptors during angiogenesis has been clearly demonstrated by the findings that KDR functions as a transducer to signal endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation and that Flt-1 is a critical survival factor involved in endothelial cell morphogenesis (30Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 31Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 32Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether activation of PPARγ alters Flt-1 and KDR gene expression using real time quantitative RT-PCR. Both KDR and Flt-1 mRNA were up-regulated by the mixture of growth factors in HUVEC grown in three-dimensional collagen gels (Fig.4, A and B,open bars). 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the induction of both VEGF receptor mRNA in HUVEC cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels (Fig. 4, A and B, hatched bars). Similar data were obtained when HUVEC were grown on type I collagen-coated surface with growth factor stimulation (not shown). It is also well known that the production of proteases (e.g.plasminogen activators) and their inhibitors (e.g.plasminogen activator inhibitor I, PAI-1) is correlated with endothelial cell degradation of extracellular matrix and migration, the two critical steps of the angiogenic processes (33Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on gene expression of uPA and PAI-1 in three-dimensional collagen gels. Treatment of HUVEC with 15d-PGJ2 reduced uPA mRNA at 4 h and increased PAI-1 gene expression at 24 h, respectively (Fig. 4, Cand D, hatched bars). Taken together, these observations indicate some possible molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ ligands mediate inhibition of angiogenesis. To determine the potential anti-angiogenic effect of PPARγ ligand 15d-PGJ2 in vivo, hydron pellets containing 200 ng of recombinant VEGF with or without 10 μg of 15d-PGJ2 were implanted into the corneas of Sprague-Dawley rats. Summary data from the experiment show that pellets containing the combination of 15d-PGJ2 and VEGF demonstrated a significant reduction in vessel area compared with the VEGF only positive controls (Fig. 5, A, B, andC). Results from this experiment were repeated in a second independent experiment. These in vivo data strongly support our in vitro observations that activation of PPARγ results in marked inhibition of angiogenesis. Recent evidence has demonstrated that PPARγ is highly expressed in most colon cancer cells and breast cancer cells (14Elstner E. Muller C. Koshizuka K. Williamson E.A. Park D. Asou H. Shintaku P. Said J.W. Heber D. Koeffler H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8806-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 16Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Activation of the PPARγ resulted in growth arrest and induction of differentiation of cancer cells and reduction of tumor cell growth rate, suggesting potential implications of PPARγ as a target for treatment of human cancers. In this study we have documented, for the first time, the expression of PPARγ in human endothelial cells. Activation of PPARγ with either naturally occurring ligand or synthetic selective ligands results in potent inhibition of endothelial differentiation into tube-like structures and proliferation in vitro and suppression of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. PPARγ activation also inhibits the expression of at least three important genes in the angiogenic process, the VEGF receptors Flk/KDR, Flt-1, and the protease uPA. This study thus provides a new insight into the mechanism of PPARγ ligands as inhibitors of solid tumor growth and suggests that such drugs may also provide novel means to control other angiogenic disorders.

In addition to the Smad pathway, another pathway involving a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family of kinases, TGF-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), is required for TGF-β signaling. However, it is unknown how these pathways function together to synergistically amplify TGF-β signaling. Here we report that the transcription factor ATF-2 (also called CRE-BP1) is bound by a hetero-oligomer of Smad3 and Smad4 upon TGF-β stimulation. ATF-2 is one member of the ATF/CREB family that binds to the cAMP response element, and its activity is enhanced after phosphorylation by stress-activated protein kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38. The binding between ATF-2 and Smad3/4 is mediated via the MH1 region of the Smad proteins and the basic leucine zipper region of ATF-2. TGF-β signaling also induces the phosphorylation of ATF-2 via TAK1 and p38. Both of these actions are shown to be responsible for the synergistic stimulation of ATF-2trans-activating capacity.

Hetero-oligomers of Smad move into the nucleus and directly participate in TGF-β- and activin-dependent transcriptional activation (12Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Cárcamo J. Harland R.M.

Recently, the N-terminal regions of Drosophila Mad and mammalian Smad3 and Smad4, which are conserved in the Smad gene family, were shown to interact with specific DNA sequences, and the direct binding of Smad3/4 to DNA is critical for the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation (15Kim J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). In addition to the Smad group of proteins, another pathway involving a member of the MAPKKK family of kinases, TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase), is also known to be involved in TGF-β signaling (19Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). TAB1 and TAB2 were identified as proteins that directly bind to TAK1 (20Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TAB1 enhances the activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) gene promoter, which is regulated by TGF-β, and increases the kinase activity of TAK1, suggesting that TAB1 is an upstream regulator of TAK1. Furthermore, TAK1 activates stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), p38 through MKK6 or MKK3 (21Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H.

Since MKK4 can also activate p38 (23Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), TAK1 may activate p38 via MKK4. However, it is unknown how the Smad and TAK1 pathways function together to synergistically amplify TGF-β signaling. Recently, the cAMP response element (CRE) in theUltrabithorax (Ubx) gene enhancer was shown to mediate transcriptional activation by Dpp, a Drosophilahomologue of TGF-β/BMP (25Eresh S. Riese J. Jackson D.B. Bohman D. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the AP-1 sites of the collagenase promoter eliminated TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activation (16Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the CRE and AP-1 sites (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element,) are similar to each other, and ATF/CREB and members of the Jun family of proteins bind to these sites, respectively (26Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). So far, a number of transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family have been identified. All members of this family contain a DNA binding domain consisting of a cluster of basic amino acids and a leucine zipper region, the so-called b-ZIP (for review, see Ref. 27Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). They form homodimers or heterodimers through their leucine zipper regions and bind to CRE. Among many of the transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family, two factors, CREB (28Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habner J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and ATF-2 (also called CRE-BP1) (30Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 32Kara C.J. Liou H.-C. Ivashikiv L.B. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), are the best characterized. CREB is activated via direct phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (33Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SAPKs such as JNKs and p38 phosphorylate ATF-2 at Thr-69, Thr-71, and Ser-90 which lie close to the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and stimulate itstrans-activating capacity (34Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 35Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N.

Thus, these two groups of factors, CREB and ATF-2, are linked to distinct signaling cascades involving the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and SAPK pathways. ATF-2, ATF-a, and CRE-BPa form a subgroup (30Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4259-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have a transcriptional activation domain containing the metal finger structure located in their N-terminal regions (38Nomura N. Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4259-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These factors bind to CRE with high affinity as a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Jun (26Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 40Macgregor P.F. Abate C. Curran T. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar). Among these three factors, ATF-2 has been more extensively studied, and shown to be ubiquitously expressed, with the highest level of expression being observed in the brain (41Takeda J. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Seino Y. Imura H. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant mice generated by gene targeting exhibited lowered postnatal viability and growth, in addition to a defect in endochondrial ossification and a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje cells (42Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Colins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The fact that ATF-2 activity is enhanced by SAPK whose activity in turn is stimulated by TAK1 allowed us to hypothesize that ATF-2 might play an important role in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Our results indicate that ATF-2 not only directly binds to Smad3/4 hetero-oligomers but also that ATF-2 is phosphorylated by TGF-β signaling via TAK1 and p38. The two pathways, Smad and TAK1, synergistically enhance the activity of ATF-2 which acts as their common nuclear target. The plasmids used to express the GST-Smad fusion proteins containing various forms of Smad3/4 were constructed by using appropriate enzyme sites or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method with the pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each construct contained one of the following regions: Smad3 CT1 (amino acids 1–105), Smad3 CT2 (aa 1–147), Smad3 CT3 (aa 1–266), Smad3 CT4 (aa 1–341), Smad3 NT1 (aa 148–424), Smad4 CT1 (aa 1–65), Smad4 CT2 (aa 1–227), Smad4 CT3 (aa 1–427), Smad4 NT1 (aa 228–552), or Smad4 NT2 (aa 152–552). For the in vitro translation of ATF-2, plasmids encoding a series of mutants of ATF-2, which were described previously (39Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were similarly constructed using the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene). The GST pull-down assays were performed as described (43Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) except for the use of about 20 μg of GST fusion protein per assay. To avoid the nonspecific interaction via DNA, the resins bound to GST fusion proteins were washed with TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.6 m NaCl to remove bacterial DNA. The binding buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% skim milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) was used for binding assays. A mixture of 2 μg of the ATF-2 expression plasmid, pact-CRE-BP1, 2 μg of the Flag-Smad3 expression plasmid, pact-Flag-Smad3, and 2 μg of the Flag-Smad4 expression plasmid, pact-Flag-Smad4, was transfected into the TGF-β-responsive 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some assays, the plasmid to express the constitutively active form of the TGF-β type I receptor, pact-ALK5-T204D, was also co-transfected. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 8 μg by adding the control effector plasmid, pact1, lacking the cDNA to be expressed. TGF-β treatment at a final concentration of 7.2 ng/ml was performed for 1 h before lysate preparation. Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture), and whole-cell lysates were prepared. After decreasing the NaCl concentration to 100 mm by adding the lysis buffer lacking NaCl, lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-ATF-2 polyclonal antibodies (N-96, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG as a control. The immune complex was analyzed by Western blotting to detect the co-precipitated Smad3 and Smad4 using anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) and LumiGO chemiluminescent detection reagent (New England Biolabs). To examine the Smad3/4 and ATF-2 proteins expressed, aliquots of cell lysates were also directly used for Western blotting with anti-Flag and anti-ATF-2 antibodies. The plasmids used to express the Gal4-Smad fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) joined to the N-proximal region of Smad3 (amino acids 1–189) or Smad4 (amino acids 1–265) were made by the PCR-based method with the use of the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing expression vector. The plasmids encoding the VP16-ATF-2 fusion protein containing the C-proximal region of ATF-2 (amino acids 291–505) were constructed similarly using the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The plasmids used to express the Gal4-ATF-2 fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain joined to the C-proximal region of ATF-2 (amino acids 291–414) were made by the PCR-based method with the use of the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing expression vector. The plasmids encoding the VP16-Smad fusion protein containing the full-length form of Smad3 or Smad4 were constructed similarly using the pcDNA3 vector. Co-transfection assays were performed as described (44Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of the Gal4-binding site. A mixture containing 1 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid, 3 μg of either the Gal4-Smad3N, Gal4-Smad4N, or Gal4-ATF-2 expression plasmid, 4 μg of either the VP16-ATF-2, VP16-Smad3FL, VP16-Smad4FL, or VP16 expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was transfected into HepG2 cells. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 8.5 μg by the addition of the control plasmid lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Experiments were repeated three times, and the data were averaged. To examine the phosphorylation of endogenous protein, 293 cells were serum-starved and incubated with TGF-β (3 ng/ml). The cells were disrupted in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of ATF-2, p38, JNK1, and JNK2 were examined using PhosphoPlus ATF-2 (Thr-71), p38MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), and JNK1/2(Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody kits, respectively (New England Biolab.). To inhibit p38 activity, 293 cells were treated with SB203580 (Calbiochem) for 45 min before the preparation of cell lysates. To analyze the phosphorylated state of ATF-2 expressed by the transfected DNA, 293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a mixture made up of 1.5 μg of the plasmid expressing the wild type or CT91 mutant lacking the C-terminal 91 amino acids and 1.5 μg of a plasmid expressing the activated form of TAK1 (TAK1ΔN) or no protein at all. About 45 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and the phosphorylated state of ATF-2 was examined again as described above. The plasmids to express Smad3 and Smad4 were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNAs downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The CRE-containing luciferase reporter was constructed using the previously reported CRE-CAT reporter plasmid (39Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATF-2 and c-Jun expression plasmids containing the chicken cytoplasmic β-actin promoter were described previously (39Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments using the CRE-containing reporter, a mixture containing 2 μg of the reporter plasmid, 2 μg of the ATF-2 expression plasmid, or 1 μg of the plasmid to express ATF-2 or c-Jun, 1.5 μg of the plasmid to express Smad3 or Smad4, 1.5 μg of the activated TAK1 (TAK1ΔN) expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into HepG2 cells. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 9 μg by the addition of the control plasmid lacking the cDNA to be expressed. In the experiments using the p3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, a mixture containing 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid, 2 μg of the ATF-2 expression plasmid, 1.5 μg of the plasmid to express Smad3 or Smad4, 1.5 μg of the activated TAK1 expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected. To examine the effect of various dominant negative forms of ATF-2, Smad3/4, and TAK1, the following mutants were used. The Ala mutant (ATF-2Ala) in which the three SAPK phosphorylation sites (Thr-69, Thr-71, and Ser-90) were replaced by alanine was constructed using the PCR-based method. The N-truncated mutant of ATF-2 (ATF-2Δ107) lacking the N-terminal 107 amino acids was described previously (39Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-truncated mutant of Smad3 (Smad3ΔC) or Smad4 (Smad4ΔC) lacking the C-terminal 40 or 38 amino acids were made by using the PCR-based method. The Smad3 mutant in which all the three serine residues of the SSXS motif are mutated to alanine (Smad3AAVA) was also constructed by using the PCR-based method. The dominant negative form of TAK1, in which Lys-63 of the ATP-binding site was replaced by tryptophan (TAK1K63W), was a gift from Dr. K. Matsumoto (19Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of various dominant negative forms on the TGF-β-induced activity of 3TP-Lux promoter, a mixture containing 1.5 μg of the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, 2 μg of the plasmid to express various forms of dominant negative forms of ATF-2, Smad3/4, or TAK1, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into HepG2 cells by using the CaPO4 method. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 9 μg by the addition of the control plasmid lacking the cDNA to be expressed. To examine the effect of dominant negative form of ATF-2 on the Smad- and/or TAK1-induced activity of 3TP-Lux promoter, a mixture containing 1.5 μg of the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, 1 μg of the plasmid to express Smad3 or Smad4, 1.5 μg of the activated TAK1 (TAK1ΔN) expression plasmid, 1 μg of the plasmid to express the dominant negative forms of ATF-2, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into HepG2 cells by using the CaPO4 method. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 10 μg. TGF-β treatment was performed for 12 h at a final concentration of 2.4 ng/ml before lysate preparation. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Experiments were repeated 2–4 times, and the data were averaged. To investigate whether ATF-2 functions in the Smad pathway, we first of all examined for a direct interaction between Smad3/4 and ATF-2 (Fig.1). Protein affinity resins in which the GST, GST-Smad3, or GST-Smad4 fusion protein containing the full-length form of Smad3 or Smad4 was used as a ligand were prepared (Fig. 1,A and B). The full-length form of human ATF-2 was synthesized using the in vitro transcription/translation system and was mixed with this affinity resin. Approximately 17 and 20% of ATF-2 were bound to the resin containing the GST-Smad3 and the GST-Smad4 fusion protein, respectively, but none was bound by the GST resin alone (Fig. 1 C). We further examined which region of Smad3 and Smad4 binds to ATF-2. In addition to the GST fusion protein containing the full-length form of Smad3 and Smad4, five fusion proteins containing a series of truncated Smad3 or Smad4 protein were prepared and used in the binding assays (Fig. 1, A andB). Among Smad proteins, there are two homologous regions, the N-terminal MH1 (mad homology domain 1) and the C-terminal MH2, which are conserved in Smad-related proteins in various species ranging from insects to vertebrates (Fig. 1 A). The truncated mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 that lacked the region downstream of the MH1 region still retained the ability to interact with ATF-2 (Fig. 1, Aand C). However, the mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 that lacked a part or the whole region of MH1 could not bind to ATF-2 (see CT1 and NT1 of Smad3 and CT1, NT1, and NT2 of Smad4). These results indicate that the N-terminal MH1 region binds to ATF-2. To determine further which region of ATF-2 interacts with Smad4, we made various mutants of ATF-2 by an in vitro transcription/translation system and used them in the GST pull-down assay (Fig.2). Among the six mutants, the two mutants lacking the basic region (ΔBR) or containing a mutated leucine zipper (L34V), in which the third and fourth leucine residues were mutated to valine, failed to bind to GST-Smad4. In contrast, all the other ATF-2 mutants bound to GST-Smad4 with an efficiency similar to that of the wild type (approximately 15–30% of the input ATF-2 protein was bound). These results indicated that the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 interacts with Smad4. We investigated the interaction between ATF-2 and Smad3/4 in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.3 A). The ATF-2 expression plasmid was co-transfected into the TGF-β-responsive 293 cells with the two plasmids expressing Flag-linked Smad3 and Smad4. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-ATF-2 polyclonal antibody, and the co-precipitated Smad3 and Smad4 proteins were detected using anti-Flag antibody. Both Smad3 and Smad4 were co-precipitated with anti-ATF-2 antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The Smad3 proteins overexpressed from the transfected DNA were reported to be localized in the nuclei even in the absence of ligand (45Chen Y. Lebrun J.-J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and ATF-2 is constitutively in the nuclei. These facts are consistent with the data described above. To examine whether TGF-β signaling enhances the association between ATF-2 and Smad3/4, the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, in which Thr-204 was replaced by aspartic acid, was co-transfected, and the cells were treated with TGF-β. Under these conditions higher amounts of Smad3/4 were co-precipitated with the anti-ATF-2 antibody than in the absence of the exogenous TGF-β type I receptor and TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 3 A,compare lanes 2 and 3). The control IgG did not co-precipitate Smad3/4 at all (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). These results show that ATF-2 associates with Smad3/4 upon TGF-β stimulation in vivo. To confirm the interaction in mammalian cells between the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 and the MH1 region of Smad3/4, the two-hybrid assay was performed using HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 B). In the first experiment, two types of chimeric proteins were employed. In one, the N-proximal region of Smad3 or Smad4 was fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4, and in the other, the C-proximal region of ATF-2 containing the b-ZIP structure was fused to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16, and the degree of transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells was examined (Fig. 3 B, left panel). The VP16-ATF-2 fusion proteins stimulated Gal4-Smad3N and Gal4-Smad4N activity by 8.9- and 11-fold, respectively, whereas VP16 alone had no effect. In the second experiment, the C-proximal region of ATF-2 containing the b-ZIP structure was fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, and the full-length form of Smad3 or 4 was fused to the strong transcriptional activation domain of VP16 (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The VP16-Smad3 and VP16-Smad4 fusion proteins stimulated Gal4-ATF-2 act"
https://openalex.org/W2133258970,"It has been proposed that cells sense hypoxia by a heme protein, which transmits a signal that activates the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), thereby inducing a number of physiologically relevant genes such as erythropoietin (Epo). We have investigated the mechanism by which two heme-binding ligands, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, affect oxygen sensing and signaling. Two concentrations of CO (10 and 80%) suppressed the activation of HIF-1 and induction of Epo mRNA by hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CO had no effect on the induction of HIF-1 activity and Epo expression by either cobalt chloride or the iron chelator desferrioxamine. The affinity of CO for the putative sensor was much lower than that of oxygen (Haldane coefficient, ∼0.5). Parallel experiments were done with 100 μm sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor. Both NO and CO inhibited HIF-1 DNA binding by abrogating hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1α protein. Moreover, both NO and CO specifically targeted the internal oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α, and also repressed the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α. Thus, NO and CO act proximally, presumably as heme ligands binding to the oxygen sensor, whereas desferrioxamine and perhaps cobalt appear to act at a site downstream.

Remarkably, the hypoxic induction of all of these diverse genes appears to depend on a common mode of oxygen sensing and signal transduction, triggering the activation of a critical transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) 1The abbreviations used are:HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; Epo, erythropoietin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; luc, luciferase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocater. (for review, see Ref. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a widely expressed heterodimeric protein composed of HIF-1α and ARNT subunits, both of which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix periodic-arylhydrocarbon receptor-simultaneous family (12Wang G.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover HIF-1α is remarkably unstable, with a half-life of <5 min (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Thus, hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1 depends in part on posttranslational stabilization of HIF-1α. In addition, hypoxia markedly enhances transactivating function of HIF-1α (22Li H. Ko H.P.

The oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) of HIF-1α is governed by an internal 200-residue ODD domain (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Removal of the ODD domain renders HIF-1α stable under normoxia, resulting in autonomous heterodimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation in the absence of hypoxia signaling (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). The activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia depends on a sensing and signaling process that is poorly understood. There is strong, albeit circumstantial, evidence that the oxygen sensor is a heme protein (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar,27Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Support for this claim derives largely from experiments demonstrating that heme binding ligands suppress the hypoxic induction of HIF-1 activation and expression of the genes mentioned above.

Subquently, another heme ligand, nitric oxide (NO), was shown to exert a similar effect (29Liu Y. Christou H. Morita T. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Kourembanas S. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to hypoxia, HIF-1 can be activated by the transition metal Co2+ as well as by iron chelation (33Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the activities of these agonists are unknown, although there is circumstantial evidence that they affect the level of reactive oxygen species (34Görlach A. Fandrey J. Holtermann G. Acker H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which may serve as signaling molecules (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). To gain insight into hypoxic sensing and signaling, we have made an in-depth comparison of the downstream effects of CO and NO on HIF-1 activation, HIF-1α stability, and the expression of oxygen-responsive endogenous and reporter genes. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 8-bromo-cGMP, cobaltous chloride, and desferrioxamine were all purchased from Sigma. Hep3B cells were incubated in alpha-modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 293 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), both at 37 °C. For experiments involving CO treatment, cells were seeded in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) fitted with autoclaved rubber stoppers punctured with sterile inflow (3.5-inch, 17-gauge) and outflow (1.5-inch, 18-gauge) needles. Gas flow was maintained at 300 ml/min. In some experiments, cobaltous chloride, desferrioxamine, or SNP was added to the culture medium at final concentrations of 100, 130, and 100 μm, respectively. Cells were exposed to one of the following gas mixtures: normoxia (95% air and 5% CO2), hypoxia (1% oxygen, 94% N2, and 5% CO2), normoxia with CO (21% O2, 10% CO, 5% CO2, and balance N2), or hypoxia with CO (1% O2, 10 or 80% CO, 5% CO2, and balance N2). Gases were mixed with a Series 200 computerized gas standards generator (Environics, Tolland, CT) and humidified by being passed through 0.15 m NaCl. Total RNA was extracted by the TRIzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and dissolved in 100% formamide. A plasmid, containing a portion of exon 5 of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene (bp 2650–2890) inserted into pBluescript, was linearized withXhoI and in vitro transcribed in the presence of [32P]CTP (DuPont NEN) with T7 polymerase (Promega). RNase protection assays were performed with 40–100 μg of RNA hybridized at 55 °C overnight with the Epo riboprobe. For quantification of gels, a PhosphorImager was used with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. from independent experiments. Both p(HA)HIF-1α and p(HA)HIF-1α(401Δ603) are (CMV)-driven expression vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HIF-1α and the ODD domain-deleted HIF-1α (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F.

In general, 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of each expression vector plus 0.25 μg of pCMV-βgal, whereas Hep3B cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-βgal and 2 μg of reporter plasmid. Cells were treated with 100 μm sodium nitroprusside as indicated. After 24 h of incubation, whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F.

For reporter gene assays, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described elsewhere (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Whole cell extracts were analyzed for HIF-1 or Gal4 DNA binding activity or were subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Endogenous HIF-1α protein was detected by anti-HIF-1α monoclonal antibodies: a mix of monoclonal antibodies OZ12 and OZ15 directed against the C-terminal half (residues 530–826; Ref. 35Arany Z.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Maxwell), and anti-HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO. All three monoclonal antibodies gave internally consistent results. The monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) antibody was used to determine HA-tagged HIF-1α expression. Polyclonal anti-ARNT antibodies were used as before (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To calculate the fractional saturation of the oxygen sensor with ligand (O2 versus CO), we used a comprehensive and accurate set of earlier experimental data from our laboratory (37Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the relationship between pO2and level of Epo mRNA. These data, in combination with experimental quantitation of Epo mRNA, enabled the estimation of pOsvalues, the pO2 simulated by O2 + CO ligation. Because the relevant experiments were carried out in 1% O2 (=7 torr), the Haldane coefficient M was calculated from the equation: M = (pOs − 7)/COtorr. Of all the genes up-regulated by hypoxia, Eposhows the most robust response. Therefore we began by examining the effect of CO and NO on the induction of Epo mRNA in Hep3B cells. Epo mRNA, protected by a 240-bp riboprobe during ribonuclease protection assays, displayed a doublet banding pattern (Fig.1, A and B). As expected, hypoxia, cobalt, and desferrioxamine markedly induced Epo mRNA expression. CO suppressed hypoxic induction of Epo mRNA, almost to the level of normoxic controls (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 4). In determining the Haldane coefficient for the oxygen sensor, we assumed that CO and O2 bind to the same site, similar to other heme proteins. At 10 and 80% CO, the calculated Haldane coefficients were 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Interpretation of these values may be confounded by the possibility that, like cytochromec oxidase, CO is likely to bind reversibly to the heme group of the oxygen sensor, whereas oxygen binding may be irreversible if it undergoes reduction to superoxide (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 38Acker H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 718: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the coefficients that we obtained were reproducible and probably valid, owing to the high flow of gas used in the incubations and the likelihood that thepO2 was maintained at a constant level. Cobalt and hypoxia had an additive effect on Epo mRNA levels, whereas desferrioxamine and hypoxia did not. Combined cobalt and hypoxia induction was decreased by 10 and 80% CO treatment, to the levels of normoxic cobalt induction. Cobalt induction of Epo mRNA under normoxic conditions was not suppressed by 10% CO (Fig. 1 A, lane 14). Likewise, CO had no effect on desferrioxamine-induced Epo mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A, lane 11). These results indicate that CO does not suppress Epo mRNA expression in a nonspecific toxic manner. Parallel experiments were done with 100 μm SNP as a source of NO. As shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 3, this concentration of SNP mimicked CO in suppressing the induction of Epo mRNA by hypoxia. However, in contrast to CO, SNP suppressed induction of Epo mRNA by cobalt (Fig.2, lanes 5, 7, and9). These results with SNP are consistent with those of Sogawa et al. (32Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), who tested a hypoxia-inducible reporter gene with SNP and two other NO donors. To delineate the mechanism by which CO and NO suppressed Epo mRNA expression, we examined how these agents affected the activation of HIF-1, the transcription factor responsible for the regulation of Epoand a number of other genes induced by hypoxia. Extracts prepared from hypoxic cells, when incubated with radiolabeled wild-type HIF-1 binding sequence, displayed doublet bands in gel shift assays. In contrast, single bands were observed in extracts prepared from cells treated with cobalt (Fig. 2, lane 2) or desferrioxamine. Similar results have been reported by others (12Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 33Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding was attenuated by treatment with CO in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and6). In contrast, cobalt and desferrioxamine induction of HIF-1 binding was not affected by CO treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). Similar to what was observed with CO, 100 μm SNP significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced HIF-1 DNA binding in Hep3B cells, whereas neither constitutive nor nonspecific binding was affected (Fig. 2, lane 14). To investigate the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of CO and SNP, 293 cells were transfected with the CMV-driven vectors overexpressing HIF-1 (HA-tagged HIF-1α and ARNT, respectively). Both CO and NO abrogated DNA binding of overexpressed HIF-1 (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 17). It is noteworthy that under normoxia, despite exogenous overexpression of HIF-1, no HIF-1 binding activity was detected (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and15). Together these results indicate that both endogenous and exogenous HIF-1 are regulated by the same signaling pathway. Because HIF-1 activity is primarily determined by the abundance of HIF-1α protein (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), we examined by Western blot whether CO and NO affect HIF-1α accumulation in hypoxic cells. As shown in Fig. 2,bottom, exposure of hypoxic cells to 10 and 80% CO resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the abundance of HIF-1α protein (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), comparable with the decrease in HIF-1 DNA binding on EMSA. Importantly, CO had no effect on the abundance of HIF-1α induced by cobalt (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8), again indicating that CO was not exerting a nonspecific toxic effect. In a like manner, we examined whether NO affects HIF-1α accumulation in hypoxic cells. Consistent with the results obtained with CO, SNP blocked hypoxia-induced accumulation of endogenous HIF-1α (Fig. 2, lane 14). Moreover, both CO and NO suppressed accumulation of transfected HIF-1α (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 17). In all these results, the level of HIF-1α closely paralleled that of HIF-1 binding activity. We recently identified an ODD domain within HIF-1α that plays a regulatory role for hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α. Internal removal of this domain rendered HIF-1α stable irrespective of oxygen tension (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of CO and SNP on the accumulation of HIF-1α protein prompted us to examine whether the ODD domain is targeted by treatment with these agents. As in the experiment shown in Fig. 2, lanes 9–11 and 15–17, 293 cells were co-transfected with a vector expressing ARNT and another vector expressing wild-type HIF-1α or the ODD-deleted HIF-1α (401Δ603; Fig.3 A). Consistent with previous results (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), normoxic cell extracts prepared from cells transfected with HIF-1α(401Δ603) gave rise to strong constitutive HIF-1 binding (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). In contrast to wild-type HIF-1α, HIF-1α(401Δ603) was resistant to treatment with either CO (Fig.3 B, lane 4) or SNP (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). These results indicate that the ODD domain is required for the suppressive effects of CO and SNP. Gal4 is normally a highly stable protein. However, when fused to the ODD domain, it undergoes oxygen-dependent degradation (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). To confirm that abrogation of HIF-1α abundance by SNP is specifically mediated by the ODD domain, a plasmid expressing Gal4-ODD was transfected into 293 cells and assayed for Gal4 DNA binding activity. Like wild-type HIF-1, Gal4-ODD exhibited very weak binding activity under normoxia (Fig. 3 C, lane 7) and robust induction with hypoxia (Fig. 3 C, lane 8). Of note, hypoxia-induced binding was markedly reduced by SNP treatment (Fig. 3 C, lane 9). In an effort to elucidate further the mechanism underlying the effect of nitric oxide on the ODD domain, we tested the possibility that NO could be forming an SNO adduct with a cysteine sulfhydryl group on the ODD. Accordingly, Cys-520, the only cysteine residue present in the ODD domain, was mutated to serine. As in experiments depicted in Figs. 2and 3, HIF-1 binding activity was analyzed after cells were transfected with ARNT and either wild-type HIF-1α or the mutant HIF-1α(C520S). Interestingly, the mutant HIF-1α was still sensitive to SNP treatment (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), which is in agreement with the loss of HIF-1α protein accumulation demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B, top panel). As shown in Fig.4 B, bottom panel, probing of the same blot with anti-ARNT antibodies demonstrated that ARNT protein levels remained unchanged. Previously Sogawa et al. (32Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that SNP specifically inhibited hypoxia-induced activity of a luciferase reporter containing four copies of the HIF-1 binding site. Because we found that expression of HIF-1α(401Δ603) gave rise to stable HIF-1 DNA binding activity that was insensitive to CO and SNP treatment (Fig.3, B and C), we wondered whether this stable HIF-1 activity could transactivate an HIF-1 target reporter gene in the presence of SNP. A luciferase reporter EpoE-luc was used to test the effect of SNP in Hep3B cells co-transfected with wild-type HIF-1 (HIF-1α and ARNT) or the ODD domain-deleted HIF-1 (HIF-1α(401Δ603) and ARNT) as mentioned above. The reporter EpoE-luc contains a native HIF-1 binding site within a 50-bp region of the human erythropoietin 3′ enhancer (19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results of Sogawa et al. (32Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), SNP drastically inhibited hypoxia-induced luciferase activity when wild-type HIF-1 was transfected (Fig. 5, left). Surprisingly, a similar result was obtained when HIF-1α(401Δ603) was tested (Fig. 5, right). It is noteworthy that HIF-1α contains two transactivation domains; one is within the ODD domain, and the other is at the C terminus (23Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 24Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol.

Under normoxic conditions the transactivating activity of HIF-1α(401Δ603) was substantially higher than that of the wild type, as observed previously (25Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxia further"

However, NF-κB activation induces rapid resynthesis of IκBα, which is responsible for post-induction repression of transcription. Newly synthesized IκBα translocates to the nucleus, where it dissociates NF-κB from DNA and transports NF-κB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a nuclear export sequence-dependent process that is sensitive to leptomycin B (LMB). In the present study, LMB was used as a tool to inhibit nuclear export sequence-mediated nuclear protein export and evaluate the consequences for regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. Pretreatment of cells with LMB inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by interleukin 1β or tumor necrosis factor α. This is a consequence of the inhibition of signal-induced degradation of IκBα. Although LMB treatment does not affect the signal transduction pathway leading to IκBα degradation, it blocks IκBα nuclear export. IκBα is thus accumulated in the nucleus, and in this compartment it is resistant to signal-induced degradation. These results indicate that the signal-induced degradation of IκBα is mainly, if not exclusively, a cytoplasmic process. An efficient nuclear export of IκBα is therefore essential for maintaining a low level of IκBα in the nucleus and allowing NF-κB to be transcriptionally active upon cell stimulation.

Once IκBα is degraded, NF-κB can translocate to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of several genes including that of its inhibitor, IκBα.Newly synthesized IκBα is accumulated in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus, where it terminates NF-κB-dependent transcription. This is accomplished by inhibition of the NF-κB/DNA interaction and export of NF-κB back to the cytoplasm (38Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter function of IκBα is conferred by a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) present in its carboxyl-terminal region (aa 265–277) (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and homologous to the NES found in many proteins including the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Rev protein and the protein kinase A inhibitor (40Fischer U.

Such NESs constitute transferable transport signals that are necessary and sufficient to mediate rapid and active export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The nuclear protein CRM1 (also known as exportin 1) has been recently identified as the NES receptor (43Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 44Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). CRM1 belongs to the karyopherin β family and, in particular, it shares sequence homology in the Ran-GTP binding domain with members from this family (47Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The formation of CRM1/NES complex is facilitated by the presence of Ran in its GTP-bound form. It has been proposed that this ternary complex is transported through the nuclear pore complex and dissociates in the cytoplasm due to GTP hydrolysis by Ran-GAP (43Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In addition, CRM1 has been shown to be the cellular target of the drug leptomycin B (LMB) that inhibits NES-mediated protein export both in vivo and in vitro (43Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 44Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).In the present study, LMB was used as a tool to inhibit NES-mediated nuclear protein export and evaluate the consequences for regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. Pretreatment of cells with LMB inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by IL-1β or TNFα. This is a consequence of the inhibition of signal-induced degradation of IκBα. Although LMB treatment does not affect the signal transduction pathway leading to IκBα degradation, it blocks IκBα nuclear export. IκBα is thus accumulated in the nucleus, and in this compartment it is resistant to signal-induced degradation. These results indicate that the signal-induced degradation of IκBα is mainly, if not exclusively, a cytoplasmic process. An efficient nuclear export of IκBα is therefore essential for maintaining a low level of IκBα in the nucleus and allowing NF-κB to be transcriptionally active upon cell stimulation.DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here indicate that inhibition of IκBα nuclear export not only prevents the post-induction repression of NF-κB-dependent transcription but also strongly represses the initial activation of NF-κB upon cell stimulation. Indeed, nuclear IκBα appears to be resistant to signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation, and this results in nuclear accumulation of transcriptionally inactive IκBα/NF-κB complexes. Nuclear export of IκBα and many other proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is mediated by a leucine-rich NES that is recognized by CRM1/exportin 1 (43Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 44Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In our experiments, nuclear export of IκBα was inhibited by the drug LMB. LMB specifically targets CRM1 by blocking its interaction with the NES (45Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of CRM1 by LMB is highly specific, it was important to rule out the possibility that LMB might be interfering with the signal transduction pathways that lead to NF-κB activation. To address this point, we used a lacZ fusion protein (4NBC) containing the amino and carboxyl termini of IκBα. When this protein is expressed in cells, it is unable to translocate to the nucleus but undergoes signal-induced degradation in response to agents such as TNFα and IL-1β (24Kroll M. Conconi M. Desterro M.J. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Signal-induced degradation of the 4NBC protein was unaffected by LMB (Fig. 5 A), indicating that LMB does not inhibit the signal transduction pathway that leads to IκBα degradation. It is also clear that LMB does not inhibit transcription in a nonspecific fashion because the activity of the integrated RSV-driven lacZ reporter was unaffected by the presence of LMB (Fig. 1). The conclusion from these experiments is that in HeLa cells, signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm. One possibility to explain this restriction is that an essential component of the signal transduction pathway that leads to IκBα phosphorylation cannot gain access to the nucleus. It appears that the IκBα kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) are present in a large signaling complex that may contain upstream kinases such as NF-κB inducing kinase (55Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and scaffolding proteins such as NEMO (57Yamoaka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). It has yet to be determined if this large complex can be imported into the nucleus. The alternative argument would be that the signal modification machinery has access to the nucleus, but that the nuclear IκBα is in some way refractile to modification. Mechanisms to achieve this could include prior covalent modification of IκBα to a form that is no longer recognized by the IKK signaling complex. It has recently been demonstrated that IκBα is modified by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 (50Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Because this protein is linked to the same lysine residues that are used for ubiquitination of IκBα, this renders the SUMO-1 modified form of IκBα resistant to signal-induced degradation. Although the known proteins that are substrates for SUMO-1 modification have been detected in the nucleus or are involved in nuclear transport (58Hodges M. Tissot C. Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R749-R752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have no evidence to support the notion that nuclear IκBα detected in the presence of LMB is resistant to signal-induced phosphorylation because it is modified by SUMO-1. It is also possible that IκBα could interact with a nuclear protein that occludes the region in IκBα containing residues Ser-32 and Ser-36, thus protecting it from signal-induced phosphorylation.In unstimulated cells, there is clearly a requirement for the transcription of essential NF-κB-dependent genes. Low-level transcription of these genes does not take place simply as a consequence of NF-κB-independent transcription, because IκBα overexpression effectively abolishes the activity of a NF-κB-dependent reporter in unstimulated cells. 2M. S. Rodriguez, unpublished observations. Thus, it appears that the cell has evolved a highly dynamic system to provide for continued low-level transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. This homeostatic mechanism requires the continuous proteasome-mediated breakdown of IκBα, which generates a stream of free NF-κB that can translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NF-κB activates NF-κB-dependent genes, including that of IκBα. After transport to the cytoplasm, IκBα mRNAs are translated, and the free IκBα is directed to the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA-bound NF-κB and dissociates the DNA-protein complex. By virtue of the presence of a NES in IκBα (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NF-κB/IκBα complexes are recognized by CRM1, which mediates nuclear export (45Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). At this point, equilibrium is reestablished. Thus, rather than having a simple on-off switch, the cell can delicately alter the NF-κB transcriptional response by varying the rate at which IκBα is turned over. The most extreme perturbation of this equilibrium comes after exposure of the cells to agents such as TNFα or IL-1β. In this situation, cytoplasmic IκBα is completely degraded, and a massive pulse of NF-κB is released into the nucleus to initiate high-level transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. However, the same mechanism is used to bring the system back into homeostasis (38Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A remarkably similar homeostatic mechanism seems to operate to control the level of p53 within the cell. In this case, the product of thehdm2gene targets p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and disruption of this interaction during the damage response leads to the accumulation of p53. Nuclear translocation of p53 activates transcription of the hdm2gene, and the newly synthesized protein enters the nucleus, where it terminates p53-dependent transcriptional activation. hdm2 also contains a NES, and this is used to export the p53/hdm2 complex to the cytoplasm using the same pathway that is used for nuclear export of IκBα. Inhibition of hdm2-mediated export revealed that nuclear export of hdm2 is required to accelerate the degradation of p53 (59Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In the case of both IκBα and p53, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation occurs in the cytoplasm, even though proteasomes are found in both compartments. However, proteasomal components are distributed differentially between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (60Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 61Wojcik C. Paweletz N. Schroeter D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 191-198PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasomes may have unique properties. The advantage to the cell of these homeostatic mechanisms to control NF-κB- and p53-dependent transcription is that they are both highly sensitive to perturbation, and they can provide a finely tuned response to external signals.

The NF-κB form activated by extracellular signals is composed of p50 and p65. NF-κB transcriptional activity is controlled by inhibitor IκB proteins that contain ankyrin repeat domains. Association of p50/p65 with IκB not only occludes the nuclear localization sequence of p50 and p65, leading to cytoplasmic sequestration, but also prevents NF-κB DNA binding activity.

C., Brunke, K. J., Drayna, D. T., Risch, N. J., Bacon, B. R., and Wolff, R. R. (1996)Nat. Genet. 13, 399–408). At the cell surface, HFE complexes with transferrin receptor (TfR), increasing the dissociation constant of transferrin (Tf) for its receptor 10-fold (Gross, C. N., Irrinki, A., Feder, J. N., and Enns, C. A. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22068–22074; Feder, J. N., Penny, D. M., Irrinki, A., Lee, V. K., Lebron, J. A., Watson, N., Tsuchihashi, Z., Sigal, E., Bjorkman, P. J., and Schatzman, R. C. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A95, 1472–1477). HFE does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with TfR to Tf-positive internal compartments (Gross et al., 1998). Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf, as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake. These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE.

N., and Enns, C. A. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22068–22074; Feder, J. N., Penny, D. M., Irrinki, A., Lee, V. K., Lebron, J. A., Watson, N., Tsuchihashi, Z., Sigal, E., Bjorkman, P. J., and Schatzman, R. C. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A95, 1472–1477). HFE does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with TfR to Tf-positive internal compartments (Gross et al., 1998). Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf, as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake. These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE. HFE is the protein product of the gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disease hereditary hemochromatosis (1), which was first cloned in 1996 (1Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z.

Genet. 1996; 13: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar). It is therefore a relatively new member of the growing group of proteins involved in iron metabolism. HFE is remarkable in that it is a nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I type molecule, a characteristic that prevented its role in iron homeostasis from being recognized immediately. Over 80% of hereditary hemochromatosis patients have the same mutation in the α3 domain of HFE that prevents its heterodimerization with β2microglobulin (2Feder J.N. Tsuchihashi Z. Irrinki A.

Consistent with the classification of HFE as an major histocompatibility complex class I type molecule, this C282Y mutation has been shown to prevent cell surface expression and, presumably, function of the protein (2Feder J.N.

The generation of the HFE knockout mouse supports the finding that the C282Y mutation is, indeed, a loss of function mutation because the phenotype of the knockout mouse parallels the manifestation of hereditary hemochromatosis in humans (4Zhou X.Y.

Although the gene encoding HFE was discovered by genetic mapping of individuals with a disease of iron overload, the function of the protein in iron metabolism has not been immediately appreciated. The region of the HFE molecule normally associated with peptide binding and cell surface presentation in major histocompatibility complex class I molecules is too narrow to bind peptides. HFE does not appear to bind iron either (5Lebron J.A. Bennett M.J. Vaughn D.E. Chirino A.J. Snow P.M. Mintier G.A. Feder J.N. Bjorkman P.J.

HFE does, however, associate with the transferrin receptor (TfR), 1The abbreviations used are:Tf, transferrin; TfR, Tf receptor; fHFE, FLAG epitope-tagged HFE; Ft, ferritin; IRP, iron regulatory protein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; tTA, tetracycline transactivatable; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are:Tf, transferrin; TfR, Tf receptor; fHFE, FLAG epitope-tagged HFE; Ft, ferritin; IRP, iron regulatory protein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; tTA, tetracycline transactivatable; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. a well characterized member of the iron metabolic pathway. The TfR is a type II transmembrane protein that binds the serum protein, diferric transferrin (Tf), at the cell surface. The Tf-TfR complex is constitutively taken into the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. At the low pH of the endosome, a conformational change in the TfR facilitates iron release from Tf (6Bali P.K. Aisen P.

Apotransferrin (apo-Tf) remains bound to TfR until the complex cycles back to the cell surface. At the neutral pH of the extracellular environment, apo-Tf is quickly replaced by diferric Tf and is free to bind more iron (for further discussion, see reviews in Refs. 10Enns C.A. Rutledge E.A.

The association of HFE with the TfR has been demonstrated in tissues and in cell culture (12Feder J.N. Penny D.M. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Lebron J.A. Watson N. Tsuchihashi Z. Sigal E. Bjorkman P.J.

In cultured cells, HFE traffics with TfR between the cell surface and Tf-positive perinuclear compartments (15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

The association between HFE and TfR has been shown to lower the affinity of TfR for its ligand 10-fold (5Lebron J.A. Bennett M.J. Vaughn D.E. Chirino A.J. Snow P.M. Mintier G.A. Feder J.N.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the interaction between HFE and TfR is not immediately clear. Diferric Tf is present at concentrations of approximately 5 μm in the blood (23Young S.P. Bomford A. Williams R. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of Tf for the TfR-HFE complex is approximately 11 nm. Thus, the binding of diferric Tf to its receptor is saturated in the presence of HFE. These results emphasize the putative role of HFE as a regulator of iron homeostasis that acts through the TfR cycle rather than having a role as a transporter or iron-binding protein. To investigate its influence on cellular iron metabolism, the ability of HFE to specifically regulate the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake was tested. We found that HFE does not alter the cycling kinetics of the TfR. Rather, HFE reduces the amount of iron assimilated from Tf by ∼33% without affecting non-Tf-mediated uptake of Fe-NTA. This finding gives more insight into the role of HFE as an iron regulator through the Tf-mediated pathway. Additionally, this focuses attention on the role of Tf-iron stores as a critical part of the “sensing machinery” that regulates dietary iron uptake and the kinetics of metabolic iron recycling. The fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cell line expressing FLAG epitope-tagged HFE (fHFE) under the tetracycline-responsive promoter has been previously described (15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22068-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Calbiochem), 200 ng/ml puromycin, and with (HFE−) or without (HFE+) 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Human holotransferrin (Intergen, Co.) was labeled with Na[125I] (NEN Life Science Products) using lactoperoxidase as described previously (24Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rate of 125I-Tf uptake was determined as described previously (24Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Uptakes were performed on subconfluent HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cultures (∼1 × 106 cells) washed two times with 2 ml of DMEM-20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated in the same medium for 15 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. At the 0 min mark, 1 ml of specific (DMEM-20 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml ovalbumin, 50 nm125I-Tf) or nonspecific (specific medium with 1 mg/ml cold Tf) medium was added to the appropriate cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2, 4, 6, or 8 min. Externally bound Tf was stripped with an acidic buffer (0.5 n acetic acid, 0.5 mNaCl) for 3 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells were washed four times with 2 ml of 4 °C final wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) before addition of solubilization detergent (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% NaOH) and counting in a gamma counter (Packard, CobraII Auto-Gamma). Surface TfR numbers were determined by counting the amount of125I-Tf bound after incubation with 50 nm125I-Tf for 90 min on ice at 4 °C. Following the 90-min incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed four times with 2 ml of 4 °C final wash buffer before solubilization and counting. The rate of Tf efflux was determined as described previously by McGraw and Maxfield (25McGraw T. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Monolayers of subconfluent HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells grown in 35-mm plates were washed three times with 2 ml of DMEM-20 mmHEPES and then preincubated in the same medium for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 2 h with specific (50 nm125I-Tf in DMEM-20 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml ovalbumin) or nonspecific (specific medium with 1 mg/ml unlabeled Tf) medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed with 2 ml of 37 °C mild acid buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 5.0) for 2 min and then washed two times with 2 ml of 37 °C final wash buffer with 100 μmdesferoxamine (desferal; Ciba-Geigy Ltd.; Basel, Switzerland) and 3 μg/ml Tf to prevent loading and rebinding of apo-125I-Tf. 1 ml of 37 °C medium (DMEM-20 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml ovalbumin) with 3 μg/ml Tf and 100 μm desferoxamine was added at the 0 min mark, and then at each of the appropriate time points, plates were placed on ice and the appropriate efflux, surface and internal samples were collected as follows. Medium was removed by pipetting, and cells were washed one time with 1 ml of final wash, which was pooled and counted in gamma counter (Packard, CobraII Auto-Gamma). Cells were incubated in 1 ml of acid wash (0.2n acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl) for 3 min at 4 °C and then washed 1 time with 1 ml of final wash, which was pooled and counted. Cells were stripped and washed as per surface samples and then solubilized in 2 ml of solubilization detergent and counted. The relative TfR distribution between cell surface (external) and internal compartments was determined as described previously (25McGraw T. Maxfield F.R.

Subconfluent HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells grown in 35-mm plates were either incubated for 90 min with 100 nm125I-Tf at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for total and internal measurements or with 100 nm125I-Tf at 4 °C for external measurements in 1 ml of specific (100 nm125I-Tf in DMEM-20 mm HEPES) or nonspecific (specific medium with 1 mg/ml unlabeled Tf) medium at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation time, cells were placed on ice. Total and external measurements were determined by washing four times with 2 ml of final wash at 4 °C and then solubilizing and counting. The amount of internalized125I-Tf was determined by stripping the surface for 3 min with acid wash, washing four times with 2 ml of final wash, and then solubilizing and counting in gamma counter (Packard, CobraII Auto-Gamma). 55FeCl3 (NEN Life Science Products) was complexed to nitrilotriacetic acid in a 1:200 ratio (Fe:NTA). Then, the55Fe-NTA was incubated with Tf in a 2:1 ratio for 1 h in carbonate buffer (10 mm NaHCO3, 250 mm Tris-HCl). 55Fe-transferrin was separated from free 55Fe on a 20-ml G-50 Sephadex (Sigma) column. The resulting transferrin was 82% saturated with iron. 55Fe uptake from transferrin was determined essentially as described above for 125I-Tf uptake with the following modifications. Uptakes were performed on subconfluent HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells grown in 35-mm dishes. Specific medium contained 100 nm55Fe-Tf and 2 mg/ml ovalbumin in wash medium (McCoy's 5A with 20 mm HEPES). Nonspecific medium was the same as specific with the addition of 1 mg/ml unlabeled Tf. After 45, 90, 135, or 225 min of uptake, cells were placed on ice, and externally bound Tf was stripped with an acidic buffer (0.2n acetic acid, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mmFeCl3) for 3 min at 4 °C. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of the same solubilization detergent described above. Lysates were mixed with 6 ml UniverSol (ICN) and counted for 10 min in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC) with a window of 0–350 nm. TfR numbers were determined as described for the 125I-Tf uptake protocol above. 55Fe-NTA uptake procedures were modified from a previously described protocol by Inman and Wessling-Resnick (27Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A55Fe-NTA solution was made by the addition of55FeCl3 to NTA buffer (80 μm NTA, 20 mm HEPES-Tris) for a final concentration of 20 μm. Subconfluent fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed two times with 2 ml of McCoy's 5A-20 mmHEPES at 37 °C. Wash medium was replaced with 1 ml of specific (200 nm55Fe-NTA in wash medium) or nonspecific (specific medium with 1 mm Fe-NTA) medium. After 2, 5, 10, 15, or 30 min of uptake, cells were placed on ice, and 3 ml of 4 °C quench buffer (1 mm Fe-NTA, 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl) was added for 20 min. Finally, the cells were washed three times with 2 ml of 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C, solubilized, and counted as for 55Fe-Tf uptake protocol described above. HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells were seeded at ∼1.5 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish. After 2 days, cells were treated with either 50 μm desferoxamine, 100 nm human holotransferrin (Intergen Co.), or 100 μm Fe-NTA overnight. Cells were lysed in NET-Triton (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100) after at least 12 h of treatment. Cell extracts from 2 × 105 cells were diluted with 4× Laemmli buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) to 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was performed using sheep anti-human transferrin receptor serum (described previously (24Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); 1:10,000 dilution), and sheep anti-human ferritin antibody (The Binding Site, Ltd., 1:100 dilution) followed by swine anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim). Chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) was performed per the manufacturer's directions. The influence of HFE on TfR cycling kinetics was measured to determine how HFE regulates iron levels in the cell. In previous studies, a cell line expressing fHFE under the control of the tetracycline repressible system was established (15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22068-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Induction of HFE expression by the withdrawal of tetracycline from the medium results in decreased ferritin (Ft) levels. One mechanism by which HFE could lower the amount of iron taken up into cells would be by decreasing the rate of endocytosis of the TfR. HFE co-traffics with TfR between the cell surface and Tf positive perinuclear compartments (15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22068-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and therefore might have some influence on TfR endocytic kinetics. The rate of 125I-Tf uptake was measured to test whether or not HFE alters the endocytosis of TfR and therefore the amount of Tf-mediated iron uptake in fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells expressing fHFE (fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells). Uptake experiments were performed in the presence of 50 nm125I-Tf. The association of HFE with the TfR decreases the affinity of the TfR for Tf, resulting in an increase in the K d from 1.2 to 11 nm(15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22068-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). At 50 nm Tf, essentially all the TfRs are occupied with Tf, even in the presence of HFE. Cells were incubated with125I-Tf for 2, 4, 6, or 8 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The surface was stripped of bound Tf, and the amount of 125I-Tf inside the cell was counted. Both HFE− and HFE+ cells took up approximately 0.20 Tf/surface TfR/min (Fig.1). The same rates of internalization were measured in cells treated with 100 nm125I-Tf, confirming that the binding of Tf to its receptor was rapid and saturating (data not shown). fHFE did not significantly alter the amount of 125I-Tf uptake per TfR in fWTHFE/tTA cells and therefore did not affect the kinetics of TfR endocytosis. The amount of iron taken up into cells is a function of the kinetics of TfR cycling that depends on both the endocytic and exocytic rates. Because fHFE had no effect on TfR endocytosis, the rate of 125I-Tf release was measured to test whether fHFE alters the exocytic rate of TfR in HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells. Cells were loaded with 125I-Tf for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to saturate internal and external TfR with Tf. Then, the cell surface was stripped of Tf, and fresh medium was added to the cells. The Tf released from internal cellular compartments was collected and counted at 2, 4, 6, and 8 min time points. HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells did not differ significantly in their rate of TfR exocytosis (Fig.2). Because the uptake and efflux kinetics of Tf did not change with the expression of fHFE, the steady state distribution of external and internal TfRs should also remain the same between cells expressing and not expressing fHFE. To test this prediction, steady state external and internal pools of 125I-Tf were measured in control cells (HFE−) and in cells expressing fHFE (HFE+). fHFE expression did not significantly alter the relative surface and internal distributions of TfR (Fig. 3). Approximately 20% of cellular TfR was found at the cell surface, whereas 80% was found in internal vesicles. The distribution of TfR between the cell surface and internal compartments was similar to that reported previously in other cell lines expressing similar amounts of TfR (29Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12780-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30McGraw T.E. Pytowski B. Arzt J. Ferrone C. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Combined with the uptake and efflux data reported above, these findings support the conclusion that HFE has no effect on TfR cycling kinetics even though HFE associates and co-traffics with the TfR (15Gross C.N. Irrinki A. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22068-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether HFE affected the amount of Tf-mediated or non-Tf-mediated iron uptake because no effect on the cycling kinetics of the TfR was detected. HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of 100 nm55Fe-loaded Tf for up to 240 min, and the rate of 55Fe uptake from Tf for HFE− and HFE+ cells was determined. Control cells took up 55Fe from Tf at a rate of 0.291 pmol of Fe/106 cells/min, whereas cells expressing fHFE took up 55Fe from Tf at a rate of 0.193 pmol of Fe/106 cells/min (Fig. 4). These data show that HFE-expressing cells take up approximately 33% less iron from Tf than control cells that do not express fHFE. To determine whether the influences of HFE are restricted to the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake or if HFE additionally affects the non Tf-mediated iron uptake pathway, HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of 200 nm55Fe-NTA for up to 30 min. No significant difference was seen in iron uptake between HFE− and HFE+ cells (Fig.5). Combined, these results support the conclusion that the regulation of iron uptake by HFE is specific to the Tf-mediated iron uptake pathway. The effect of HFE on Tf-mediated iron uptake is therefore a direct effect on the Tf-derived iron pathway rather than an alteration of all cellular iron metabolism. The response of HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells to iron loading or iron chelation was observed by detection of TfR and Ft levels on Western blots. These experiments were performed to test whether HFE affects the ability of the cells to compensate for changing iron levels in the medium as predicted by the known influences of iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) on Ft and TfR expression. IRPs are the most extensively characterized mode of regulating intracellular iron concentrations. In the presence of low intracellular iron, IRPs bind to iron responsive elements in the mRNA of iron-regulated proteins. This interaction either stabilizes the mRNA by binding to the 3′-end of the transcript (as is the case for TfR mRNA), or blocks translation by binding to the 5′-end of the transcript, close to the site of translation initiation (as is the case for Ft mRNA). Thus, at low intracellular iron levels, the cell increases iron uptake by increasing TfR levels. It decreases iron storage by lowering Ft levels. When intracellular iron concentrations are high enough, the IRP no longer binds the iron responsive element. This acts to reduce iron uptake from Tf by reducing TfR levels and increasing Ft levels. The response of cells to iron depletion and iron loading was measured in HFE− and HFE+ fWTHFE/tTA HeLa cells grown for 2 days in untreated growth medium and treated for at least 12 h with growth medium supplemented with 50 μm desferoxamine to chelate iron, human Tf, or Fe-NTA. Under control conditions, cells expressing fHFE had no detectable Ft over background, whereas those that do not express HFE showed significant amounts of Ft (Fig.6). HFE− and HFE+ cells showed increased Ft expression following treatment with 100 nm human Tf. HFE− cells increased Ft levels only about 2-fold upon inspection of the Western blot. HFE+ cells had slightly less Ft than HFE− cells for the same treatment condition, but this was a significant increase over the undetectable Ft levels in HFE+ cells without Tf treatment. In the same way, both HFE− and HFE+ cells showed increased Ft expression following treatment with 100 μm Fe-NTA. TfR levels als"

The TXA2receptor (TXA2R) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is found as two alternatively spliced isoforms, α (343 residues) and β (407 residues), which share the first 328 residues. In the present report, we demonstrate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence microscopy that the TXA2Rβ, but not the TXA2Rα, undergoes agonist-induced internalization when expressed in HEK293 cells as well as several other cell types. Various dominant negative mutants were used to demonstrate that the internalization of the TXA2Rβ is dynamin-, GRK-, and arrestin-dependent in HEK293 cells, suggesting the involvement of receptor phosphorylation and clathrin-coated pits in this process. Interestingly, the agonist-stimulated internalization of both the α and β isoforms, but not of a mutant truncated after residue 328, can be promoted by overexpression of arrestin-3, identifying the C-tails of both receptors as necessary in arrestin-3 interaction. Simultaneous mutation of two dileucine motifs in the C-tail of TXA2Rβ did not affect agonist-promoted internalization. Analysis of various C-tail deletion mutants revealed that a region between residues 355 and 366 of the TXA2Rβ is essential for agonist-promoted internalization. These data demonstrate that alternative splicing of the TXA2R plays a critical role in regulating arrestin binding and subsequent receptor internalization.

Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K.L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is a product of the sequential metabolism of arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenases and TXA2 synthase (2Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). TXA2 formation can result from activation of various cell types, including platelets, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells (1Halushka P.V. Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K.L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binding of TXA2 to its receptor (TXA2R) induces platelet aggregation, constriction of vascular and bronchiolar smooth muscle cells, as well as mitogenesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. TXA2 has been implicated in a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases (1Halushka P.V. Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K.L. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). While pharmacological studies have suggested the existence of TXA2R subtypes (3Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar), the receptor appears to be encoded by a single gene that can be alternatively spliced in the carboxyl-terminal tail (C-tail) leading to two variants, TXA2Rα and -β, that share the first 328 amino acids. Complementary DNAs for the 343-amino acid TXA2Rα were cloned from placental and megakaryocytic sources (4Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), whereas a cDNA for the 407-amino acid TXA2Rβ was isolated from a vascular endothelial library (5Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (Correction (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7011): 19256-19261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TXA2Rs have been shown to couple to the G proteins Gq, Gi2, G11, G12, G13, G16, and an 85-kDa unidentified G protein, explaining the multiplicity of TXA2R-mediated signal transduction (6Kinsella B.T.

While no isoform-specific biological functions have been ascribed to either of the TXA2Rs, the different C-tails are likely to play a role in G protein-coupling specificity (12Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and perhaps confer different desensitization characteristics. It has been suggested that homologous desensitization of the TXA2Rs in cells can be divided into two stages: the early stage involves uncoupling of receptors from G proteins, while a later stage involves a loss of receptor sites from the plasma membrane (13Spurney R.F. Middleton J.P. Raymond J.R. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F467-F478PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sakai K. Nakahata N. Ono H. Yamamoto T. Ohizumi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that the dose and time dependence of agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation appeared similar for both isoforms in HEK293 cells stably overexpressing the TXA2Rs. However, phorbol ester-promoted activation of protein kinase C prevented the agonist-mediated intracellular calcium rise in TXA2Rβ-, but not TXA2Rα-, stably expressing CHO cells (18Yukawa M. Yokota R. Eberhardt R.T. von Andrian L. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the presence of Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites is critically important in receptor desensitization and internalization (see Ref. 19Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, and references therein). Homologous receptor desensitization appears to be primarily initiated by phosphorylation of the agonist-activated GPCR by a family of Ser/Thr kinases known as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This leads to high affinity binding of a second class of proteins referred to as arrestins (for review, see Refs. 19Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 20Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Sterne-Marr R.

The non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, 2While a variety of names have been used for the various mammalian arrestins, in this article we use nomenclature based on the order of discovery of the arrestins: arrestin-1 (visual arrestin, S-antigen, 48-kDa protein); arrestin-2 (β-arrestin, β-arrestin-1); arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2, arrestin3, thy-X arrestin); arrestin-4 (C-arrestin, X-arrestin).2While a variety of names have been used for the various mammalian arrestins, in this article we use nomenclature based on the order of discovery of the arrestins: arrestin-1 (visual arrestin, S-antigen, 48-kDa protein); arrestin-2 (β-arrestin, β-arrestin-1); arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2, arrestin3, thy-X arrestin); arrestin-4 (C-arrestin, X-arrestin). function as adaptor proteins to recruit receptors to coated pits by virtue of their ability to bind to both activated, phosphorylated GPCRs and clathrin (24Goodman Jr., O.B.

We were interested in determining if the different C-tails of the TXA2Rα and -β could bestow distinct internalization characteristics to these receptor isoforms. Here, we report that the TXA2Rβ, but not the TXA2Rα, undergoes agonist-induced internalization in several different cell types. The internalization of TXA2Rβ is inhibited by dominant negative forms of dynamin, GRK2, and arrestins, while internalization of both isoforms can be promoted by overexpression of GRK2 and arrestins. A small region which contains 3 serine residues in the C-tail of TXA2Rβ was identified as being essential for internalization. Taken together, these data suggest a role for receptor phosphorylation in TXA2Rβ agonist-induced internalization, in a process likely involving arrestins and clathrin-coated pits. Our results indicate that the C-tail of these two receptors is responsible for their different internalization properties. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MiaPACA (human pancreatic carcinoma cells) were grown in the same medium also containing 2.5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse lymphoid neoplasm cells (P388D1) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum while CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were grown in Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections were done with Fugene-6 (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNAs for the TXA2Rα and TXA2Rβ were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using a pool of total RNA from HeLa, A431, U937, and MiaPACA cells. Primers used for TXA2Rα were 5′-GGAATTCATGTGGCCCAACGGCAGTTCCCTG-3′ (TXAF) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTTCCAATGTCTGCATGCCC-3′, while the primers TXAF and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCATTCAATCCTTTCTGGACAGAGC-3′(TXAB) were used for TXA2Rβ. A pcDNA3 vector containing an HA epitope was constructed by annealing the two primers 5′-AGCTTCGATCGTCGACATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGCGAGCTCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGAGCTCGCCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATGTCGACGATCGA-3′ and ligating them in pcDNA3 digested with HindIII andEcoRI. The same strategy was employed to generate a pcDNA3FLAG vector using 5′-AGCTTGGGCACCATGAAGACGATCATCGCCCTGAGCTACATCTTCTGCCTGGTGTTCGCCGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACACCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGGTGTCATCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCGAACACCAGGCAGAAGATGTAGCTCAGGGCGATGATCGTCTTCATGGTGCCCA-3′ as primers. The receptors were then subcloned in these vectors, yielding in-frame constructs expressing epitope-tagged receptor polymerase chain reaction. Mutated receptors were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with the TXA2Rα and TXA2Rβ cDNAs as templates. Mutants were created using the TXAF primer and the following corresponding primers: S344Stop, 5′-GAGGAATTCCTACGAGATCGTGCCACTGTACTC-3′; C347Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAGCAGTGAGCCGAGATCGTGCC-3′; L351Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAGAGGCGGAGGTTGCAGTGAGC-3′; S355Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAGCTTGAACCCGGGAGGCGGAG-3′; S362Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAGGAGGCTGAGGCACGAGAATC-3′; G366Stop, 5′-CTCCTCGAGTCACCCAGCTGCTCGGGAGGCTGAG-3′; F380Stop, 5′-CTCCTCGAGTCAAAAGAGCATGCAAGGCGGGGC-3′; D385Stop, 5′-CTCCTCGAGTCAGTCAAATTCAGGGTCAAAGAG-3′; G389Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCACTGTACCCCAGCAAGTAGGTC-3′; F395Stop, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAAAAAGGAAGCAACTGTACCCCAGC-3′; and LLLLA, 5′-CAGCTCGAGTCAATCCTTTCTGGACAGAGCCTTCCCTGTTGGAGGTTCAAAAGGAGCCGCCTGTACCCCAGCAGCAGCGTCAAATTCAGGGTCAAAGAG-3′. All the mutants were subcloned in the HA-tag vector as mentioned above. Mutations and the integrity of the coding sequence were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Sidney Kimmel Nucleic Acid Facility). Competition binding curves were done on HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptor species. Cells were harvested and washed twice in Buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 129 mm NaCl, 8.9 mmNaHCO3, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm dextrose, 0.38% sodium citrate, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA). Binding reactions were carried out on 5 × 104 cells in a total volume of 0.25 ml in the same buffer with 10 nm [3H]SQ29543 (a TXA2antagonist) and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive SQ29543 for 2 h at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 1 min and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. For quantification of receptor internalization, ELISA assays were performed essentially as described by Daunt et al. (37Daunt D.A. Hurtz C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The cell lines were plated out at 6 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish, transfected with 6 μg of DNA and split after 24 h into 6 wells of 24-well tissue culture dishes previously coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma). After another 24 h, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in DMEM at 37 °C for several minutes. Then the TXA2 agonist U46619 was added at a concentration of 100 nm in prewarmed DMEM to the wells. The cells were then incubated for various times at 37 °C and reactions were stopped by removing the media and fixing the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde/TBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with TBS and nonspecific binding blocked with TBS containing 1% BSA for 45 min at room temperature. The first antibody (monoclonal HA 101R, Babco) was added at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Three washes with TBS followed, and cells were briefly reblocked for 15 min at room temperature. Incubation with goat anti-mouse conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:1000 in TBS/BSA was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with TBS and a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate was added. When the adequate color change was reached, 100-μl samples were taken for colorimetric readings. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 were studied concurrently to determine background. All experiments were done in triplicate. HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells per well of 12-well plates and transfected as described above with the WT or mutant receptors and labeled the following day for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol at 4 μCi/ml in DMEM (high glucose, without inositol). After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in prewarmed DMEM (high glucose, without inositol) containing 0.5% BSA, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated for 10 min with different concentrations of U46619. The reactions were terminated by removing the stimulation media and by the addition of 0.8 ml of 0.4 m perchloric acid. Samples were harvested in Eppendorf tubes, and a 0.5 volume of 0.72 nKOH, 0.6 m KHCO3 was added. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Inositol phoshates were separated on Dowex AG 1-X8 columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then counted by liquid scintillation. Cells (HEK293, P388D1, MiaPACA, A431, and CHO) were grown in 35-mm dishes on coverslips and then transfected as described above with 2 μg of DNA/well. After 48 h, cells were incubated with Flag M1 antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, then treated with 100 nm U46619 for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 0.5% BSA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS/CaCl2, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS/CaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with blotto (0.05% Triton X-100/PBS/CaCl2 containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at 37 °C. Goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was then added at a dilution of 1:150 in blotto for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed six times with permeabilization buffer with the last wash left at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde as described. Coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and examined by microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan Fluor 60× objective. Cells expressing the lowest levels of transfected proteins, but clearly above those of nonexpressing cells, were chosen for view. Images were collected using QED Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop v. 3.0. A schematic representation of the carboxyl-terminal tails of the two isoforms of the human TXA2 receptor is shown in Fig.1. In order to investigate the internalization of the TXA2Rα and -β, epitope-tagged TXA2Rs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Similar to previous reports (5Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M.

These observations were confirmed by evaluation of ligand binding to a mutant receptor truncated after residue 328 (R328Stop) (K d = 12.9 ± 1.7 nm). Addition of an HA or Flag epitope tag at the NH2 terminus of the receptors also did not alter ligand affinities, nor did it effect the activation characteristics of the receptors as determined by their respective EC50 values for inositol phosphate generation in response to agonist (data not shown). The TXA2R expressing HEK293 cells were next assessed for agonist-promoted loss of cell surface TXA2Rs using an ELISA assay. A time course analysis of receptor internalization following stimulation with 100 nm of the agonist U46619 is illustrated in Fig. 2. While the TXA2Rα does not undergo agonist-stimulated internalization, ∼40% of the TXA2Rβ are internalized after 2 h of agonist treatment, with a t1/2 of ∼45 min. Stimulation of cells with U46619 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 nm all produced maximal effects which could be blocked by the specific antagonist SQ29543, while even 1 μm U46619 treatment failed to induce TXA2Rα internalization (data not shown). To confirm these results, we performed an additional series of studies using immunofluorescence microscopy to directly visualize internalization of the Flag-tagged TXA2 receptors in HEK293 cells. Cells were incubated with the Flag antibody prior to agonist exposure so that only the trafficking of receptors initially present on the cell surface would be detected. After agonist treatment, cells were permeabilized and the Flag epitope was visualized with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the TXA2Rα is found primarily at the cell surface even after the cells have been stimulated with agonist for 1 h. In contrast, agonist exposure of cells expressing the TXA2Rβ resulted in a striking redistribution of the receptors to intracellular compartments. These observations support the results obtained by ELISA analysis. Interestingly, there is also a significant amount of TXA2Rβ redistribution when the cells are incubated at 37 °C in the absence of agonist compared with cells kept at 4 °C (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that the TXA2Rβ may also undergo some tonic internalization in the absence of agonist.Figure 3Immunofluorescence analysis of TXA2Rα and TXA2Rβ distribution in HEK293 (A) and A431 (B) cells. Flag epitope-tagged receptors were transiently transfected in HEK293 and A431 cells.

Immunofluorescence detection was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Top panel, receptor distribution in cells expressing TXA2Rα (left) and TXA2Rβ (right) when incubated at 4 °C.

O'Mahony D.J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29914-29919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus would be expected to possess the necessary “cellular machinery” for TXA2R regulation. However, we also wanted to test whether these observations could be extended to other cell types. Thus, similar immunofluorescence microscopy studies were performed in P388D1 and A431 cells, which contain endogenous TXA2Rs, and MiaPACA and CHO cells, which lack endogenous TXA2Rs (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 3 B, the TXA2Rβ but not TXA2Rα undergoes agonist-induced internalization in A431 cells transiently transfected with the epitope-tagged receptors. Comparable results were obtained in P388D1, MiaPACA, and CHO cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the differential internalization of TXA2Rα and -β is a property of the receptors and that HEK293 cells are a good model for studying TXA2R trafficking. We next addressed whether the inability of the TXA2Rα to internalize was due to low levels of proteins involved in receptor trafficking or a low affinity of the TXA2Rα for such proteins. In recent studies, GRKs and arrestins have been shown to promote GPCR internalization (24Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Indeed, it has been suggested that the extent of β2-adrenergic receptor internalization correlates with the intracellular levels of GRKs and arrestins (30Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T.

A previous study identified mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of c-kit in five of six GISTs (Science 279: 577, 1998). To better define the frequency and spectrum of c-kit gene mutations in mesenchymal neoplasms of the GI tract that had been characterized for KIT protein expression, we examined archived tissue samples for mutations in the JM domain by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. c-kit JM domain mutations were found in nine of 56 mesenchymal tumors (46 GISTs, eight leiomyomas, two leiomyosarcomas) and occurred exclusively in GISTs (21%). Seven of the nine mutations consisted of intragenic deletions of one to 19 codons. There was one insertion mutation that added 12 codons and one missense mutation (Val560Asp). None of the mutations disrupted the downstream reading frame of the gene. The single missense mutation (Val560Asp) is very similar to the only other missense mutation reported in GISTs (Val599Asp). Of the 46 GISTs, 43 were strongly positive for KIT protein expression and negative for diffuse expression of desmin. Neither KIT expression nor gene mutations were found in gastrointestinal leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas. We conclude that mutation of the c-kit JM domain does not occur in gastrointestinal mesenchymal neoplasms with well developed-smooth muscle differentiation, and is restricted to GISTs. However, since these mutations are only found in a minority of GISTs, further investigation into the mechanisms of c-kit gene activation in this group of neoplasms is warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2054571512,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) elicit differential postendocytic processing of ligand and receptor molecules, which impacts long-term cell signaling outcomes. These differences arise from the higher affinity of the EGF-EGFR interaction versus that of TGFα-EGFR in the acidic conditions of sorting endosomes. To determine whether EGFR occupancy in endosomes might also affect short-term signaling events, we examined activation of the phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) pathway, an event shown to be essential for growth factor-induced cell motility. We found that EGF continues to stimulate maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR following internalization, while, as expected, TGFα stimulates markedly less. The resulting higher level of receptor activation by EGF, however, did not yield higher levels of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis over those stimulated by TGFα. By altering the ratio of activated receptors between the cell surface and the internalized compartment, we found that only cell surface receptors effectively participate in PLC function. In contrast to PIP2 hydrolysis, PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlated linearly with the total level of Tyr(P)-EGFR stimulated by either ligand, indicating that the functional deficiency of internal EGFR cannot be attributed to an inability to interact with and phosphorylate signaling proteins. We conclude that EGFR signaling through the PLC pathway is spatially restricted at a point between PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and PIP2 hydrolysis, perhaps because of limited access of EGFR-bound PLC-γ1 to its substrate in endocytic trafficking organelles.

At least five ligands are known to activate EGFR, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGFα). Progress has been made in the last two decades in elucidating structure-function relationships for EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly in how signal transduction is modulated by self-phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (1Lund K.A. Wiley H.S. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 277-303Google Scholar). This permits access to the kinase domain of EGFR (2Bertics P.J. Weber W. Cochet C. Gill G.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and allows the receptor to bind signaling proteins containing modular Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding domains (3van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Such interactions can affect the activity of the bound protein through transmission of conformational changes, enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation, and/or localization in proximity to membrane-associated target molecules. One of the prominent signaling proteins activated by EGFR is the γ1 isoform of phospholipase C (PLC) (5Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, which has two SH2 domains, catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), generating the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate and liberating PIP2-bound proteins (6Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 activity is positively modulated in vivo by association with EGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation by the receptor kinase, providing a link to ligand stimulation (7Meisenhelder J. Suh P. Rhee S.G. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 8Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D.

Another consequence of EGFR activation is clustering of ligand-receptor complexes in clathrin-coated pits, which increases the rate of receptor internalization (11Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following endocytosis, receptor-ligand complexes and other components of the plasma membrane are delivered to early endosomes, where molecules are sorted for recycling back to the cell surface or degradation in lysosomes (12Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 13Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Since the degradative route can yield down-regulation of total receptor mass and depletion of ligand from the extracellular milieu, endocytic trafficking has been recognized as an attenuation mechanism affecting long-term EGFR function (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). An unresolved question, however, is the contribution to signaling of the steady-state EGFR pool residing in pre-degradative internal compartments. It has been demonstrated that EGF remains predominantly associated with EGFR in sorting endosomes, and that internalized EGF-EGFR retain equal or greater tyrosine phosphorylation stoichiometry as well as competency in binding and phosphorylating signaling proteins (16Kay D.G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This suggests that meaningful signal transduction might be extended after endocytosis of EGF (22Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pH sensititivity of the TGFα-EGFR interaction and differential trafficking of TGFα compared with EGF suggest that TGFα dissociates from EGFR under the acidic conditions of endosomes (24Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At the pH found at the surface, EGF and TGFα exhibit indistinguishable affinities for EGFR in an equilibrium competition assay (24Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This disparity in ligand/receptor sorting could be responsible for differences in the cell responses to EGF and TGFα. To evaluate such a possibility, it is first necessary to know whether internalized and surface complexes differ either qualitatively or quantitatively in signaling. We investigate here the effect of endocytosis and compartmentalization of EGFR on the magnitude of signaling through the PLC pathway. Because NR6 fibroblasts transfected with wild-type EGFR have been used extensively in previous studies of both PLC-γ1 activation (10Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J.

We employed a ligand-based approach to analyze the PLC pathway at three distinct points of regulation: tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, and hydrolysis of PIP2. We found that internalized EGFR are deficient in stimulating PLC function, and that the point of regulation lies downstream of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation. NR6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with wild-type human EGFR (NR6 WT) (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The growth medium consisted of minimum essential medium (MEM) α, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin, streptomycin, and G418 (350 μg/ml). Cells were growth arrested at subconfluence using restricted serum conditions without G418 (MEM-α, 26 mmsodium bicarbonate with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin) for 18–24 h prior to experiments. Experiments were carried out in an air environment using MEM-α, 13 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) with 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, the antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as the binding buffer. Mouse EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) or human TGFα (Peprotech) were iodinated with 125I (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific activities of labeled ligands were typically 150,000–200,000 cpm/ng (≈600 Ci/mmol). Quiescent cells in Corning 35-mm tissue culture dishes were equilibrated in binding buffer for 15 min, on a warm plate that maintains cells at 37 °C, before challenge with125I-labeled ligand. Surface-bound and internalized ligand were discriminated essentially as described (11Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G.

Briefly, free ligand was removed by washing 6 times with ice-cold WHIPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 7.4). Surface-bound ligand was then collected in ice-cold acid strip with urea (50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2 m urea, pH 3.0) for 5–8 min, and internalized ligand was released in 1 m NaOH overnight at room temperature. Nonspecific binding (<2%) was assessed in the presence of 2 μm unlabeled human EGF (Peprotech) and subtracted from the total. Samples were quantified using a γ-counter. At intermediate times during an experiment, surface-bound ligand was removed without compromising cell viability, using brief (1–2 min) treatments of ice-cold acid strip without urea (50 mmglycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0) as indicated. By 1 min, this treatment is equally efficient in removing either EGF and TGFα (reproducibly 90–93%) from the surface of NR6 cells. High-binding ELISA plates (Corning) were coated at room temperature overnight with 10 μg/ml anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody 225 in PBS, then incubated at room temperature for 4–18 h in blocking buffer (10% horse serum, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS). After various treatments in binding buffer as indicated, cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 4 mm sodium iodoacetate, scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm sodium iodoacetate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. After 20 min of incubation on ice, cellular debris was pelleted for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant of each sample was transferred to a new tube and kept on ice for analysis. Total protein in each sample was assessed using a Micro BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each lysate was diluted to various extents in blocking buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and incubated in anti-EGFR-coated wells for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then rinsed four times with wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated RC20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After four additional washes, the wells were reacted with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 10 mmdiethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5. The reaction rate was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm in a 15-min kinetic assay, using a Molecular Devices microplate reader. The relative amount of EGFR-phosphotyrosine was determined from a binding plot of reaction rate versus micrograms of total lysate protein for each sample. Nonspecific control lanes in which the maximum lysate load was incubated in wells without 225 antibody yielded similar activities to 225 wells incubated without lysate. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and total cell protein was determined as detailed above. Immunoprecipitations of equivalent total protein amounts were performed at 4 °C for 90 min using 3–5 μg of primary antibody precoupled to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads per sample. The beads were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the residual liquid was removed with a syringe. The beads in each tube were boiled for 5 min in 30 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue), then clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (35Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted for proteins as indicated and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal Ultra detection reagent (Pierce). Bands were detected and quantified using a Bio-Rad chemiluminescence screen and Molecular Imager. When reprobing of a blot was desired, bound antibodies were first removed for 1 h at 55 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Internalized EGFR were isolated by labeling surface-accessible proteins for subsequent removal from cell lysates (36Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, after specific treatments, and surface proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C with 5 mg of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) per 10-cm plate. Plates were washed once with PBS, once with PBS, 50 mmglycine, and once again with PBS. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 as described above, and EGFR were immunoprecipitated using 225 antibody precoupled to protein G-Sepharose. Proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with 0.5% SDS. After adding 1 volume of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, biotinylated (surface) EGFR were removed using immobilized streptavidin (Pierce). Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. In vivo PLC activity was determined essentially as described (10Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) during the growth arrest protocol. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by two washes with PBS at 37 °C just before the experiment. Following various treatments in binding buffer as indicated, cells were washed once with ice-cold WHIPS buffer, scraped into boiling dH2O, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and kept on ice. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and cellular debris was pelleted for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The concentration of cytosolic radioactivity in disintegrations/min/ml for each supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting of small aliquots, and equivalent volumes of samples were loaded onto mini-columns packed with 0.5 ml of anion exchange resin (AG 1-X8, formate, 100–200 mesh; Bio-Rad) each. After washing each column with 20 ml of dH2O and 20 ml of 5 mm sodium borate, 60 mm sodium formate, inositol phosphate fractions were eluted with 200 mm ammonium formate, 100 mmformic acid. The disintegrations/min of inositol phosphate that accumulated during cell treatment was normalized to the total disintegrations/min applied to the anion exchange column for each sample. Given the central role of EGFR autophosphorylation in initiating phospholipase C activity, we determined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation stoichiometry of EGFR (Tyr(P)/receptor) is altered upon internalization of EGF or TGFα·EGFR complexes in NR6 WT cells. Based on the differential binding affinities of these ligands at endosomal pH, we expected that EGF would elicit a higher level of internal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation than TGFα. Saturating doses (20 nm) of radioiodinated EGF or TGFα were used to follow the levels of surface-bound and internalized ligand with time in NR6 WT cells (Fig.1 A). A decrease in surface complexes to a level of about 60% of the total was observed within 30 min, with a parallel increase in internalized ligand, in agreement with previously published results (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The profiles of cell-associated EGF and TGFα in both compartments were indistinguishable in these experiments. This indicated that the initial trafficking of EGFR in these cells is similar following either EGF or TGFα treatment. To distinguish between surface-associated and intracellular activated EGFR, we used a brief incubation with a mild acid wash. This treatment rapidly removes surface-bound ligand (both EGF and TGFα are dissociated equivalently). In addition, several studies have shown that it does not compromise cell viability (37Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Suh P. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation were examined using two parallel stimulation protocols: a standard time course of stimulation with EGF or TGFα (20 nm) at 37 °C, and a strip protocol (Fig. 1 B). For the strip protocol, cells were stimulated with EGF or TGFα (20 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C to allow internalization, treated with acid strip on ice for 1 min, and brought back to 37 °C in the absence of ligand for 9 min. For EGF-treated cells, ligand was then added back at 37 °C to determine whether receptor binding and signaling capacities were intact following the acid wash. As shown in Fig. 1 B, EGF-treated NR6 WT cells displayed approximately 3 to 4 times higher EGFR-phosphotyrosine relative to TGFα-treated cells following the surface strip, suggesting that the former ligand is more effective in maintaining activation of EGFR in internal compartments. Following readdition of EGF, Tyr(P)-EGFR returned to pre-strip levels, showing that the treatment does not compromise signaling in these cells. To determine the stoichiometry of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, the levels of surface-bound and internalized 125I-ligand were determined for the same time points and stimulation conditions shown in Fig. 1 B. The ratio of Tyr(P)-EGFR/total cell-associated ligand was then plotted versus the ratio of internalized ligand/total cell-associated ligand. If EGFR maintains a constant tyrosine phosphorylation stoichiometry, both with respect to time and cellular location, such a plot will have zero slope. This was indeed the case for EGF-treated NR6 WT cells (Fig.2 A). EGFR maintained a nearly constant Tyr(P)-EGFR/cell-associated ligand before the strip, after the strip, and following readdition of EGF. This type of plot can also be used to determine whether EGFR is dephosphorylated following endocytosis, since the ratio of Tyr(P)/ligand would change from the surface to the internal value as the fraction of internalized ligand increased. TGFα-treated cells displayed a decrease in Tyr(P)/ligand as the internal ligand fraction increased, and the extrapolated “surface” Tyr(P)/ligand value was very close to the mean phosphorylation stoichiometry observed for EGF (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that in the case of cells treated with TGFα, a significant fraction of internalized EGFR are dephosphorylated. To examine the possibility that the receptor phosphorylation stoichiometries elicited by EGF and TGFα simply reflect differential activation of surface complexes, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and cleared from EGFR immunoprecipitates. The remaining EGFR, presumably in intracellular compartments prior to cell lysis, were then subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2 C, EGF elicited significantly higher Tyr(P)-EGFR than TGFα in this assay, and phosphotyrosine levels were not altered by acid washing. This demonstrates that EGF induces a greater extent of internalized EGFR activation than TGFα, although tyrosine phosphorylation of internal EGFR in TGFα-treated cells is detectably higher than the unstimulated control. Taken together, our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of internalized EGFR is strongly correlated with ligand occupancy in endosomes. The dose responses (0–20 nm) of EGF- and TGFα-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation were investigated as well, after 7.5 and 20 min of ligand challenge (Fig. 3). EGFR exhibited half-maximal tyrosine phosphorylation at 1–2 nmof either ligand, with TGFα values consistently and statistically lower than EGF values for the same dose (Fig. 3). This is also consistent with activation of surface EGFR to similar extents by the two ligands and a greater degree of internalized EGFR activation by EGF. Having established that EGF yields higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of internalized EGFR than TGFα, we next investigated whether these naturally occurring ligands could stimulate the PLC pathway to different extents. To this end, we employed a functional assay that assesses the hydrolysis of PIP2 in intact cells. In vitro reactions using immunoisolated PLC-γ1 can be misleading, since the concentrations of PIP2 and other membrane-associated signaling molecules in various compartments might be different. Following the liberation of soluble inositol triphosphate from PIP2, inositol phosphatases rapidly metabolize this intermediate to free inositol. Cell exposure to Li+ inhibits the breakdown of inositol phosphate (IP), potentiating its accumulation in the cytosol. Previous studies using NR6 WT and other NR6 transfectants in conjunction with the specific PLC inhibitor U73122 demonstrated that this assay is indeed a direct readout of PIP2 hydrolysis (10Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PLC dose-response experiments were performed by incubating NR6 cells with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min, followed by stimulation in the continued presence of LiCl. Control experiments indicated that IP accumulation is roughly linear with time for at least 30 min of 20 nm EGF stimulation, that lithium is required for observable IP accumulation, that the basal level of IP in the absence of stimulation does not increase detectably with time, and that lithium treatment does not affect EGFR internalization (data not shown). The dose responses of EGF- and TGFα-stimulated PIP2hydrolysis were examined for stimulation times of 15 and 30 min (Fig.4). These time scales allow for sufficient internalization of ligand to occur (Fig. 1 A), and for stimulated IP accumulation to achieve adequate signal/noise ratios. As shown in Fig. 4, EGF did not gain any noticeable advantage over TGFα with respect to stimulation of the PLC pathway over the course of 30 min, despite higher levels of total cellular EGF-mediated EGFR activation at all doses (Fig. 3). This might be expected if the activation of PLC were saturable, i.e. if PLC-γ1 or PIP2 were stoichiometrically limiting at submaximal Tyr(P)-EGFR (40Haugh J.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 195: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, both ligand-induced PIP2hydrolysis and EGFR phosphotyrosine were half-maximal at similar EGF and TGFα concentrations (1–2 nm). Therefore, these results indirectly suggest that activated EGFR in internal compartments are deficient in stimulating PLC function. Although it seemed possible that active EGFR do not have access to PLC-γ1 and/or PIP2 in intracellular trafficking compartments, our dose-response results did not address this point directly. The internal pool of EGFR does not constitute a large fraction of the total cellular EGFR in the NR6 cell line, obscuring its potential contribution to PLC activation. Thus, mild acid washing"

https://openalex.org/W2040196391,"The role of cbl-b in signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was studied and compared with c-cbl. We demonstrate in vivo, that cbl-b, like c-cbl, is phosphorylated and recruited to the EGFR upon EGF stimulation and both cbl proteins can bind to the Grb2 adaptor protein. To investigate the functional role of cbl proteins in EGFR signaling, we transfected cbl-b or c-cbl into 32D cells overexpressing the EGFR (32D/EGFR). This cell line is absolutely dependent on exogenous IL-3 or EGF for sustained growth. 32D/EGFR cells overexpressing cbl-b showed markedly inhibited growth in EGF compared to c-cbl transfectants and vector controls. This growth inhibition by cbl-b was the result of a dramatic increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, cbl-b overexpression markedly decreased the amplitude and duration of AKT activation upon EGF stimulation compared to either vector controls or c-cbl overexpressing cells. In addition, the duration of EGF mediated MAP kinase and Jun kinase activation in cells overexpressing cbl-b is shortened. These data demonstrate that cbl-b inhibits EGF-induced cell growth and that cbl-b and c-cbl have distinct roles in EGF mediated signaling."

We studied here in vitro the formation of fibrils of pepsin-treated recombinant human type II collagen produced in insect cells. Two kinds of type II collagen preparation were used: low hydroxylysine collagen having 2.0 hydroxylysine residues/1,000 amino acids, including 1.3 glycosylated hydroxylysines; and high hydroxylysine collagen having 19 hydroxylysines/1,000 amino acids, including 8.9 glycosylated hydroxylysines. A marked difference in fibril formation was found between these two kinds of collagen preparation, in that the maximal turbidity of the former was reached within 5 min under the standard assay conditions, whereas the absorbance of the latter increased until about 600 min. The critical concentration with the latter was about 10-fold, and the absorbance/microgram collagen incorporated into the fibrils was about one-sixth. The morphology of the fibrils was also different, in that the high hydroxylysine collagen formed thin fibrils with essentially no interfibril interaction or aggregation, whereas the low hydroxylysine collagen formed thick fibrils on a background of thin ones. The data thus indicate that regulation of the extents of lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation may play a major role in the regulation of collagen fibril formation and the morphology of the fibrils.

The collagens are a family of extracellular matrix proteins that play a dominant role in maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues. A well coordinated deposition of the components of the extracellular matrix is essential to achieve and maintain their physiological function (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I.

Type II collagen is the main structural component of hyaline cartilages and forms their fibrous scaffold, which interacts with various types of proteoglycan. It forms networks of thin fibrils that differ in morphology from the much thicker fibrils of type I collagen, the main fibril-forming collagen in most other tissues (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I.

Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 352-361Google Scholar) influence collagen fibril formation and the architecture of the resulting fibrils formed. Thus the differences in fibril architecture between tissues are not necessarily dependent on differences between the various collagen types themselves. However, fibril formation experiments with purified collagens in vitro have demonstrated that the differences in structure between type II and type I collagen molecules appear to be sufficient to explain many of the characteristic differences between these two types of fibril present in tissues (10Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hojima Y. Ganguly A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics for the assembly of type II collagen fibrils in such experiments differed markedly from those for the assembly of type I collagen, and the critical concentration for type II collagen at 37 °C was about 50 times greater (10Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hojima Y. Ganguly A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the type II collagen fibrils formed in vitro were much thinner than those of type I collagen and formed three-dimensional networks (10Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hojima Y. Ganguly A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extents of hydroxylation of lysine residues and glycosylation of hydroxylysine residues in type II collagen are much higher than those in the other two major fibril-forming collagens, types I and III (11Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1979; 8: 23-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the differences in fibril morphology between types II and I might be related to these differences. The functions of the hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrate units are nevertheless poorly understood at present. As these are the most extrusive groups on the surface of the collagen molecule, it has been suggested that they may influence fibril assembly (12Kivirikko K.I. Bittar E.E. Bittar N. Principles of Medical Biology. Jai Press Ltd., London, UK1995: 233-254Google Scholar). Fibril formation experiments with type I collagen in vitro have demonstrated that this collagen with an experimentally produced increased degree of lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation formed thinner fibrils than the same protein with a normal degree of these modifications, but only a minor extent of overglycosylation could be achieved in these experiments (13Torre-Blanco A. Adachi E. Hojima Y. Wootton J. Minor R. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2650-2655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, type II collagen from the annulus fibrosus, which has a slightly higher extent of lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation than that from articular cartilage, formed fibrils with a smaller diameter (14Yang C.L. Rui H. Mosler S. Notbohm H. Sawaryn A. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The possibility has not been excluded, however, that the presence of minor amounts of proteoglycan in the collagen preparations may have contributed to these differences. To allow study in detail of the effects of the extents of lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation on fibril formation, molecular collagen species are required that are genetically identical but differ markedly with respect to these modifications. It has recently been reported that recombinant human collagens with stable triple helices can be produced in insect cells by coinfection with baculoviruses coding for the polypeptide chains of the collagen to be produced and the two types of subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the key enzyme of collagen synthesis (15Lamberg A.

We used such recombinant type II collagen preparations here to study their in vitro fibrillogenesis. High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) in shaker flasks at 27 °C. For the production of recombinant type II collagen with a low hydroxylysine content, the cells were infected with viruses coding for rhproCIINIII and 4PHαβ as described previously (18Nokelainen M.

The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 mNaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.2m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min (18Nokelainen M.

The supernatant was chromatographed on a DEAE cellulose column (DE-52, Whatman), equilibrated and eluted with a 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, the void volume being collected. The pH of the sample was lowered to 2.0–2.5, and the sample was digested with a final concentration of 150 μg/ml of pepsin for 1 h at 22 °C. The pepsin was irreversibly inactivated by neutralization of the sample followed by overnight incubation on ice. The recombinant collagen was precipitated by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 4 m and centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was dissolved in a 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5m urea, and 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 day. The sample was chromatographed on a Sephacryl HR-500 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with a solution of 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid, and lyophilized. To prepare stock solutions, the collagen preparations were dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The upper half of the supernatant was withdrawn and adjusted to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, checked with a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter. The collagen self-assembly conditions followed a modification of the method described by Williams et al. (19Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): briefly, 100 μg/ml of type II collagen, 30 mm K2HPO4, and 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The samples were then transferred to a thermocontrolled quartz cuvette. Fibril formation was triggered by increasing the incubation temperature to 34 °C. Optical density at 313 nm was monitored in steps of 2 min with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda2 photometer (connected to a personal computer). Each recording was limited to 900 min. The sample was centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 30 min after the experiment, and the concentration of the supernatant was measured by CD spectroscopy to determine the amount of aggregated collagen. The experiments to study the effects of collagen concentration were performed as above except that the collagen concentration was varied, and the time was 600 min. Aliquots of the assembly mixtures for electron microscopy were incubated in parallel with the turbidity time assay. After 1,000 min, samples of 4 × 3 μl were transferred to formvar-coated copper grids using a micropipette, and the fibrils were allowed to settle for 30 min. The buffer was then drained cautiously with a filter paper, and three washing steps were performed. The fibrils were stained with freshly prepared 1% uranyl acetate, dissolved in distilled water for 2 min, washed 3 times more, and dried. The grids were examined using a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope. Fibril width was measured with an image analysis system (Optoquant, Lübeck, Germany) using an internal distance of 10 periods in the collagen banding pattern. Recombinant type II collagen preparations were dialyzed against a solution of 50% glycerol in 0.05% acetic acid for 16 h at 4 °C. The samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica using an air brush. The droplets on the mica were dried at room temperature at 10−6 mm Hg for 12 h in a vacuum coater (Edwards 306). The dried specimens were rotatory-shadowed with platinum using an electron gun positioned at 6° to the mica surface and then coated with a film of carbon generated by an electron gun positioned at 90° to the mica surface. The replica was floated on distilled water and collected on a grid covered with a formvar film. The specimens were studied with a Zeiss 109 transmission electron microscope. Protein samples hydrolyzed in 6 mHCl for 24 h at 110 °C under N2 were used for amino acid analyses performed in an Applied Biosystems 421 or Beckman system 6300 analyzer. The glycosylated hydroxylysine content was determined by hydrolyzing collagen samples in 2 m KOH for 24 h at 110 °C in 2-ml polypropylene reaction vials. Hydroxylysine and its glycosides were separated by cation exchange chromatography on Dovex 50W-X8 as described previously (18Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T.

Biochem. 1984; 33: 117-127Google Scholar). A glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine standard (20Tenni R. Rimodi D. Zanaboni G. Castellani A.A. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 33: 117-127Google Scholar) was used to quantify the glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylhydroxylysine. For the analysis of pepsinized collagen chains, the samples were studied by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie staining. The recombinant human type II procollagen preparations produced in insect cells were converted to collagens by digestion with pepsin at 22 °C for 1 h, and the pepsin-treated collagens were purified. Two kinds of recombinant human type II collagen preparation were used: low hydroxylysine collagen, produced without recombinant lysyl hydroxylase, and high hydroxylysine collagen, produced with recombinant lysyl hydroxylase. Both types were pure when studied by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie staining (Fig.1) and also by amino acid analysis (details not shown). The recombinant low hydroxylysine type II collagen preparation had low levels of total hydroxylysine and its glycosides (TableI), whereas the recombinant high hydroxylysine preparation had levels that were even higher than those in nonrecombinant human type II collagen from articular cartilage (Table I). As discussed elsewhere (18Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the marked increase in the quantity of glycosylated hydroxylysine residues obtained by coexpression with lysyl hydroxylase must be due to the presence of a high level of endogenous collagen glycosyltransferase activities in the High Five insect cells.Table IHydroxylysine and its glycosides in the recombinant type II collagen preparationsAmino acidRecombinant Low Hydroxylysine Type II CollagenRecombinant High Hydroxylysine Type II CollagenNonrecombinant Type II Collagen from Articular CartilageaRef. 14.residues/1,000Total hydroxylysine2.019.015.3Nonglycosylated hydroxylysine0.710.19.2Galactosylhydroxylysine0.56.34.2Glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine0.82.61.9The recombinant type II collagens were prepared and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.”a Ref. 14Yang C.L.

Open table in a new tab The recombinant type II collagens were prepared and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Formation of fibrils of the two kinds of human recombinant type II collagen was studied using an assay based on the increase in absorbance at 313 nm in a 100 μg/ml collagen solution at 34 °C as a function of time. A marked difference was found between the low and high hydroxylysine collagens, in that the maximum absorbance of the former was reached within 5 min, whereas the absorbance of the latter increased for about 600 min (Fig.2). The amount of low hydroxylysine collagen incorporated into the fibrils was slightly smaller than that of high hydroxylysine collagen but was more than 90% in both cases (details not shown). Thus the maximum absorbance/microgram collagen incorporated into the fibrils of the low hydroxylysine collagen was about 6 times that observed with the high hydroxylysine collagen (Fig.2). The critical concentrations for fibril formation also differed markedly between the two types of recombinant human type II collagen, the apparent critical concentration for the low hydroxylysine collagen being less than 10 μg/ml, whereas that for the high hydroxylysine collagen was about 70 μg/ml (Fig.3). Electron micrographs of the two kinds of recombinant type II collagen when visualized by rotatory shadowing showed predominantly monomers of uniform length (details not shown). No differences were detected between the low and high hydroxylysine collagens with this technique. Electron microscopy of the fibrils formed by the high hydroxylysine collagen showed that they were typically very thin with essentially no interfibril interaction or fibril aggregation (Fig.4 A). A few short, slightly thicker fibrils could also be seen with sharp tips on both ends (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the low hydroxylysine collagen formed thick fibrils on a background of thin ones (Fig. 4 B). To study the distribution of the fibril diameters in more detail, a histogram of 200 measured fibril diameters was plotted against their relative frequency (Fig. 5). Fibril aggregates were excluded from these measurements, and thus the histogram shows only diameters of single fibrils. The high hydroxylysine collagen showed the highest frequency of fibrils with a diameter of about 10 nm, whereas the low hydroxylysine collagen had the highest frequency of fibrils with a diameter of about 20 nm, and some fibrils had diameters exceeding 60 nm (Fig. 5). All experiments reported here were carried out with type II collagen samples prepared from the corresponding procollagens by removing the N and C propeptides by digestion with pepsin at 22 °C for 1 h. Although the collagen triple helix is resistant to proteolytic enzymes, such treatment is likely to degrade part of the N and C telopeptides, the short nontriple-helical sequences at the ends of the collagen molecules (1Kielty C.M.

J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Many previous studies have shown that pepsin-treated collagens tend to form fibrils with a smaller diameter and a lesser degree of a highly resolved cross-striation pattern than collagens produced from procollagens by the cleavage with procollagen N and C proteinases (see Ref. 8Prockop D.J. Hulmes D.J.S. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.B. Extracellular Matrix Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1994: 47-90Google Scholar). Thus the fibrils studied here are not identical to those formed in vivo, but the pepsin treatment cannot explain any of the differences in fibril assembly and morphology between the recombinant low and high hydroxylysine type II collagens. The glucosylgalactose moiety is highly hydrophilic and has a length of about 1 nm (14Yang C.L. Rui H. Mosler S. Notbohm H. Sawaryn A. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This moiety is oriented parallel to the backbone of the collagen molecule and shields three or four amino acid residues (14Yang C.L. Rui H. Mosler S. Notbohm H. Sawaryn A. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The glucosylgalactose moiety can thus be expected to inhibit lateral growth of collagen fibrils because it reduces the surface available for hydrophobic interactions. This hypothesis is supported by our morphological findings and also by the data on fibril formation, because the final turbidity of the high hydroxylysine collagen was only about one-sixth of that of the low hydroxylysine variety. Turbidity is related to molecular mass per unit length in the case of very long molecules. The difference in turbidity between the low and high hydroxylysine collagens accounts for a three-fold difference in fibril diameter. This is not fully in accordance with the morphometric analysis of single fibrils, however, because only a portion of the fibrils deviated in diameter. It is likely that interfibrillar interactions or banding of unit fibrils contributed to the increased light scattering, even though the electron micrographs seem to suggest that the thick fibrils appear to be formed from thin unit fibrils. The data indicate the presence of marked differences in fibril formation between recombinant human type II collagens containing low and high amounts of hydroxylysine and its glycosylated forms. The maximal absorbance of the low hydroxylysine collagen was reached within 5 min, whereas the absorbance of the high hydroxylysine collagen increased for about 600 min and was only about one-sixth of that obtained with the former. Furthermore, the critical concentration for fibril formation with the high hydroxylysine collagen was about 10 times that with the low hydroxylysine collagen. The morphology of the fibrils formed was also different, in that the high hydroxylysine collagen formed very thin fibrils with essentially no interfibril interaction or fibril aggregation, whereas the low hydroxylysine collagen formed thick fibrils on a background of thin ones."

As Vpr is not part of the p55 Gag polyprotein precursor (Pr55gag), its incorporation requires an anchor to associate with the assembling viral particles. Although the molecular mechanism is presently unclear, the C-terminal region of the Pr55gagcorresponding to the p6 domain appears to constitute such an anchor essential for the incorporation of the Vpr protein. In order to clarify the mechanism by which the Vpr accessory protein istrans-incorporated into progeny virion particles, we tested whether HIV-1 Vpr interacted with the Pr55gag using the yeast two-hybrid system and the maltose-binding protein pull-down assay. The present study provides genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that the Pr55gag can physically interact with the Vpr protein. Furthermore, point mutations affecting the integrity of the conserved L-X-S-L-F-G motif of p6gag completely abolish the interaction between Vpr and the Pr55gag and, as a consequence, prevent Vpr virion incorporation. In contrast to other studies, mutations affecting the integrity of the NCp7 zinc fingers impaired neither Vpr virion incorporation nor the binding between Vpr and the Pr55gag. Conversely, amino acid substitutions in Vpr demonstrate that an intact N-terminal α-helical structure is essential for the Vpr-Pr55gag interaction. Vpr and the Pr55gag demonstrate a strong interaction in vitroas salt concentrations as high as 900 mm could not disrupt the interaction. Finally, the interaction is efficiently competed using anti-Vpr sera. Together, these results strongly suggest that Vprtrans-incorporation into HIV-1 particles requires a direct interaction between its N-terminal region and the C-terminal region of p6gag. The development of Pr55gag-Vpr interaction assays may allow the screening of molecules that can prevent the incorporation of the Vpr accessory protein into HIV-1 virions, and thus inhibit its early functions.

The tatand rev regulatory genes have been shown to be absolutely essential for viral replication in vitro (1Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an increasing number of studies demonstrate that mutations affecting the other auxiliary genes, called the accessory proteins, cause significant phenotypic defects in HIV-1 replication, suggesting that these accessory genes may play pivotal roles during in vivoinfection and pathogenesis (2Miller R.H. Sarver N. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The Vpr accessory gene product encodes a 14-kDa, 96-amino acid nuclear protein that is expressed late during viral replication in a Rev-dependent manner (3Garrett E.D. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is highly conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In addition, HIV-2 and SIVs encode for a protein, Vpx, that has been shown to possess many structural as well as functional similarities with the Vpr protein (4Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Functionally, the HIV-1 Vpr protein harbors two main biological activities. First, early during infection of nondividing cells, Vpr is implicated in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex (5Heinzinger N.K. Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.-A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 6Nie Z. Bergeron D. Subbramanian R. Yao X.-J. Checroune F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4104-4115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Vpr influences the transport of the preintegration complex remains unclear. Although no classical nuclear localization signal have been clearly demonstrated in Vpr, it is likely that Vpr acts through interactions with cellular proteins involved in the nuclear import of macromolecules. In fact, it was recently demonstrated that Vpr could associate with importin-α and the nucleoporin Nsp1, and thus possibly play the role of an importin-β-like protein (7Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 8Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G.

Virol. 1998; 72: 6004-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its involvement in the nuclear targeting of the preintegration complex, Vpr was shown to be required for efficient replication in nondividing cells such as monocytes and macrophages (6Nie Z. Bergeron D. Subbramanian R. Yao X.-J. Checroune F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4104-4115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R.

Med. 1998; 187: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ability of Vpr to arrest the cell cycle constitutes the second biological activity associated with this protein (12Jowett J.B.M. Planelles V. Poon B. Shah N.P. Chen M.-L. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 882-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytostatic effect of Vpr was shown to result in a specific block in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which was correlated with the inactivation of the Cdc2 kinase (14Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The functional role of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest in proliferating and nondividing HIV target cells is still unclear. However, Stewartet al. (16Stewart S.A. Poon B. Jowett J.B.M. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Vpr could also induce apoptosis following cell cycle arrest, suggesting a contribution to CD4 cell depletion during HIV-1 disease. As well, the cell cycle arrest action of Vpr was shown to increase viral expression in dividing T cells as well as in macrophages (11Subbramanian R.A. Kessous-Elbaz A. Lodge R. Forget J. Yao X.-J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An important feature of the HIV-1 Vpr and the HIV-2/SIV Vpx proteins is that they are selectively incorporated into the virus particles, which indeed suggests an early function for these two proteins during the viral life cycle (19Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yu X.-F. Ito S. Essex M. Lee T.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The localization of Vpr and Vpx within virions is still unclear. Immunoelectron microscopic studies suggested that the HIV-1 Vpr protein localized beneath the viral envelope, co-localizing with the Gag p24 core structures (21Wang J.J. Lu Y.-L. Ratner L. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2607-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, a more recent analysis by Kewalramani and Emerman (22Kewalramani V.N. Emerman M. Virology. 1996; 218: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) placed the Vpx protein within HIV-2 cores. As Vpr and Vpx are not synthesized as part of the Gag or Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, they must utilize a distinct mechanism in order to be incorporated into virion particles. Lavallée et al. (23Lavallée C. Yao X.-J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Vpr could be specifically incorporated in trans within virus-like particles originating only from the expression of the Pr55gag. The C-terminal p6 domain of the Pr55gag was subsequently demonstrated to be essential for the incorporation of Vpr into virus particles (24Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7229-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kondo E. Mammano F. Cohen E.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the integrity of a very conserved motif in the C-terminal region of the p6 domain, L-X-S-L-F-G, was shown to be critical for Vpr virion incorporation (26Kondo E. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lu Y.-L. Bennett R.P. Wills J.W. Gorelick R. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6873-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies clearly established that the predicted amphipathic α-helical structure located within the N-terminal region of Vpr was important for its packaging into virions (28Mahalingam S. Khan S.A. Murali R. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Yao X.-J. Subbramanian R.A.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the data accumulated so far, the mechanism of Vpr incorporation into virion particles suggests a direct interaction between the p6 domain of the p55 Gag precursor and Vpr. Nonetheless, Vpr was also shown to associate with other domains from the Pr55gag. The zinc fingers of NCp7 have recently been suggested to be important for the virion incorporation of Vpr (31de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.-L. Rocque B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Li M.-S. Garcia-Asua G. Bhattacharyya U. Mascagni P. Austen B.M. Roberts M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence suggesting an association between Vpr and the MAp17 has also been obtained (33Sato A. Yoshimoto J. Isaka Y. Miki S. Suyama A. Asachi A. Hayami M. Fujuwara T. Yoshie O. Virology. 1996; 220: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In order to clarify the mechanism by which the HIV-1 Vpr protein istrans-incorporated into virion particles, we used protein-to-protein interaction assays to investigate Vpr-Gag interactions. The present work provides genetic (yeast two-hybrid) and biochemical evidence indicating that the incorporation of Vpr into HIV-1 particles involves a direct association between Vpr and the p55 Gag polyprotein precursor. We demonstrate that the p6 domain is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. The direct binding of Vpr to the p55 precursor may constitute a target for the development of molecules that could prevent Vpr virion incorporation, and thus, Vpr early functions.DISCUSSIONHIV-1 Vpr is the major virion-associated accessory protein. As Vpr is not synthesized as part of the Gag polyprotein precursor, it must utilize a distinct mechanism in order to be incorporated into virion particles. It has been clearly demonstrated through Gag deletion analysis that the virion incorporation of the Vpr protein requires the p6 domain from the p55 precursor (24Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7229-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kondo E. Mammano F. Cohen E.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lu Y.-L. Bennett R.P. Wills J.W. Gorelick R. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6873-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the association between Vpr virion incorporation and Vpr-Pr55gagbinding was still missing. Several groups (26Kondo E. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lu Y.-L. Bennett R.P. Wills J.W. Gorelick R. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6873-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that single amino acid substitutions or deletions of either Leu44 or Phe45 in the p6 domain abolished the ability of Vpr to be incorporated in the context of MLV/HIV p6 or Rous sarcoma virus/HIV p6 chimeric viruses. In addition, the inability of our HIV-1 Pr55gag (p6 L44P/F45S) double mutant to incorporate Vpr was confirmed in the context of an infectious proviral clone of HIV (Fig. 5 A). Consequently, the inability of Vpr to interact with the HIV-1 Pr55gag (p6 L44P/F45S) double mutant (Fig. 2 B) brings a direct correlation between the lack of direct binding to the Pr55gag and the incapacity of Vpr to be incorporated into virion particles.Evidence of direct interaction between Vpr and other Gag domains has been recently reported. de Rocquigny et al. (31de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.-L. Rocque B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that the zinc fingers of the nucleocapsid protein (NC) were important for Vpr virion association. Moreover, using chemically synthesized peptides, they demonstrated that Vpr could directly interact with NCp7, but not with p6 in vitro. However, our result demonstrated that only mutants in the p6 domain (LF-PS) resulted in the loss of binding between Vpr and the Pr55gag, while mutations or the complete deletion of the p7 zinc fingers did not affect the interaction (Fig. 2 B) and Vpr incorporation (Fig.5 B). It is possible that the zinc fingers of the NCp7 are important for Vpr binding in the context of the mature NC. However, our results indicate that in the context of the Pr55gag, the zinc finger motifs are less critical for the Vpr-Pr55gag interaction. Moreover, in contrast to de Rocquigny et al. (31de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.-L. Rocque B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), who demonstrated significant defects in Vpr virion incorporation using NC mutants, in particular with the HIV-1 p7 H23C mutant, our result did not reveal extensive impairment of Vpr virion-incorporating ability (Fig. 5, B and C). It is possible that this discrepancy results from experimental differences. Indeed, the basis for quantification of Vpr encapsidation are different, de Rocquigny's group used Western blot while we used radioimmunoprecipitation. Consequently, the importance of NCp7 in HIV-1 Vpr incorporation still needs to be demonstrated. In fact, Wu et al. (49Wu X. Conway J.A. Kim J. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) deleted the complete NCp8 sequence in HIV-2 and did not affect the ability of Vpx to be incorporated into virions, while removal of p6 sequences resulted in loss of Vpx incorporation.The structural domains within Vpr important for incorporation have also been studied. The extensive mutagenic analysis of several groups agrees that the amphipathic α-helical region located between amino acids 18 and 34 in the N terminus of Vpr is important for the incorporation of this accessory protein (28Mahalingam S. Khan S.A. Murali R. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Yao X.-J. Subbramanian R.A.

Khan S.A. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Virology. 1995; 207: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our binding studies using five Vpr mutants, E25K, A30F, Q65E, SR79–80ID, and R80A, showed that the two mutants that were unable to interact with the Pr55gag were the mutants that lost their ability to be incorporated (29Yao X.-J. Subbramanian R.A. Rougeau N. Boisvert F. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result also correlates the loss of incorporation of Vpr to its incapacity to directly interact with the Pr55gag. The observation that Vpr could only interact with the Pr55gag when fused to the C terminus of the LexA DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 A,lane 7) but not when fused to the B42 transactivator (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) suggests that this interaction requires proper conformation. It is likely that either the B42-Vpr or the LexA-Pr55gag fusion, or both, are not presented in the proper structure to expose their respective binding domain. Interestingly, we suspect that the p6-binding motif of Vpr requires more than just the predicted N-terminal α-helical domain since attempts to compete the in vitroVpr-Pr55gag association with a series of Vpr peptides were unsuccessful. Peptides harboring Vpr amino acids 1–19, 19–35, or 23–37 could not compete the interaction between Vpr and the Pr55gag. Moreover, Yao et al. 2X.-J. Yao, G. Kobinger, S. Dandache, N. Rougeau, and E. A. Cohen, submitted for publication. demonstrated that fusion proteins containing amino acids 1–62, which harbor the predicted N-terminal α-helical moiety of Vpr, are incapable of incorporating virion particles, while polypeptides fused to amino acids 1–80 of Vpr are efficiently incorporated. These results suggest that the presence of the leucine/isoleucine-rich domain of Vpr (amino acids 60–80) might be important for correct folding or exposition of the predicted N-terminal α-helical region. Similar results have also been observed by Sato et al. (52Sato A. Isaka Y. Kodama M. Yoshimoto J. Kawauchi S. Kuwata T. Adachi A. Hayami M. Yoshie O. Fujiwara T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that our anti-Vpr peptide serum directed against the N-terminal region of Vpr (amino acids 1–19) was more effective in affecting the interaction with the Pr55gag than the antibody directed against recombinant Vpr (Fig. 4 C), which principally recognizes epitopes lying between amino acids 19 and 72. 3C. Lavallée and E. A. Cohen, unpublished observations. This suggests that, even though the leucine/isoleucine-rich region of Vpr might be important, the critical region for the Vpr-Pr55gaginteraction is the predicted N-terminal α-helical structure of Vpr.From our and other groups' results, we present a model for the molecular mechanism by which the Vpr protein istrans-incorporated into progeny virions. We suggest that HIV-1 Vpr can only associate with p6 in the context of the Pr55gag. In this context, p6 would have a proper conformation to directly associate with Vpr, and subsequently pull it within forming virions. Then, upon activation of the viral protease, the Pr55gag would be processed and mature p6 would be release from the Pr55gag. This release of p6 would result in its dissociation from Vpr. Subsequently, Vpr could associate with other virion proteins such as NC in the viral core in order to fulfill its functional role in the context of the preintegration complex early in infection.In summary, the results presented here demonstrate direct interaction between Vpr and Gag in the context of the p55 precursor. Furthermore, our results suggest that Vpr trans-incorporation requires a direct binding to the p6 domain of the Pr55gag.The development of an assay that demonstrates this critical interaction may allow the screening of molecules that prevent Vpr virion association and thus, Vpr early function, which could ultimately impair HIV-1 infection.Addendum — During review of this work, a paper appeared (Selig, L., Pages, J.-C., Tanchou, V., Prévéral, S., Berlioz-Torrent, C., Liu, L. X., Erdtmann, L., Darlix, J.-L., Beuarous, R., and Benichou, S. (1999) J. Virol. 73,592–600) in which a direct interaction between Vpr and the Pr55gag of HIV-1 was reported.

The tatand rev regulatory genes have been shown to be absolutely essential for viral replication in vitro (1Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an increasing number of studies demonstrate that mutations affecting the other auxiliary genes, called the accessory proteins, cause significant phenotypic defects in HIV-1 replication, suggesting that these accessory genes may play pivotal roles during in vivoinfection and pathogenesis (2Miller R.H. Sarver N. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Vpr accessory gene product encodes a 14-kDa, 96-amino acid nuclear protein that is expressed late during viral replication in a Rev-dependent manner (3Garrett E.D. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is highly conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In addition, HIV-2 and SIVs encode for a protein, Vpx, that has been shown to possess many structural as well as functional similarities with the Vpr protein (4Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Functionally, the HIV-1 Vpr protein harbors two main biological activities. First, early during infection of nondividing cells, Vpr is implicated in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex (5Heinzinger N.K. Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.-A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 6Nie Z. Bergeron D. Subbramanian R. Yao X.-J. Checroune F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4104-4115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Vpr influences the transport of the preintegration complex remains unclear. Although no classical nuclear localization signal have been clearly demonstrated in Vpr, it is likely that Vpr acts through interactions with cellular proteins involved in the nuclear import of macromolecules. In fact, it was recently demonstrated that Vpr could associate with importin-α and the nucleoporin Nsp1, and thus possibly play the role of an importin-β-like protein (7Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 8Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G.

Virol. 1998; 72: 6004-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its involvement in the nuclear targeting of the preintegration complex, Vpr was shown to be required for efficient replication in nondividing cells such as monocytes and macrophages (6Nie Z.

Med. 1998; 187: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ability of Vpr to arrest the cell cycle constitutes the second biological activity associated with this protein (12Jowett J.B.M. Planelles V. Poon B. Shah N.P. Chen M.-L. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 882-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytostatic effect of Vpr was shown to result in a specific block in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which was correlated with the inactivation of the Cdc2 kinase (14Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The functional role of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest in proliferating and nondividing HIV target cells is still unclear. However, Stewartet al. (16Stewart S.A. Poon B. Jowett J.B.M. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Vpr could also induce apoptosis following cell cycle arrest, suggesting a contribution to CD4 cell depletion during HIV-1 disease. As well, the cell cycle arrest action of Vpr was shown to increase viral expression in dividing T cells as well as in macrophages (11Subbramanian R.A. Kessous-Elbaz A. Lodge R. Forget J. Yao X.-J.

From the resulting plasmid, pK1, the ScaI-XhoI fragment was subcloned into pAΔ7 (digested SacI, XhoI) carrying theSUC2-HIS4C fusion construct (17Sengstag C. Stirling C. Scheckman R. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pG355. pR90 was constructed by amplifying PMT1 from bp −137 to +270 with oligo Al3 (5′-tgtcgaagaagagtttggcg-3′) and oligo Al5 (5′-ttaccgctcgagcctaatgtattgcgaggc-3′), digesting the fragment with BglII-XhoI, and subcloning it into pK1 (digested BglII and XhoI). TheSacI-XhoI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then subcloned into pAΔ7. The construction of pR157 was analogous to that of pR90 using oligos Al3 and Al6 (5′-ttaccgctcgagacgtaaagtcatgtacatc-3′). For pV175 oligo Al3 and oligo 105 (5′-acgtacgactcgagaacggcaaagcagatagcgctc-3′), for pL221 oligos Al3 and Al10 (5′-ttaccgctcgagaagcaaggacttgtaagc-3′) were used to amplify PMT1 from bp −137 to +525 and bp −137 to +659, respectively. The PCR fragments were digested withBsh1365I and XhoI and subcloned into pR157 (cut with Bsh1365I and XhoI). For pS263 to pC731 the following regions of PMT1 were amplified by PCR: pS263, bp +550 to +789, oligos Al9 (5′-cgttacattctgttggacgc-3′) and Al11 (5′-ttaccgctcgagggaagacttagtcaaatcc-3′); pF306, bp +550 to +918, oligos Al9 and Al12 (5′-cattagctcgagaaagaagcttgcgccatcc-3′); pP616, bp +550 to +1848, oligos Al9 and Al7 (5′-ttaccgctcgagtggtttacctaactgcc-3′); pH655, bp +550 to +1965, oligo Al9 and oligo101 (5′-ttaccgctcgaggtgatgcaaaaacatttgacgttg-3′); pC731, bp +550 to +2193, oligos Al9 and Al8 (5′-ttaccgctcgagacaattgtagtcccaacc-3′). The PCR fragments were digested with PstI and XhoI and subcloned into pL221 cut with the same.Plasmid pSB52 (PMT1G355HA)A 111-bpNotI fragment encoding three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was isolated from pAxl2 (22Roemer T. Madden K. Chang J. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGEMEX-1 (Promega). Sequence analysis was used to identify clones with the 5′-sequence of the HA epitope following the XhoI site of the vector. The HA epitope sequence (XhoI-SphI fragment) was further subcloned from this construct (pSB50) into pG355 (XhoI, PflmI-digested), resulting in pSB52.Plasmid pSB53 (PMT1)A carboxyl-terminal fragment ofPMT1 was amplified on genomic DNA using the primer pair oligo Al4 (5-tcttgttatggttacagcgg-3′) and oligo 133 (5′-tcactagcatgcggatccaccttcagcaaatg-3′). The PCR-fragment was digested with PflmI and SphI and subcloned into pC731 (cut with PflmI, SphI).PMT1 MutantsDeletions or insertions ofN-glycosylation sites were attained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. To create pSB57 (PMT1N743A) and pSB60 (PMT1N390A) the plasmid pSB53 was used as template DNA. The primer pairs oligo 124 (5′-gaagagtacaaagcccaaaccttgactaaacgt-3′) and oligo 125 (5′-cacgtttagtcaaggtttgggctttgtactcttc-3′) were utilized to make pSB57, oligo 122 (5′-acaacattccaagccctaaccgatggtaccaaggtc-3′) and oligo 123 (5′-gaccttggtaccatcggttagggcttggaatgttgt-3′) to make pSB60. pSB52 served as the template DNA to produce pSB62 (PMT1G355HA/loop 1)), pSB59(PMT1G355HA/loop 4)), and pSB61(PMT1G355HA/loop 6)). pSB62 was created using the primer pair oligo 138 (5′-cctcctcttgcaaagaacttgtctgctggtaacgcatcgcttggtggg-3′)/oligo 139 (5′-cccaccaagcgatgcgttaccagcagacaagttctttgcaagaggagg-3′), pSB59 the primer pair oligo 117 (5′-gcaagcaaggacttgttagcattggtcgagttgtcagggtacat-3′)/oligo 118 (5′-atgtaccctgccaactcgaccaatgctaacaagtccttgcttgc-3′), and pSB61 the primer pair oligo 140 (5′-ggcgcaagcaacttttcgcctgaatttaactctacactaaagaac-3′)/oligo 141 (5′-gttctttagtgtagagttaaattcaggcgaaaagttgcttgcgcc-3′). To create pSB79 (PMT1Δ304–531), the plasmid pSB53 was digested with SphI, NarI, and religated. The resulting plasmid (pSB73) was cut with HindIII and religated, thereby deleting the PMT1 sequence coding for aa 304 to aa 531.Computer AnalysesStructural predictions of Pmt1p were made using the programs TMAP (23Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and TMPRED. The latter uses an algorithm based on the statistical analysis of TMbase (24Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural models made by Martinsried Institute for Protein Sequences accession numberA47716 and SWISS-PROT accession number P33775, were used.Analysis of the Pmt1-His4C Fusion ProteinsGrowth on HistidinolThe strain STY50 was transformed with the plasmids pR90 to pC731. Transformants were selected for the URA3-containing plasmids on SD plates supplemented with the amino acids and bases required at 20–30 mg/liter, lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose. Ura+ transformants were streaked on supplemented minimal medium lacking histidine but containing 6 mm histidinol. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days.Immunoprecipitation from Whole-cell ExtractsYeast cells were grown on SD medium to a concentration of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml. Cells (50 ml) were harvested and whole-cell extracts prepared as described previously (25Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). 10 μl of anti-invertase antibody (26Rothe C. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were added to 400 μl of whole-cell extract and incubated for at least 3 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 50 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) were added and the extracts dissected. 15 μl of bead volume protein A-Sepharose C-4B beads (Pharmacia) were added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 1.4 ml of lysis buffer and once with 1.4 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.02% SDS, protease inhibitors as above. Subsequently, the precipitates were subjected to endoglycosidase H digestion or mock treated.Preparation of Crude MembranesYeast cells were grown on SD medium. At a concentration of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml, 20 ml of cells were harvested, washed with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm MgCl2, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer plus protease inhibitors (see above). An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were lysed by vortexing, for 1 min, four times (with 1-min intervals on ice). The bottom of the tube was punctured and the lysate collected. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. Membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2.Isolation of ChitinaseYeast cells were grown on SD medium to 2.0 × 107 cells/ml. Chitinase (Cts1p) was isolated from cell walls as described in Gentzsch and Tanner (14Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Deglycosylation by Endoglycosidase H DigestionImmunoprecipitates or 5 μl of crude membranes were suspended in 25 μl of Endo H buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 5.5, 0.02% SDS, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors as above) and digested with 1–5 units/μl of Endo H for 1 h at 37 °C. Mock samples were incubated without Endo H. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer.Western Blot AnalysesProteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-Pmt1p and anti-invertase polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:1,000, anti-Cts1p polyclonal antibody at 1:2,500, and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12; Babco) at 1:5,000 dilution. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system.In Vitro Dol-P-Man:Protein O-Mannosyltransferase Assay5–30 μg of membrane protein were incubated in the in vitro assay for Dol-P-Man:proteinO-mannosyltransferase, as described previously (5Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pentapeptide acetyl-YATAV-NH2 was used at a final concentration of 3.5 mm.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present the first analysis of the transmembrane topology of a Pmt-mannosyltransferase, an enzyme crucial to initiating protein O-mannosylation at the ER. Our data provide strong genetic and biochemical evidence for a seven-transmembrane helical model, summarized in Fig. 8. The Pmt1p amino terminus faces the cytoplasm, the carboxyl terminus the ER lumen. A large hydrophilic region, located in the ER lumen, is separated from the amino terminus by five and from the carboxyl terminus by two membrane spanning domains. By using deletion mutagenesis we show that the ER luminally oriented central loop is crucial for mannosyltransferase activity.The successful use of heterologous protein fusions as topology-sensitive monitors (17Sengstag C. Stirling C. Scheckman R. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Manoil C. Beckwith J. Science. 1986; 233: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) encouraged us to use His4C as a reporter of the topological location which discrete portions of Pmt1p acquire in the membrane. The results obtained with Pmt1-His4C fusions are supported by several other lines of evidence as follows. (i)N-glycosylation scanning demonstrates that TM I integrates into the membrane with its carboxyl-terminal region reaching into the ER lumen. As a consequence the Pmt1p amino terminus is cytoplasmic. In agreement with these data TM I shows the features of a “type II signal anchor sequence” (reviewed in Ref. 35Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 135-150Google Scholar); TM I (aa 51–70) is amino-terminally flanked by three positive (Arg-42, Lys-48, and Lys-50) and carboxyl-terminally by three negative (Asp-72, Asp-77, and Glu-78) charges. (ii) Mutation of the endogenous Pmt1pN-glycosylation sequons N390LT and N743QT demonstrates that the central hydrophilic loop and the carboxyl terminus of Pmt1p are oriented toward the ER lumen. Earlier results resting upon Endo H digestion of Pmt1p isolated from yeast and heterologous expression of Pmt1p in E. coli already suggested that all threeN-glycosylation sites (Asn-390, Asn-513, and Asn-743) are used in the yeast Pmt1p protein (5Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). (iii) OurN-glycosylation scanning data corroborates the prediction that hydrophobic helix TM V does not span the membrane. TM V (aa 235–256) is flanked on both sides by positively charged loops and thus might adopt a “leave-one-out” topology as observed by Gafvelin and von Heijne (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) for E. coli inner membrane proteins. (iv) The majority of the loop regions between the seven transmembrane helices follow the “positive-inside rule” which states that positively charged residues are often found flanking hydrophobic transmembrane segments on the cytosolic side of the membrane (reviewed in Ref. 37von Heijne G. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 55-62Google Scholar).The complex organization of yeast Pmt1p contrasts the structure of the mammalian UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation at the Golgi apparatus of higher eucaryotes (38Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The GalNAc-transferases show small cytosolic amino-terminal domains, single transmembrane segments, lumenal stem regions, and large carboxyl-terminal lumenal domains responsible for catalysis. This type II model structure is common to glycosyltransferases of the Golgi apparatus, for example the yeast mannosyltransferases Mnt1/Kre2p (39Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Hill K. Boone C. Goebl M. Puccia R. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Genetics. 1992; 130: 273-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Mnn1 (41Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. Hara O.-P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).ER resident glycosyltransferases showing multiple putative transmembrane helices were found in S. cerevisiae as well as in higher eucaryotes. These include the glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the lipid oligosaccharide precursor forN-glycans (3Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar, 42Dan N. Middleton R.B. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30717-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (3Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar, 43Menon A.K. Baumann N.A. van't Hof W. Vidugiriene J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The topological organization of these transferases is not well characterized, but for the ones investigated so far the putative transmembrane topology does not resemble the structure of Pmt1p. A scarce example where the structure-function relationship has been examined in detail is the hamster UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT) (44Zhu X. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14250-14255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Scocca J.R. Krag S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20621-20626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme initiates N-linked glycosylation by catalyzing the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. Lehrman and co-workers (42Dan N. Middleton R.B. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30717-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Dan N. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GPT is a multimeric enzyme with multiple, most likely 10 transmembrane spans. The largest hydrophilic segment, located between TM 9 and TM 10, is facing the cytoplasm. This loop region most likely bears the catalytic site consistent with the fact that GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol is synthesized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER. GPT seems to be highly conserved between higher eucaryotes and yeast since the human GlcNAc-1-P transferase complements a S. cerevisiae alg7 (asparaginelinked glycosylation) mutant defective in GPT activity (47Eckert V. Blank M. Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, several ER-located glycosyltransferases have been identified which, like Pmt1p, use dolichol phosphate-activated sugars as donor substrates. These include Alg3p (48Aebi M. Gassenhuber J. Domdey H. Te-Heesen S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Alg6p (49Reiss G. Te-Heesen S. Zimmerman J. Robbins P.W. Aebi M.

We demonstrated recently that mutant AVP precursors accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum of neuronal cells, leading to cellular toxicity. In this study, the possibility that mutant AVP precursors interact with wild-type (WT) proteins to alter their processing and function was explored. WT and mutant precursors were epitope-tagged to allow them to be distinguished in transfected cells. An in vivo cross-linking reaction revealed homo- and heterodimer formation between WT and mutant precursors. Mutant precursors were also shown to impair intracellular trafficking of WT precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. In addition to the cytotoxicity caused by mutant AVP precursors, the interaction between the WT and mutant precursors suggests that a dominant-negative mechanism may also contribute to the pathogenesis of familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.

The AVP gene encodes polypeptide precursors consisting of a signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NP), and glycoprotein domains (16Sausville E. Carney D. Battey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10236-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prepro-AVP is synthesized in the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus and is converted to pro-AVP by the removal of the signal peptide. Pro-AVP undergoes several post-translational processing steps, including the addition of carbohydrate side chains and proteolytic cleavage to yield AVP, NP, and the glycoprotein. These products are stored within neurosecretory vesicles in the axonal terminals of the posterior pituitary gland and are secreted into the blood in response to osmotic stimuli (17Brownstein M.J. Russel J.T. Gainer H. Science. 1980; 207: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Most of the mutations in individuals with FNDI have been found within the signal peptide and the NP domains (18Hansen L.K. Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 363-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A substitution of Thr for Ala at the carboxyl terminus of the signal peptide (A(−1)T) is the most commonly found mutation, and it has been identified in various ethnic groups, suggesting independent mutational events. Mutations within the NP domain include amino acid substitutions, a single amino acid deletion, and premature protein termination. Despite the presence of a normal allele, FNDI patients develop diabetes insipidus, although the symptoms are not usually manifest until several months or years after birth. These features have raised questions concerning the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. A limited number of autopsy studies have demonstrated a paucity of AVP-producing neurons in the hypothalamus of patients with FNDI (19Braverman L.E. Mancini J.P. McGoldrick D.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1965; 63: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Green J.R. Buchan G.C. Alvord E.C. Swanson A.G. Brain. 1967; 90: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Nagai I.

Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 81: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with these pathologic findings, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an absence of the bright spot that characterizes the posterior pituitary gland in a subset of patients with FNDI (12Rutishauser J. Boni-Schnetzler M. Boni J. Wichmann W. Huisman T. Vallotton M.B. Froesch E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been postulated that mutant AVP precursors might be cytotoxic to AVP-producing neurons. In a previous study (4Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the A(−1)T mutation was shown to cause inefficient cleavage of the signal peptide, giving rise to aberrant precursors that were glycosylated, but not cleaved, by signal peptidase. This finding raised the possibility that the aberrant precursors might accumulate and lead to cellular toxicity. In support of this idea, the expression of several different FNDI mutants was shown to impair the intracellular trafficking of mutant AVP precursors and the viability of neuroblastoma cells (23Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of mutant AVP precursors may be sufficient to account for the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance of FNDI. However, in some autosomal dominant diseases, the mutant protein exerts dominant-negative activity to alter the function of the normal allele (24Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). AVP precursors have been shown to physically interact with each other in vitro (25Kanmera T. Chaiken I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8474-8482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that mutant AVP precursors could form heterodimers with wild-type (WT) protein products to alter their function and contribute to the pathogenesis of FNDI. In this study, we examined the physical and functional interactions between WT and mutant AVP precursors by expressing epitope-tagged precursors in cultured cells. Expression vectors for the WT and mutant (G57S (2Ito M. Mori Y. Oiso Y. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), A(−1)T (4Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For epitope tagging (Fig. 1 B), restriction sites for ClaI, SpeI, andXbaI (ATCGAT ACTAGT TCTAGA) were introduced by polymerase chain reaction immediately after the last codon of the glycoprotein domain (WT, G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47) or the 66th codon of the NP domain (C67X), and the resulting vectors were digested withClaI and XbaI. Annealed oligonucleotides containing the Myc-His tag or the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, along with sequence overhangs for the ClaI andXbaI sites, were ligated into the same restriction sites in the plasmid vectors (Fig. 1 B). The Myc-His tag contains the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL), the intervening amino acid sequence (NSAVD), and polyhistidine sequence (His6) from the pcDNA3.1MycHis expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The His6 sequence is added to allow protein purification. The amino acid sequence of the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. After polymerase chain reaction and subcloning, the entire cDNA sequence was verified by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar). All the cDNAs were introduced into the pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen). The vector without a cDNA insert was used as a control in some experiments. Human embryonic kidney tsa 201 cells (27Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (28Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6460) Google Scholar). In precursor interaction assays (see below), cells were treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Sigma) for 12 h to inhibit protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (29Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Continuous metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (23Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected cells were labeled for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi of Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (DuPont). Cell extracts and culture medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-AVP or anti-NP antibodies (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Immunoprecipitates were separated by 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography. For pulse-chase analyses, transfected cells were labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi of Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture in 0.5 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chased using 1 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cycloheximide was added to completely inhibit further synthesis of labeled precursors after the pulse labeling. In some experiments, immunoprecipitates were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Densitometric analyses were performed using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Quantitative analyses were performed with film exposures in the linear range. Cells transfected with expression vectors for precursors, with or without the Myc-His epitope tag, were labeled for 12 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml BFA. After labeling, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmimidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell extracts were incubated with the Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 10 mm imidazole for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After extensive washing in buffer A containing 15 mmimidazole, bound proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and subjected to 16.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For the in vitro precursor interaction assay, WT precursors with and without the Myc-His tag were translated in vitro using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (DuPont) and canine microsomal membranes (Promega). The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were subjected to the binding reaction with metal affinity resin as described above. Extensive washing and the inclusion of imidazole throughout the assay are necessary to reduce nonspecific protein interactions. Under these conditions, <10% of the total input protein is typically bound to the affinity resin (30Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A non-cleavable cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce), was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 100 mm. For the detection of homodimers, cells expressing precursors with the HA tag were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in either phosphate-buffered saline containing Me2SO (1:100 dilution) or phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DSS for 30 min at room temperature. Immediately after performing the cross-linking reaction, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Whole cell extracts were subjected to 15% reducing SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). Membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Subsequently, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Boehringer Mannheim). For the detection of heterodimers as well as homodimers, cells expressing precursors with the Myc-His tag and those with the HA tag were subjected to an in vivo cross-linking reaction as described above. After the reaction, cells were lysed in buffer A, and cell extracts were incubated with the metal affinity resin as described above for the precursor interaction assay. Bound proteins were eluted from the resin and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After Western blot transfer, membranes were probed with the anti-HA antibody. Human embryonic kidney tsa 201 cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector or with expression vectors for WT AVP precursors with or without the Myc-His epitope tag to allow studies of precursor expression and processing. After continuous metabolic labeling, cell extracts and medium were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation. A 14-kDa protein (Fig.2 A, lanes 3,5, 9, and 11) was detected in cells transfected with an empty vector (lanes 1 and 7), suggesting that this band is nonspecific. Using the anti-NP antibody, a similar series of precursors were identified, independent of the presence of the Myc-His epitope tag. The WT AVP precursor was 21 kDa (lane 3), whereas the intracellular precursor containing the Myc-His epitope tag was 25 kDa (lane 5). The expression levels of the 21- and 25-kDa precursors for the WT and Myc-His-tagged AVP precursors were similar. The intracellular precursors consisted of doublets (lanes 3 and 5), presumably reflecting different states of glycosylation. In the medium, the 22-kDa (WT) (lane 4) and 26-kDa (Myc-His) (lane 6) precursors as well as a 12-kDa protein were detected. The sizes of the precursors in the medium were increased relative to those in the cell extracts, reflecting the addition of carbohydrate moieties prior to secretion (Fig. 2 B). Each of the precursor forms and the 12-kDa protein were also immunoprecipitated with the anti-AVP antibody (Fig.2 A, lanes 9–12), indicating that they contain both the AVP and NP domains. The 12-kDa protein corresponds to the intermediate form observed in neuro2A cells (Fig. 2 B) (23Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that the sizes of the processed AVP precursor products in this cell line and indicate that the presence of the Myc-His epitope tag does not alter the level or the efficiency of precursor processing or secretion into the medium. Digestion of the immunoprecipitated proteins with Endo H (Fig.3 A) demonstrated that the WT intracellular precursors (21 and 25 kDa) (lanes 1 and11) were sensitive to Endo H, yielding 17- and 21-kDa digested products (lanes 21 and 31). In contrast, the products in the medium (lanes 2 and 12) were resistant to Endo H digestion (lanes 22 and 32). The Endo H resistance of the secreted precursors is consistent with their increased molecular size, likely reflecting glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus. Little or no Endo H-resistant precursors were detected within cells (lanes 21 and 31), suggesting that AVP precursors are rapidly exported into the medium or undergo further processing once they are glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2 B). The expression and processing of the G57S, A(−1)T, ΔE47, and C67X mutant AVP precursors were examined in parallel with the WT precursors described above. Under conditions of continuous labeling (Fig. 3 A), the mutant AVP precursors with and without the Myc-His tag were readily detected within cells (lanes 1, 3, 5,7, and 9 and lanes 11, 13,15, 17, and 19). In fact, in most cases, the level of mutant precursor expression was greater than that of WT precursor expression (lanes 1 and 11). The migration of the G57S precursors (lanes 3 and 13) was indistinguishable from that of the WT precursors, whereas the A(−1)T (lanes 5 and 15) and ΔE47 (lanes 7 and 17) precursors migrated differently. The slower migration of the A(−1)T mutant likely reflects the formation of aberrant precursors that are glycosylated, but not cleaved by signal peptidase (Fig. 2 B) (4Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The slightly faster migration of the ΔE47 mutant may reflect the deletion of a single amino acid. The C67X mutant, with and without the Myc-His tag (14 and 10 kDa) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9 and 19), was also expressed well within cells. In the medium, 22- and 26-kDa precursors as well as 12-kDa intermediate forms were detected for the WT, G57S, and A(−1)T mutants (lanes 2, 4, and6 and lanes 12, 14, and16). The sizes of the secreted WT and A(−1)T mutant precursors in the medium were the same because their products are identical once the signal peptide is removed. The amount of the G57S and A(−1)T proteins detected in the medium was reduced compared with that of the WT protein. Little or no precursors were detectable in the medium for the Δ47E and C67X mutants (lanes 8and 10 and lanes 18 and 20). The effects of Endo H treatment were similar for the mutant and WT precursors (Fig. 3 A). Digestion of intracellular G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47 AVP precursor proteins with and without the Myc-His tag (lanes 3, 5, and 7 and lanes 13, 15, and 17) gave rise to 17- and 21-kDa proteins (lanes 23, 25, and 27 andlanes 33, 35, and 37). The G57S and A(−1)T precursors in the medium (lanes 4 and 6and lanes 14 and 16) were resistant to Endo H digestion (lanes 24 and 26 and lanes 34 and 36). No Endo H-resistant precursors were detected within the cells, indicating that like the WT precursors, most of the mutant precursors are readily secreted into the medium after glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus. As expected, Endo H had no effect on the C67X mutant precursors (lanes 9 and19 and lanes 29 and 39). Pulse-chase analyses were performed to further evaluate the kinetics of precursor processing and secretion. AVP precursors recovered in cells and in the medium 1 h after the pulse labeling were normalized to the amount of labeled products present after labeling (Fig.3 B, left panel). The recovery of WT precursors in the medium was 31%, whereas that of the mutants ranged between 0 and 7%, indicating reduced secretion of mutant precursors. The total recovery of WT precursors in cells and the medium was 71%, whereas the recovery of the C67X mutant precursor was only 35%. In the case of other mutant precursors, the recovery was between 50 and 64%. These results suggest that intracellular degradation is involved in the inefficient secretion of mutant precursors. Pulse-chase analyses also revealed that mutant precursors were still retained within cells 8 h after pulse labeling (Fig.3 B, right panel). By comparison, most of the WT precursors were secreted into the medium by 8 h, indicating that the mutant AVP precursors are secreted into the medium less efficiently than the WT precursors. Because precursors appear to be rapidly secreted into the medium after glycosylation (Fig. 3 A), these findings suggest that the G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47 mutant precursors are not transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus as effectively as the WT precursors. The levels of the C67Xmutant were relatively low due to intracellular degradation (see above), but it, too, appears to be retained within the intracellular pool, consistent with previous studies in which ER retention of the C67X precursors was demonstrated using immunofluorescence staining in neuro2A cells (23Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that both intracellular degradation and retention are responsible for the reduced secretion of mutant precursors. AVP precursors were previously shown to interact with each other in vitro using synthetic peptides and immobilized NP (25Kanmera T. Chaiken I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8474-8482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a protein “pull-down” assay to assess interactions among the precursor proteins. Cells were treated with BFA, which blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, to allow a similar degree of retention of both mutant and WT AVP precursors. Treatment of cells with BFA completely eliminated the release of precursors and intermediate forms into the medium, resulting in a comparable degree of WT and mutant precursor expression (data not shown). Cells expressing precursors with and without the Myc-His tag were labeled in the presence of BFA prior to lysis. Cell extracts were incubated with metal affinity resin to bind AVP precursors containing the Myc-His tag to the resin. After extensive washing, bound proteins were separated on 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography (Fig.4 A). AVP precursors with the Myc-His tag were retained by the metal affinity resin (lane 1), but those without the Myc-His tag were not retained (lane 2), demonstrating a specific interaction of the His6-tagged precursors with the resin. WT and mutant precursors with the Myc-His tag interacted with their respective precursors without the tag (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–7), as reflected by the fact that the precursors without the Myc-His tag were also retained by the affinity column. These results suggest that WT and mutant precursors form homodimers. WT precursors with the Myc-His tag also interacted with the G57S, A(−1)T, ΔE47, and C67X mutant precursors (lanes 8–11). And in the reverse format, the G57S, A(−1)T, ΔE47, and C67Xmutant precursors with the Myc-His tag interacted with the WT precursors (lanes 12–15). These results indicate that the WT and mutant precursors form both homo- and heterodimers. Precursor proteins were also labeled during in vitrotranslation to provide an estimate of the fraction of input proteins that interact with the metal affinity resin in this assay (Fig.4 B). WT precursors with and without the Myc-His tag were translated in vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes to produce prohormones (4Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). WT precursors with the Myc-His tag (25 kDa) (lane 2) interacted with metal affinity resin (lane 4). WT precursors (21 kDa) (lane 1) without the tag did not interact with the resin (lane 3), but were retained in the presence of WT precursors with the Myc-His tag (lane 5). In comparison with the input proteins (lanes 2and 4), ∼8% of the WT precursors with the Myc-His tag were bound, which is similar to the interactions of previously characterized protein dimers in this type of assay (30Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Approximately 7% of the total input of WT precursors without the tag was associated with WT precursors with the Myc-His tag (lanes 1and 5), suggesting that the majority of WT precursors without the tag interact with WT precursors with the epitope tag. Cross-linking studies were used to further assess the formation of AVP precursor homodimers within the cellular environment. WT or mutant precursors with the HA tag were expressed, and the cells were subjected to an in vivo cross-linking reaction with DSS prior to lysis. After Western blot transfer, membranes were probed with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5). The monomeric form of the WT, G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47 precursors was 23 kDa, whereas the C67X monomer was 12 kDa. In the absence of DSS treatment, homodimerization of the G57S and ΔE47 precursors (46 kDa) was detected (lanes 3 and 7), but little or no homodimerization was seen with the WT, A(−1)T, and C67X (24 kDa) precursors (lanes 1,5, and 9). After treatment with DSS, all of the WT and mutant precursors formed homodimers (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and10). The ratio of dimer to monomer for the C67Xmutant was greater than that for the WT, G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47 precursors. Cells coexpressing WT and mutant precursors with the HA tag and the Myc-His tag were subjected to the cross-linking reaction with DSS prior to lysis. Cell extracts were prepared and incubated with the metal affinity resin to isolate Myc-His-tagged complexes. After washing, bound proteins were subjected to Western blot transfer, and the membranes were probed with the anti-HA antibody (Fig.6). As a control, WT precursors with the Myc-His tag were not recognized by the anti-HA antibody (lane 1). WT precursors with the HA tag were not detected in the absence of precursors with the Myc-His tag (lane 2), indicating that the precursors with the HA tag were not retained by the affinity resin. However, WT precursors with the HA tag were detected when coexpressed with WT precursors containing the Myc-His tag (lane 3). The detection of 48-kDa proteins by the anti-HA antibody indicates the formation of mixed complexes consisting of WT precursors with the Myc-His tag (25 kDa) and those with the HA tag (23 kDa) (lane 3). Similarly, homodimerization of G57S, A(−1)T, and ΔE47 precursors was demonstrated by the detection of complexes con"
https://openalex.org/W2033549688,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that is crucial in the regulation of a large number of genes involved in glucose, cholesterol, and fatty acid metabolism and in determining the hepatic phenotype. We have previously shown that HNF-4 contains transcription activation functions at the N terminus (AF-1) and the C terminus (AF-2) which work synergistically to confer full HNF-4 activity. Here, we show that HNF-4 recruits the CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivator on promoters of genes that contain functional HNF-4 sites. HNF-4 interacts with the N-terminal region of CBP (amino acids 1–771) and the C-terminal region of CBP (amino acids 1812–2441). The two activating functions of HNF-4, AF-1 and AF-2, interact with the N terminus and the N and C terminus of CBP, respectively. In addition, we show that in contrast to the other nuclear hormone receptors the interaction between HNF-4 and CBP is ligand-independent. Recruitment of CBP by HNF-4 results in an enhancement of the transcriptional activity of the latter. CBP does not activate gene expression in the absence of HNF-4, and dominant negative forms of HNF-4 prevent transcriptional activation by CBP, suggesting that the mere recruitment of CBP by HNF-4 is not sufficient for enhancement of gene expression. These findings demonstrate that CBP acts as a transcriptional coactivator for HNF-4 and provide new insights into the regulatory function of HNF-4.

In mice, HNF-4α transcripts have been detected as early as day 4.5 and its knock-out impairs gastrulation and is embryonic-lethal (3Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we performed a systematic analysis of the functional domains of HNF-4 that are involved in DNA binding, dimerization, and transactivation (19Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have found that HNF-4 contains two activation functions (AFs), designated AF-1 and AF-2, that are located in the A/B and D/E regions, respectively, and activate transcription in a cell type-independent manner. In most cell types examined, AF-1 and AF-2 synergize for full HNF-4 activity. The AF-1 consists of the extreme N-terminal 24 amino acids and functions as a constitutive autonomous activator of transcription. The AF-2 transactivator is more complex, spanning the region between amino acids 128 and 366. The 360–366 region of HNF-4 (AF-2 AD) contains a motif that is highly conserved among transcriptionally active nuclear receptors and is essential for AF-2 activity. Unlike the AF-2 domains of retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor, and thyroid receptor, the corresponding AF-2 AD region does not exhibit an autonomous function, although it can adopt a similar amphipathic α-helical conformation (20Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 21Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G.

For AF-2 activity in HNF-4, the entire 128–366 region is required, representing a new subclass of activation domains defined by the requirement of an intact D/E region for activity. The F region, which is unique to HNF-4, has a negative effect on AF-2 activity. It was recently shown that long chain fatty acids directly modulate the transcriptional activity of HNF-4α by binding as their acyl-CoA thioesters to HNF-4. Depending on the chain length and the degree of saturation of the fatty acyl-CoA ligand, HNF-4 can either activate or repress transcription of the target genes (25Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the different HNF-4 domains in ligand-mediated transcriptional activation has yet to be defined. Recent studies have shown that the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of certain nuclear hormone receptors interact strongly with the coactivator CBP and its functional homolog p300 in a ligand-dependent manner (26Chakravarti D.

CBP is a multi-faceted protein involved in multiple signal transduction pathways with different activators and in interactions with components of the basal transcription machinery like TATA-binding protein, TFIIB, and RNA helicase (28Ferreri K.

Together these proteins form a putative coactivator complex, the components of which appear to be specific for different transcriptional activators (40Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Current theory suggests that transcription factors bound to their DNA response elements associate with CBP or other coactivators and direct acetylation of histones in their vicinity. The consequent restructuring of the chromatin leads to enhanced assembly of the basal transcription machinery, possibly recruited by CBP, to form a stable preinitiation complex. However, chromatin disruption by histone acetylation is not sufficient for NHR-dependent transactivation (41Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, p300 can acetylate the general transcription factors TFIIEβ and TFIIF (42Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) suggesting that modification of core proteins by CBP or other coactivators may have a role in transcriptional activation. In the present study, we show that HNF-4 interacts in vitrowith CBP and that HNF-4 can recruit CBP while bound to the DNA. CBP targets both the AF-1 and the AF-2 domains of HNF-4. The AF-1 domain interacts weakly only with the N-terminal region of CBP, and the AF-2 domain of HNF-4 interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP, and this interaction is both AF-2 AD and ligand-independent. In cotransfection assays, CBP functions as a coactivator and stimulates the transcriptional activity of HNF-4. CBP does not activate gene expression in the absence of HNF-4, and dominant negative forms of HNF-4 prevent transcriptional activation by CBP. Although both the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP associate with HNF-4, transcriptional coactivation may be mediated by the C-terminal region. These findings demonstrate that CBP acts as a transcriptional coactivator for HNF-4 and provide new insights into the regulatory function of HNF-4. The wild type apoCIII promoter [apoCIII(−890/+24)CAT] plasmid has been described previously (43Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids containing the apoCIII(−890/+24) promoter mutated in the regulatory element B (BM5) and I4(I4M) have been described previously (14Kardassis D. Tzameli I. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

Plasmid pG5CAT contains five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the β-globin promoter and the CAT gene (19Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol.

The construction of the various HNF-4 mutants cloned in the vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen), as well as the GAL-HNF-4 chimeras have been previously described (19Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E.

The HNF-4 mutants HNF-4-(45–142), HNF-4-(45–370)68/71G, and HNF-4-(45–370)103/106G were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The N-terminal primer was HNF-4 45F, 5′-ACTCGGGATCC GCCGCCGCC ATGCTGGGTGTCAGTGCCCTGTGTC. The C-terminal primers were HNF-4 142R, 5′-GATGTCGAATTCTCAGGAGGGTAGGCTGCTGTCCTC, and HNF-4 370R, 5′-TCTAGAGAATTCTCAGGCAGACCCTCCAAGCAGCATC. Mutations were generated using the following primers: 68/71G F, 5′-TCAAGCGGTGACGGCGGCAAGGGA; 68/71G R, 5′-TCCCTTGCCGCCGTCACCGCTTGA; 103/106G F, 5′-AACCAGGGTCGTTACGGCAGGCTC; and 103/106G R, 5′-GAGCCTGCCGTAACGACCCTGGTT. The underlined nucleotides indicate the restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI as well as the initiator codon, ATG, and the terminator codon, TGA (TCA in reverse orientation). The bold nucleotides indicate the Kozak sequence adjacent to the initiator codon for optimal translation. The HNF-4-(45–142) clone was generated using HNF-4 45F and HNF-4 142R as primers. The HNF-4-(45–370)68/71G and HNF-4-(45–370)103/106G clones were obtained by a two-step PCR strategy. First, two separate PCR reactions were carried out, one containing HNF-4 45F and the relevant reverse primer for mutation (68/71G R or 103/106G R), and the other containing HNF-4 370R and the relevant forward primer for mutation (68/71G F or 103/106G F). Aliquots containing 2% of each of these initial PCR reactions were mixed and used for another round of PCR containing the HNF-4 45F and HNF-4 370R primers. The PCR products were digested withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the expression vector pcDNAI/amp. GST-CBP fusion constructs in pGEX-3T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the various CBP mutants cloned in vector pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) (44Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. Dimitris Thanos (Columbia University). [35S]Methionine-labeled HNF-4 proteins were produced from cDNA templates cloned downstream of T7 RNA polymerase promoter using the TNT T7 Quick-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformed with the GST-CBP fusion proteins GST-CBP1, GST-CBP2, GST-CBP3, and GST-CBP4. Fresh transformants were grown in LB media supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until anA 550 = 0.5 was reached. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After incubation for 3 h cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × gfor 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1/20 of the original culture volume in ice-cold phosphate resuspension buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and were broken by sonication on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with glutathione-agarose beads (SIGMA G4510) equilibrated to the same buffer. The coupled proteins were washed several times with the phosphate resuspension buffer and were stored at 4 °C covered by an equal volume of buffer. The purity of proteins bound to the GST-agarose beads was identified by SDS-PAGE. When necessary, the pure GST-CBP proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by resuspending the pelleted beads in a half-volume of cold phosphate resuspension buffer containing 2.5 mm glutathione. The suspension was incubated for 2–3 min on ice, the beads pelleted by centrifugation, and the eluate reserved. The beads were washed 2–3 more times, and the protein content in each faction of the eluate was observed by SDS-PAGE. For the binding assays 5–50 μl of glutathione beads containing approximately 0.5 μg of the fusion GST-CBP protein were incubated at 4 °C in 0.35 ml of 150 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (GST-CBP1, GST-CBP2, and GST-CBP3), or of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% BSA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (GST-CBP4). Equal amounts of in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled HNF-4 proteins were added, and binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the interaction buffer and once with the same buffer lacking BSA. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and were resolved by electrophoresis. The proteins were visualized by autoradiography. HNF-4 cDNA was cloned in the bacterial pET15b vector under the control of the T7 promoter and was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The expression and purification of HNF-4 protein has been previously described (45Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Lavrentiadou S.N. Zannis V.I. Kardassis D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14078-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the B regulatory element of the apoCIII promoter (CIIIB) which binds HNF-4 was used as a probe (15Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed HNF-4 protein was incubated with the 32P-labeled probe for 15 min at 4 °C in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 40 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 30 μg of BSA, and 50 ng of purified HNF-4. Where indicated, the reactions also included 0.25 μg of either GST-CBP1, GST-CBP2, or GST-CBP4 proteins that had been eluted from the agarose beads. HepG2, HeLa, or CV1 cells were maintained as stocks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Fifty to 60% confluent 30-mm dishes were transfected using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method, as described previously (46Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 3 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid, 50 ng of the HNF-4 or HNF-4 mutant expression plasmids (shown in Fig. 5 A), or 100 ng of GAL-HNF-4 fusion plasmid, 1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid, and where appropriate, 1.25 μg of CBP or CBP mutant plasmid. In every case vector DNA (pcDNAI/Amp) was added as necessary to achieve a constant amount of transfected DNA (5.75 μg). Forty hours post-transfection the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were collected in TEN solution (0.04 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl). Whole cell extracts were prepared in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, by three sequential freeze-thaw cycles. CAT activities were determined using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA as described previously (47Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). CAT enzyme levels that exhibited more than 60% conversion of acetylated product were diluted and reassayed for CAT activity in the linear range. The CAT values were not normalized for β-galactosidase, since CBP appeared to increase the expression of β-galactosidase. The results represent the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments each carried out in duplicate. To investigate whether there is an interaction between HNF-4 and CBP, we used a protein-protein interaction assay with glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-CBP fusion proteins. Several fragments of CBP cloned in frame with the GST gene (Fig.1 A) were expressed, purified, and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads before incubation within vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled HNF-4. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HNF-4 associates with CBPin vitro. Both the N-terminal fragment of CBP (GST-CBP1,lane 3) and the C-terminal fragment of CBP (GST-CBP4,lane 6) were found to interact with HNF-4. These interactions were specific as CBP regions 2 and 3 (lanes 4and 5, respectively) did not associate with HNF-4 nor did GST alone (lane 2). The interaction of HNF-4 with the C terminus of CBP appeared to be weaker than that with the N terminus, since they retained approximately 10 and 20% of the HNF-4 input (lane 1), respectively. To investigate whether HNF-4 can recruit CBP to the promoter, we carried out EMSA experiments using recombinant HNF-4 along with the GST-CBP fusion proteins. The CIIIB element of the apoCIII promoter that binds HNF-4 with strong affinity (15Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe. Bacterially expressed purified HNF-4 binds strongly to CIIIB (Fig.2, lane 2). Interestingly, the same N-terminal fragment of CBP-(1–771) that specifically interacts with HNF-4 forms a ternary complex on the DNA with HNF-4 (Fig. 2,lane 3). GST-CBP4-(1892–2441) does not appear to bind to the DNA·HNF-4 complex (Fig. 2, lane 5). This is in agreement with the observation from the protein-protein interaction assay that the N terminus of CBP forms a stronger complex with HNF-4 than the C terminus (Fig. 1 B, lane 3 versus lane 6). The specificity of the HNF-4·CBP complex formed in the EMSA was demonstrated by the inability of GST-CBP2-(706–1069) to supershift the HNF-4·DNA complex (Fig. 2, lane 4), confirming the result (Fig. 1, lane 4) that this region of CBP does not associate with HNF-4. Based on the interaction between HNF-4 and CBP, we sought next to evaluate the role of CBP in HNF-4-dependent transcription. Although CBP is widely expressed, its low levels are rate-limiting (27Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

To test for transcriptional coactivation by CBP, we utilized the apoCIII promoter in combination with HNF-4. We showed previously that HNF-4 binds with high affinity to regulatory elements CIIIB and CIII-I4present in the proximal promoter and in the enhancer region of theapoCIII gene, respectively (14Kardassis D.

To examine the role of CBP in the HNF-4-dependent transactivation of the apoCIII gene, we performed transient transfection experiments in three different cell types (HepG2, HeLa, and CV1) using the wild type apoCIII promoter along with mammalian expression vectors for HNF-4 and/or CBP (Fig.3 A). We chose HepG2 cells, because they support the expression of liver-specific genes likeapoCIII, and HeLa and CV1 cells in which the expression ofapoCIII gene is totally dependent on the expression of cotransfected HNF-4. In HepG2 cells, HNF-4 enhanced apoCIII promoter activity by 4.5-fold and CBP by 6.5-fold in the absence of transfected HNF-4 (Fig. 3 A). However, when the CBP expression vector was cotransfected along with HNF-4, apoCIII promoter activity levels were increased from 4.5- to 6.5–25-fold. The increase in apoCIII promoter activity by CBP alone observed in HepG2 cells is probably attributable to the interaction of transfected CBP with endogenous HNF-4. Therefore, CBP functions as a coactivator for HNF-4-inducedapoCIII gene transcription. This enhancement of HNF-4 transactivation by CBP is more profound in HeLa and CV1 cells where the expression of CBP alone had no effect on the levels of activation of the reporter in the absence of cotransfected HNF-4 (Fig.3 A). Remarkably, a significant stimulation of the reporter a"

https://openalex.org/W2015256946,"Recent work has demonstrated that the signal recognition particle (SRP) is required for the efficient insertion of many proteins into the Escherichia coli inner membrane (IM). Based on an analogy to eukaryotic SRP, it is likely that bacterial SRP binds to inner membrane proteins (IMPs) co-translationally and then targets them to protein transport channels (“translocons”). Here we present evidence that SecA, which has previously been shown to facilitate the export of proteins targeted in a post-translational fashion, is also required for the membrane insertion of proteins targeted by SRP. The introduction of SecA mutations into strains that have modest SRP deficiencies produced a synthetic lethal effect, suggesting that SecA and SRP might function in the same biochemical pathway. Consistent with this explanation, depletion of SecA by inactivating a temperature-sensitive amber suppressor in a secA am strain completely blocked the membrane insertion of AcrB, a protein that is targeted by SRP. In the absence of substantial SecA, pulse-labeled AcrB was retained in the cytoplasm even after a prolonged chase period and was eventually degraded. Although protein export was also severely impaired by SecA depletion, the observation that more than 20% of the OmpA molecules were translocated properly showed that translocons were still active. Taken together, these results imply that SecA plays a much broader role in the transport of proteins across the E. coli IM than has been previously recognized. Recent work has demonstrated that the signal recognition particle (SRP) is required for the efficient insertion of many proteins into the Escherichia coli inner membrane (IM).

Taken together, these results imply that SecA plays a much broader role in the transport of proteins across the E. coli IM than has been previously recognized. Proteins that are destined to be translocated across or inserted into the bacterial inner membrane (IM) 1The abbreviations used are:IM, inner membrane; AP, alkaline phosphatase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; IMP, inner membrane protein; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactoside; OM, outer membrane; RBP, ribose-binding protein; SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. are targeted to transport sites by multiple mechanisms. In Escherichia coli, many secreted proteins are targeted to the IM by molecular chaperones such as SecB, which keep them in a loosely folded, translocation-competent conformation (1Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford Jr., P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The chaperone-based targeting pathways promote the translocation of fully synthesized proteins in vitro and probably also function in a post-translational fashion at least to some extent in vivo(3Koshland D. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 30: 893-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Randall L.L. Cell. 1983; 22: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). By contrast, recent studies have suggested that a variety of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) are targeted to the membrane by an essential ribonucleoprotein complex that is closely related to the eukaryotic signal recognition particle (SRP) (5de Gier J.W.

In mammalian cells, SRP is a complex composed of six polypeptides and a single RNA that targets proteins to the secretory pathway in a strictly co-translational fashion (reviewed in Ref. 8Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The 54 kDa subunit of SRP (SRP54) binds to signal sequences of nascent polypeptides and guides ribosome-nascent chain complexes to transport sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via an interaction with the membrane-bound SRP receptor. Although the SRP found in E. coli and many other bacterial species contains only a single protein (a homolog of SRP54 called “Ffh”) and a small RNA (“4.5 S RNA”) (9Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), many aspects of its function appear to be conserved, including co-translational binding to substrates (10Brown S. Cell. 1987; 49: 825-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and a specific interaction with a homolog of the SRP receptor (“FtsY”) (11Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All of the different targeting pathways appear to converge at the IM. Both exported proteins and IMPs are transported by a common translocation channel or “translocon” composed of a phylogenetically conserved heterotrimer called the SecYEG complex, which is closely related to the Sec61p complex found in the eukaryotic ER (reviewed in Ref. 12Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Bacteria differ from eukaryotes, however, in that they have a unique peripheral membrane protein called SecA that interacts with SecY (13Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14Snyders S. Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that plays an essential role in protein export (15Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 16Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SecA acts as a molecular motor that binds to SecB-preprotein complexes in the cytoplasm (17Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and then uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to catalyze post-translational translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane (18Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Following translocation, SecA is released from the membrane (19Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the role of SecA in IMP insertion, and its role in transporting proteins targeted by the SRP pathway is particularly unclear. The insertion of some IMPs, but not others, has been proposed to be SecA-dependent (e.g. Refs. 20Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gebert J.F. Overhoff B. Manson M.D. Boos W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the SecA dependence does not correlate well with SRP dependence. Moreover, in all of the studies on IMP insertion, SecA activity has been blocked by adding sodium azide, a weak inhibitor of the SecA ATPase, or by shifting strains containing the temperature-sensitivesecA51 ts allele to high temperature. Because ATP binding and hydrolysis regulates the affinity of SecA for different components of the system, azide treatment may interfere with the normal cycling of SecA and may therefore inhibit IMP insertion by an indirect mechanism. Likewise, the SecA51(Ts) protein becomes trapped on the IM above 33 °C (25Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may block IMP insertion by simply interfering with the docking of ribosomes. Indeed recent studies strongly suggest that the use of sodium azide and temperature-sensitive secalleles can produce misleading results (22Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26de Gier J.-W.L. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To circumvent the problems associated with conditional alleles and inhibitors of SecA function, we used a novel approach to investigate the role of SecA in the membrane insertion of SRP substrates. Initially we tested for a genetic interaction between SRP and SecA using a synthetic lethality assay. The results from these experiments raised the possibility that SRP and SecA function in the same biochemical pathway. To test this idea directly, we examined the effect of SecA depletion on the membrane insertion of an SRP substrate, AcrB. In these experiments we used a strain that contains a secA ammutation and a temperature-sensitive amber suppressor. At low temperature full-length SecA protein is synthesized, but at high temperature only a small unstable fragment of the protein is produced (16Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We found that after SecA depletion AcrB was quantitatively retained in the cytosol, where it was eventually degraded. Surprisingly, we found that although SecA depletion also had a profound effect on protein export, a fraction of at least one protein was still properly translocated. These results demonstrate that SecA function is at least as important for the insertion of IMPs targeted by SRP as for protein export and suggest that SecA plays a role in the transport of both co-translationally and post-translationally targeted proteins. Strains HDB90 (secA + zab::Tn10), HDB91 (secA450 zab::Tn10), and HDB92 (secA51 ts zab::Tn10) were constructed by introducing the secA mutations from MM52 and EE450 (27Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Lee C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 878-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Miller J.H.

Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) by P1 transduction. Strains BA13 (MC4100 supF ts trp am secA13 am zch::Tn10) and DO251 (MC4100supF ts leu::Tn5 zch::Tn10) were obtained from Dr. Don Oliver. Media preparation and bacterial manipulations were performed according to standard methods (28Lee C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 878-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selective media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Amino acids 266–1049 were deleted from AcrB by excising an NruI-SalI fragment from plasmid S215 (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and repairing the ends with DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) to generate plasmid S215Δ2. To create a fusion of alkaline phosphatase (AP) with AcrB at amino acid 265 (pJN4), S215Δ2 was digested with SalI and ligated to aBsiHKAI-XhoI fragment of pHI-1 containing the AP gene (30Inouye H. Michaelis S. Wright A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide adapters 5′-CCGCCGGGTGCAGTAATATCGCCT-3′ and 5′-TCGAAGGCGATATTACTGCACCCGGCGGTGCT-3′. 2J. A. Newitt, N. D. Ulbrandt, and H. D. Bernstein, manuscript submitted.A derivative of pJN4 in which the AP fusion was subcloned into pACYC184 (pJN6) was used for the experiments described here. A pACYC184 derivative containing the AcrB 576-AP fusion (pNU88) and plasmid pAP-1 have been described (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose and 40 μg/ml l-amino acids, excluding methionine and cysteine. Cultures were then diluted into fresh medium at an optical density (A 550) of 0.02 and grown to an OD of 0.05 at 30 °C. Each culture was then divided in half. One-half was maintained at 30 °C while the other was shifted to 41 °C. At various times after the temperature shift, cells were subjected to pulse-chase labeling and processed essentially as described (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In some experiments, spheroplasts were divided into two portions, one of which was treated with proteinase K. Proteins were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To provide an internal standard, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was immunoprecipitated from all samples. To measure levels of SecA and SecY, portions of each culture were removed and cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%. trichloroacetic acid precipitates were collected by centrifugation, and Western blotting was performed as described (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The antibodies against various proteins that were used in this study were obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO (AP, CAT), Dr. Jon Beckwith (ribose-binding protein (RBP), OmpA), Dr. Don Oliver (SecA) and Dr. Koreaki Ito (SecY). Radiolabeled cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by ultrasonic treatment using a Heat Systems XL-2020 sonicator. A “total” cell lysate was obtained after removing unbroken cells by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min in a Sorvall HS-4 rotor. Cell envelopes were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TLX tabletop ultracentrifuge. To separate the outer and inner membranes, the pellet was resuspended in 3 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) and incubated in the presence of 0.5% Sarkosyl for 20 min at room temperature (32Filip C. Fletcher G. Wulff J.L. Earhart C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture was recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet, which contained outer membranes, was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA. Proteins were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Although cells can generally tolerate slight deficiencies in essential biochemical pathways, it has often been observed that combining two deficiencies in the same pathway has a synergistic effect that leads to cell death (33Huffaker T.C. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 259-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, if SRP and SecA are required in successive steps of IMP insertion, then reduction in the activity of each of these factors might produce similar physiological effects that together would be lethal. To test the effect of reducing SRP and SecA activity simultaneously, we constructed strains HDB90 (secA +), HDB91 (secA450), and HDB92 (secA51ts) in which the expression of ffh is regulated by thetrc promoter. Cells were plated on LB agar containing various amounts of IPTG and incubated at temperatures that are permissive for growth. Based on previous studies performed with the parent strain (HDB45), it was expected that a near wild-type level of Ffh would be produced in the presence of 10 μm IPTG (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Growth of HDB91 cells at 37 °C and of HDB92 cells at 30 °C was observed on LB plates containing this concentration of inducer (Fig.1, A and B). When the level of inducer and therefore the level of Ffh was slightly reduced, however, strong growth defects were observed; HDB91 and HDB92 did not grow at all on plates containing 2 μm IPTG and no IPTG, respectively. HDB90 cells grew about as well on the plates containing reduced levels of inducer as on plates containing 10 μm IPTG. These results demonstrate that reduction in SRP concentration in cells that contain SecA mutations produces a synthetic lethal effect and therefore raise the possibility that SecA participates in the insertion of SRP substrates. We next used a protease protection assay to study the effect of SecA depletion on the insertion of the SRP substrate AcrB. In this assay, protease treatment releases the AP domain from IMP-AP fusion protein molecules that are properly inserted into the IM but not from those that are retained in the cytoplasm (34Traxler B. Lee C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method has been used to show that inhibition of the SRP pathway sharply reduces the membrane insertion of both the polytopic AcrB 576-AP fusion and the bitopic AcrB 265-AP fusion (6Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).2 Strains BA13 (secA am supF ts) and DO251 (secA + supF ts) were first transformed with plasmids that encode the AP fusions. Cells were then grown in defined minimal medium at 30 °C, at which temperature the amber suppressor in BA13 is stable. Under these conditions the two strains grew equally well (Fig.2 A, diamonds andcircles) and contained similar amounts of SecA (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–4) as shown by Western blot. When the cells reached early log phase, half of each culture was removed and incubated at 41 °C, a temperature at which the amber suppressor is denatured (Fig. 2 A, solid arrow). Effective dilution of the residual SecA protein required 3 h (Fig.2 B, lane 1) at which point cell growth began to decline (Fig. 2 A, dashed arrow). Portions of each culture were removed at various times after the temperature shift and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. The cells were harvested, spheroplasts were generated and treated with protease, and the released AP plus any protease-protected AP fusion protein that remained was immunoprecipitated with anti-AP antibodies. We found that depletion of SecA had a profound effect on the membrane insertion of the AcrB-AP fusion proteins. A partial block of AcrB insertion was observed by 1.5 h after the shift (data not shown), but by 3 h a virtually complete block was observed. All of the pulse-labeled AcrB 265-AP fusion protein in BA13 cells was protease-protected following a 2-min chase, indicating that the protein was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–2). Even after a 30-min chase, little or no fusion protein was inserted into the membrane (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Because the fusion protein that remained in the cytoplasm was slowly degraded, only about 50% of the radiolabeled molecules were immunoprecipitated at this time point. By contrast, the AcrB 265-AP fusion protein was inserted efficiently into the IM of BA13 cells grown continuously at 30 °C and DO251 grown at either 30 or 41 °C (Fig. 3 A,lanes 5–16) as indicated by the complete susceptibility of the AP domain to proteolysis at all time points. Similar results were obtained in experiments in which the insertion of the AcrB 576-AP fusion was examined. At 41 °C, only protease-protected pulse-labeled fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from BA13 cells following a 2-min chase (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–2). After longer chase times, very little fusion protein was isolated from either untreated or protease-treated spheroplasts (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–2) due to rapid degradation of the protein in the cytoplasm. Quantitative insertion of the AcrB 576-AP fusion was observed in BA13 cells grown at 30 °C and in DO251 cells at both high and low temperature (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–16), and the membrane-bound form of the protein was stable (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3–8). To confirm that the protease resistance of the AcrB-AP fusion proteins was due to retention in the cytoplasm, we examined their localization in more detail by cell fractionation. BA13 and DO251 cells were grown at 30 °C as described above and shifted to 41 °C for 3 h. The cells were then pulse-labeled and harvested following a 10-min chase. Cell extracts were prepared by sonication, and membranes were isolated by high speed centrifugation. About 80–90% of the AcrB 265-AP fusion protein in BA13 cells was found in the high speed supernatant and cofractionated with the cytoplasmic protein CAT (Fig.4 A). By contrast, almost all of the fusion protein in DO251 cells was found in the membrane fraction. Similar results were obtained when the cells were spheroplasted and lysed by hypotonic shock using established methods (data not shown). These results demonstrate directly that depletion of SecA prevents the integration of SRP substrates into the IM. Although the effect of inhibiting SecA activity on protein export has been studied extensively in vivo, most experiments have involved treating cells with sodium azide or shifting strains containing the secA51 ts allele to the nonpermissive temperature. To test the effect of SecA depletion on protein export, BA13 and DO251 cells were first transformed with a plasmid expressing an AcrB-AP fusion or with plasmid pAP-1 (31Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were then grown and radiolabeled as described above, and AP, RBP, and OmpA were immunoprecipitated from samples that were not treated with proteinase K. Consistent with previous studies on SecA function, the export of AP and RBP was completely blocked by SecA depletion. None of the radiolabeled precursor was converted to the mature form in BA13 cells grown at 41 °C even after a 30-min chase (Fig.5, lanes 1–3). Like the AcrB-AP fusion proteins, pre-AP retained in the cytoplasm (but not pre-RBP) was slowly degraded during the long chase period. By contrast, rapid export of both AP and RBP from BA13 grown at 30 °C or from DO251 cells grown at either high and low temperature was indicated by the complete processing of the radiolabeled precursors within 2 min (Fig. 5, lanes 4–12). Export of OmpA was also significantly inhibited by SecA depletion, but surprisingly a small fraction of the protein appeared to be slowly translocated across the inner membrane (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). Only about 12% of the protein was processed after a 2-min chase, but after 30 min, more than 20% of the pro-OmpA was converted to OmpA. The remainder of the pro-OmpA was gradually degraded in the cytoplasm. We next performed cell fractionation experiments to confirm that the processing of OmpA observed after SecA depletion was due to proper translocation and insertion of the protein into the outer membrane (OM). Pulse-labeled BA13 and DO251 cells that had been incubated at 41 °C for 3 h were harvested after a 10-min chase. Cell membranes were separated from the cytoplasm by centrifugation and then further divided into IM and OM fractions. The AcrB-AP fusion protein was used as a marker to validate the membrane fractionation method (data not shown). OmpA was then immunoprecipitated from each cell fraction. In BA13 cells, all of the processed OmpA was correctly localized to the OM (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and4). Most of the pro-OmpA remained in the cytoplasm, although a small portion was isolated in the IM fraction (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–3). As expected, all of the OmpA in DO251 cells was properly processed and inserted into the OM (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 4). Taken together, these results show that OmpA is accurately transported across the IM (albeit with reduced efficiency) even after a severe reduction in the level of SecA. Thus the IMP insertion defects described above are not due to a nonspecific inactivation of translocons following SecA depletion. To determine whether SecA depletion affected translocon stability, we measured the SecY levels in BA13 and DO251 cells grown at 30 °C and 41 °C by Western blot. A similar amount of SecY was present in each strain at both temperatures (Fig. 6,lanes 2–5). This result strongly suggests that the AcrB insertion block observed in the absence of SecA was not caused by a loss of protein transport capacity. In the experiments reported here we have obtained strong evidence that SecA plays an essential role in the membrane insertion of proteins targeted by SRP in E. coli. In an initial genetic test, we found that slight Ffh deficiencies are lethal in SecA mutant strains. This observation indicated that SecA and SRP are likely to function in either the same or in parallel biochemical pathways. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed the insertion of a model SRP substrate, AcrB, in cells that had normal levels of SRP but reduced levels of SecA activity. To avoid possible artifacts associated with conditional alleles and metabolic inhibitors in these experiments, we used a strain in which SecA can be depleted. The observation that the insertion of both bitopic and polytopic AcrB-AP fusion proteins was quantitatively blocked by SecA depletion strongly supports the hypothesis that SecA is required for the insertion of SRP substrates. In light of evidence that SRP targets proteins to the IM cotranslationally, the simplest explanation of the cell fractionation data is that the SecA dependence is dictated by the AcrB moeity of the fusion proteins. If SecA were required only for the transport of the AP domain, then the fusion proteins would have been expected to fractionate with cell membranes. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that attachment of an AP domain to an IMP influences the SecA-dependence of its biogenesis. Interestingly, results from a recent biochemical study (35Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) are consistent with the conclusion that SecA functions downstream from SRP in the IMP insertion process. Nascent IMPs that were bound to E. coli SRP were released by the addition of FtsY and then, in the presence of membrane vesicles, transferred to the translocon. Although some of the nascent chains were cross-linked to SecY, a much larger fraction was cross-linked to SecA. Our results suggest that the proximity of the nascent chain to SecA that is implied by this study may have an important functional significance. The finding that SecA is required for the insertion of SRP substrates in E. coli is surprising in light of previous studies on the eukaryotic SRP pathway. In mammalian cells a tight seal between the ribosome and the translocon is generally formed after nascent chains are targeted to the ER by SRP (36Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E.

Continued elongation of the nascent chain is thought to be sufficient to push the polypeptide through the translocon. If the molecular mechanisms of translocation are conserved in bacteria, then motor proteins such as SecA would not be expected to participate in the transport of SRP substrates. Thus our results, together with the observation that only the core components of the translocon are evolutionarily conserved, suggest that there are significant differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic translocation systems. It is possible that the composition of the translocon or of the IM itself hinders the formation of a tight ribosome-translocon junction or necessitates the use of a molecular motor to drive proteins across the membrane. Dissociation of the ribosome from the translocon has been observed in mammalian cells under some circumstances (37Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this phenomenon might be more predominant in bacterial cells. If so, then the motor function of SecA may be required to ensure continuous transport of nascent chains across the membrane. An alternative explanation of our results that would be consistent with the formation of a tight ribosome-translocon junction is that SecA promotes the insertion of SRP substrates by a mechanism that does not depend on its motor activity. Extensive analysis of protein translocation in vitro has clearly shown that SecA uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to facilitate post-translational translocation, but the data do not rule out the possibility that SecA has additional functions. Recently it has been shown that the ER lumenal protein BiP maintains the permeability barrier of the ER by sealing nontranslocating Sec61p complexes (38Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that inactive translocons in bacteria are sealed by a different mechanism (no BiP equivalent has yet been identified) and that SecA triggers conformational changes that are required to initiate both protein translocation and IMP insertion. The observation that SecY is stable after substantial SecA depletion suggests that SecA is not required, however, to maintain the structural integrity of the translocon. In addition to providing evidence that SecA is required for the insertion of SRP substrates, our experiments also yielded several unanticipated results. Given that inhibition of the SRP pathway only partially blocks the insertion of all substrates that have been tested (5de Gier J.W. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar),2 the observation that SecA depletion completely abolished the insertion of AcrB is striking. This result suggests that the insertion of AcrB is SecA-dependent regardless of the mechanism by which it is targeted to the translocon. Furthermore, although our data are consistent with other types of evidence indicating that SecA is essential for protein export, the slow translocation of OmpA observed after SecA was nearly completely depleted was very surprising. OmpA is often used as a model protein forin vitro translocation studies, and its transport into membrane vesicles is strictly dependent on SecA (16Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The relative insensitivity of OmpA export to reduced SecA concentrations suggests that it has an atypical ability to persist in a transport-competent form or that it has a much higher affinity for SecA than most other periplasmic and membrane proteins. In either case, the unexpected behavior of OmpA in these experiments, together with the finding that SecA is required for the transport of a wider range of proteins than previously suspected, suggests that many aspects of SecA function remain to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W1994188231,"Myocardial hypertrophy is associated with increased basal glucose metabolism. Basal glucose transport into cardiac myocytes is mediated by the GLUT1 isoform of glucose transporters, whereas the GLUT4 isoform is responsible for regulatable glucose transport. Treatment of neonatal cardiac myocytes with the hypertrophic agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or phenylephrine increased expression of Glut1 mRNA relative to Glut4 mRNA. To study the transcriptional regulation of GLUT1 expression, myocytes were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of theGlut1 promoter. Stimulation of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or phenylephrine induced transcription from the Glut1 promoter, which was inhibited by cotransfection with the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases CL100 and MKP-3. Cotransfection of the myocytes with constitutively active versions of Ras and MEK1 or an estrogen-inducible version of Raf1 also stimulated transcription from theGlut1 promoter. Hypertrophic induction of theGlut1 promoter was also partially sensitive to inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and was strongly inhibited by cotransfection with dominant-negative Ras. Thus, Ras activation and pathways downstream of Ras mediate induction of theGlut1 promoter during myocardial hypertrophy. Myocardial hypertrophy is associated with increased basal glucose metabolism.

Myocardial cells can use a wide variety of substrates for energy production, including free fatty acids, glucose, lactate, and ketone bodies. Substrate selection by cardiac myocytes is developmentally regulated. During the perinatal period, substrate metabolism shifts from predominant non-oxidative glucose utilization to predominant fatty acid oxidation (1Lopaschuk G.D. Collins-Nakai R.L. Itoi T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This shift is associated with a shift in the expression of several regulatory proteins involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism (2Wang C. Hu S.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Specifically, the ubiquitous glucose transporter GLUT1 is replaced by the insulin-regulated, muscle- and fat-specific isoform GLUT4 (2Wang C. Hu S.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Studelska D.R. Campbell C. Pang S. Rodnick K.J. James D.E. Am. J.

Myocardial hypertrophy is a pathological condition triggered by excess workload or cellular stress and is characterized by a number of phenotypic changes, including activation of immediate/early, fetal, and contractile protein genes, e.g. c-fos, atrial natriuretic factor, and myosin light chain-2. In addition, the hypertrophied heart exhibits a pattern of substrate metabolism similar to that of the fetal/neonatal heart with increased glycolytic flux and reduced fatty acid oxidation (8El Alaoui-Talibi Z. Landormy S. Loireau A. Moravec J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1068-H1074PubMed Google Scholar, 9Allard M.F. Schönekess B.O. Henning S.L. English D.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J.

Such alterations of the metabolic behavior could be explained by a resumption of the fetal expression pattern of proteins involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Two preliminary reports have described increased expression of theGlut1 isoform mRNA in myocardial hypertrophy induced in adult rats by pressure overload (11Weinberg E.O. Thienelt C.D. Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-385Google Scholar) or a large infarct of the left ventricle (12Remondino-Müller A. Rosenblatt-Velin N. Montessuit C. Tardy I. Papageorgiou I. Dorsaz P.-A. Schneider J. Lerch R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29 (abstr.): A85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to treatment with a variety of different agonists, primary cultures of ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal rat hearts display many of the features associated with hypertrophy in vivo and provide a useful model to study this nonproliferative growth response (13Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We have used this model to investigate the regulation of GLUT1 expression in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with a reporter construct encoding luciferase under the control of the Glut1 promoter. The expression of this reporter in response to the hypertrophic agonists 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are:TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PE, phenylephrine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.1The abbreviations used are:TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PE, phenylephrine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. and phenylephrine was assessed, and the signaling pathways responsible for increased expression of GLUT1 were investigated. Primary ventricular myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old rats by collagenase digestion and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (4:1) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (maintenance medium) as described previously (14Thorburn J. McMahon M. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30580-30586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105/3.5-cm dish. For RT-PCR experiments or ERK activation assay, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. For activated Ras assays, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes. Cardiac fibroblasts cultures were prepared by two passages of the cells adherent to the culture dish during the pre-plating procedure. Cells were maintained in maintenance medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection experiments, cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105/3.5-cm dish and grown for 24 h in maintenance medium with FCS before transfection. For activated Ras assays, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and grown in maintenance medium with FCS to subconfluence. Cells for morphological analysis were plated on glass coverslips coated with gelatin and laminin. Cells were treated for 48 h and then fixed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin to show filamentous actin. Cells were pretreated with or without PD98059 for 30 min and then treated with either TPA or phenylephrine for 10 min. Cells were then harvested in 500 μl of Laemmli buffer, and 50 μl of cell lysate were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Total ERKs and doubly phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) ERKs were detected by Western blotting using the K-23 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the E10 monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.), respectively. The plasmid containing 1.4 kilobase pairs of the mouse Glut1 promoter along with enhancer 1 (0.6 kilobase pair) and enhancer 2 (1.3 kilobase pair) was a kind gift from Dr. Takashi Murakami (15Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Glut1 promoter along with enhancers 1 and 2 was subcloned into the pGL3basic multicloning site (Promega) to generate the luciferase reporter plasmid pLuc-GT1/E1/E2. The luciferase reporter was cotransfected with a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (provided by Michael Kapiloff). The estrogen-regulated Raf-1 expression vector (pCEP4-ΔRaf-1:ER) expresses the kinase domain of Raf1 fused to the steroid-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (16Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for the Ras mutants V12Ras (constitutively active) and A15Ras (dominant-negative) were constructed by subcloning a 650-base pair cDNA into an elongation factor 1α-driven plasmid. The expression plasmid for the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-3 was constructed by cloning a 1.4-kilobase pair cDNA that was amplified from a rat cardiac cDNA library into an elongation factor 1α-driven plasmid. CL100 in the expression vector pSG5 was provided by Steve Keyse. The cytomegalovirus-driven ΔN3/S218E/S222D MEK1 construct (17Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Kukasawa K.

Transient transfections of myocytes were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Thorburn J. McMahon M. Thorburn A. J. Biol.

Transfection of fibroblasts was achieved using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the supplier's instruction. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed with reagents from Promega or Tropix Inc., respectively, as described by the manufacturer. To evaluate the relative expression of the endogenous glucose transporter genesGlut1 and Glut4 by RT-PCR, we took advantage of regions of structural similarity and differences between the two isoforms (21Sivitz W.I. Lee E.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2387-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Untreated cells or cells stimulated with 1 μm TPA or 100 μm phenylephrine for 48 h were harvested in 750 μl of TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was used for reverse transcription and subsequent polymerase chain reaction using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system from Boehringer Mannheim. Primers capable of amplifying bothGlut1 and Glut4 cDNAs such that their respective products could be resolved on the basis of a 12-base pair size difference were used (21Sivitz W.I. Lee E.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2387-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PCR products were labeled by adding 0.05 μCi/μl [α-32P]dCTP to the reaction mixture and subsequently resolved by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to storage phosphor screens. Band intensity was determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. Detection of Ras-GTP in cells extract was performed as described (18Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to Western blotting. Blots were probed using a rabbit anti-Ha-Ras polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz sc-520). Fig. 1 shows phalloidin staining of rat neonatal ventricular myocytes treated with either TPA or phenylephrine. As described previously (13Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 22Allo S.N. McDermott P.J. Carl L.L. Morgan H.E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), cells treated with either agonist for 48 h showed a dramatic increase in size, together with increased organization of myofibrils, two hallmarks of hypertrophy of ventricular myocytes. The effect of the hypertrophic agonists TPA and PE on the relative expression of the glucose transporter isoformsGlut1 and Glut4 is shown in Fig.2. Untreated myocytes had aGlut1/Glut4 expression ratio close to 1 (1.2 ± 0.2), typical for neonatal cardiac myocytes (2Wang C. Hu S.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Studelska D.R. Campbell C. Pang S. Rodnick K.J. James D.E. Am. J.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Following 48 h of treatment with either TPA or PE, the ratio ofGlut1/Glut4 mRNAs was markedly increased, to 5.1 ± 1.4 and 3.7 ± 1.7, respectively. This increase was mainly achieved by overexpression of Glut1 and to a minor extent by a decrease in Glut4 expression. To determine whether the increased Glut1mRNA level in response to hypertrophic stimuli was caused by increased transcription from the Glut1 promoter, we performed transient transfection experiments with the pLuc-GT1/E1/E2 construct. As shown in Fig.3 A, both TPA and PE stimulated transcription from the GT1/E1/E2 promoter construct in cardiac myocytes. TPA also induced transcription in cardiac fibroblasts, albeit to a lesser extent, whereas PE did not affect transcription in these cells. Fig. 3 B shows the time course of induction of theGlut1 promoter in cardiac myocytes. Induction by TPA was already detectable after 6 h of treatment and reached a plateau by 12 h, whereas induction by phenylephrine was slower, being detectable after 12 h and reaching a maximum by 48 h only. Therefore, an incubation time of 48 h was selected for subsequent experiments. Stimulation of the MAP kinase pathways plays an important role in the development of hypertrophy of myocardial cells. We therefore assessed the involvement of MAP kinase pathways in the overexpression of Glut1. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 partially inhibited activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in response to either TPA or phenylephrine (Fig.4 A). Treatment with PD98059 did not affect base-line expression of either the Glut1 orGlut4 endogenous gene. However, treatment with PD98059 markedly reduced expression of the Glut1 gene induced by either TPA or phenylephrine, without affecting expression of theGlut4 gene (Fig. 4, B and C). We then assessed the involvement of MAP kinase pathways in the induction of theGlut1 promoter by TPA and phenylephrine. Cotransfection of the cells with the broad specificity MAP kinase phosphatase CL100 significantly reduced induction of the Glut1 promoter by either TPA or phenylephrine (Fig. 4 D). PD98059 also inhibited the response to both hypertrophic agonists, confirming participation of the ERK pathway. In contrast, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 did not affect induction of the Glut1 promoter by TPA or phenylephrine (data not shown). To further confirm involvement of the ERK pathway in Glut1promoter induction, cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing the ERK-specific phosphatase MKP-3 (Fig.5) (27Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As expected, MKP-3 inhibited induction of the Glut1 promoter by both TPA and phenylephrine. We next reasoned that if the ERK pathway was important for induction of the Glut1 promoter, then introduction into cells of constitutively active versions of the proteins of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade should mimic the effect of TPA and phenylephrine and induce the promoter. The results shown in Fig. 6demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active mutant of Ras (V12Ras), an estrogen-inducible version of Raf-1 (ΔRaf-1:ER), or a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 (ΔN3/S218E/S222D MEK1) resulted in increased expression from the Glut1 promoter. Furthermore, expression induced by all of these agonists was inhibited by cotransfection with the broad specificity MAP kinase phosphatase CL100. Ras activation is required for phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy and is sufficient to induce both morphological and genetic markers of hypertrophy (19Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Hines W.A. Thorburn A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Ras was also required for the Glut1 response to TPA and phenylephrine. Fig. 7 A shows that cotransfection of cardiac myocytes with increasing amounts of the dominant-negative Ras mutant A15Ras (31Chen S. Huff S. Lai C. Der C. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar) strongly inhibited induction of the Glut1 promoter by both TPA and phenylephrine. This result suggests that Ras activation is required for transduction of the signal elicited by both TPA and phenylephrine in cardiac myocytes. In contrast, expression of A15Ras in cardiac fibroblasts did not affect the Glut1 promoter induction in response to TPA (Fig.7 B), whereas it markedly blunted induction of theGlut1 promoter by serum (Fig. 7 C). These results suggest that Ras does not participate in signal transduction activated by TPA in cardiac fibroblasts, although it does participate in induction by TPA in cardiac myocytes. To further investigate the difference between cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts regarding the requirement for Ras for TPA-induced GLUT1 expression, we performed Ras-GTP loading assays in both cell types. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment of myocytes with 1 μm TPA or 10% FCS induced GTP loading of Ras. In contrast, TPA was unable to elicit activation of Ras in fibroblasts, although the cells responded to FCS stimulation. Therefore, TPA can induce Ras in muscle cells, but not in fibroblasts, thus explaining the Ras requirement only in muscle cells. In addition to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, GTP loading of Ras can trigger activation of other signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (32Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P. Dhand R. Van Haesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M. Waterfield M. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether activation of the PI3K pathway was required for induction of the Glut1 promoter by hypertrophic agonists. As shown in Fig. 9, the selective PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (33Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduced base-line expression of both the Glut1and Glut4 endogenous genes, but did not affect theGlut1/Glut4 expression ratio in non-hypertrophic cells. However, treatment with LY294002 reduced the increase in theGlut1/Glut4 ratio observed upon treatment with TPA or phenylephrine. In addition, LY294002 slightly, but significantly inhibited induction of the Glut1 promoter by both TPA and phenylephrine (Fig. 9 C). LY294002 did not inhibit induction of the Glut1 promoter by V12Ras. These results suggest that PI3K activation contributes to the induction of the Glut1promoter in response to TPA and phenylephrine and that it acts upstream of Ras. Myocardial hypertrophy is characterized by expression of immediate/early, fetal, and contractile genes. In vivo, hypertrophic hearts have a pattern of substrate metabolism resembling that observed in fetal hearts, with increased reliance on glycolysis for energy production and reduced oxidation of fatty acids (8El Alaoui-Talibi Z.

In this study, we observed that hypertrophy of rat neonatal ventricular myocytes is associated with increased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 isoform mRNA. GLUT1 is the principal isoform expressed in the fetal heart, and its expression is down-regulated following birth in normal myocardium (2Wang C. Hu S.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Studelska D.R. Campbell C. Pang S. Rodnick K.J. James D.E. Am. J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar), concomitantly with the shift from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism (1Lopaschuk G.D. Collins-Nakai R.L. Itoi T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that regulation of Glut1 expression during hypertrophy is primarily achieved at the transcriptional level. Transient transfection experiments with a luciferase reporter under the control of the mouse Glut1 promoter indicated that treatment of myocytes with hypertrophic agonists resulted in increased transcription from the Glut1 promoter occurring between 6 and 48 h following addition of the agonist. The two agonists we used (TPA and phenylephrine) activated the promoter with different kinetics, with TPA acting more rapidly and efficiently than phenylephrine. This is probably related to TPA being a better activator of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases compared with PE (Fig.3 A). The mode of action of these agonists is different. Phenylephrine is an α1-adrenergic agonist whose receptor is coupled to a Gαq-containing heterotrimeric G protein. Activation of Gq-containing heterotrimeric protein in cardiac myocytes leads to Ras activation via the tyrosine kinase/Shc/Grb2/Sos pathway (34Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Ras activation, in turn, can trigger a variety of downstream signaling pathways, including Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (for a review, see Ref. 35Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). TPA belongs to the phorbol ester family, a class of compounds able to directly stimulate the classical and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Stimulation of PKC activity can cause activation of Raf and MAP kinases independently of Ras (36Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, the modes of action of both agonists may converge onto Raf. In some cell types, TPA-induced activation of MAP kinases involves Ras (37Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 38Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halouega S. Brugge J.S.

Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that primary ventricular myocytes fall into this class (see below). GLUT1 is a ubiquitous isoform of the glucose transporter, expressed at a significant level in virtually every tissue of the body. Therefore, it was a potential concern that the effect of TPA, a non-tissue-specific protein kinase C agonist, could be due to increased expression of the Glut1 promoter in contaminating non-myocyte cardiac cells, mainly cardiac fibroblasts. We are confident, however, that this is not the case, for the following reasons. 1) Phenylephrine, which activates common signaling pathways with TPA, but through α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, induced a similar response from the Glut1 promoter in myocyte culture. It failed, however, to induce the Glut1promoter in cultures of non-myocyte cardiac cells, consistent with the presence of the α1-adrenergic receptor on myocytes only (40Stewart A. Rokosh D. Bailey B. Karns L. Chang K. Long C. Kariya K. Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 2) TPA-induced activation of the Glut1 promoter was less in cultures of cardiac fibroblasts than in cultures of myocytes. The converse would be expected if the effect observed in myocytes was due to contaminating fibroblasts, which represent at most only 5% of the cells in myocyte cultures. 3) TPA-induced activation of theGlut1 promoter was almost totally abolished by cotransfection with dominant-negative Ras in myocytes, as was phenylephrine-induced activation of Glut1; it was, however, unaffected in non-myocytes. This observation is corroborated by the finding that TPA treatment resulted in activation of Ras in myocytes, but not in fibroblasts (see below). Activation of the MAP kinase pathways is involved in the process of myocardial hypertrophy. Previous results have shown that Ras or Raf-1 activity is required for expression of the c-fos, atrial natriuretic factor, and myosin light chain-2 promoters in phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy (14Thorburn J. McMahon M. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30580-30586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, active MAP kinase is required for induction of the c-fos and atrial natriuretic factor promoters by phenylephrine (41Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 42Glennon P.E. Kaddoura S. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and expression of constitutively active MEK1 results in overexpression of hypertrophic genes (43Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cowley S. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28092-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for activation of the Glut1 promoter during myocardial hypertrophy. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the ERK kinase MEK1 (44Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar), partially inhibited both overexpression of the endogenous Glut1 mRNA and activation of the Glut1 promoter in response to hypertrophic agonists. Inhibition was only partial, however, as was inhibition of ERK activation, possibly because MEK2, which is much less sensitive to PD98059 than MEK1, is the predominant ERK kinase in cardiac myocytes. Cotransfection of the cells with the MAP kinase phosphatases CL100 (45Keyse S. Emslie E. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and MKP-3 (27Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) also significantly reduced induction of theGlut1 promoter by TPA and phenylephrine. Because of the low transfection efficiency in primary myocytes, it was not possible to assess the effect of transfection with these molecules on expression of endogenous Glut1 mRNA. Although MKP-1, the mouse homologue of CL100, was initially thought to be specific for the ERKs, we have previously shown that, in our cells, CL100 could inhibit MEK kinase-induced JNK activity as well as ERK activity (25Thorburn J. Xu S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further restrict involvement of the MAP kinase pathways to the ERKs, we also used the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-3, which is highly specific for ERK (28Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Together, the results obtained with PD98059, CL100, and MKP-3 suggest that activation of the ERK pathway plays a major role in transducing hypertrophic signals to the Glut1 promoter. Furthermore, transfection of cardiac myocytes with constitutively active or estrogen-inducible mutants of proteins of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade also leads to increased expression from the Glut1promoter. Conversely, cotransfection of the cells with a dominant-negative version of Ras (A15Ras) strongly inhibits induction of the Glut1 promoter by either TPA or phenylephrine, suggesting that activation of Ras is not only sufficient, but also necessary for induction of the Glut1 promoter. The finding that A15Ras strongly inhibits TPA-induced activation was somewhat unexpected in view of the ability of active PKC to stimulate Raf independently of Ras in COS and NIH3T3 cells (36Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, Maraiset al. (39Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) recently showed that TPA activation of ERK required active Ras in COS cells. Furthermore, TPA increased the amount of Ras-GTP in these cells. In our experiments, TPA increased Ras-GTP in myocytes, but not in fibroblasts, a finding consistent with inhibition of the TPA effect by A15Ras in myocytes only. These results therefore suggest that Ras-mediated Raf activation, rather than PKC-mediated Raf phosphorylation, is the main pathway leading to stimulation of ERK activity in myocytes treated with phorbol esters. The reason why TPA activates Ras in myocytes but not in fibroblasts remains unknown, but could be related to expression of different PKC isoforms. We have also shown that PI3K activation is involved, at least in part, in the transduction of the signal from hypertrophic agonists to theGlut1 promoter. The exact position of PI3K in these signal transduction pathways remains somewhat controversial. Although an initial report described PI3K as being a direct target of Ras (32Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P. Dhand R. Van Haesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M. Waterfield M. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar), other studies have suggested that PI3K could act upstream of Ras (46Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The present study does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on this issue. However, the fact that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 does not inhibit induction of Glut1 by V12Ras suggests that PI3K does not act downstream of Ras in this model. Recently, two reports showed that PI3K activity was required for activation of some PKC isoforms, including the TPA-activated isoform nPKCδ (48Le Good J.A. Ziegler W. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 49Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would place PI3K upstream of Ras in cardiac myocytes in which Ras is activated as a result of PKC activation. In addition to the ERK pathway, phenylephrine has been shown to potently activate the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways (50Clerk A. Ashour M. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 51Nemoto S. Sheng Z. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Experiments using the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (52Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E.

Although this study used pharmacological agonists to study the in vitro hypertrophic response of glucose transporters, it has implications for the understanding of glucose metabolism in pathophysiological situations. Physiological agonists that, like phenylephrine, signal through Gαq-coupled receptors and activate ERKs, such as endothelin (54Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H.

Res. 1995; 76: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophyin vivo. In addition, a specific inhibition of Gαq-dependent signaling blocks pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in transgenic mice (57Akhter S. Luttrell L. Rockman H. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R. Koch W. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Other stimuli, such as oxidative stress (58Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) or hypoxia/reoxygenation (59Seko Y. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), that lead to activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway or ischemia/reperfusion leading to translocation and activation of PKC isoforms (60Prasad M.R. Jones R.M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 61Yoshida K. Hirata T. Akita Y. Mizukami Y. Yamaguchi K. Sorimachi Y. Ishihara T. Kawashiama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) could also potentially lead to increased Glut1 transcription. In fact, overexpression of Glut1 has recently been reported in an in vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion (62Tardy I. Montessuit C. Remondino-Müller A. Papageorgiou I. Lerch R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28 (abstr.): A16Google Scholar), a situation in which PKC activation and oxidative stress take place. In conclusion, our data indicate that Glut1 expression in hypertrophied myocytes can be explained primarily through activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Interestingly the signaling pathways that are used in different cell types in the heart to activate the ERK molecules are different.

In this study, the effects of ALLN on the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Aβ were examined in 293 cells expressing APP or the C-terminal 100 amino acids of APP (C100). In cells expressing APP or low levels of C100, ALLN increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion at low concentrations, decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion at high concentrations, and increased cellular levels of C100 in a concentration-dependent manner by inhibiting C100 degradation. Low concentrations of ALLN increased Aβ42 secretion more dramatically than Aβ40 secretion. ALLN treatment of cells expressing high levels of C100 did not alter cellular C100 levels and inhibited Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion with similar IC50 values. These results suggest that C100 can be processed both by γ-secretase and by a degradation pathway that is inhibited by low concentrations of ALLN. The data are consistent with inhibition of γ-secretase by high concentrations of ALLN but do not support previous assertions that ALLN is a selective inhibitor of the γ-secretase producing Aβ40.

Aβ is produced by proteolysis of a single transmembrane domain protein known as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (reviewed in Refs. 1Selkoe D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar and 2Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The first step in Aβ production involves the cleavage of APP by an uncharacterized protease termed β-secretase. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase produces a large ectodomain protein known as APPsβ, which is ultimately secreted, and a C-terminal 14-kDa membrane-bound fragment known as C100 (also termed C99 in some references). C100 is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase, another uncharacterized protease that cleaves within the transmembrane domain of C100 and produces the 39–43-amino acid Aβ peptides. Aβ40 is the dominant species of Aβ secreted from cultured cells and is also more abundant in cerebrospinal fluid of normal and AD patients. Aβ42, which comprises about 5–10% of total Aβ secreted from cultured cells, is more amyloidogenic and is the major species of Aβ that is deposited at the early stage of senile plaques formation. Familial AD has thus far been associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (2Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Collectively, these data suggest that excessive Aβ42 production is critical for the development of AD. Whereas the locations of mutations in the APP gene suggest that the mutations lead to increased Aβ42 production by increasing cleavage of APP by β- or γ-secretase, the mechanism by which presenilin mutations increase Aβ42 production remains unclear. Primary neuronal cultures derived from PS1 knock-out mice exhibit marked reduction of Aβ secretion (7De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), suggesting an essential role of PS1 in generating Aβ. Understanding the cellular mechanisms that regulate Aβ production will be a key step to unraveling the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ production can also be modulated by peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors such as N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN, also known as calpain inhibitor I or LLnL) (5Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G.

Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but at high concentrations it can also inhibit proteasome-associated activities (13Viniski A. Michaud C. Powers J. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ALLN inhibits Aβ40 production at concentrations that have little effect on or even increase Aβ42 production (5Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G. Biere A. Seubert P. Selkoe D.

These data are interpreted as evidence suggesting that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are produced by distinct γ-secretases. In contrast, a recent study demonstrates that ALLN increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 production at low concentrations and decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 production at higher concentrations (10Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the reported effects of ALLN on Aβ production are conflicting, and the mechanism(s) by which ALLN modulates Aβ production are not clear. Nevertheless, ALLN may serve as an important tool to investigate the regulation of Aβ biosynthesis. In this study, the effects of ALLN on Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion are examined in detail and the mechanism by which ALLN modulates Aβ secretion is further defined. The data provide the novel insights that substrate availability plays a major role in regulating Aβ40 and Aβ42 production by γ-secretase. Antibodies W02, G2-10, and G2-11 were obtained from Dr. Konrad Beyreuther (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). W02 recognizes an epitope at amino acids 5–8 of the Aβ peptide, and G2-10 and G2-11 specifically recognize the C terminus of Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively (14Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J.

Antibody 54 was obtained from Dr. Barry Greenberg (Cephalon, Inc., West Chester, PA) and recognizes the secreted APP ectoprotein formed after β-secretase cleavage (APPsβ) (15Savage M.J. Trusko S.P.

Antibody 14, which recognizes an N-terminal domain of PS1(16), was obtained from Dr. Samuel Gandy (Cornell University, New York). N-Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All tissue culture reagents used in this work were from Life Technologies, Inc. A human APP695 cDNA clone with the Swedish mutation (APPsw) and a cDNA encoding the the C-terminal 99 amino acids of APP plus an N-terminal methionine (hereafter referred to as C100) were obtained from Dr. Barry Greenberg. C100 was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The SPC100 construct consists of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of APP appended to the N terminus of C99 as described by others (17Dykes T. Dykes E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To prepare the SPC100 construct, residues 19–596 of the APP695 cDNA were deleted by using the Seamless Cloning Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting SPC100 construct was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The APP London mutation (18Suzuki N. Cheung T. Cai X. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T. Younkin S. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar) was introduced into C100 and SPC100 constructs using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The human cDNAs encoding wild type PS1 and mutant PS1 with the exon 9 deletion (PS1ΔE9) (19Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Wu C. Levesque G. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Ikeda M. Holman K. Lin C.

PS1ΔE9 sometimes is referred to as exon 10 deletion (20Clark R.F. The Alzheimer's Disease Collaboration Group Nat.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient expression of C100 and SPC100, 293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates, and transfection was conducted 2 days later when the cells reached 60–70% confluence. Cells were transfected by means of LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare 293 cells stably expressing APPsw, 293 cells were transfected as described above. About 24 h after transfection, cells were passed to media containing 0.4 mg/ml G418, and G418-resistant clones were analyzed for Aβ secretion by ELISA (see below). Clones secreting high levels of Aβ were expanded and maintained in media supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml G418. APPsw cells and cells transiently expressing C100 or SPC100 were treated with various concentrations of ALLN for 16 h. The conditioned media were then collected, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and stored at −20 °C prior to ELISA and Western blot analysis. The cell monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and stored frozen at −20 °C prior to Western blot analysis. APPsβ was detected in conditioned media by Western blot analysis with antibody 54. C100 and SPC100 were identified in cell lysates with antibody W02. Visualization was performed with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Sandwich ELISA assays were developed to measure Aβ40 and Aβ42 using the combination of antibodies G2-10/W02 and G2-11/W02, respectively. Both antibody G2-10 and G2-11 are more than 100-fold selective for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively (14Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and the sensitivity of these assays are about 50–100 pg/ml. Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorb immunoassay plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.4 μg/well G2-10 in 100 mmNaHCO3 (pH 9.5) or with 1 μg/well G2-11 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the antibody solution was removed, and the wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (TBS). The wells were then washed with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) and were stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months. Conditioned media were diluted with 10% bovine serum albumin in TBS to yield a final concentration of 2% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μl of diluted media was added to each well along with 40 ng/well biotinylated W02. Biotinylation of W02 was performed with the EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plate was incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking either overnight (for Aβ40 measurement) or for at least 24 h (for Aβ42 measurement). The plate was then washed five times with TTBS, and 100 μl of 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Pierce) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The color was developed with the TMB-H2O2 system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and absorption at 450 nm was measured on a plate reader. 293 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected with C100 as described above. About 40 h after transfection, cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM medium for 1 h and were then labeled for 1 h with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The cells were subsequently washed and either kept frozen at −20 °C (pulse) or incubated with fresh complete DMEM (chase) in the absence and presence of 25 μm ALLN. The chase media and cell monolayers were collected at different time points and kept frozen until further analysis. C100 and Aβ peptide were immunoprecipitated with antibody W02 from radiolabeled cells and chased media, respectively. The cells were solubilized with 0.6 ml/dish of 1× RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), and 0.5 ml of cell lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation assay with 3 μg of antibody W02. For immunoprecipitation of Aβ from chased media, 0.2 ml of 5× RIPA was added to 1 ml of media together with 3 μg of antibody W02. Forty microliters of Protein G plus Protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) was added to each immunoprecipitation reaction, and the mixtures were rocked overnight at 4 °C before being centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 2 min. The pellets were then washed twice with 1× RIPA buffer and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The immunocomplexes were denatured in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before being processed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. In addition to full-length APP with the Swedish mutation, two truncated APP constructs were used in this study to examine the processing of APP by γ-secretase (see Fig.1 A). The construct designated as C100 consists of the methionine initiation codon plus the C-terminal 99 amino acids of APP. The N terminus of C100 corresponds to the β-secretase cleavage site, i.e. the N terminus of the Aβ peptide. The construct designated SPC100 consists of the methionine initiation codon, the 16 amino acid signal peptide of APP, and the first two amino acids of APP appended to the N terminus of C100. C100 and SPC100 are similar to the constructs previously reported by Dykeset al. (17Dykes T. Dykes E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that the expression vector pcDNA3.1 was used instead of pCEP4. Western blot analysis of extracts from 293 cells transiently expressing SPC100 detected a 14-kDa band that co-migrated with native C100 (Fig. 1 B). These data confirm that the signal peptide of SPC100 was removed. As reported previously (21Dykes T. Dykes E. Monning U. urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the level of expression of C100 was much higher in cells transiently expressing SPC100 than in cells transiently expressing C100 (Fig. 1 B). 293 cells transiently expressing SPC100 secreted 2–3-fold more Aβ40 and Aβ42 than cells transiently expressing C100 (Fig. 1, Cand D), consistent with a previous report (21Dykes T. Dykes E. Monning U. urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The increased Aβ secretion from cells expressing SPC100 relative to cells expressing C100 is probably due to the higher level of C100 in these cells (Fig. 1 B). Despite the quantitative differences in Aβ secretion from cells expressing C100 and SPC100, the relative amounts of Aβ42 and Aβ40 secreted by cells expressing the two constructs (i.e. the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratios) were similar (Fig. 2 A). The effects of APP and PS1 FAD mutations on Aβ secretion from cells expressing C100 and SPC100 were also tested. As reported previously (16Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), extracts from 293 cells expressing wild type PS1 displayed a 48-kDa product corresponding to full-length PS1 as well as a 33-kDa N-terminal fragment of PS1 (Fig.2 B). Extracts from 293 cells expressing the PS1 mutant PS1ΔE9 displayed a full-length PS1 protein with slightly greater mobility than that of full-length wild type PS1 due to the deletion of exon 9 in this mutant (Fig. 2 B). The 33-kDa N-terminal fragment of PS1, which is derived primarily from endogenous PS1, was not increased significantly by overexpression of PS1wt or PS1ΔE9. As previously reported for full-length APP (4Borchelt D. Thinakaran G. Eckman C. Lee M. Davenport F. Ratovitsky T. Prada C. Kim G. Seekins S. Yager D. Slunt H. Wang R. Seeger M. Levey A. Gandy S. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Price D. Younkin S. Sisodia S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), the secretion of Aβ42 from cells expressing either C100 or SPC100 was selectively increased by co-expression of PS1ΔE9 or by introduction of the London mutation into C100 or SPC100 (Fig. 2 A). Co-expression of PS1ΔE9 did not alter Aβ40 secretion from cells expressing either C100 or SPC100, nor did co-expression of wild type PS1 affect Aβ secretion from cells expressing either construct (data not shown). Co-expression of wild type PS1 or PS1ΔE9 did not affect the levels of C100 protein in cells expressing either C100, SPC100, C100-London, or SPC100-London (Fig.2 C and data not shown). Thus, γ-secretase processing of C100 derived from either the C100 or SPC100 constructs is qualitatively similar as evidenced by the similar relative secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (i.e. the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio) and the similar effect of APP and PS1 FAD mutations on Aβ secretion. ALLN and related peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors have multiple effects on APP processing. In addition to modulating Aβ production, it has been observed that these inhibitors can also potentiate the α-secretase pathway and enhance the secretion of APPsα (5Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G. Biere A. Seubert P. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The altered α-secretase processing may indirectly affect the β-secretase pathway as the two proteases compete for a common substrate. Consequently, the effect of ALLN on Aβ production in cells expressing APP is complex, and it is very difficult to distinguish the specific action of ALLN on the γ-secretase cleavage step. Since C100 is the product of β-secretase cleavage and is the native substrate for γ-secretase (1Selkoe D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), Aβ production by cells expressing C100 or SPC100 reflects only γ-secretase processing. We therefore utilized cells expressing C100 and SPC100 to study the effect of ALLN on the γ-secretase cleavage reaction without the influence of this inhibitor on α- and β-secretase processing. In cells expressing C100 or APPsw, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretions were increased by treatment with low concentrations of ALLN and decreased by treatment with high concentrations of ALLN (Fig. 3,A and C). Aβ42 secretion from cells expressing C100 or APPsw was increased much more dramatically by low concentrations of ALLN than was Aβ40 secretion (Fig. 3, Aand C). In contrast, ALLN had only concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion from cells expressing SPC100 (Fig.3 B). Examination of cell lysates revealed that ALLN increased the cellular level of C100 in a concentration-dependent manner in cells expressing C100 and APPsw, whereas it did not affect C100 protein levels in cells expressing SPC100 (Figs.4 and5 A). The ALLN-induced increase in C100 in APPsw cells was not due to increased β-secretase activity since ALLN did not potentiate the secretion of APPsβ from these cells (Fig. 5 B). The increase in C100 protein level induced by ALLN in cells expressing C100 or APPsw was not a result of inhibition of γ-secretase since concentrations of ALLN that increased cellular C100 protein levels also increased both Aβ40 and Aβ42 production. In addition, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that at concentrations of ALLN that increased Aβ production (data not shown), this compound decreased the rate of C100 turnover in cells expressing C100 (Fig. 6), suggesting that ALLN increases C100 protein levels by inhibiting C100 degradation.Figure 5Regulation of APP processing by ALLN in cells expressing APPsw. 293 cells expressing APPsw were incubated overnight with ALLN at the indicated concentrations.

Diehl T. Gordon G. Biere A. Seubert P. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,9Klafki H.-W. Abramowski D. Swoboda R. Paganetti P.A. Staufenbiel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28655-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These data were interpreted as indicating that distinct γ-secretases are responsible for Aβ40 and Aβ42 production. Although these data are intriguing, a recent study suggests that the effects of ALLN on Aβ secretion from cells expressing APP are complex (10Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms by which ALLN modulates Aβ production and, by inference, γ-secretase activity, this study examined the effects of ALLN on Aβ production in more detail. The γ-secretase reaction was studied in 293 cells expressing either APPsw or various amounts of C100, the C-terminal fragment of APP that represents the immediate substrate of this enzyme. C100 was produced in 293 cells by expression of two constructs designated as C100 and SPC100 (Fig. 1). As reported previously, much higher levels of C100 were produced in cells expressing SPC100 than in cells producing C100 (21Dykes T. Dykes E. Monning U. urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), presumably because the signal peptide present in SPC100 permits more efficient processing or sorting of the protein. The characteristics of Aβ production in cells expressing APPsw, C100 or SPC100 cells were similar. The relative amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted by cells expressing C100 or SPC100 were similar as reflected by the similar Aβ42:Aβ40 ratios, and like the APP expression cells (4Borchelt D. Thinakaran G. Eckman C. Lee M. Davenport F. Ratovitsky T. Prada C. Kim G. Seekins S. Yager D. Slunt H. Wang R. Seeger M. Levey A. Gandy S. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Price D. Younkin S. Sisodia S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki N. Cheung T. Cai X. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T. Younkin S. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar), the secretion of Aβ42 was specifically increased by co-expression of mutant PS1 or by introduction of the London mutation into the constructs (Fig. 2). These observations argue that the same γ-secretase(s) is(are) responsible for Aβ production in cells expressing all three constructs. Treatment of cells expressing C100 or APPsw with low concentrations of ALLN resulted in increased secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 3,A and D), which is consistent with results reported by others (10Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of cells expressing either C100 or APPsw with low concentrations of ALLN also increased cellular C100 protein accumulation (Figs. 4 and 5 A). Pulse-chase experiments in cells expressing C100 demonstrated that a low concentration of ALLN decreased the rate of C100 turnover (Fig. 6), whereas Aβ secretion was increased during the same period (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that low concentrations of ALLN increase Aβ production by inhibiting C100 turnover and, hence, increasing the amount of C100 substrate available for γ-secretase cleavage (Fig. 7). This suggestion is supported by the observation that ALLN did not affect cellular C100 levels in cells expressing SPC100 and correspondingly did not increase Aβ secretion from these cells at any concentration. One implication of these results is that in addition to cleavage by γ-secretase, C100 is normally degraded by a distinct ALLN-sensitive pathway (Fig. 7). Channeling of C100 into this alternative, ALLN-sensitive degradation pathway would prevent Aβ production (Fig. 7). The fact that ALLN did not increase cellular C100 levels in cells expressing SPC100 may be due to the fact that the ALLN-sensitive degradation pathways is overwhelmed by the much higher levels of cellular levels of C100 present in these cells. Low concentrations of ALLN also increase Aβ secretion from primary hippocampal cultures where only endogenous APP is expressed, 2P. Fraser and L. Zhang, unpublished data. suggesting that the ALLN-sensitive degradation of this APP intermediate represents a normal metabolic process and is not merely an artifact of overexpressing C100 in cultured cells. The presence of an ALLN-sensitive catabolic pathway for C100 may provide a mechanism by which cells regulate substrate availability for γ-secretase and thus regulate cellular Aβ production. In this regard, the regulation of C100 metabolism may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. An alternative mechanism has been proposed to explain the ability of ALLN to increase Aβ secretion (22Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several protease inhibitors, including ALLN, are known to prevent the proteasome-mediated degradation of PS1 (22Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fraser P.E. Levesque G. Yu G. Mills L.R. Thirlwell J. Frantseva M. Gandy S.E. Seeger M. Carlen P.L. St. George-Hyslop P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on this observation and the fact that presenilin mutations are associated with increases in Aβ42 secretion, it has been suggested that the stabilization of presenilins by protease inhibitors like ALLN may directly potentiate Aβ42 production in cells (22Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data do not support this model for two reasons. First, the effects of ALLN and PS1 mutations are additive,i.e. low concentrations ALLN further increase the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio in cells expressing mutant PS1 (22Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3L. Zhang and L. Song, unpublished data. Second, the fact that Aβ42 production in cells expressing SPC100 can be increased by co-expression of a mutant PS1 (Fig. 2 A), but not by ALLN (Fig. 3 B), provides additional evidence that PS1 mutations and ALLN regulate Aβ42 production by independent mechanisms. High concentrations of ALLN inhibited Aβ40 and Aβ42 production by cells expressing either APPsw or C100. High concentrations of ALLN may directly inhibit γ-secretase and, hence, decrease Aβ production, but other effects of ALLN on cellular metabolism could also be responsible for this effect. In cells expressing SPC100, which gives rise to much higher cellular C100 levels than in cells expressing APPsw or C100, ALLN inhibited Aβ40 and Aβ42 production at all concentrations and the IC50 values of ALLN for inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 production were very similar. This observation does not support the conclusion that ALLN selectively inhibits Aβ40 production (5Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G. Biere A. Seubert P. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Klafki H.-W. Abramowski D. Swoboda R. Paganetti P.A. Staufenbiel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28655-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a finding that was interpreted as implying the existence of distinct γ-secretases responsible for Aβ40 and Aβ42 production. Since ALLN modulates Aβ production by multiple mechanisms, as documented in this study and Ref. 10Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, it is difficult to use this compound to pharmacologically distinguish multiple γ-secretases. Whereas low concentrations of ALLN and other calpain/proteasome inhibitors increase Aβ40 and Aβ42 production, the increase in Aβ42 production induced by these protease inhibitors is much more pronounced (Ref. 10Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Fig. 3, A and D). Although a definitive explanation for this phenomenon cannot be discerned from the existing data, a reasonable model can be proposed. As discussed above and illustrated in the model diagrammed in Fig. 7, ALLN increases Aβ production by increasing the availability of the γ-secretase substrate C100. Since ALLN increases Aβ42 secretion more dramatically than Aβ40 secretion, this model implies that the γ-secretase cleavage reaction producing Aβ42 is more dependent on substrate concentration than the reaction producing Aβ40. In other words, the γ-secretase that cleaves C100 to produce Aβ42 has a higherK m for the substrate C100 than the γ-secretase that cleaves C100 to produce Aβ40. Thus, the ALLN-induced increase in the cellular concentration of the γ-secretase substrate C100 will increase Aβ42 secretion more than Aβ40 secretion. The fact that Aβ40 secretion was only slightly increased by ALLN would suggest that the γ-secretase that produces Aβ40 is nearly saturated with C100 under the conditions used in these experiments. This model would explain why Aβ40 is the dominant Aβ species produced during normal physiologic processing of APP. It should be pointed out that this model and the experimental data that support it do not necessarily require the existence of two distinct γ-secretase enzymes that independently produce Aβ40 and Aβ42. The major weakness of this model is the observation that the higher cellular levels of C100 seen in cells expressing SPC100 relative to cells expressing C100 is associated with similar increases in Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion rather than a more selective increase in Aβ42 secretion as would be predicted by the model. It is possible that the model is fundamentally correct but that increasing cellular C100 levels by expressing SPC100 rather than C100 is somehow biochemically or mechanistically different from increasing cellular C100 levels with ALLN. In any case, the hypothesis that substrate concentration is a more important determinant of Aβ42 production than Aβ40 production provides a novel framework for further experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms regulating Aβ production.

We also wanted to identify transcription factors that may be functioning in conjunction with NF-κB (subunits p50 and p65) to drive iNOS transcription. Deletion analysis of the iNOS promoter/enhancer revealed that an AT-rich sequence (−61 to −54) downstream of the NF-κB site (−85 to −76) in the 5′-flanking sequence was important for iNOS induction by interleukin-1β and endotoxin in vascular smooth muscle cells. This AT-rich sequence, corresponding to an octamer (Oct) binding site, bound the architectural transcription factor high mobility group (HMG)-I(Y) protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that HMG-I(Y) and NF-κB subunit p50 bound to the iNOS promoter/enhancer to form a ternary complex. The formation of this complex required HMG-I(Y) binding at the Oct site. The location of an HMG-I(Y) binding site typically overlaps that of a recruited transcription factor. In the iNOS promoter/enhancer, however, HMG-I(Y) formed a complex with p50 while binding downstream of the NF-κB site. Furthermore, overexpression of HMG-I(Y) potentiated iNOS promoter/enhancer activity by p50 and p65 in transfection experiments, suggesting that HMG-I(Y) contributes to the transactivation of iNOS by NF-κB. Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical gas whose production is catalyzed by the enzyme NO synthase, participates in the regulation of multiple organ systems.

The high output pathway of NO production is catalyzed byNOS2, a transcriptionally regulated gene that is induced after immunologic or inflammatory stimuli. We refer to this inducible NOS2 isoform as iNOS. Although iNOS was originally identified and characterized in macrophages (6Xie Q.-w. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A.

Much of the initial evaluation of the mouse iNOS gene focused on its transcriptional regulation in macrophages after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-γ stimulation (12Xie Q.-w. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 13Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc.

Dissection of the iNOS promoter/enhancer revealed that a downstream nuclear factor (NF)-κB site (−85 to −76, NF-κBd) is critical for activation of iNOS by LPS in macrophages. In the presence of LPS, c-Rel or Rel A (p65) binds with p50 to form heterodimers on the iNOS promoter/enhancer, in conjunction with additional unidentified proteins (14Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that a more upstream region of the iNOS promoter/enhancer (−951 to −911) is responsible for the synergistic induction of iNOS by IFN-γ and LPS. IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 binding to an IRF binding site (IRF-E) (15Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. J. Exp.

We have shown that the downstream NF-κBd site (−85 to −76) is important for proinflammatory cytokine induction of the iNOS promoter/enhancer in vascular smooth muscle cells (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, elements other than this NF-κBd site in the downstream portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (−234 to +31) also appear to be crucial for full activation of iNOS (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We designed the present study to further elucidate the important regulatory elements in region −234 to +31 responsible for iNOS induction in vascular smooth muscle cells by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Goldring and colleagues (21Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Jeannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated by in vivofootprint analysis in macrophages that, in addition to the NF-κB sites, nuclear protein binding occurred after LPS stimulation at NF-IL6 (−150 to −142) and octamer (Oct) (−61 to −54) sites of the iNOS promoter/enhancer (21Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Jeannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Their report revealed potential binding sites in region −234 to +31 of the iNOS promoter/enhancer but lacked a detailed functional analysis of these sites. Until our present study, the functional importance of these sites in vascular smooth muscle cells had not been elucidated. Furthermore, there had been no identification of nuclear proteins (binding in the downstream region of the iNOS promoter/enhancer) that facilitate iNOS transactivation by NF-κB. Nuclear proteins that interact with members of the NF-κB family include the nonhistone chromosomal proteins of the high mobility group (HMG)-I(Y) family (22Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) proteins play a role in the transcriptional regulation of certain mammalian genes whose promoter/enhancer regions contain AT-rich sequences (22Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 24Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) refers to two proteins, HMG-I and HMG-Y, that are alternatively spliced products of the same gene (25Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) binds to AT-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA (26Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is known to bind Oct sequence motifs (27Eckner R. Birnstiel M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) facilitates the assembly of functional nucleoprotein complexes (enhanceosomes) by modifying DNA conformation and by recruiting nuclear proteins to an enhancer (28Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar,29Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The role of HMG-I(Y) in enhanceosome assembly has been studied extensively in the IFN-β gene after viral stimulation (28Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Thanos D. Maniatis T.

HMG-I(Y) has been shown to enhance the binding of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and activating transcription factor-2, to their binding sites by DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions (28Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Because of the aforementioned properties of HMG-I(Y), we determined whether this protein bound to the iNOS promoter/enhancer and interacted with NF-κB subunits to regulate iNOS gene transcription. We also determined whether the site of HMG-I(Y) binding overlapped a binding site for NF-κB (as occurs with IFN-β), or if HMG-I(Y) bound at a site different from NF-κB. Salmonella typhosa LPS (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and stored at −20 °C. Recombinant human IL-1β (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA) was stored at −80 °C until use. Recombinant human NF-κB subunit p50 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was also stored at −80 °C until use. A goat polyclonal antibody to p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for supershift experiments. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (34Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (Sigma) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. RASMC were passaged every 4–5 days, and experiments were performed on cells 4–6 passages from primary culture. Rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383 (35Helmke R.J. Boyd R.L. German V.F. Mangos J.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1987; 23: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Drosophila SL2 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) (36Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained at 23 °C in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 12% heat-inactivated FBS and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Plasmid pGL2-Basic contained the firefly luciferase gene without any promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). Reporter constructs containing fragments of the mouse iNOS 5′-flanking sequence were named according to the location of the fragment from the transcription start site in the 5′ and 3′ directions. A 1516-base pair (bp) fragment amplified from mouse genomic DNA, containing 1485 bp of the 5′-flanking region and the first 31 bp after the transcription start site, was named iNOS(−1485/+31), as described (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A shorter fragment, iNOS(−234/+31), was generated by polymerase chain reaction from iNOS(−1485/+31) as described (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The downstream NF-κBd site was mutated (−85 to −83, GGG to CTC) in the −1485 to +31 fragment by using a site-directed mutagenesis technique (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and this construct was named iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm). To localize binding elements other than NF-κBd that may be important for IL-1β or LPS induction of iNOS, we used iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm) as a template to generate a series of truncated iNOS 5′-flanking fragments by polymerase chain reaction. Constructs containing these 5′-deletion fragments were named iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm), iNOS(−208/+31 NF-κBm), iNOS(−141/+31 NF-κBm), iNOS(−97/+31 NF-κBm), and iNOS(−69/+31). We also used iNOS(−1485/+31) or iNOS(−1485/+31 NF-κBm) as a template to mutate the downstream Oct site (−61 to −54, ATGCAAAA to CGTACCCC) by a site-directed technique (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C.

The new constructs were named iNOS(−331/+31 OCTm) and iNOS(−331/+31 NF/OCTm). All constructs were inserted into pGL2-Basic and sequenced by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method (37Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) to confirm the insert's orientation and sequence. Plasmid pOPRSVI-CAT contained the prokaryotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) driven by a Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter. Plasmid pPAC was described elsewhere (29Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 38Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). NF-κB subunit p50 and p65 expression constructs were made by inserting cDNAs coding for the subunits into the BamHI site of pPAC (39Krasnow M.A. Saffman E.E. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Expression vectors phsp82LacZ and pPACHMGI were described elsewhere (29Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). RASMC were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, 500,000 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). Then iNOS luciferase constructs and pOPRSVI-CAT (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) were added (5 μg each) to the RASMC in a solution containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. RASMC were subsequently shocked with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide solution for 1 min and then allowed to recover in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Twelve hours after transfection, RASMC were placed in 2% FBS. RASMC were then stimulated with vehicle, human recombinant IL-1β (10 ng/ml), or LPS (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. The doses of IL-1β and LPS, and the duration of stimulation, were chosen on the basis of pilot experiments (data not shown). Rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) were also transfected by the same DEAE-dextran method (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with the exception that they were treated in a floating suspension (the RASMC were attached to culture dishes). Twelve hours after transfection, the macrophages were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. In both the RASMC and macrophage transfection experiments, cell extracts were prepared by detergent lysis (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (EG&G, Gaithersburg, MD) and the Promega luciferase assay system. To evaluate the efficiency of transfection, we performed a CAT assay by a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method as described (40Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase to CAT activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. SL2 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method according to Di Nocera and Dawid (42Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In brief, SL2 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes (Costar Corp, Cambridge, MA) 24 h before transfection. Transfection was then performed in six separate wells for each condition. iNOS plasmids were added at 1 μg/well. Plasmids p50-pPAC, p65-pPAC, and phsp82LacZ were added at 100 ng/well. Plasmid pPACHMGI was added at 1 μg/well, alone or in combination with p50-pPAC or p65-pPAC (or both). The expression plasmid doses were chosen on the basis of pilot experiments (data not shown). Forty-eight hours after the initial transfection, extracts from the SL2 cells were prepared and luciferase activity was measured as described for RASMC. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described elsewhere (43Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. The prokaryotic expression plasmid for mouse HMG-I(Y), pRSETHMG-I(Y), was prepared as described (44Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRSETHMG-I(Y) (containing the HMG-I(Y) protein, a vector-derived polyhistidine tag, and an enterokinase cleavage site) was transferred into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression was induced in culture (mid-log phase) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Three hours after induction of expression, the bacteria were lysed and HMG-I(Y) was purified by cobalt affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Proteins were renatured by dialysis overnight against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 20 mmKCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The dialysate was stored at −80 °C until use. EMSA were performed with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes encoding region −87 to −52 of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (TGGGGACTCTCCCTTTGGGAACAGTTATGCAAAATA). Probes were also generated with mutations in the −85 to −76 NF-κBd site (TGCTCCAGAGGGCTTTGGGAACAGTTATGCAAAATA) and the −61 to −54 Oct site (TGGGGACTCTCCCTTTGGGAACAGTTCGTACCCCTA). Prior to annealing, polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to label the oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP. A typical binding reaction contained 20,000 cpm DNA probe, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 500 ng of poly(dG-dC·dG-dC), and recombinant HMG-I(Y) and/or p50 protein in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixture was allowed to incubate for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were then fractionated on a 5% native polyacrylamide electrophoretic gel in a 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA recirculating buffer system at 4 °C. Data from the SL2 cell transfection experiments were subjected to analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. We have demonstrated elsewhere that the IL-1β-responsive elements in iNOS reside between bp −234 and +31 of the 5′-flanking sequence (20Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our previous data also suggested that elements other than NF-κBd in this downstream region contributed to activation of the iNOS promoter/enhancer by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells. To reveal these other IL-1β-responsive elements in the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence, we generated deletion constructs containing a mutated NF-κBd site. This approach ensured that any induction of iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after transfection of the constructs into vascular smooth muscle cells would not be the result of nuclear protein binding to the NF-κBd site. Beyond a decrease in iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after mutation of the NF-κBd site (Fig. 1), no further reduction in IL-1β responsiveness occurred, even after the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence had been reduced to a construct containing bases −69 to +31 of the downstream promoter. Other than the TATA box, an AT-rich Oct site (−61 to −54) remained in this portion of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated constructs of the downstream iNOS 5′-flanking sequence that contained no mutations (iNOS(−234/+31)), a mutation at the NF-κBd site (iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm)), a mutation at the Oct site (iNOS(−331/+31 OCTm)), or mutations at both sites (iNOS(−331/+31 NF/OCTm)). These constructs were transfected into RASMC and stimulated with vehicle or IL-1β. Mutation of the NF-κBd site produced a 69% reduction in iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after stimulation with IL-1β (Fig. 2). Furthermore, mutation of the Oct site led to an even greater reduction (90%) in iNOS activity after IL-1β stimulation. Mutating both sites did not cause iNOS promoter/enhancer activity to fall below the level obtained by mutating the Oct site alone. Taken together, the data in Fig. 2 suggest that the Oct binding site (−61 to −54) is critical for induction of iNOS promoter/enhancer activity by IL-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells. The absence of a further reduction in iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after mutation of both sites suggests that there may be an interaction between nuclear proteins that bind at the Oct site and nuclear proteins that bind at the NF-κBd site. There were no significant differences in promoter/enhancer activity among iNOS constructs that received vehicle alone. To determine if this Oct site was important for iNOS induction by inflammatory stimuli other than IL-1β, we transfected constructs iNOS(−234/+31), iNOS(−331/+31 NF-κBm), iNOS(−331/+31 OCTm), and iNOS(−331/+31 NF/OCTm) into RASMC and stimulated the cells with LPS. LPS and IL-1β had an almost identical effect on iNOS promoter/enhancer activity. Mutation of the NF-κBd site caused a significant reduction (72%) in iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after LPS stimulation; activity was reduced even further (87%) in the construct containing a mutated Oct site (Fig.3 A). Again, activity after mutation of both sites was not different from activity after mutation of the Oct site alone. We also transfected these constructs into alveolar macrophages and stimulated the cells with LPS. In comparison with iNOS promoter/enhancer activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, mutation of the NF-κBd site produced a more dramatic reduction in macrophages (85%) after LPS stimulation (Fig.3 B). Mutation of the Oct site again caused a dramatic reduction (92%) in iNOS promoter/enhancer activity after LPS stimulation. These experiments demonstrate that binding of nuclear proteins at the downstream Oct site is important for activation of the iNOS promoter/enhancer in both vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, and that this site is important for iNOS activation after stimulation with two mediators of inflammation, IL-1β and LPS. To determine if HMG-I(Y) could bind to the iNOS promoter/enhancer region containing the NF-κBd and Oct sites, we performed EMSA with a radiolabeled probe encoding region −87 to −52 of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence. Incubation of recombinant HMG-I(Y) with the probe containing intact NF-κBd and Oct sites resulted in a DNA-protein complex (Fig.4 A). This complex was specific because a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled identical oligonucleotide, but not unrelated oligonucleotide, competed for HMG-I(Y) binding and abolished the DNA-protein complex. To localize the site of HMG-I(Y) binding, we incubated recombinant HMG-I(Y) with a radiolabeled probe containing intact NF-κBd and Oct sites, a mutated NF-κBd site, or a mutated Oct site. Like the wild-type probe containing intact binding sites, the probe containing a mutated NF-κBd site was able to bind to HMG-I(Y) (Fig.4 B). Mutation of the AT-rich Oct site, however, resulted in a marked reduction in HMG-I(Y) binding. In addition, a probe containing a mutated region between the NF-κBd and Oct sites did not disrupt HMG-I(Y) binding (data not shown). These data suggest that binding of HMG-I(Y) within region −87 to −52 of the iNOS promoter/enhancer occurs at the Oct binding site. EMSA were performed with a radiolabeled probe encoding region −87 to −52 of the iNOS 5′-flanking sequence (containing intact NF-κBd and Oct sites) and recombinant p50 (an important DNA binding subunit of NF-κB; Re"
https://openalex.org/W2071448910,"We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1beta, synergistically enhance the expression of type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) in human dermal fibroblasts in culture (Mauviel et al., 1994). Recently, we identified a SMAD-containing complex, rapidly induced by TGF-beta and binding the region [-496/-444] of the COL7A1 promoter, responsible for COL7A1 gene transactivation (Vindevoghel et al., 1998a). In this report, we demonstrate that TGF-beta and TNF-alpha response elements are distinct entities within the COL7A1 promoter. In particular, we demonstrate that the TNF-alpha effect is mediated by NF-kappaB1/RelA (p50/p65) and RelA/RelA (p65/p65) NF-kappaB complexes binding the TNF-alpha response element (TaRE) located in the region [-252/-230], with RelA acting as the transcriptional activator. Finally, we provide definitive evidence for the role of both TGF-beta and TNF-alpha response elements as enhancer sequences, functioning in the context of a heterologous promoter in an additive manner in response to TGF-beta and TNF-alpha. This study provides the first identification of a functional interaction between the two immediate-early transcription factors, SMAD and NF-kappaB, to activate the expression of an extracellular matrix-related gene, COL7A1."
https://openalex.org/W2088274907,"Shc adaptor proteins play a role in linking activated cell surface receptors to the Ras signaling pathway in response to receptor mediated tyrosine kinase activation. While the function of Shc in the activation of the Ras pathway via binding to Grb2 has been well characterized, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Shc participates in additional signaling pathways through interactions with other cytoplasmic proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a unique Shc binding protein designated PAL (Protein expressed in Activated Lymphocytes) with no similarity to other known proteins. mPAL binds specifically to the Shc SH2 domain and unlike previously described Shc SH2 domain-protein interactions, the association of mPAL and Shc is phosphotyrosine-independent. Both mPAL RNA and protein expression are restricted to tissues containing actively dividing cells and proliferating cells in culture. mPAL expression is induced upon growth factor stimulation and is down-regulated upon growth inhibition. This pattern, and timing of mPAL expression and its association with the Shc adaptor molecule suggests a role for this protein in signaling pathways governing cell cycle progression."

In eukaryotes, duplication and segregation of the genome are strictly regulated processes that cells must alternate for successful cell division. Studies of yeast have suggested that this coordination is achieved by means of the Ser/Thr kinase activity of p34cdc2/cdc28, given that activation of this kinase is required first for initiating genome replication and second for cells to enter mitosis (1Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, initiation of DNA synthesis in replicating cells requires chromatin to be competent for the p34cdc2/cdc28-mediated activation. At the molecular level, competency means that a multisubunit protein complex, called pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), 1The abbreviations used are:pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Ha, hemagglutinin; Ub, ubiquitin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence. must be formed at origins of replication (ARSs) previous to fire initiation of DNA replication. Association with chromatin is a hierarchical process in which ARSs first recruit the origin recognition complex, then Cdc6p, and finally the Mcm complex, consisting of Mcm2–7 proteins (2Aparicio O.M.

In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, formation of pre-replicative complexes is dependent upon Cdc6, because association of the Mcm proteins relies on the presence of a functionalCDC6 gene product (3Tanaka T.

Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct genetic evidence indicates that CDC6 is rate-limiting for the initiation of DNA replication by interacting with origin recognition complex at origins (5Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis may play a role in cell cycle (6Goebl M.J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varhavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Proteolysis may trigger the initiation of S phase and the transition from metaphase to anaphase by two distinct ubiquitin-conjugation pathways, the former requiring CDC34and the latter involving the anaphase-promoting complex (reviewed in Refs. 7King R.W.

Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In G1 for example, Cln/Cdc28-phosphorylated Cln2p is targeted for degradation in a Cdc53p-dependent manner (9Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Comparably, proteolysis of Sic1p relies on Cdc4p at the G1 to S phase transition (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In fact, Sic1p must be Cdk-phosphorylated prior to its in vitroCdc34-dependent ubiquitination (11Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). It is well known that the Cdc4p protein acts in concert with Cdc34p and Cdc53p to ubiquitinate proteins (12Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Given the importance of some of these substrates, it is accepted that the Cdc4p-Cdc34p-Cdc53 complex controls the G1 to S phase transition (reviewed in Ref. 7King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). All these data support the notion that this complex may act to specifically target degradation of proteins implicated in cell cycle control in aCDC28-dependent phosphorylation manner (13Deshaies R.J.

Cdc34p is an E2-type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that together with Cdc53p and Skp1p form the core complex of ubiquitination for degradation of G1 cyclins Cln1p and Cln2p and the Cdk inhibitor Sic1p. These ubiquitination processes require different F box proteins, whereas Grr1p participates in targeting G1cyclins (15Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Kobayashi R.

It has been argued that Cdc4p may physically interact both with phosphorylated substrates and Skp1p to form the ubiquitinating complex (reviewed in Ref. 12Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This paper addresses the mechanism degrading the key DNA replication initiator Cdc6p protein at the G1 to S phase boundary. Cdc6p is accumulated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis mutants,cdc4-1 and cdc34-2. In accordance with recently published data (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), our results indicate that Cdc4p and Cdc34p participate in Cdc6p proteolysis, suggesting that the initiator protein is phosphorylated for degradation through the proteasome. Consistent with this hypothesis, we present data showing that the Cdc6p protein is ubiquitinated in vivo in budding yeast before it is degraded. All S. cerevisiae strains were derived from 15Dau unless indicated. 15Dau is a MATa derivative of BF264-15D (18Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive and deletion mutants used were as follows:cdc4-1 leu2 ura3; cdc4-1 GAL1:CDC6(URA3) leu2 ura3; cdc4-1 sic1::URA3 leu2 ura3; cdc34-2 ura3 his3; cdc34–2 sic1::URA3 leu2 ura3; and cdc6::kanMX4 GAL1:CDC6 (URA3). Cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% glucose), YEPR (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% raffinose), or YEPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2.5% galactose), except when selecting for plasmids. In this case, cultures were grown in minimal media with supplemented amino acids. The strain deleted forCDC6 conditionally grows on galactose media thanks to theGAL1:CDC6 allele inserted at the ura3 locus, as checked by Southern blotting. Repressing with glucose results in cell cycle block due to the lack of any functional Cdc6 product, as described previously (19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Induction of genes from the CUP1promoter was accomplished by growing cells in YEPD suplemented with 25 μm CuSO4 according to Ecker et al.(20Ecker D.J. Kahn M.I. Marsh J. Butt T.R. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3524-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). General molecular techniques were performed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,22Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA content of individual cells was measured using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry by staining them with propidium iodide following the method of Hutter and Eipel (23Hutter K.J. Eipel H.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 113: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). AnNdeI-BamHI CDC6 containing fragment was cloned into bacterial expression vector pT7-7. Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells transformed with this plasmid were induced to express the fusion protein by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cdc6 protein was purified to homogeneity from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 6 mm NaH2PO4, 4 mmNa2HPO4, 2% SDS, pH 6.8 buffer. Solubilized protein was loaded into a 11% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and purified by electroelution. SDS was removed and fusion protein partially refolded dialyzing against 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3 buffer. Protein concentration was estimated by comparing with bovine serum albumin standards. Rabbits were immunized with 25 μg of full-length Cdc6. After the third injection, antibody-containing serum was collected and titrated by immunoblot. The antibodies were affinity purified on nitrocellulose filter prefixed with Cdc6Ha fusion protein purified to homogeneity. This antiserum was incubated with the filter, washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and eluted by 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.5. The Cdc6 affinity purified antibody was also characterized by immunoblot. Mouse polyclonal antibodies were obtained as described for rabbit antibodies with some modifications as follows: 12 μg of purified and refolded Cdc6264 protein per dosage were intraperitoneally injected into mouse with Freund's complete adjuvant. 10 days after the third injection, ascites fluid was collected, centrifuged to discard cell debris, and the antibody-containing supernatant titrated and characterized by immunoblot (Fig. 3) and used in the indicated dilutions. Soluble protein extracts were prepared as described previously (24Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed, and broken in 30 μl of HB buffer by glass beads. HB buffer contains 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm P-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 15 mmMgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. Glass beads were washed with 500 μl of HB buffer, and the supernatant was recovered. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Protein extracts and immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed using 10 or 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 40 μg of total protein extracts from each sample were blotted to nitrocellulose, and proteins were detected using α-Cdc6 affinity purified polyclonal mouse antibody (1:3000), or rabbit (1:100), or the anti-Cdc28 polyclonal antibody (9Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (1:5000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies and the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. The CDC6 gene encodes a polypeptide of predicted molecular mass of 56 kDa. In order to study the Cdc6 protein in budding yeast, α-Cdc6 polyclonal antisera were produced by injecting rabbits with the full-length protein or mouse with a truncated Cdc6 polypeptide (named Cdc6264) both made in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). This 30.6-kDa polypeptide lacks the carboxyl-terminal 249 amino acids downstream of the region interacting with Cdc28 and Cdc4 (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cdc6 protein was only detected in immunoblots of protein extracts ofcdc28ts, 2M. Sánchez, A. Calzada, and A. Bueno, unpublished results. cdc4-1, or cdc34-2 mutants blocked at the restrictive temperature. Neither with rabbit α-Cdc6 nor with mouse α-Cdc6264 antibodies did we detect Cdc6 protein in immunoblots of extracts from asynchronous cultures of wild type cells, indicating that it is not an abundant protein. Affinity purified rabbit antibodies detected two bands by Western blot, not detected by preimmune serum, of approximately 57 and 65 kDa incdc4-1 cells blocked in G1 (Fig.1). The fastest species was absent from protein extracts of strains deleted for CDC6, suggesting that could be Cdc6. Moreover, cells overexpressing CDC6accumulated the same molecular weight band (Fig. 1), so we concluded that this antibody detected specifically endogenous p57CDC6. Affinity purified mouse polyclonal α-Cdc6264 antibodies identified three bands of approximately 53, 57, and 70 kDa present in lysates from cdc4-1 cells blocked in G1. The p57 species was absent in cell lysates of a strain deleted for CDC6 and prominent in extracts from cells overexpressing that gene (Fig. 3), indicating that this single band is the endogenous Cdc6. Cdc6p and Sic1p proteins become unstable late in G1. Given that Sic1p is degraded through the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 11Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), we were interested in studying whether stabilization of Cdc6p is regulated in a similar way. For this reason, we monitored the Cdc6 protein content by Western blot with antiserum to Cdc6 incdc4-1 and cdc34-2 mutants incubated at the restrictive temperature. Samples were taken every hour as shown in Fig.2. Microscopic and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the cdc4-1 and cdc34-2mutant strains arrested with the characteristic multibudded phenotype and that cells had a 1C DNA content. In both mutant backgrounds p57CDC6 accumulated as a single band (Fig. 2 afor cdc4-1 and data not shown for cdc34-2). Accumulation of a given protein could be an indirect consequence of the cell cycle defect of the mutant under analysis. A first approach to understand whether or not Cdc4 affects Cdc6 stability was to examine the rate of Cdc6 disappearance in promoter shut-off experiments in acdc4-1 GAL1-10:CDC6 strain. Expression of CDC6 was induced in nocodazole-arrested cells by incubating them on galactose for 60 min at 37 °C. Transcription was repressed by addition of glucose and Cdc6 stability estimated by Western blotting either at 25 °C (permissive temperature) or 37 °C (restrictive temperature) (Fig. 2 c). While Cdc6 became unstable at the permissive temperature, its levels remained constant up to 50 min at the restrictive temperature. Therefore, cells blocked in G2/M require Cdc4 to degrade ectopically produced Cdc6. These results together with data recently shown by others (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) suggest that Cdc6p degradation requires CDC4, CDC34, andCDC53 gene products, because Cdc6p is stabilized incdc4/34/53 temperature-sensitive mutants. Nevertheless, it has been described that cdc4 and cdc34 mutants accumulate p40SIC1, a potent Cdk inhibitor (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Cdc6p contains eight potential Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites, and it is anin vitro substrate for this kinase as well as an in vivo phosphoprotein (26Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); furthermore, Cdc6p accumulates incdc28 temperature-sensitive mutants.2 Then, it is formally possible that Cdc6p stabilizes in cdc4 mutants as a direct consequence of the drop in CDC28-associated kinase activity due to the accumulation of Sic1p. Alternatively, this accumulation might be the consequence of a defect in CDC4function related to Cdc6p degradation. To distinguish between these two possibilities we studied Cdc6p accumulation in two different mutant backgrounds, cdc4-1 single and cdc4-1 Δsic1 double mutants. The latter strain, although incapable of performing the Cdc4 function at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) and in contrast with the single mutant, arrests with a 2C DNA content (Fig. 2 b) consistent with a G2-like arrest as previously shown by others (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed by Western blot the content of Cdc6 protein in acdc4-1 sic1::URA3 double mutant arrested at 37 °C by taking samples at regular intervals. As shown in Fig. 2, Cdc6 also accumulated rapidly under these conditions, and the kinetics of stabilization was comparable to the cdc4-1single mutant. Similar results were obtained for cdc34-2 andcdc34-2 sic1::URA3 strains. We conclude that Cdc6p is degraded by theCDC4-CDC34 ubiquitin-mediated pathway because these data indicate that it is due to a genuine defect onCDC4-CDC34 function. The Cdc4p protein then plays an unknown but essential role in the pathway of degradation of the Cdc6p protein (Ref. 17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and this work). It has been argued that Cdc4p may physically interact both with phosphorylated substrates and Skp1p to form the ubiquitinating complex (12Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). If this is true it should be possible to block cdc4-1 mutant cells, accumulating Cdc6p in a phosphorylated but non-ubiquitinated form, release them from the block, and detect ubiquitinated-Cdc6p protein prior to degradation. With the purpose of examining the kinetic of accumulation and degradation of ubiquitinated forms of the Cdc6p protein, an indirect strategy was designed. A cdc4-1 yeast strain was transformed with a plasmid carrying the ubiquitin gene tagged with the Ha epitope (Ub-Ha) under the control of the CUP1 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Upon Cu2+ induction at 25 °C, permissive conditions for the cdc4 allele, Ub-Ha efficiently labeled many polypeptides, as shown by Western blot with α-Ha monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1, lower panel). By using this efficient labeling, we wished to see if Cdc6p was one of the Ub-Ha-tagged proteins. A block and release experiment was carried out in which samples were taken at regular intervals for immunoprecipitation and DNA content analysis. Either cdc4-1or cdc4-1 CUP1:UBHA strains were incubated at 25 °C in the presence of Cu2+ for 2 h before shifting to 37 °C. Cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at this temperature to allow them to accumulate Cdc6p and then were released at 25 °C. After releasing, samples were taken at 0, 5, 20, 35, and 65 min; protein extracts were quantitated, immunoprecipitated with α-Ha monoclonal antibody, and immunoblotted using mouse α-Cdc6 polyclonal antisera. This affinity purified antibody recognizes a single Cdc6-related band in cells overexpressingCDC6 or in cdc4-1-blocked cultures (Fig.3 a, left panel) but reacts with multiple high molecular weight bands as well as low molecular weight bands in cdc4-1 CUP1:UBHA (Fig. 3 a, right panel); these bands were absent in the cdc4-1 control strain grown under identical conditions (Fig. 3 a, right panel), suggesting that they could correspond to Cdc6p ubiquitin conjugates. To investigate this possibility a second block and release experiment was done in which samples were immunoprecipitated with crude antisera to Cdc6 and immunoblotted with α-Ha antibody obtaining comparable results (Fig. 4 a, left panel). Given that after releasing cultures from the block the proteolytic machinery is re-activated, we interpret that low molecular weight bands are Cdc6p degradation products. These analyses revealed that Cdc6p protein was ubiquitinated in vivo. Ubiquitin conjugates of Cdc6p reached a maximum at 5 and 20 min after releasing cells at 25 °C and then disappeared, that is to say coincident with S phase initiation as analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 b). Ubiquitinated-Cdc6p forms were not further detected. Our results, together with previous observations demonstrating that the Cdc6 protein is degraded early in S phase (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), suggest that p57CDC6 is polyubiquitinated and degraded as soon as budding yeast cells initiate genome replication. To investigate if the Cdc6 protein was polyubiquitinated in a Cdc4-dependent manner as suggested by experiments described above, we studied Cdc6 ubiquitination in block and release experiments in cdc4-1 and cdc4-1 Δsic1 mutant strains transformed with a plasmid containing the CUP1:UBHA allele. As discussed earlier even though both strains are defective for Cdc4 function at 37 °C, the latter double mutant mimics a G2 block due to the lack ofsic1 function (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Ub-Ha were blocked at 37 °C to accumulate Cdc6. After releasing at 25 °C samples were immunoprecipitated with crude antisera to Cdc6 and immunoblotted with α-Ha monoclonal antibody. High molecular weight bands, Cdc6-ubiquitin conjugates, were detected in both mutant backgrounds (Fig.4 a); these bands were absent in control strains lacking theCUP1:UBHA plasmid (data not shown). These results suggest that formation of ubiquitin conjugates of Cdc6 requires the Cdc4 function. Nevertheless, a second strategy was used to show a Cdc4 dependence of Cdc6 ubiquitination. Similar to the experiment described in Fig. 2 c, cdc4-1 GAL1-10:CDC6 CUP1:UBHA cells expressing Ub-Ha were blocked in nocodazole for 2.5 h at 25 °C. Flow cytometry and microscopic analysis demonstrated that cells were arrested in G2/M (data not shown). Expression of CDC6 was induced at 37 °C in these nocodazole-arrested cells by addition of galactose. After 60 min, transcription was repressed by adding glucose. Appearance of ubiquitin conjugates of Cdc6 was tested either at 25 (permissive temperature) or 37 °C (restrictive temperature) (Fig.4 b). In this experiment samples were immunoprecipitated with α-Ha monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with affinity purified α-Cdc6. Consistent with a Cdc4-dependent ubiquitination, multiple high and low molecular weight bands were detected at the permissive temperature for the cdc4-1 allele. These bands were absent at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 4 b, left panel). Under these conditions ubiquitinated Cdc6 was immunoprecipitated even 45 min after repressing CDC6expression; we interpret that this fact is a consequence of the massive expression of the CDC6 gene from theGAL1-10 promoter. Together these results indicate that a Cdc4-dependent mechanism ubiquitinates Cdc6 for degradation in budding yeast. Genetic interaction of mutant alleles of two different genes may reflect in vivo direct protein association or an association-independent but functional interaction between wild type gene products. This genetic approach is called synthetic lethality analysis. It has been shown that Cdc4p and Cdc6p proteins interact through the amino terminus of Cdc6p (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), then it is expected that cdc6ts mutants may interact withcdc4ts mutant yeast strains. Indeed, in our strain background, GAL1:CDC6 exhibited at 25 °C synthetic lethal interactions with the cdc4-1 mutation (Fig.5 a); furthermore, Cdc6p overproduction rendered multiple and elongated budded cells, phenocopying the cdc4-1 terminal arrest phenotype at the restrictive temperature. These data are partially in contrast with the recently published results of Drury et al. (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). They have published that overproduction of Cdc6p in cdc4-1 mutants does not block cell growth, although overproduction causes dramatic changes in cell morphology at the permissive temperature in a W303 S. cerevisiae strain (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).2 This phenotype is very similar to the cdc4-1 arrest phenotype and is indistinguishable from the terminal phenotype of the cdc4-1 GAL1-10:CDC6 described above. Since Cdc6p overproduction affects distinctly S. cerevisiae 15Dau and W303 strains (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Bueno A. Russell P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we wondered if these contradictory results may be explained by differences in Cdc6p accumulation in these strain backgrounds. We monitored p57CDC6 content by Western analysis with rabbit antiserum to Cdc6p in parallel experiments withcdc4-1 mutants of the two strain backgrounds, 15Dau and W303. Exponentially growing cultures were shifted to the restrictive temperature. Samples were taken at 1-h intervals for FACS analysis and protein detection. Flow cytometry and microscopic analysis demonstrated that cells were arrested in G1. Western analysis of cell extracts revealed that Cdc6p accumulated more rapidly and to a greater extent in S. cerevisiae 15Dau cells (Fig. 5 b), suggesting a more dramatic phenotype of the cdc4-1 mutation in this strain background. In this context, the overproduction of Cdc6p in a cdc4-1 15Dau mutant strain is likely to allow cells to accumulate the initiator protein to higher levels thancdc4-1 W303. This circumstance might diminish further Cdc4-1 protein function causing the stabilization of Sic1p that would mimic the arrest phenotype of the cdc4-1 allele at the restrictive temperature. A distinguishing feature of the Cdc6/Cdc18 class of proteins is their oscillatory pattern of appearance each cell cycle during G1 due in part to its periodic destruction as cells enter S phase (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the Cdc6p protein interacts with Cdc4p and that this interaction is required for its degradation (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To address details regarding the mechanism and the timing of Cdc6p degradation further, we have combined genetic analysis and yeast biochemistry in studying these questions. The major conclusion of this report is that Cdc6p is ubiquitinated each cell cycle in a Cdc4p-dependent manner. Several important details regarding the Cdc4-Cdc34-mediated degradation of Cdc6 are reported in this paper. First, although Drury et al. (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) reported that cdc4ts, cdc34ts, andcdc53ts mutants do not degrade Cdc6p, their experiments were made ectopically expressing CDC6 from theGAL1-10 promoter. Corroborating their results, we report here that Cdc6p accumulates at the block point ofcdc4ts and cdc34ts mutants (Fig. 2). Second, the Cdc4-Cdc34-Cdc53 complex controls the G1 to S phase transition ubiquitinating for degradation the potent Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 11Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 7King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar and 12Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). As previously discussed (Fig.2), our results regarding the accumulation of Cdc6p incdc4-1 Δsic1 double mutants indicate that the initiator protein stabilizes due to a genuine defect in the ubiquitination pathway rather than a drop in kinase activity. Third, the requirement of Cdc4 and Cdc34 suggests that Cdc6 degradation may involve ubiquitination of the initiator protein; however, it does not prove it. Nevertheless, we show here cdc4-1 block and release experiments in which Cdc6p is detected forming ubiquitin conjugates. Our data, together with previous observations regarding Cdc6 stability (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), show that ubiquitination and proteolysis are consecutive steps in Cdc6p degradation that occur soon after the transition of G1 to S phase is initiated. Moreover, by arresting cells in different points of the cell cycle, we have shown that Cdc6 is ubiquitinated in a Cdc4-dependent manner (Fig.4). Although these data suggest that proteolysis of Cdc6 might be catalyzed by the proteasome, at present we do not know if this is the case. Further experiments need to be done in order to show that proteasome is indeed involved in Cdc6 proteolysis even though it is likely to be the mechanism. The closest homologue of CDC6 in fission yeast,cdc18+ is also required for DNA replication (28Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Cdc18 protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle, peaking at G1 as Cdc6 does (19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 29Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although at present it is unknown if the Cdc18 protein is degraded at the same time that DNA replication is initiated, given that the overexpression ofcdc18+ induces continuous DNA synthesis (29Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,30Muzi-Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that proteolysis of this protein might play a key role in limiting DNA replication to once per cell cycle. On the other hand, it has been shown that Cdc18 interacts in vivowith Pop1 and Sud1, Cdc4-related proteins in fission yeast, and that Cdc18 protein accumulates in pop1 and sud1mutants as well as in proteasome-deficient mutants of the fission yeast, in the latter mutants possibly forming ubiquitin conjugates (31Kominami K. Toda V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,32Jallepalli P.V. Tien D. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8159-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data and the results presented here show that degradation of Cdc6/Cdc18 class of initiator proteins is conserved at least in simple eukaryotes such as yeast. Despite these similarities, the degree of competence of this degradation mechanism in controlling genome ploidy appears to be slightly different in fission and budding yeast. InSchizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of eitherpop1 + or sud1 + results in cells becoming polyploids, suggesting that Cdk-regulated proteolysis may be critical to ensure a single round of DNA replication (31Kominami K. Toda V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Jallepalli P.V. Tien D. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ploidy control in budding yeast appears to be a Cdk-controlled redundant mechanism in which some of the pre-RCs components may be degraded, as is the case for Cdc6 (Refs. 17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, and this work), whereas association and/or localization of others may be regulated by Cdk phosphorylation (34Hennessy K.M. Clark C.D. Botstein D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 35Dalton S. Whitbread L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion,cdc4ts mutants do not polyploidize under restrictive conditions (10Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), or cells expressing a stable form of Cdc6 do not re-replicate (17Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In any case, budding yeast Cdc4-regulated Cdc6p proteolysis is part of the mechanism restricting genome duplication to S phase, because in the absence of Cdc6p no pre-RCs are formed (4Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Multicellular eukaryotes apparently have developed a slightly different mechanism in which nuclear non-phosphorylated Cdc6 associates with chromatin; meanwhile, Cdk-phosphorylated Cdc6 is probably membrane-bound or cytosolic and therefore unable to interact with chromatin. This has been suggested for Xenopus andHomo sapiens Cdc6 protein homologues (38Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 39Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whether or not degradation of nuclear Cdc6 plays a role in maintenance of genome ploidy in higher eukaryotes remains to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2115779497,"Although an important contribution of ERK and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts has been determined, their role in mediating oncogenic Ras transformation of human tumor cells remains to be established. We have utilized the human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and DLD-1 colon carcinoma cell lines, which contain endogenous mutated and oncogenic N- and K-ras alleles, respectively, to address this role. Study of these cells is advantageous over Ras-transformed rodent model cell systems for two key reasons. First, the ras mutations occurred naturally in the progression of the tumors from which the cell lines were derived, rather than due to overexpression of an exogenously introduced gene. Second, although these tumor cells possess defects in multiple genetic loci, it has been established that mutated Ras contributes significantly to the transformed phenotype of these cells. Clonal variant lines of HT1080 and DLD-1 have been isolated which have lost the oncogenic ras allele and exhibit a corresponding impairment in growth transformation in vitro and in vivo. We found that upregulation of Raf/MEK/ERK and JNK correlated with expression of oncogenic Ras in HT1080, but not DLD-1 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK activation in parental HT1080 cells caused the same changes in cell morphology and actin stress fiber organization seen with loss of expression of activated N-Ras(61K). Thus, we suggest that constitutive activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK and JNK pathways is necessary for Ras-induced transformation of HT1080 but not DLD-1 cells. These results emphasize that cell type differences exist in the signaling pathways by which oncogenic Ras causes transformation."

SNAP-25 is very abundant in neurons where it localizes to presynaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles (1Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J.

It has been shown that SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, two proteins localized at the plasma membrane, form a complex with VAMP-2, an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles (3Sollner T.

This heterotrimeric complex is a receptor (SNARE) for SNAP and NSF, two soluble factors required for vesicular traffic (3Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2626) Google Scholar). A current model predicts that SNARE receptors at an acceptor compartment (t-SNAREs) interact in a “lock and key” fashion with SNARE receptors at the surface of transport vesicles (v-SNAREs) (reviewed in Ref. 7Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that SNARE components, by themselves, are sufficient to mediate fusion between two lipid bilayers (8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F.

In agreement with this hypothesis, there are multiple members of the VAMP and syntaxin family of proteins, each localized at a specific intracellular compartment (9Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B.

A homolog of SNAP-25, called SNAP-23, was identified from a human B lymphocyte library by yeast double-hybrid screening (10Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the SNARE complex, syndet·syntaxin-4·VAMP-2 mediates insulin-dependent exocytosis of glucose transporter-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane of adipocytes (17Rea S. Martin L.B. Mc Intosh S. Macaulay S.L. Martin L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, syndet in adipocytes, like SNAP-25 in neurons, seems to be involved in exocytosis of intracellular vesicles at the cell surface. SNAP-25 and syndet are integral membrane proteins, but do not have any predicted signal sequence or transmembrane domains (1Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications may provide these proteins with a hydrophobic anchor to membranes. It has been shown that SNAP-25 is palmitoylated through a thioester bond to some or all of its four cysteines clustered at a region near the center of the protein sequence (18Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Deletion of this region abolishes palmitoylation of SNAP-25 and its binding to membranes (20Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Also point mutations at single cysteines of SNAP-25 largely inhibit palmitoylation and membrane binding (19Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This study was designed to investigate which domain of syndet is critical for its intracellular localization. In this paper we show that the number and configuration of cysteines at the cysteine-rich domain act as major determinants for the subcellular distribution of syndet. The original template for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are:PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. of syndet was pcDNA1-syndet plasmid (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were encoded in the oligonucleotide primers synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The enzyme used for PCR wasPwo DNA Polymerase (3 units/reaction, Boehringer Mannheim Corp.) with its supplied reaction buffer. The primers were used at a final concentration of 2 μm. The deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Promega, Madison, WI) were used at a final concentration of 200 μm. The PCR was carried out on a “GeneAmp PCR System 2400” (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. Syndet cDNA was amplified from pcDNA1-syndet using primers: TGCAATCAGTACAAGCTTGAGAACTGTGGAGGCTGGAGAGGAGTG (number 1) which encodes a HindIII site, and TCAGGTCACTCTAGACTACTTATACAGCTGCTTCTT (number 2) which encodes anXbaI site. It was then subcloned into theHindIII-XbaI sites of vector pCB7 (21Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtainsyndet-pCB7. Delta-syndet mutant was also made from pcDNA1-syndet in two separate PCR reactions, using primers 1 and CGCATCTTACCCGGGCTTGTTGAGTTCTGTTAAAGTCTT, which encodes anXmaI site, for the first reaction, and primers 2 and AGTGTTACGGTACCCGGGAATAGGACAAAGAACTTTGAG, which also encodes anXmaI site, for the second. The products of the first PCR reaction were digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and XmaI and the products of the second PCR reaction withXmaI and XbaI. These two products were ligated into pCB7 vector to obtain delta-syndet-pCB7. pCB7 vector was made using the technique of “overlap extension” PCR (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) with syndet-pCB7 as the template. Primers 1 and GGAAATACACAAACCAGAACACTTGTTGAG were used to make the 5′-half of syndetC2S/C4S/C5S and primers 2 and TTGTGTATTTCCCCGTCTAATAGGACAAAG to make the 3′-half. The two products were combined in a second PCR, digested with HindIII andXbaI, and subcloned into pCB7. All other mutants were created using a combination of “long distance inverse” PCR (23Hidajat R. McNicol P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and “touchdown” PCR methods (24Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar) withsyndet-pCB7 as the template. The two primers were designed to encode the mutations and align “back to back” on thesyndet-pCB7 backbone. The reverse primer was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the supplied reaction buffer along with the addition of ATP (2 mm). The PCR buffer was the same as above, except that it containedN,N-dimethylformamide at a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The PCR parameters were the following: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 6 min. The annealing temperature was then reduced by 1 °C per cycle for the next 11 cycles, and then kept at 44 °C for the following 30 cycles. The PCR products were treated withDpnI, to digest the template DNA, purified by low-melt agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated with T4 DNA-ligase. Primers TGCATCAGTCCTTGTAATAGGACA and GAGGCCTGAACACTTGTTGAGTTC were used for making syndet C2S/C4S-pCB7; ATCTGCCCTTCCAATAGGACAAAGAAC and GCAGAGGCCACTACACTTGTTGAGTTC for making syndet C2S/C5S-pCB7; GCAGAGGCCACTACACTTGTTGAGTTC and CCTTCAAATAGGACAAAGAAC for making syndet C4S/C5S-pCB7; CTCTCCATCTGCCCTTGTAAT and CCCACAAGACTTGTTGAGTTCTGT for syndet C1S/C3S-pCB7; CTCTGCATCTCCCCTTGTAATAGGACA and CCCACAACACTTGTT for syndet C4S-pCB7;CCCACAACACTTGTT and CTCTGCATCTGCCCTTCTAATAGGACAAAGAAC for syndet C5S-pCB7; TCCTCACTTCTGTATTTGCTG and TCCGCAAAGAAACTCATT forsyndet delta-BoNT/E; CTCTGCATCTGCCCTTGTAATAAGGCAACATGGGGA and CCCACAACACTTGTTCAGCATAGTGATGGT for syndet δα1 . The identity of all the mutants was confirmed by restriction analyses and sequencing. AtT-20 cells were cultured and transfected as described (25Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). AtT-20 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and treated for immunofluorescence as described (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As primary antibodies, anti-syndet affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:80 dilution (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-SNAP 25 SMI-81 antibodies from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. (Baltimore, MD) at 1:400 dilution; and anti-ACTH monoclonal antibody, clone 57 from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ), at 1:100 were used. Donkey anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibodies and goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Chemicals, West Grove, PA) were used at 1:200 dilution. The immunofluorescence images were obtained at the Confocal Microscopy Facility of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. A Zeiss Axiovert 100TV fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal attachment was used to obtain the images. The cells were excited with an Argon-Krypton laser using the standard wavelengths for rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate. The images were collected as 1-μm thick optical sections. They were processed using Zeiss LSM 3.95 software and Adobe Photoshop 3.0 (Adobe Systems). Immunogold labeling of broken and agarose-embedded AtT-20 cells was done as described elsewhere (25Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-syndet antibodies were used at 1:20 dilution and mouse monoclonal anti-SNAP-25 antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution. Colloidal gold donkey anti-rabbit IgG (12 nm) and colloidal gold donkey anti-mouse IgG (6 nm) were used for immunolabeling at a concentration of 1:100. Immunolabeled cells were osmicated (0.5% for 30 min), dehydrated, and embedded in tEPON (Tousimis Research Corp., Rockville MD). Thin sections (70 nm) were cut on an AO Ultracut microtome (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria), counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed and photographed on a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody MA). Protease inhibitors, leupeptin (6 μg/ml) and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml), were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) was from Sigma. Cells were grown on 6-cm plates for at least 72 h and homogenized in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) by passing the cells through an insulin needle six times. The homogenates were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer, boiled, and loaded into the SDS-PAGE gel. In some experiments, a fraction of the homogenate (200 μl) was spun at 400,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was recovered and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A. Each fraction (40 μl each) was mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer, boiled, and loaded into the SDS-PAGE gel. Further steps including electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing syndet, delta-syndet, and syndet C1S/C3S were labeled with ([3H]palmitate (0.5 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) for 2 h, as described. (19Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells grown in a 3.5-cm plate were washed twice with buffer A and lysed in 1.0 ml of buffer A with Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v, Sigma) along with protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g. Affinity purified syndet antibody (10 μl) was added to the supernatants and samples were incubated at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads (40 μl dry beads, Boehringer Mannheim) were added to the samples, which were further incubated at 4 oC for 45 min while being agitated. After centrifugation, pelleted immunobeads were washed three times with lysis buffer A and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and fluorography as described (20Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were run to determine that syndet, delta-syndet, and syndet C1S/C3S were immunoprecipitated to the same extent by affinity purified syndet antibodies. To visualize immunoprecipitated wild-type and mutated syndet by Western blot, immunobeads were mixed with sample buffer without reducing agents. The endogenous level of syndet protein in AtT-20 cells is undetectable by Western blot and immunofluorescence (see below). We determined the distribution of exogenous syndet in stably transfected AtT-20 cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1). Syndet immunoreactivity was seen along the plasma membrane of the cell body, the neurite-like processes and the tips (Fig. 1 B). Staining for SNAP-25, like syndet, was predominant along the entire plasma membrane (Fig. 1 A). However, SNAP-25 antibodies also stained a region near the nucleus and the cytoplasm within the tip. We have shown elsewhere by immunoelectron microscopy that endogenous syndet in adult mouse kidney is found predominantly at the plasma membrane (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the ultrastructural level, we confirmed that exogenous syndet in AtT-20 cells was indeed localized at the plasma membrane. Fig.2 shows that exogenous syndet (12-nm gold particles) and endogenous SNAP-25 (6-nm gold particles) are localized at the plasmalemma in agarose-embedded broken cells. There was no syndet or SNAP-25 labeling associated with the nuclear membrane, or mitochondria or endogenous murine leukemia virus particles. These results indicate that exogenous syndet expressed in AtT-20 cells is able to localize at the plasmalemma. We conclude that AtT-20 cells can be used as a model to study the role of various syndet domains in plasma membrane localization.Figure 2Immunogold staining of broken cells expressing wild-type syndet. Syndet (12 nm gold) and SNAP-25 (6 nm gold) are detected at the plasma membrane. There is no staining of mitochondria (m), endogenous murine leukemia virus (v), or nuclear membrane (not shown). Bar, 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We prepared three deletion mutants of syndet to find domains responsible for targeting syndet to the plasma membrane (Fig.3, upper panel). The deletion mutant delta-syndet lacks the syndet amino acid sequence from Cys79 to Cys85. Pro86 was left unchanged, and Cys87 was mutated to a glycine. Thus, delta-syndet does not have any cysteines. Syndet δα1 lacks the amino-terminal region which has a high propensity to form coiled-coil structures (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a short sequence after the cysteine-rich domain. The cysteine-rich domain was entirely preserved in the syndet δα1 mutant. Syndet delta-BoNT/E is the expected proteolysis product of mouse syndet protein treated with the botulinum toxin E (BoNT/E) (26Washbourne P. Pellizzari R. Baldini G. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Syndet delta-BoNT/E lacks approximately 40% of the carboxyl-terminal region with high probability to form coiled-coil structures (11Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of homogenates from AtT-20 cells expressing wild type syndet (26 kDa), delta-syndet (25 kDa), syndet δα1 (20 kDa), and syndet delta-BoNT/E (23 kDa) are shown in Fig. 3, A-C. Deletion of the entire cysteine-rich domain of syndet (delta-syndet) shifted the distribution of syndet immunoreactivity from the plasma membrane to a diffuse intracellular localization (Fig.4 B). The localization of endogenous SNAP-25 was not changed by expression of delta-syndet (Fig.4 A). We conclude that the cysteine-rich domain of syndet is necessary for targeting the protein to the cell surface. Syndet δα1 and syndet delta-BoNT/E immunofluorescence staining accumulated at the plasma membrane of the cell body (Fig. 4, C andE), of the neurite-like processes (not clearly visible in the optical sections shown in Fig. 4 ) and of the tips (Fig.4, C and D). Thus, the subcellular distribution of syndet δα1 and syndet delta-BoNT/E was similar to the distribution of exogenous wild-type syndet (compare with Fig. 1). These experiments indicate that the entire predicted α-helix at the amino terminus of syndet and at least 40% of the helix at the carboxyl terminus are not required for targeting syndet to the plasma membrane. Unlike these regions, the cysteine-rich domain is necessary for plasma membrane targeting. The cysteine-rich domains of wild-type syndet and two alternatively spliced isoforms of SNAP-25, SNAP-25 A and SNAP-25 B (27Bark I.C. Wilson M.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 5. The five cysteines of syndet are designated as Cys1, Cys2, Cys3, Cys4, and Cys5 and correspond to Cys79, Cys80, Cys83, Cys85, and Cys87, respectively. Unlike syndet, SNAP-25 A and SNAP-25 B have four cysteines in their cysteine-rich domain. In SNAP-25 A, the cysteine corresponding to Cys3 of syndet is substituted by a phenylalanine. In SNAP-25 B, the cysteine corresponding to syndet Cys1 is substituted by a phenylalanine. The triplet of cysteines, -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5-, of syndet is conserved in both SNAP-25 A and SNAP-25 B. To study the role of individual cysteines at the cysteine-rich domain, we prepared a series of mutations. In the mutant syndet C2S/C4S/C5S, all the cysteines of the -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet were substituted with serines. Within the -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet, we also made pairwise substitutions, syndet C2S/C4S, syndet C2S/C5S, syndet C4S/C5S, of two cysteines with serines. In syndet C4S/C4S and syndet C5S, Cys4 and Cys5, respectively, were substituted with serines. In syndet C1S/C3S, both Cys1 and Cys3 of syndet were substituted with serines. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on AtT-20 cells transiently expressing either wild type or mutated syndet proteins. Plasma membrane staining of wild-type syndet in transiently transfected AtT-20 cells was indistinguishable from that observed in the stable AtT-20 cell lines. Syndet C2S/C4S/C5S was found in the cytoplasm (Fig.6 A), and had a distribution similar to delta-syndet (Fig. 4 B). This experiment indicates that the conserved -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet is critical for syndet localization at the plasma membrane. Syndet C4S/C5S (Fig. 6 B), syndet C2S/C4S (Fig.6 C), and syndet C2S/C5S (Fig. 6 D) were also found in the cytoplasm and did not localize at the plasma membrane. Syndet proteins with single point mutations at C5S (Fig. 6 E) or C4S (Fig. 6 F) were localized at the plasma membrane. Thus, a mutation of any pair of cysteines within the conserved triplet is sufficient to prevent plasma membrane localization. Single substitutions do not alter syndet distribution. We conclude that at least 2 cysteines within the -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet are necessary for localization of syndet at the plasma membrane. Syndet distribution in AtT-20 cell lines stably expressing the syndet C1S/C3S protein was examined. In contrast to wild-type syndet (Fig.1 B), the mutant, syndet C1S/C3S, was found at an intracellular site as well as at the plasma membrane (Fig.7 B). Double staining with SNAP-25 antibodies indicate that endogenous SNAP-25 is predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 A). We determined the relative distribution of ACTH and syndet immunoreactivities in AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type syndet and syndet C1S/C3S (not shown). ACTH immunoreactivity is concentrated in a Golgi-like region near the nucleus and at the tips (25Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) where ACTH-containing granules accumulate (28Matsuuchi L. Buckley K.M. Lowe A.W. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wild-type syndet did not co-localize with ACTH immunoreactivity either at the cell body or at the tips. Syndet C1S/C3S co-localized with ACTH immunoreactivity in the Golgi-like compartment, but not at the tips of the processes. These results show that mutations at Cys1 and Cys3: (a) shift a fraction of syndet from its plasma membrane localization to a Golgi-like intracellular compartment; (b) do not induce re-distribution of syndet to dense core granules. AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type syndet, delta-syndet, and syndet C1S/C3S were homogenized in a buffer containing either 150 mm NaCl or 100 mmNa2CO3 at pH 11.5. Buffers containing sodium carbonate at pH 11.5 are known to dissociate peripheral proteins from membranes (29Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a membrane-containing pellet and a cytosol-containing supernatant. Wild type SNAP-25 and syndet were mostly or entirely recovered in the pellet fraction (Fig.8). We conclude that exogenous syndet in AtT-20 cells is an integral membrane component, like endogenous syndet in adipocytes. Overexpression of syndet did not affect the binding of endogenous SNAP-25 to membranes (Fig. 8). Delta-syndet was almost entirely recovered in the supernatant fraction, indicating that deletion of the cysteine-rich domain makes the protein soluble (Fig.8). Approximately 50% of syndet C1S/C3S was tightly associated to membranes (Fig. 8). We conclude that Cys1 and Cys3 are important, but not absolutely necessary, for syndet binding to membranes. To determine whether syndet is palmitoylated, we incubated transfected AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type syndet, delta-syndet, and syndet C1S/C3S with [3H]palmitic acid. Palmitoylated proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE fluorography (Fig.9). Wild-type syndet and syndet C1S/C3S, but not delta-syndet, incorporated labeled palmitate. These experiments and the ones in Fig. 8 indicate that the cysteine-rich motif of syndet is palmitoylated and that incorporation of fatty acid is necessary for syndet binding to membranes. Pairing of individual SNAREs before fusion may be at least one of the mechanisms by which cells maintain different organelles as unique compartments. In this light, it is essential that individual SNARE components be targeted to their correct destination. In this paper, we have identified the cysteine-rich region of the t-SNARE component, syndet, as critical for subcellular localization of syndet. We find that deletion of the cysteine-rich domain of syndet abolishes membrane binding. This result is in agreement with the finding that a mutant SNAP-25, lacking its cysteine-rich domain, is soluble (20Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 is palmitoylated in the central nervous system and in transfected cells (18Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Syndet, syndet C1S/C3S, but not the mutant lacking the cysteine-rich domain, are palmitoylated in the transfected AtT-20 cell model. Thus, it is likely that fatty acylation is necessary for the binding of syndet to membranes. Moreover, we find that the cysteine-rich domain of syndet is essential for targeting the protein to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the cysteine-rich domain of syndet has a dual role in membrane binding and plasma membrane targeting. Unlike the deletion of the cysteine-rich domain, deletions of 32 amino acids at the amino terminus domain or 25 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus domain of syndet do not have an appreciable effect on protein distribution. Our data show that the distribution of syndet which has been mutated at three cysteines, syndet C2S/C4S/C5S, is shifted from the plasma membrane to a diffuse intracellular localization. We also find that syndet C4S/C5S, C2S/C4S, and C2S/C5S are unable to accumulate at the cell periphery and are found in the cytoplasm. Syndet C4S and syndet C5S are both localized at the plasma membrane. Our observations indicate that: 1) at least two cysteines within the -Cys2- Cys4-Cys5- triplet must be substituted to prevent syndet localization at the cell surface; 2) single and double mutations of cysteines within the -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet have the same effect on syndet distribution, irrespective of which residue is changed. We conclude that Cys2, Cys4, and Cys5 are critical for plasma membrane localization and may have similar and somewhat overlapping roles. Doubly lipid modified peptides are stably anchored to membranes (30Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Since syndet and SNAP-25 have multiple cysteines, some cysteines may target these proteins to intermediate localizations along the biosynthetic route or to specialized domains at the plasma membrane. Indeed, it appears that SNAP-25 A, SNAP-25 B, and SNAP-23 accumulate in specific domains at the cell surface (5De Camilli P. Nature. 1993; 364: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Bark I.C. Hahn K.M. Ryabinin A.E. Wilson M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3422-3430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Modifications at cysteines may also modulate their binding to membranes (19Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or the formation of SNARE complexes (34Meffert M.K. Calakos N.C. Scheller R.H. Schulman H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1229-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Because syndet Cys1 and Cys3 are not conserved in SNAP-25 B and SNAP-25 A, it is reasonable to conclude that modifications at these residues may account at least in part for differences in the localization and function of these proteins. We have generated a mutant syndet protein in which both cysteines are substituted with serines. We find that, unlike the double mutants within -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet, a fraction of syndet C1S/C3S remains as an integral membrane component at steady state. Consistent with the concept that acylation of syndet is necessary for its binding to membranes, we find that syndet C1S/C3S is palmitoylated. We conclude that Cys1 and Cys3, unlike Cys2, Cys4, and Cys5, are not absolutely required for membrane binding. We also find that mutations at Cys1 and Cys3 of syndet result in localization of the mutated protein to the plasma membrane, as well as a Golgi-like compartment and the cytosol. Interestingly, a mutation of a specific cysteine palmitoylation site in Src protein kinase p56lck, can shift a fraction of the protein from the plasma membrane to a Golgi compartment (35Bijlmakers M.J. Isobe-Nakamura M. Ruddock L.J. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results support the concept that the cysteine-rich domain of syndet plays a major role in subcellular localization of the protein. We conclude that the distribution of syndet, like that of Src protein kinase p56lck, may be influenced by the configuration of the cysteines. SNAP-25 associates with the Golgi compartment at the cell body of the neurons and then undergoes fast axonal transport as an acylated protein (18Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAP-25 reaches the plasma membrane by association with transport vesicles. We find that syndet C1S/C3S is found in the cytosol, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane. The distribution of mutated syndet may mimic the steps of syndet or SNAP-25 biosynthetic routes. If this is the case, then acylations within the -Cys2-Cys4-Cys5- triplet may be sufficient to bind syndet to a Golgi localization. Acylation(s) at Cys1 and/or Cys3 may shift wild-type syndet from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In the absence of Cys1 and Cys3 transit to the plasma membrane is slow and mutated syndet C1S/C3S accumulates at the Golgi localization. Alternatively, it is also possible for mutated syndet C1S/C3S to localize both at the Golgi and at the plasma membrane directly, from the cytosol. In mast cells, SNAP-23 relocates from the plasma membrane to dense core granules in response to stimulation (37Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that modifications at the cysteine-rich motif can induce redistribution of syndet to an intracellular compartment. However, in AtT-20 cells, syndet C1S/C3S is redistributed to an intracellular compartment different from dense core granules. More work is necessary to understand whether modifications at the cysteine-rich motif play a role in changes of SNAP-23/syndet or SNAP-25 cell distribution under different conditions. In conclusion, our paper shows that the cysteine-rich domain of syndet is a major determinant for the subcellular localization of the protein. We propose that modifications at the clustered cysteines may control syndet distribution and function in cells.

Depending on the species, IgG is transported prenatally across the placenta and yolk sac or is absorbed from colostrum and milk by the small intestine of the suckling newborn. In both cases apical to basolateral transepithelial transport of IgG is thought to be mediated by FcRn, an IgG Fc receptor with homology to major histocompatibility class I antigens. Here, we analyzed the intracellular routing of chimera encoding the rat FcRn tail fused to the ecto- and transmembrane domain of the macrophage FcγRIIb. Newly synthesized chimera were delivered in a nonvectorial manner to the apical and basolateral cell surface, from where the chimera were able to internalize and transcytose. Apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical transcytosis were differently regulated. This intracellular routing of the chimera is similar to that of the native FcRn, indicating that the cytosolic tail of the receptor is necessary and sufficient to endow an unrelated FcR with the intracellular transport behavior of FcRn. Furthermore, the di-leucine motif in the cytosolic domain of FcRn was required for rapid and efficient endocytosis but not for basolateral sorting of the chimera.

Simple epithelia form barriers that allow the selective exchange of molecules between the lumen of an organ and the underlying tissue. One mechanism by which molecules can cross the epithelial barrier involves vesicular transepithelial transport (transcytosis). Our current knowledge about transcytosis of proteins is almost exclusively based on studies of the pIgR, 1The abbreviations used are:pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; BFA, brefeldin A; CaM, calmodulin; FcR, Fc receptor; FcRn, neonatal IgG FcR; rFcRn, rat FcRn; FcRII/FcRn, chimera between FcγRIIb2 ecto- and transmembrane domain and FcRn cytosolic tail; CKII, casein kinase II; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are:pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; BFA, brefeldin A; CaM, calmodulin; FcR, Fc receptor; FcRn, neonatal IgG FcR; rFcRn, rat FcRn; FcRII/FcRn, chimera between FcγRIIb2 ecto- and transmembrane domain and FcRn cytosolic tail; CKII, casein kinase II; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. which mediates the transport of serosal polymeric IgA and IgM into mucosal secretions (for review, see Refs. 1Mostov K.E.

Cell. 1986; 46: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pIgR is transported from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral surface where it binds ligand and is internalized. Basolateral targeting and internalization require signals in the form of short amino acid sequences located in the cytosolic receptor domain. Transcytosis occurs via basolateral early endosomes and an apically located endosomal recycling compartment (4Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and requires microtubules (6Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although free receptors transcytose, binding of ligand results in the transduction of signals (10Cardone M.H. Smith B.L. Mennitt P.A. Mochlyrosen D. Silver R.B. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that stimulate the rate of transcytosis (11Song W.X. Bomsel M. Casanova J. Vaerman J.P. Mostov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that transcytosis is regulated by a number of molecules involved in signal transduction, including CaM (12Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to basolateral to apical transcytosis, little is known about transport in the opposite direction, and the scant information available is derived from proteins that are not physiologically involved in transcytosis (14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. Vandeurs B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that apical to basolateral transcytosis may be independent of microtubules (6Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and may also be regulated differently from transport in the opposite direction (15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In analogy to the pIgR, however, apical to basolateral transcytosis of a bona fide transcytotic receptor may be subject to additional regulatory mechanisms. One of the few known receptors to mediate the physiologically relevant apical to basolateral transcellular transport of a ligand is FcRn. FcRn, an IgG FcR related to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (17Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was initially identified in the neonatal small intestine where it mediates the uptake of maternal IgG present in colostrum and milk (18Brambell F.W.R.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) into the fetal circulation. Like in the intestine, net transplacental IgG transport occurs in an apical to basolateral direction. More recently, a more general role of FcRn in the maintenance of IgG homeostasis by recycling internalized IgG and thus preventing its degradation in lysosomes has been proposed (32Israel E.J. Wilsker D.F. Hayes K.C. Schoenfeld D. Simister N.E. Immunology. 1996; 89: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 33Ghetie V. Hubbard J.G. Kim J.K. Tsen M.F. Lee Y. Ward E.S. Eur. J.

Because binding of IgG to FcRn occurs preferentially at a slightly acidic pH of ∼6.0 (for review, see Ref. 35Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 181-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), FcRn can bind ligand either at lumenal surfaces exposed to an acidic environment such as in the intestine (24Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), or in acidic endosomal compartments following the fluid phase internalization of IgG (31Roberts D.M. Guenthert M. Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Exposure of the receptor-ligand complex to a neutral pH following transcytosis or recycling may then lead to the dissociation of IgG into the extracellular milieu. Characterization of the intracellular transport of human and rat FcRn in transfected epithelial MDCK cells indicates that newly synthesized receptors are transported in a nonvectorial fashion to the apical and basolateral cell surface and that they transcytose in both directions. 2A. Praetor, I. Stefaner, and W. Hunziker, manuscript in preparation.2A. Praetor, I. Stefaner, and W. Hunziker, manuscript in preparation. To analyze the role of the cytosolic tail in intracellular sorting, we generated MDCK cell lines stably expressing chimera consisting of the ecto- and transmembrane domains of the macrophage FcγRIIb and wild-type or mutant cytosolic domains of rFcRn. Newly synthesized FcRII/FcRn receptors were delivered in a nonpolarized manner to the apical and basolateral surface of MDCK cells. A di-leucine motif in the cytosolic domain of FcRn was critical for efficient endocytosis but not for basolateral sorting. Following internalization, the chimeric receptors mediated bidirectional transcytosis. Trafficking of the FcRII/FcRn chimera closely resembles that of FcRn, consistent with a critical role of the cytosolic tail in FcRn traffic. Transcytosis of the chimera was not affected by BFA and only basolateral to apical transport required calmodulin and microtubule function, showing that transcytosis in the two directions is subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Brefeldin A (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), nocodazole (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) and W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphtalenesulfonamide; Bio-Science Products) were prepared and used as described previously (6Hunziker W.

Protease inhibitor mixture contained 10 mg/ml chymostatin, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (all from Sigma) in Me2SO and was used at a 1:1,000 dilution.125I-NaI was from Amersham Corp. (Little Chalfont, UK), Easytag Express protein labeling mix from NEN Life Science Products(Du Pont de Nemours, Switzerland). Immunopure sulfo-NHS-biotin was purchased from Pierce Europe (Oud Beijerland, The Netherlands), prepared as a stock of 200 mg/ml Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Fixed Staphylococcus aureuscells and protein A-negative S. aureus strain (Wood 46 strain) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA) and used as a 10% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Streptavidin-agarose was from Sigma. Fixed S. aureus cells and agarose beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin before use. Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) was used at 0.1 g/ml supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (Sigma). Fab fragments of the monoclonal rat anti-mouse FcγRIIb antibody 2.4G2 (36Unkeless J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) and a rabbit polyclonal anti FcγRIIb serum (kindly provided by I. Mellman, Yale University, New Haven, CT) were used to detect chimeric receptors. Affinity purified labeled second antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResarch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). 2.4G2 Fab fragments were radioiodinated to specific activities of 2–7 × 106cpm/μg using Iodogen (Pierce), unincorporated 125I was removed by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex-1 (Sigma) as described (37Mellman I.S. Plutner H. Steinman R.M. Unkeless J.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell culture and stable transfection of MDCK strain II cells was carried out as described (14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two or three clones expressing each construct were analyzed. In some experiments, cells were incubated overnight with 5–10 mm butyrate (38Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) to induce expression. Butyrate treatment did not significantly alter the intracellular transport of the chimera under the conditions used. 125I-canine transferrin bound in a polarized fashion to the basolateral side (39Podbilewicz B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and gp80 was secreted apically (40Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that the cell monolayers were fully polarized. Deletion and substitution mutants of the FcRn tail were generated by PCR using rat FcRn cloned into Bluescript or pCB6 as a template. A sense primer covering the 5′ region of FcRn was combined with the different mutagenic antisense primers carrying XbaI sites in the 3′ noncoding region. PCR fragments were cut withBglII/XbaI and used to replace theBglII/XbaI fragment containing the tail domain of FcRn in Bluescript. The complete FcRn coding fragment was then excised from Bluescript with KpnI/XbaI and subcloned into the expression vector pCB6. To generate chimera between the macrophage FcγRIIb2 ecto- and transmembrane domain and the wild-type or mutated FcRn cytosolic tail, a 5′ PCR primer was used to introduce an in frameAflII site just adjacent to the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain of FcRn. PCR products encoding wild-type and mutant FcRn tails were then appended to the lumenal and transmembrane domains of a tail-less FcγRIIb2 construct carrying a uniqueAflII site following the transmembrane domain (38Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), resulting in the in frame fusion to the ecto- and transmembrane region of FcγRIIb2 (see Fig. 1). All fragments synthesized by PCR were verified by sequencing. The sequence of the primers is available upon request. Endocytosis and transcytosis of FcRII/FcRn was analyzed by measuring the uptake and translocation of prebound iodinated 2.4G2 Fab fragments as described previously (6Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that Leibowitz 15 medium (L-15) was used instead of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Binding of 125I-2.4G2 Fab fragments (2–3 × 105 cpm) was specific because the addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled Fab fragments inhibited binding by 80–90%. Treatment of cells with nocodazole (6Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), BFA (8Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 67: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), or W7 (13Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out as described. Transcytosis was defined as the fraction of total initially bound Fab fragments present on the surface and released into the compartment opposite that from which Fab fragments had initially been allowed to bind. More than 80% of the transcytosed Fab fragments represented surface-associated material. Experiments were done several times using duplicate or triplicate filters. Staining of cells with a polyclonal anti-FcR serum or with 2.4G2 Fab fragments and internalization of prebound antibodies was carried out as described previously (14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To measure reinternalization of transcytosed receptor-Fab complexes, cells grown on Transwell filters were incubated in the presence of 2.4G2-Fab (2 μg/ml in L-15) in the apical or basolateral chamber for 45 min at 37 °C. After cooling the cells on ice and washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline+, labeled second antibody (2 μg/ml) was allowed to bind to transcytosed molecules for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were either fixed or incubated at 37 °C for another 15 min to allow reinternalization of bound fluorescent antibodies. Following internalization, cells were washed with L-15, pH 2.5, on ice to remove surface bound antibody, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and mounted. Colocalization of internalized (60 min at 37 °C) biotinylated 2.4G2-Fab (1 μg/ml in L-15) with lysosomes was done using the monoclonal antibody AC17 (kindly provided by A. Le Bivic, Marseille) as described (41Höning S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Insertion of newly synthesized receptors into the apical or basolateral cell surface was analyzed as described Hunziker et al. (8Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 67: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the cytosolic tail of FcRn in intracellular transport, we generated chimera in which the ecto- and transmembrane domains of FcγRIIb2 were fused to wild-type or mutant cytosolic domains of FcRn (Fig.1). Tail-less FcγRIIb2 accumulates on the apical surface of MDCK cells because it lacks the cytosolic di-leucine motif required for basolateral sorting and endocytosis (15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,42Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), making it an attractive tag to analyze the role of cytosolic tails in targeting to different intracellular compartments or the basolateral plasma membrane (15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I.

In addition to a chimera encoding the wild-type FcRn tail (FcRII/FcRn), we generated constructs encoding a deletion of the C-terminal third (CT24) or the complete tail (CT4). Because the FcRn tail encodes a di-leucine motif similar to that responsible for basolateral sorting and endocytosis of FcγRIIb2 (43Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,44Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we also constructed chimera encoding alanine substitutions of Leu-22 and/or Leu-23 in the context of the CT24 mutant (CT24 L22A, CT24 L23A, and CT24 L22A,L23A). The different constructs were transfected into MDCK cells, and several clones stably expressing the different receptor chimera were selected and further analyzed. A first indication as to the subcellular distribution of FcRII/FcRn was obtained by permeabilizing cells grown on coverslips and staining with the anti-FcγRII ectodomain monoclonal antibody 2.4G2. FcRII/FcRn predominantly localized to intracellular compartments (Fig.2 A), whereas the tail minus construct was mostly observed on the plasma membrane (Fig.2 B). If cells expressing FcRII/FcRn were incubated with the antibody on ice and then fixed, plasma membrane staining was readily detectable (Fig. 2 C), indicating that a fraction of FcRII/FcRn was present on the plasma membrane at steady state. Antibody was internalized into a vesicular compartment if cells carrying prebound antibody were warmed to 37 °C (Fig. 2 E), showing that the chimeric receptors were able to internalize. In contrast, antibody prebound to cells expressing the tail minus construct (Fig.2 D) was not internalized and could be removed from the cell surface by washing the cells with acid (Fig. 2 F). These results demonstrate that the FcRII/FcRn chimera is present intracellularly and on the plasma membrane and that chimera expressed on the cell surface can be internalized. To determine the kinetics of endocytosis by wild-type and mutant FcRII/FcRn, we followed the internalization of prebound125I-labeled 2.4G2 Fab fragments. Fab fragments were allowed to bind on ice and the cells were then transferred to 37 °C for different periods of time to allow for internalization to occur. After returning the cells on ice, noninternalized Fab fragments were removed by washing with acid, and the fraction that had been internalized was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, chimera encoding the wild-type tail rapidly and efficiently endocytosed Fab fragments and after 10 min of warming the cells, up to 50% of the Fab fragments had been internalized. Although deletion of the C-terminal half of the tail in CT24 led to a reduction in the rate and extent of endocytosis when compared with FcRII/FcRn, this mutant was still capable of significant internalization. In contrast, substitutions of either Leu-22, Leu-23, or both to alanines led to a dramatic reduction in endocytosis of CT24. Nevertheless, internalization by the leucine substitutions was still above that observed for the tail-minus construct. Similar results were obtained for the different mutants if endocytosis from the apical or basolateral cell surface was analyzed in cells grown as polarized monolayers (data not shown). These results indicate that the di-leucine motif in the cytosolic tail plays a critical role for rapid and efficient endocytosis of FcRn. We next determined the steady state distribution of the chimeric proteins to the apical and basolateral domain of polarized MDCK cell monolayers. Cells expressing the different constructs were grown on Transwell filters and allowed to bind 125I-labeled 2.4G2 Fab fragments added from the apical or basolateral compartment at 4 °C, and the radioactivity specifically bound to one or the other surface was quantitated. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 70–80% of the total surface receptors were present on the apical domain of cells expressing the wild-type as well as the CT24 and CT24 L22A,L23A mutants. As expected, also the tail-minus CT4 construct was enriched on the apical surface (14Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Binding experiments using125I-canine transferrin confirmed the basolateral localization of the endogenous transferrin receptor and gp80 was predominantly secreted into the apical medium (data not shown), showing that the predominant apical localization of the different chimeric receptors was not because of a lack of polarization of the different clones. Thus, FcRII/FcRn preferentially localized to the apical surface at equilibrium, and the localization was not significantly altered for the different tail mutants analyzed. To determine whether the apical steady state localization of FcRII/FcRn reflected the direct delivery of newly synthesized receptors to the apical domain, we monitored the appearance of a cohort of newly synthesized receptors on the apical and basolateral cell surface. Cells grown on Transwell units were pulse labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and labeled proteins were chased to the cell surface for 30 or 45 min. Cells were then cooled on ice, and the apical or basolateral surface was biotinylated. Following cell lysis, total receptors were immunoprecipitated. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitated receptors was used to determine the total amount of receptor labeled, the rest was precipitated with streptavidin-agarose to isolate molecules that had appeared on the cell surface. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography and the amount of biotinylated surface receptors was normalized to the amount of total labeled receptors for each filter. As shown in Fig. 4 B, an equal fraction of pulse-labeled FcRII/FcRn was biotinylated from the apical and basolateral side, indicating that cell surface transport was not vectorial. Also CT24 and CT24 L22A,L23A were inserted to similar extents into the apical and basolateral surface, indicating that the mutations did not alter the nonvectorial transport of FcRII/FcRn to the plasma membrane. In contrast, however, the CT4 tail-minus construct was preferentially transported to the apical domain, consistent with previous studies (15Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I.

Similar results were obtained if cells were chased for 30 min in the continuous presence of the anti-FcγRII antiserum (42Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) to detect labeled receptors, which may only transiently be exposed on the cell surface (data not shown). These experiments thus show that regardless of the predominant apical localization at equilibrium, FcRII/FcRn and the mutants are nonvectorially transported from the trans-Golgi network to the apical and basolateral surface. Despite the nonpolarized membrane insertion, FcRII/FcRn was enriched on the apical domain at steady state, indicating that transcytosis may play a role in receptor distribution. We therefore analyzed transcytosis of125I-2.4G2 Fab fragments prebound at 4 °C from the apical or basolateral surface of MDCK cell monolayers. After washing nonbound Fab fragments, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time and returned on ice. The fraction of Fab fragments released into the apical or basolateral compartment or present on the apical and basolateral plasma membrane or inside the cells was quantitated. Fab fragments present on the membrane or in the medium opposite the compartment of addition at a given time were defined as having undergone transcytosis. Fab fragments preboun"

To characterize their regulatory mechanisms in neurons, we compared glutamate-induced phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV and CaM kinase II in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We observed that dephosphorylation of these kinases followed different time courses, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms for each kinase. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and PP2A, increased the phosphorylation of both kinases. In contrast, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, showed different effects: the phosphorylation and activity of CaM kinase IV were significantly increased with this inhibitor, but those of CaM kinase II were not significantly increased. Cyclosporin A treatment of neurons increased phosphorylation of Thr196 of CaM kinase IV, the activated form with CaM kinase kinase, which was recognized with an anti-phospho-Thr196 antibody. Moreover, recombinant CaM kinase IV was dephosphorylated and inactivated with calcineurin as well as with PP1, PP2A, and PP2C in vitro. These results suggest that CaM kinase IV, but not CaM kinase II, is directly regulated with calcineurin.

These increases activate Ca2+-dependent molecules involved in signaling, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases). Among the six types of known CaM kinases (namely, myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and CaM kinases I, II, III, and IV), CaM kinase II has been the most extensively characterized. It is abundantly expressed in the brain and plays an important functional role in hippocampal long-term potentiations (1Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ito I. Hidaka H. Sugiyama H. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 121: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Silva A.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21830-21836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CaM kinase II shows Ca2+-independent activity, which prolongs its activity even after intracellular Ca2+ concentrations return to basal levels. CaM kinase IV is also abundant in the brain, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and particularly the nuclei of cerebellar granule cells (6Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of its expression in the latter, this enzyme is also called CaM kinase Gr (granule). In addition, CaM kinase IV is found in the thymus and testis (7Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting functional importance not only in the brain but in the immune system and reproductive cells. The genomic structure of CaM kinase IV is quite unique: both CaM kinase IV and calspermin, a male germ cell-specific CaM-binding protein, are derived from a single CaM kinase IV gene (7Means A.R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5784-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CaM kinase IV has a broad substrate specificity and is thought to be multifunctional (8Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as is CaM kinase II. Although less is known about the function of CaM kinase IV than that of CaM kinase II, recent work shows important biochemical and molecular differences between both kinases. CaM kinase IV functions as a monomer rather than an oligomer (8Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM kinase IV requires phosphorylation at Thr196 with another CaM kinase, CaM kinase kinase, for full activation (12Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), rather than autophosphorylation, as typically observed in CaM kinase II. CaM kinase IV is localized in the nuclei of neurons (9Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), possibly associating with chromatin by the polyglutamate sequence in its C-terminal region, whereas the limited isoforms of CaM kinase II (αB and δB isoforms) exist in the nuclei. The nuclear localization of CaM kinase IV suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression. CaM kinase IV can phosphorylate Ser133, the essential site for activation of CREB (16Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is essential for the activation of CRE-containing promoters. In an assay using cultured hippocampal neurons, it was reported that CREB phosphorylation induced by synaptic stimulations was mediated with CaM kinase IV (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ca2+-induced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that has a CRE motif in its promoter region (18Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) was reported to be mediated by CaM kinase IV (19Shieh P.B. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+- and CRE-mediated gene expression is controlled with CaM kinase IV in vivo. Given the functional differences in these kinases, it is likely that CaM kinase IV and CaM kinase II are regulated by different mechanisms.To characterize the differences between CaM kinase IV and CaM kinase II in the central nervous system and focus on the differences in the regulatory mechanisms of these kinases, we investigated glutamate-induced phosphorylation and the effects of protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, using primary cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We also examined the susceptibility of recombinant CaM kinase IV to protein phosphatases.DISCUSSIONIn previous reports, we have investigated the activation of CaM kinase II by autophosphorylation in response to neurotransmitters, growth factors, and hormones in various cells (rat embryo fibroblasts (29Ohta Y. Ohba T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11540-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hippocampal neurons (23Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cerebellar granule cells (5Fukunaga K. Rich D.P. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21830-21836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NG 108-15 cells (30Yamakawa T. Fukunaga K. Higashida H. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1992; 597: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), hippocampal slices (1Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat cortical astrocytes (31Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MIN 6 cells (32Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (33Yanagihara N. Toyohira Y. Yamamoto H. Ohta Y. Tsutsui M. Miyamoto E. Izumi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar)). This study describes the activation of CaM kinase IV in hippocampal neurons by stimulation with an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. In this connection, Bito et al. (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) reported that CREB phosphorylation caused by synaptic stimulation or by high potassium-induced depolarization was mediated by CaM kinase IV activation in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, Park and Soderling (26Park I.K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported activation of CaM kinase IV in Jurkat T lymphocytes by stimulation of the antigen receptor CD3. Thus, CaM kinase IV as well as CaM kinase II in living cells is activated in response to neurotransmitters. This is the first report to show directly that CaM kinase IV is activated in neurons by glutamate stimulation, an observation lending support to the idea that CaM kinase IV is involved in Ca2+-mediated gene expression.Although CsA alone had no effect on the phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV in cultured hippocampal neurons, the combination of glutamate and CsA greatly increased its phosphorylation compared with the increases observed with glutamate alone (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no difference in phosphorylation of CaM kinase II was observed when stimulation with glutamate alone was compared with stimulation with glutamate plus CsA. This finding suggested that calcineurin could dephosphorylate CaM kinase IV but not CaM kinase II. The CaM kinase II results were consistent with in vitro observations made in a previous report (34Goto S. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Iwasa T. Matsukado Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-CaM kinase IV phosphorylated with GST-CaM kinase kinase could be dephosphorylated with calcineurin purified from rat brain. In addition, FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, was reported to delay the time course of dephosphorylation of CREB phosphorylated with CaM kinase IV (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), suggesting the regulation of CaM kinase IV or CaM kinase kinase with calcineurin. On the other hand, okadaic acid combined with glutamate stimulated the phosphorylation of both CaM kinases IV and II (Figs. 1, C and D). This suggests that okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases are involved in the dephosphorylation of CaM kinases IV and II. CaM kinase II could be dephosphorylated with protein phosphatases 1 (35Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8581-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2A (36Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and 2C (21Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, GST-CaM kinase IV could also be dephosphorylated with purified protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2C in addition to calcineurin. In contrast to this study, Park and Soderling (26Park I.K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 could not dephosphorylate CaM kinase IV. The difference between our results and their data has not yet been clarified. We suppose that it may be due to the difference in the isoforms of protein phosphatase 1; they used an α-isoform, whereas we used a human γ-isoform that was purchased commercially. Because both of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 are recombinant, the preparations have no contamination by other protein phosphatases.CaM kinase IV has multiple autophosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region (37Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and in a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal region (38Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6903-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in addition to the Thr196 phosphorylated with CaM kinase kinase. Although the relationship between kinase activity and N-terminal autophosphorylation is not yet clearly understood, C-terminal autophosphorylation was reported to cause inactivation of CaM kinase IV (38Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6903-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the physiological significance of this phosphorylation is still unclear, it is important to determine the protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of the autophosphorylated C-terminal because dephosphorylation of this site may reactivate CaM kinase IV.Because it was shown in this study that CaM kinase IV was dephosphorylated with calcineurin (Fig. 5), the interaction between CaM kinase IV and calcineurin is predicted to occur in neurons. CaM kinase IV, which is primarily localized to the nuclei of neurons (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), has also been seen in the axons of neurons (9Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although calcineurin is thought to be localized to the cytoplasm, it has been reported that calcineurin may translocate to the nucleus with NF-AT after ionomycin treatment (39Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), which shows Ca2+-mediated translocation of calcineurin to the nucleus. It is unclear how the phosphorylation state of nuclear CaM kinase IV compares with that of the putative cytoplasmic form and whether translocation of calcineurin with glutamate stimulation occurs in neurons. How these enzymes interact should be elucidated in a further study.This study focused on the dephosphorylation of CaM kinase IV in cultured hippocampal neurons. Because CaM kinase IV is activated with CaM kinase kinase in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner, CaM kinase kinase is also activated in response to glutamate. Because it was reported that CaM kinase kinase showed strong autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (40Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16073-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we do not exclude the possibility that activation of CaM kinase IV may be controlled by the regulation of CaM kinase kinase with protein phosphatases.

These increases activate Ca2+-dependent molecules involved in signaling, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases). Among the six types of known CaM kinases (namely, myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and CaM kinases I, II, III, and IV), CaM kinase II has been the most extensively characterized. It is abundantly expressed in the brain and plays an important functional role in hippocampal long-term potentiations (1Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ito I. Hidaka H. Sugiyama H. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 121: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Silva A.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21830-21836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CaM kinase II shows Ca2+-independent activity, which prolongs its activity even after intracellular Ca2+ concentrations return to basal levels. CaM kinase IV is also abundant in the brain, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and particularly the nuclei of cerebellar granule cells (6Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of its expression in the latter, this enzyme is also called CaM kinase Gr (granule). In addition, CaM kinase IV is found in the thymus and testis (7Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting functional importance not only in the brain but in the immune system and reproductive cells. The genomic structure of CaM kinase IV is quite unique: both CaM kinase IV and calspermin, a male germ cell-specific CaM-binding protein, are derived from a single CaM kinase IV gene (7Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Ohmstede C.A. Bland M.M. Merril B.M. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5784-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CaM kinase IV has a broad substrate specificity and is thought to be multifunctional (8Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as is CaM kinase II. Although less is known about the function of CaM kinase IV than that of CaM kinase II, recent work shows important biochemical and molecular differences between both kinases. CaM kinase IV functions as a monomer rather than an oligomer (8Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM kinase IV requires phosphorylation at Thr196 with another CaM kinase, CaM kinase kinase, for full activation (12Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), rather than autophosphorylation, as typically observed in CaM kinase II. CaM kinase IV is localized in the nuclei of neurons (9Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), possibly associating with chromatin by the polyglutamate sequence in its C-terminal region, whereas the limited isoforms of CaM kinase II (αB and δB isoforms) exist in the nuclei. The nuclear localization of CaM kinase IV suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression. CaM kinase IV can phosphorylate Ser133, the essential site for activation of CREB (16Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is essential for the activation of CRE-containing promoters. In an assay using cultured hippocampal neurons, it was reported that CREB phosphorylation induced by synaptic stimulations was mediated with CaM kinase IV (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ca2+-induced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that has a CRE motif in its promoter region (18Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) was reported to be mediated by CaM kinase IV (19Shieh P.B. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+- and CRE-mediated gene expression is controlled with CaM kinase IV in vivo. Given the functional differences in these kinases, it is likely that CaM kinase IV and CaM kinase II are regulated by different mechanisms. To characterize the differences between CaM kinase IV and CaM kinase II in the central nervous system and focus on the differences in the regulatory mechanisms of these kinases, we investigated glutamate-induced phosphorylation and the effects of protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, using primary cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We also examined the susceptibility of recombinant CaM kinase IV to protein phosphatases. DISCUSSIONIn previous reports, we have investigated the activation of CaM kinase II by autophosphorylation in response to neurotransmitters, growth factors, and hormones in various cells (rat embryo fibroblasts (29Ohta Y. Ohba T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11540-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hippocampal neurons (23Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cerebellar granule cells (5Fukunaga K. Rich D.P. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21830-21836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NG 108-15 cells (30Yamakawa T. Fukunaga K. Higashida H. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1992; 597: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), hippocampal slices (1Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat cortical astrocytes (31Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MIN 6 cells (32Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (33Yanagihara N. Toyohira Y. Yamamoto H. Ohta Y. Tsutsui M. Miyamoto E. Izumi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar)). This study describes the activation of CaM kinase IV in hippocampal neurons by stimulation with an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. In this connection, Bito et al. (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) reported that CREB phosphorylation caused by synaptic stimulation or by high potassium-induced depolarization was mediated by CaM kinase IV activation in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, Park and Soderling (26Park I.K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported activation of CaM kinase IV in Jurkat T lymphocytes by stimulation of the antigen receptor CD3. Thus, CaM kinase IV as well as CaM kinase II in living cells is activated in response to neurotransmitters. This is the first report to show directly that CaM kinase IV is activated in neurons by glutamate stimulation, an observation lending support to the idea that CaM kinase IV is involved in Ca2+-mediated gene expression.Although CsA alone had no effect on the phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV in cultured hippocampal neurons, the combination of glutamate and CsA greatly increased its phosphorylation compared with the increases observed with glutamate alone (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no difference in phosphorylation of CaM kinase II was observed when stimulation with glutamate alone was compared with stimulation with glutamate plus CsA. This finding suggested that calcineurin could dephosphorylate CaM kinase IV but not CaM kinase II. The CaM kinase II results were consistent with in vitro observations made in a previous report (34Goto S. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Iwasa T. Matsukado Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-CaM kinase IV phosphorylated with GST-CaM kinase kinase could be dephosphorylated with calcineurin purified from rat brain. In addition, FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, was reported to delay the time course of dephosphorylation of CREB phosphorylated with CaM kinase IV (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), suggesting the regulation of CaM kinase IV or CaM kinase kinase with calcineurin. On the other hand, okadaic acid combined with glutamate stimulated the phosphorylation of both CaM kinases IV and II (Figs. 1, C and D). This suggests that okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases are involved in the dephosphorylation of CaM kinases IV and II. CaM kinase II could be dephosphorylated with protein phosphatases 1 (35Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8581-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2A (36Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and 2C (21Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, GST-CaM kinase IV could also be dephosphorylated with purified protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2C in addition to calcineurin. In contrast to this study, Park and Soderling (26Park I.K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 could not dephosphorylate CaM kinase IV. The difference between our results and their data has not yet been clarified. We suppose that it may be due to the difference in the isoforms of protein phosphatase 1; they used an α-isoform, whereas we used a human γ-isoform that was purchased commercially. Because both of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 are recombinant, the preparations have no contamination by other protein phosphatases.CaM kinase IV has multiple autophosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region (37Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and in a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal region (38Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6903-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in addition to the Thr196 phosphorylated with CaM kinase kinase. Although the relationship between kinase activity and N-terminal autophosphorylation is not yet clearly understood, C-terminal autophosphorylation was reported to cause inactivation of CaM kinase IV (38Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6903-6910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the physiological significance of this phosphorylation is still unclear, it is important to determine the protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of the autophosphorylated C-terminal because dephosphorylation of this site may reactivate CaM kinase IV.Because it was shown in this study that CaM kinase IV was dephosphorylated with calcineurin (Fig. 5), the interaction between CaM kinase IV and calcineurin is predicted to occur in neurons. CaM kinase IV, which is primarily localized to the nuclei of neurons (17Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), has also been seen in the axons of neurons (9Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although calcineurin is thought to be localized to the cytoplasm, it has been reported that calcineurin may translocate to the nucleus with NF-AT after ionomycin treatment (39Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), which shows Ca2+-mediated translocation of calcineurin to the nucleus. It is unclear how the phosphorylation state of nuclear CaM kinase IV compares with that of the putative cytoplasmic form and whether translocation of calcineurin with glutamate stimulation occurs in neurons. How these enzymes interact should be elucidated in a further study.This study focused on the dephosphorylation of CaM kinase IV in cultured hippocampal neurons. Because CaM kinase IV is activated with CaM kinase kinase in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner, CaM kinase kinase is also activated in response to glutamate. Because it was reported that CaM kinase kinase showed strong autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (40Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1964523246,"We previously reported that ceramide released from glycosphingolipids (GSLs) by endoglycoceramidase was directly metabolized to GSLs, and thus the content of GSLs was constantly maintained in B16 melanoma cells (Ito, M., and Komori, H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem.271, 12655–12660). In this study, the metabolism of ceramide released from sphingomyelin (SM) by bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) was examined using B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with bacterial SMase effectively hydrolyzed SM on the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1ceramide was significantly increased. Interestingly, UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase-1 (GlcT-1) activity and GSL synthesis, but not SM synthesis or sphingosine generation, were found to be up-regulated by SMase treatment. The up-regulation of GSL synthesis seemed to occur at both the transcriptional and post-translational steps of GlcT-1 synthesis. Accumulation of ceramide by bacterial SMase was much higher in GM95 cells than in the parental cells. When the enzyme was removed from the culture medium, the intracellular ceramide level in B16 cells, but not that in the mutant cells, normalized. No rapid restoration of SM in either of the cell lines was observed after removal of the enzyme. SMase treatment strongly inhibited DNA synthesis in GM95 cells but not that in B16 cells. In the presence ofd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of GlcT-1, SMase treatment markedly increased the ceramide content and thus inhibited DNA synthesis in B16 cells. Our study provides the first evidence that GlcT-1 functions to regulate the level of intracellular ceramide by glycosylation of the ceramide when it is present in excess. We previously reported that ceramide released from glycosphingolipids (GSLs) by endoglycoceramidase was directly metabolized to GSLs, and thus the content of GSLs was constantly maintained in B16 melanoma cells (Ito, M., and Komori, H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem.271, 12655–12660). In this study, the metabolism of ceramide released from sphingomyelin (SM) by bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) was examined using B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with bacterial SMase effectively hydrolyzed SM on the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1ceramide was significantly increased. Interestingly, UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase-1 (GlcT-1) activity and GSL synthesis, but not SM synthesis or sphingosine generation, were found to be up-regulated by SMase treatment. The up-regulation of GSL synthesis seemed to occur at both the transcriptional and post-translational steps of GlcT-1 synthesis. Accumulation of ceramide by bacterial SMase was much higher in GM95 cells than in the parental cells. When the enzyme was removed from the culture medium, the intracellular ceramide level in B16 cells, but not that in the mutant cells, normalized. No rapid restoration of SM in either of the cell lines was observed after removal of the enzyme. SMase treatment strongly inhibited DNA synthesis in GM95 cells but not that in B16 cells. In the presence ofd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of GlcT-1, SMase treatment markedly increased the ceramide content and thus inhibited DNA synthesis in B16 cells. Our study provides the first evidence that GlcT-1 functions to regulate the level of intracellular ceramide by glycosylation of the ceramide when it is present in excess. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) 1The abbreviations used are:GSL, glycosphingolipid; C6-ceramide, N-hexanoylsphingosine; CMH, ceramide monohexoside; GlcT-1, UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase-1; GM3, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1ceramide; MEM, minimum essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDMP, d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino3-morpholino-1-propanol; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; TLC, thin layer chromatography; FBS, fetal bovine serum. and sphingomyelin (SM) are characteristic components of vertebrate plasma membranes and have the same hydrophobic residue, ceramide, which consists of a sphingosine and a fatty acid. GSLs have been defined as tumor antigens, receptors for microbes and their toxins, and possible modulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interactions (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 2Karlsson K.-A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 309-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 3Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S.

Recently, ceramide has emerged as a novel second messenger for intracellular signaling pathways responding to various cytokines and stress (4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that a signaling ceramide is produced from SM by the action of endogenous neutral (5Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acid sphingomyelinase (SMase; EC3.1.4.12) (6Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or by de novo synthesis (7Bose B. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism of regulation of intracellular level of ceramide, which should be strictly regulated within cells. Endoglycoceramidase (EC3.2.1.123) is a GSL-specific enzyme fromRhodococcus sp. that hydrolyzes the glycosidic linkage of ceramide and sugar chains of various GSLs (8Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14278-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface GSLs of various erythrocytes (9Ito M. Ikegami Y. Tai T. Yamagata T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and cultured mammalian cells (10Ji L. Ito M. Zhang G. Yamagata T. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were hydrolyzed by the purified rhodococcal endoglycoceramidase (11Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the assistance of its protein activator (12Ito M. Ikegami Y. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7919-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that treatment of B16 melanoma cells with a microbial endoglycoceramidase activated GSL synthesis via transient up-regulation of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase-1 (GlcT-1, glucosylceramide synthase; EC2.4.1.80) (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a result, cell surface NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1ceramide (GM3), the end product of GSL synthesis in B16 cells, was restored quickly when the enzyme was removed from the culture medium (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effects of bacterial SMase on the metabolism of GSLs and SM using B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells, which lack GlcT-1 (14Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although GSLs were quickly restored after endoglycoceramidase treatment, restoration of SM was not observed after treatment with bacterial SMase in B16 melanoma cells. Interestingly, ceramides generated from not only GSLs but also SM by the microbial enzymes were primarily glucosylated by GlcT-1, metabolized to GM3, and then transported to the plasma membrane. Ceramide was accumulated during SMase treatment in GM95 or B16 cells in the presence ofd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) (15Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Inokuchi J. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 183-213PubMed Google Scholar) or N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (16Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), potent inhibitors of GlcT-1. These results suggest a biological role of GlcT-1 in the regulation of intracellular ceramide content. Because excess generation of ceramide is toxic to cells, GlcT-1 seems to function for expulsion of ceramide from the cell. This regulation, regarded as a putative detoxification mechanism, may function as a defense against an unexpected increase of ceramide, which could be caused by various forms of stress, e.g. infections with pathogenic microorganisms that produce SMase or endoglycoceramidase. This paper also indicates the biological role of ceramide as a modulator of the overall synthesis of GSLs by regulating GlcT-1 at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Monoclonal antibody M2590 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM were purchased from Cosmo Bio Co., SMases from Staphylococcus aureus andBacillus cereus were obtained from Sigma and Funakoshi Co., respectively. d-Threo-PDMP andN-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide) were purchased from Matreya, and thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Silica Gel 60) were from Merck. 14C-Labeled Gal, serine, choline, and [32P]ATP were obtained from DuPont NEN, and [3H]thymidine, [14C]palmitic acid, and [14C]UDP-glucose were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol kinase was kindly provided by Dr. T. Okazaki (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). All other chemicals were of the highest grade available. All experiments using B16 melanoma and the GlcT-1-deficient mutant GM95 cells (14Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were conducted at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2incubator. SMase from S. aureus was used for all experiments except that shown in Fig. 2, in which the enzyme from B. cereus was used. Cells were incubated in 200 μl of MEM supplemented with 5% FBS containing 1 μCi of [14C]Gal, [14C]serine, or [14C]choline for the times indicated. Cells (1 × 105) were harvested by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 5 min) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sphingolipids were extracted with 750 μl of i-propanol/hexane/water (55:35:10, v/v) in a sonicator for 20 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants obtained were dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied to TLC plates, which were developed with chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2(5:4:1, v/v) for GSLs and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:30:8:5, v/v) for SM. Radiolabeled sphingolipids separated on TLC plates were analyzed and quantified using a BAS1000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Identification of C6-ceramide GSLs was done by the method described by Komori and Ito (17Komori H. Ito M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled total lipid extracts from cells were spotted onto TLC plates (10 × 10 cm). The first chromatographic run was performed with chloroform/methanol/formic acid/H2O (65:25:8.9:1.1, v/v). The second run was performed with chloroform/methanol/5 n NH4OH (50:40:10, v/v) perpendicular to the original direction. Then the third run was performed with diethylether in the opposite direction to the second run to separate ceramides from other neutral lipids. Spots on the TLC plates were identified using authentic standards (18Yokoyama K. Nojiri H. Suzuki M. Setaka M. Suzuki A. Nojima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total lipids, extracted from 5–7 × 106 cells with a mixture ofi-propanol/hexane/water (55:35:10, v/v), were applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:30:8:5, v/v). SM was visualized with Coomasie Brilliant Blue (19Nakamura K. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and quantified using a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with reflection mode set at 580 nm. Ceramide was extracted from cells (2 × 106) with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and 0.8 ml of water was added and mixed well. The organic and aqueous phases were subsequently separated by addition of 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of water followed by vigorous shaking and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The organic phase was carefully removed and transferred to a new tube, and the samples were dried under N2 gas. The amount of ceramide was measured usingsn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase as described (20Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Ceramide 1-phosphate and phosphatidic acid were separated by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) as a solvent system. B16 cells (1 × 106) were incubated on ice for 30 min with 100 μl of monoclonal antibody M2590 specific to GM3 (NeuAc) (21Hirabayashi Y. Hamaoka A. Matsumoto M. Matsubara T. Tagawa M.S. Wakabayashi S. Taniguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13328-13333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing twice with PBS, B16 cells were treated with 100 μl of secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM) on ice for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). Cells (2 × 104) were treated with 20 milliunits of SMase in 200 μl of MEM supplemented with 5% FBS in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 14 h. After incubation, 10 μl of PBS containing 0.1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to the medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, cells were collected using a Combi 11025 cell harvester (Skatron), and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. GlcT-1 activity was determined according to the method of Basu et al. (22Basu S. Kaufman B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1388-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. To prepare cell lysates, cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Standard incubation mixture (50 μl) contained 0.5% Triton X-100, 500 μm [14C]UDP-glucose (0.02 μCi/reaction), 0.3 mm ceramide (type III), and cell lysate (500 μg as protein) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at 32 °C for 2 h, 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added to terminate the reaction, and the lower layer was applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 (65:25:4, v/v). The [14C]glucosylceramide produced was determined with an imaging analyzer (BAS1000, Fuji Film). Fifty μg of C67-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diozole-ceramide was mixed with 500 μg of phosphatidylcholine and 10 μg of sulfatide in 1 ml of distilled water to form liposomes. To prepare cell lysates, cells (5 × 105) were washed with 1 ml of PBS and were suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The incubation mixture contained 10 μl of liposomes, 500 μm CDP-choline, 1 mm EDTA, and cell lysate (50 μg as protein) in 50 μl of 16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at 32 °C for 15 min, 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added to terminate the reaction, and the lower layer was applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform/methanol/12 mmMgCl2 (65:25:4, v/v). The NBD-SM produced was determined with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation, 475 nm; emission, 525 nm). The activity measured by this method appeared to show the total activity of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and CDP-choline:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase. Protein contents of cell extracts were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total RNA was isolated from cells with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Aliquots of 30 μg of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 18% formaldehyde, and transblotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 1.2-kbBamHI-XhoI cDNA fragment of the mouse GlcT-1 gene was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h in 5 × SSPE (750 mm NaCl, 43.3 mm NaH2PO4, 6.25 mm EDTA) containing 50% formamide, 4% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), and32P-labeled probe (23Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membrane was washed continuously with 2 × SSPE containing 0.5% SDS, 1 × SSPE containing 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 × SSPE containing 0.5% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min at each step. The membranes were also hybridized by the method described above but with a β-actin cDNA probe for normalization of mRNA levels. mRNA levels were quantified using an imaging analyzer (BAS1000, Fuji Film). NBD-labeled C6-ceramide was added to cells (1 × 106) and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2incubator for the times indicated. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 5 min) and washed twice with PBS. Sphingolipids were extracted with 750 μl ofi-propanol/hexane/water (55:35:10, v/v) in a sonicator for 20 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants obtained were dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform/methanol/12 mmMgCl2 (65:25:4, v/v). The NBD-sphingolipids produced were determined with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation, 475 nm; emission, 525 nm). We previously reported that endoglycoceramidase treatment of B16 melanoma cells stimulated GSL synthesis (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because ceramide is the common lipid backbone of GSLs and SM, we examined the metabolism of SM-derived ceramide using bacterial SMase instead of endoglycoceramidase. The ceramide portions of SM and GSLs of B16 cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine, washed with fresh MEM, and then treated with SMase from S. aureus. Two-dimensional TLC revealed that SMase treatment markedly reduced the content of [14C]SM to 49% of that in controls, whereas that of [14C]GM3 simultaneously increased to 197% of the control level (Fig. 1 A). To avoid the influence of de novo synthesis of ceramide, the same experiment was conducted but in the presence of Fumonisin B1, an inhibitor for acyl-CoA:sphinganine N-acyltransferase (24Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar). Even in the presence of Fumonisin B1, the increase in GM3 concomitant with the decrease in SM was observed after SMase treatment (Fig.1 A), indicating that the increase in GM3 level was not attributable to an increase in de novo synthesis of ceramide. During SMase treatment, [14C]Gal uptake into ceramide monohexoside (CMH) and GM3 was increased in B16 cells (Fig.1 B). However, the level of sphingosine was not changed after SMase treatment (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that increased GM3 was metabolized from SM-derived ceramide by direct glycosylation but not from sphingoid base salvaged from hydrolysis of ceramide. The increase of GM3 was also confirmed by flow cytometry using a GM3-specific monoclonal antibody, M2590, indicating that the increased GM3 was actually transported to the cell surface (Fig.1 C). An increase in GSL synthesis during SMase treatment was also observed in not only B16 cells but also other cell lines, as shown by the synthesis of CMH in HL60 human myelocytic leukemia cells, which increased by not less than 2-fold during SMase treatment. The GlcT-1 activity and de novo synthesis of GSLs in B16 cells were examined with or without SMase treatment. Interestingly, GlcT-1 activity in the cell lysate increased by ∼2-fold by the enzyme treatment, whereas SM synthase activity was not affected (Fig.2 A). It was confirmed that GM95 cells completely lacked GlcT-1 activity (data not shown). The activation of GlcT-1 seems to occur post-translationally, because even in the presence of cycloheximide an increase in GSL synthesis was observed after SMase treatment (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, Northern blotting analysis indicated that SMase treatment slightly activated transcription of the GlcT-1 gene (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of B16 cells with C6-ceramide also increased GlcT-1 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 D). These results indicate that up-regulation of GSL synthesis by SMase treatment occurs at the level of both transcription and post-translation of the GlcT-1 gene, and also that ceramide could modulate the overall synthesis of GSLs via regulation of GlcT-1. The content of GM3 in B16 cells was reduced by endoglycoceramidase treatment but recovered quickly after the enzyme was removed from the culture medium (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, no restoration in SM content was observed after removal of SMase when B16 cells were prelabeled with [14C]choline (Fig.3). GM95 cells also showed no rapid restoration of SM (Fig. 3). It should be noted that this restoration was estimated by a base exchange reaction between ceramide and phosphatidylcholine, which is considered to be the major pathway of SM synthesis (25Marggaraf W.-D. Kanfer J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, a portion of SM (<25%) appeared to recover in B16 cells after removal of the enzyme and reculture for 9 h when the SM mass was estimated by Coomasie Brilliant Blue staining. This increase in SM seemed to be derived from de novosynthesis of ceramide and not from the recycling of ceramide. The ceramide content of B16 cells, which was measured bysn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase assay, increased by ∼2-fold after SMase treatment for 3 h but gradually decreased after removal of the enzyme and returned to the basal level after 6–9 h. In contrast, in GlcT-1-deficient mutant GM95 cells the accumulation of ceramide by SMase treatment was much higher than in the parental cells and was maintained after the enzyme was removed from the culture medium (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, SMase treatment of B16 cells in the presence of PDMP, a potent inhibitor of GlcT-1, markedly increased the accumulation of ceramide (Fig. 4 B). Ceramide generation in B16 cells by bacterial SMase was also enhanced 2.6 times by addition ofN-butyldeoxynojirimycin at 200 μm, which is an another inhibitor of GlcT-1 (16Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that GlcT-1 functions to remove the excess ceramide generated by bacterial SMase. Although ceramide functions as a novel class of second messenger (4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), the excess generation of ceramide must be harmful to the cell. As shown in Fig.5 A, DNA synthesis of GM95 cells measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine was significantly inhibited by bacterial SMase treatment, whereas this enzyme treatment seemed to have no effect on that of B16 cells (Fig.5 A). However, in the presence of PDMP, SMase treatment appeared to be harmful for B16 cells (Fig. 5 A). The degree of inhibition of DNA synthesis was consistent with that of accumulation of ceramide (Fig. 4). Hidari et al. (26Hidari K.I.-P.J. Ichikawa S. Fujita T. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14636-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that the treatment of GM95 cells with the bacterial SMase disrupted cell-substratum adhesion, and the cells were peeled off from dishes. However, in this experiment a much lower concentration of SMase was used to avoid disrupting the adhesion. The effects of the short chain ceramide, C6-ceramide, on DNA synthesis of B16 and GM95 cells were also examined. Incubation with 50 μm C6-ceramide for 3 h strongly suppressed DNA synthesis in GM95 cells but not in B16 cells (Fig. 5 B). This result is consistent with that using SMase (Fig. 5 A). When C6-ceramide was added to B16 cell cultures in the presence of [14C]Gal, C6-CMH and C6-GM3 were generated, both of which were also released into the medium (Fig.6 A). However, glycosylation of the short chain ceramide was not found in cultures of GM95 cells (Fig.6 A). To examine the ratio for conversion of ceramide to GSLs and SM, NBD-C6-ceramide was added to cultures of B16 and GM95 cells. The NBD-C6-ceramide was exhausted in B16 cells much more rapidly than in GM95 cells (Fig. 6 B). In B16 cells, NBD-C6-ceramide was converted to NBD-C6-CMH and NBD-C6-SM at the same rate by 15 min, but thereafter the generation of NBD-C6-CMH was much faster than that of NBD-C6-SM. In GM95 cells, NBD-C6-ceramide was converted to NBD-C6-SM, but not to NBD-C6-GSLs, and the conversion reached a plateau by 15 min when 70% of NBD-C6-ceramide still remained in the cells. These results indicated that the exclusion of ceramide in B16 cells was mainly achieved by glycosylation. The preference for glycosylation of ceramide seems to be restricted to ceramide generated from GSLs (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and SM on the plasma membrane, because the de novo synthesis of GM3 and SM in B16 cells was almost 1:1 when [14C]serine was used as a precursor and chased for 30 min and also 18 h. In conclusion, this study has clearly demonstrated the biological role of GlcT-1 in regulation of the intracellular ceramide content;i.e. genetic and pharmacological blockade of GlcT-1 results in accumulation of ceramide and inhibition of DNA synthesis after SMase treatment in B16 melanoma cells. Recently, Zhang et al. (27Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reported the expression of a recombinant B. cereus SMase in Molt-4 leukemia cells. After the transfection of the gene and stable expression of the SMase, intracellular ceramide content increased, resulting in induction of apoptosis. However, exogenously added B. cereus SMase, despite causing a greater elevation of ceramide level, did not induce apoptosis in Molt-4 cells (27Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This result suggested the existence of two distinct SM pools, one of which is accessible by endogenous SMase and the other by exogenous SMase. The former seems to be responsible for transduction of the apoptotic signal, and the turnovers of these two pools might be somewhat different. On the other hand, some reports indicated that exogenous bacterial SMase had biological effects on cells. For example, the Streptomyces SMase enhanced the action of subthreshold vitamin D3 in inducing HL60 cell differentiation (28Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzyme from S. aureus induced apoptosis of U937 cells (29Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). In the present study, treatment of B16 cells with bacterial SMase inhibited DNA synthesis under conditions of genetic or pharmacological blockade of GlcT-1. These results suggest that the localization and topology of SM and their susceptibility to SMase differ according to cell type. Luberto and Hannun (30Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of human lung fibroblast WI38 cells with bacterial SMase resulted in a decrease in SM level and concomitant generation of ceramide. This ceramide level decreased very slowly in the cells, but there was little restoration of SM content. In contrast, SV40-transformed cells, in which the activity of SM synthase (phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C) was found to be 3-fold higher than that in parental cells, cleared ceramide much more rapidly and regenerated SM. The authors argued the potential significance of SM synthase for regulation of intracellular ceramide levels in the fibroblasts. We showed, on the other hand, that in B16 melanoma cells the ceramides generated from SM as well as GSLs (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by microbial enzymes were primarily glucosylated by GlcT-1 and metabolized to GM3. This discrepancy may be attributable to the balance between GlcT-1 and SM synthase activities in cells, which is genetically defined depending on the origin of cells or their phenotype and might be affected by other environmental factors. The present study revealed that ceramide generated on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by bacterial SMase was directly, but not via the sphingoid-base salvage pathway (31Gillard B.K. Clement R. Colucci-Guyon E. Babinet C. Schwarzmann G. Taki T. Kasama T. Marcus D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), metabolized to GSLs in B16 melanoma cells. Because the catalytic domain of GlcT-1 is located on the cytosolic side of the Golgi membrane (32Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the generated ceramide must be translocated to the outer leaflet of the Golgi membrane before it becomes accessible to the enzyme. Although the transportation of ceramide to the Golgi membrane remains unclear, our findings suggest that the transport of ceramide in protein-directed (33Kok J.W. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Klappe K. Alexander C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21128-21136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and vesicle-independent manners (34Kok J.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is significant. Many pathogenic and opportunistic microbes produce SMases, some of which have been identified as hemolysins and cytotoxins (35Titball R.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 347-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that cell surface SM of vertebrates might be exposed to the action of microbial SMase, which may result in the elevation of the intracellular ceramide level. Because the excess generation of ceramide must be toxic for the cell, the exclusion of ceramide from the cell by glycosylation can be regarded as a mechanism of defense against infection by SMase-producing pathogens. It is interesting to note that many opportunistic pathogens can also produce endoglycoceramidase extracellularly (13Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lavie et al. (36Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol.

The reverse multidrug resistance drug tamoxifen was found to inhibit GlcT-1, resulting in a decrease in the level of glucosylceramide and an increase in that of ceramide. This drug as well as 1-phenyl2-palmitoyoamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of GlcT-1, sensitized the multidrug-resistant cells to some anticancer drugs. These results suggested that GlcT-1 is involved in regulation of ceramide levels, which may affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. We conclude that GlcT-1, distributed ubiquitously in vertebrate cells, functions to regulate the level of intracellular ceramide by glycosylation of the ceramide when it is present in excess.

Although the mechanism for decreased LPL is not known, elevated glucose is known to increase diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C (PKC). To determine whether PKC is involved in the regulation of LPL, we studied the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on adipocytes. LPL activity was inhibited when TPA was added to cultures of 3T3-F442A and rat primary adipocytes. The inhibitory effect of TPA on LPL activity was observed after 6 h of treatment, and was observed at a concentration of 6 nm. 100 nm TPA yielded maximal (80%) inhibition of LPL. No stimulation of LPL occurred after short term addition of TPA to cultures. To determine whether TPA treatment of adipocytes decreased LPL synthesis, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and LPL protein was immunoprecipitated. LPL synthetic rate decreased after 6 h of TPA treatment. Western blot analysis of cell lysates indicated a decrease in LPL mass after TPA treatment. Despite this decrease in LPL synthesis, there was no change in LPL mRNA in the TPA-treated cells.Long term treatment of cells with TPA is known to down-regulate PKC. To assess the involvement of the different PKC isoforms, Western blotting was performed. TPA treatment of 3T3-F442A adipocytes decreased PKC α, β, δ, and ε isoforms, whereas PKC λ, θ, ζ, μ, ι, and γ remained unchanged or decreased minimally. To directly assess the effect of PKC inhibition, PKC inhibitors (calphostin C and staurosporine) were added to cultures. The PKC inhibitors inhibited LPL activity rapidly (within 60 min).

N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The regulation of lipoprotein lipase is complex and regulation may occur at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels (2Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). LPL activity is decreased in the adipose tissue of patients with diabetes. After treatment to control hyperglycemia in both type I and type II diabetes, there is an increase in LPL activity (3Taskinen M.-R. Nikkilä E.A. Diabetologia. 1979; 17: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D. Best J.D. Judzewitsch R.G. Halter J.B. Porte Jr., D.

Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made in experimental models of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. Whereas short term insulin treatment of insulin-deficient rats increased LPL protein more than LPL mRNA, prolonged insulin treatment increased both LPL protein and LPL mRNA levels (6Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin.

Sherman N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia is known to increase cellular diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn is the natural activator of PKC. Elevated DAG, resulting in PKC activation has been identified in insulin-deficient diabetic adipose tissue (8Rouis M. Dugi K.A. Previato L. Patterson A.P. Brunzell J.D. Brewer H.B.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The role of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in the activation of PKC isoforms and involvement in insulin resistance has been studied in various animal models of diabetes (11Avignon A. Yamada K. Zhou X. Spencer B. Cardona O. Saba-Siddique S. Galloway L. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PKC is present in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction in cells prior to stimulation, and the treatment of cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in activation and translocation of PKC to the membrane. TPA activates PKC by interacting with the DAG binding site (12Niedel J.E. Kuhn L.J. Vandenbark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), although the degree of stimulation of PKC by TPA is much greater than the induction by DAG. However, prolonged treatment with phorbol ester can down-regulate PKC activity and PKC protein by depleting cellular PKC protein (13Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 15194-15199Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Borner C. Eppenberger U. Wyss R. Fabbro D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The eleven related isoforms of PKC have been described and can be classified into three subgroups, depending on the requirement for diacylglycerol, phospholipid, and calcium for activation. These isoenzymes are characterized by differences in their four domains, the regulatory domains, C1 and C2, and the catalytic domains, C3 and C4 (15Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Each PKC isoform has a distinct tissue distribution and physiological function. Recent studies indicate that PKC isoforms β and δ are activated preferentially in the vasculature of diabetic animals. However, other PKC isoforms are also increased in the glomeruli and retinal tissues isolated from diabetic animals and in cells cultured in the presence of high glucose (16Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Sugimoto T. Koya D. Araki S. Togawa M. Shigeta Y. J. Diabetes Complicat. 1995; 9: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar).In this study, the effect of PKC activation and depletion by TPA on LPL activity was examined in adipocytes. Although stimulation of PKC did not increase LPL, depletion or inhibition of PKC resulted in a decrease in LPL translation. These data suggest that PKC plays a vital role in the expression of LPL activity in adipocytes.DISCUSSIONLPL hydrolyzes the triglyceride core of lipoproteins and is subject to regulation by a number of different hormones (2Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The physiologic regulators of LPL include catecholamines, which inhibit adipose lipid accumulation during periods of active lipolysis (e.g. fasting), and insulin, which stimulates LPL in concert with an inhibition of lipolysis (e.g. after a meal). A number of studies have demonstrated that the regulation of LPL is complex. Under some conditions, levels of LPL mRNA are regulated, whereas other times there is regulation of LPL translation, or posttranslational processing (2Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Regulation of LPL translation has been demonstrated in response to several conditions, including glucose (29Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thyroid hormone (30Saffari B. Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in response to improved diabetes control (5Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all of these instances, there was no change in LPL mRNA expression, but the synthetic rate of LPL was altered, resulting in decreased LPL activity. In this study we report that expression of LPL activity in adipocytes is decreased by depletion of PKC, and that this inhibition of LPL takes place at the level of translation.To determine whether PKC was involved in the regulation of LPL activity in adipocytes, we studied the effect of TPA, which can mimic in part the effect of DAG, the natural ligand for PKC (35Liu J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC is an immediate response to TPA, and occurs within 30 min (36Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Cooper D. Watson J. Pushkin D. Farese R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Francois A.J. Ways K. Arnold T.P. Hernandez H. Cooper D.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We observed that TPA treatment caused no significant change in LPL activity during this time interval. The inhibitory effect of TPA on LPL activity, however, was evident after longer treatment with TPA. Long term treatment with TPA is known to decrease PKC in several cell types (38Adams J. Gullick J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of PKC has been documented in several studies and is mainly due to increased rate of degradation (39Junco M. Webster C. Crawford C. Bosca L. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, Shea et al. (41Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. Griffin W.R. Leli U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrated that with prolonged TPA treatment of human neuroblastoma cells, the rate of degradation of PKC-α is faster than the rate of synthesis, which resulted in the depletion of PKC protein. To demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of TPA on LPL were caused by PKC depletion, we directly inhibited PKC with specific inhibitors. This resulted in inhibition of LPL activity. We also demonstrated the depletion of several PKC isoforms by Western blotting. Thus, depletion of PKC or direct inhibition using PKC inhibitors inhibited LPL activity, indicating that physiological levels of active PKC play a vital role in the regulation of LPL activity. Because stimulation of PKC did not stimulate LPL, our data suggest that PKC must play a constitutive role to maintain LPL synthesis.In our previous studies (32Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that LPL translation is regulated by an RNA-binding protein that is stimulated by catecholamines, and binds to the 3′-untranslated region of the LPL mRNA. Other examples of regulatory RNA-binding proteins have involved phosphoproteins (42Kwon Y.K. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6547-6557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that PKC may alter LPL translation through the phosphorylation of a protein intermediate. Phorbol esters trigger phosphorylation and activation of RAF1, which is a 75-kDa phosphoprotein with intrinsic kinase activity and is an important physiological substrate for PKC α (43Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D.R.U. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Activated RAF functions as a kinase kinase and triggers signaling proteins including cytosolic enzymes like S6 kinase.The role of PKC in the phosphorylation and regulation of neuromodulin and neurogranin, and other nuclear RNA-binding proteins which regulate translational initiation, splicing and ribosomal assembly has been described recently (44Deloulme J.C. Prichard L. Delattre O. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27369-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation of these proteins inhibits their binding to their target RNA in vitro. It is possible that PKC may play a similar role in the regulation of LPL activity. PKC could be involved in the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins that are involved in the translation of LPL. Depletion of PKC may dephosphorylate the binding protein and inhibit LPL activity.PKC plays a vital role in other aspects of gene expression and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (45Schubert C. Carel K. DePaolo D. Leitner W. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15311-15314Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Depletion of PKC by prolonged treatment of adipocytes with TPA resulted in an activation of GTPase-activating protein and inhibition p21ras GTP loading (substitution of GTP for GDP on p21ras), which results in an alteration of insulin action. Another mechanism by which PKC alters insulin action may involve serine phosphorylation on the C-terminal domain of the insulin receptor, which results in a decrease in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and a decrease in insulin signaling (46Lewis R.E. Volle D.J. Sanderson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26259-26266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrated that PKC depletion results in a decrease in LPL translation. PKC is an important regulatory protein involved in catalyzing specific substrate phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells (35Liu J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and may be relevant to the changes in LPL that occur with diabetes. LPL activity is decreased in the adipose tissue of patients and animals with both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant diabetes, and improved diabetes control increased LPL activity (4Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D. Best J.D. Judzewitsch R.G. Halter J.B. Porte Jr., D. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 47Pykalisto O. Smith P.H. Brunzell J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Elevated blood glucose levels stimulates the production of DAG in many cells, including adipocytes (36Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Cooper D. Watson J. Pushkin D. Farese R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 48Craven P.A. Davidson C.M. DeRubertis F.R. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 667-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One would expect that glucose-mediated increases in DAG would activate PKC, and hence maintain LPL expression. Perhaps such is the case under normal fasting/feeding conditions where elevations in blood glucose are modest and transient. With diabetes, however, where blood glucose is chronically elevated, it is possible that the elevated DAG, or perhaps some related mechanism, results in a down-regulation of PKC and hence an inhibition of LPL expression.In summary, we have demonstrated that the depletion of PKC in adipocytes resulted in a decrease in LPL translation, although the stimulation of PKC did not affect LPL. These data suggest that PKC is necessary for the normal constitutive expression of LPL and may provide an important link to the signal transduction events that regulate this important enzyme.

After treatment to control hyperglycemia in both type I and type II diabetes, there is an increase in LPL activity (3Taskinen M.-R. Nikkilä E.A.

Similar observations have been made in experimental models of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. Whereas short term insulin treatment of insulin-deficient rats increased LPL protein more than LPL mRNA, prolonged insulin treatment increased both LPL protein and LPL mRNA levels (6Tavangar K.

Commun. 1988; 156: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia is known to increase cellular diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn is the natural activator of PKC. Elevated DAG, resulting in PKC activation has been identified in insulin-deficient diabetic adipose tissue (8Rouis M. Dugi K.A. Previato L. Patterson A.P. Brunzell J.D. Brewer H.B.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The role of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in the activation of PKC isoforms and involvement in insulin resistance has been studied in various animal models of diabetes (11Avignon A. Yamada K. Zhou X. Spencer B. Cardona O. Saba-Siddique S. Galloway L. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PKC is present in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction in cells prior to stimulation, and the treatment of cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in activation and translocation of PKC to the membrane. TPA activates PKC by interacting with the DAG binding site (12Niedel J.E. Kuhn L.J. Vandenbark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), although the degree of stimulation of PKC by TPA is much greater than the induction by DAG. However, prolonged treatment with phorbol ester can down-regulate PKC activity and PKC protein by depleting cellular PKC protein (13Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 15194-15199Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Borner C. Eppenberger U. Wyss R. Fabbro D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The eleven related isoforms of PKC have been described and can be classified into three subgroups, depending on the requirement for diacylglycerol, phospholipid, and calcium for activation. These isoenzymes are characterized by differences in their four domains, the regulatory domains, C1 and C2, and the catalytic domains, C3 and C4 (15Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Each PKC isoform has a distinct tissue distribution and physiological function. Recent studies indicate that PKC isoforms β and δ are activated preferentially in the vasculature of diabetic animals. However, other PKC isoforms are also increased in the glomeruli and retinal tissues isolated from diabetic animals and in cells cultured in the presence of high glucose (16Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Sugimoto T. Koya D. Araki S. Togawa M. Shigeta Y. J. Diabetes Complicat. 1995; 9: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of PKC activation and depletion by TPA on LPL activity was examined in adipocytes. Although stimulation of PKC did not increase LPL, depletion or inhibition of PKC resulted in a decrease in LPL translation. These data suggest that PKC plays a vital role in the expression of LPL activity in adipocytes. DISCUSSIONLPL hydrolyzes the triglyceride core of lipoproteins and is subject to regulation by a number of different hormones (2Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The physiologic regulators of LPL include catecholamines, which inhibit adipose lipid accumulation during periods of active lipolysis (e.g. fasting), and insulin, which stimulates LPL in concert with an inhibition of lipolysis (e.g. after a meal). A number of studies have demonstrated that the regulation of LPL is complex. Under some conditions, levels of LPL mRNA are regulated, whereas other times there is regulation of LPL translation, or posttranslational processing (2Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Regulation of LPL translation has been demonstrated in response to several conditions, including glucose (29Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thyroid hormone (30Saffari B. Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all of these instances, there was no change in LPL mRNA expression, but the synthetic rate of LPL was altered, resulting in decreased LPL activity. In this study we report that expression of LPL activity in adipocytes is decreased by depletion of PKC, and that this inhibition of LPL takes place at the level of translation.To determine whether PKC was involved in the regulation of LPL activity in adipocytes, we studied the effect of TPA, which can mimic in part the effect of DAG, the natural ligand for PKC (35Liu J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC is an immediate response to TPA, and occurs within 30 min (36Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Cooper D. Watson J. Pushkin D. Farese R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Francois A.J. Ways K. Arnold T.P. Hernandez H. Cooper D.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We observed that TPA treatment caused no significant change in LPL activity during this time interval. The inhibitory effect of TPA on LPL activity, however, was evident after longer treatment with TPA. Long term treatment with TPA is known to decrease PKC in several cell types (38Adams J. Gullick J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of PKC has been documented in several studies and is mainly due to increased rate of degradation (39Junco M. Webster C. Crawford C. Bosca L. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, Shea et al. (41Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. Griffin W.R. Leli U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrated that with prolonged TPA treatment of human neuroblastoma cells, the rate of degradation of PKC-α is faster than the rate of synthesis, which resulted in the depletion of PKC protein. To demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of TPA on LPL were caused by PKC depletion, we directly inhibited PKC with specific inhibitors. This resulted in inhibition of LPL activity. We also demonstrated the depletion of several PKC isoforms by Western blotting. Thus, depletion of PKC or direct inhibition using PKC inhibitors inhibited LPL activity, indicating that physiological levels of active PKC play a vital role in the regulation of LPL activity. Because stimulation of PKC did not stimulate LPL, our data suggest that PKC must play a constitutive role to maintain LPL synthesis.In our previous studies (32Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that LPL translation is regulated by an RNA-binding protein that is stimulated by catecholamines, and binds to the 3′-untranslated region of the LPL mRNA. Other examples of regulatory RNA-binding proteins have involved phosphoproteins (42Kwon Y.K. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6547-6557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that PKC may alter LPL translation through the phosphorylation of a protein intermediate. Phorbol esters trigger phosphorylation and activation of RAF1, which is a 75-kDa phosphoprotein with intrinsic kinase activity and is an important physiological substrate for PKC α (43Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D.R.U. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Activated RAF functions as a kinase kinase and triggers signaling proteins including cytosolic enzymes like S6 kinase.The role of PKC in the phosphorylation and regulation of neuromodulin and neurogranin, and other nuclear RNA-binding proteins which regulate translational initiation, splicing and ribosomal assembly has been described recently (44Deloulme J.C. Prichard L. Delattre O. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27369-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation of these proteins inhibits their binding to their target RNA in vitro. It is possible that PKC may play a similar role in the regulation of LPL activity. PKC could be involved in the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins that are involved in the translation of LPL. Depletion of PKC may dephosphorylate the binding protein and inhibit LPL activity.PKC plays a vital role in other aspects of gene expression and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (45Schubert C. Carel K. DePaolo D. Leitner W. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15311-15314Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Depletion of PKC by prolonged treatment of adipocytes with TPA resulted in an activation of GTPase-activating protein and inhibition p21ras GTP loading (substitution of GTP for GDP on p21ras), which results in an alteration of insulin action. Another mechanism by which PKC alters insulin action may involve serine phosphorylation on the C-terminal domain of the insulin receptor, which results in a decrease in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and a decrease in insulin signaling (46Lewis R.E. Volle D.J. Sanderson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26259-26266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrated that PKC depletion results in a decrease in LPL translation. PKC is an important regulatory protein involved in catalyzing specific substrate phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells (35Liu J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and may be relevant to the changes in LPL that occur with diabetes. LPL activity is decreased in the adipose tissue of patients and animals with both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant diabetes, and improved diabetes control increased LPL activity (4Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D. Best J.D. Judzewitsch R.G. Halter J.B. Porte Jr., D. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J.

Elevated blood glucose levels stimulates the production of DAG in many cells, including adipocytes (36Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Cooper D. Watson J. Pushkin D. Farese R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 48Craven P.A. Davidson C.M. DeRubertis F.R. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 667-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One would expect that glucose-mediated increases in DAG would activate PKC, and hence maintain LPL expression. Perhaps such is the case under normal fasting/feeding conditions where elevations in blood glucose are modest and transient. With diabetes, however, where blood glucose is chronically elevated, it is possible that the elevated DAG, or perhaps some related mechanism, results in a down-regulation of PKC and hence an inhibition of LPL expression.In summary, we have demonstrated that the depletion of PKC in adipocytes resulted in a decrease in LPL translation, although the stimulation of PKC did not affect LPL. These data suggest that PKC is necessary for the normal constitutive expression of LPL and may provide an important link to the signal transduction events that regulate this important enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2044754255,"In the current study we report the isolation of 854 base pairs of the rat mannose receptor promoter. Analysis of the sequence revealed one Sp1 site, three PU.1 sites, and a potential TATA box (TTTAAA) 33 base pairs 5′ of the transcriptional start site. The tissue specificity of the promoter was determined using transient transfections. The promoter was most active in the mature macrophage cell line NR8383 although the promoter also showed activity in the monocytic cell line RAW. No activity was observed in pre-monocytic cell lines or epithelial cell lines. Mutation of the TTTAAA sequence to TTGGAA resulted in a 50% decrease in activity in transient transfection assays suggesting that the promoter contains a functional TATA box. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutagenesis we established that the transcription factors Sp1, PU.1, and USF bound to the mannose receptor promoter, but only PU.1 and USF contributed to activation. Transient transfections using a dominant negative construct of USF resulted in a 50% decrease in mannose receptor promoter activity, further establishing the role of USF in activating the rat mannose receptor promoter. Comparison of the rat, mouse, and human sequence demonstrated that some binding sites are not conserved. Gel shifts were performed to investigate differences in protein binding between species. USF bound to the rat and human promoter but not to the mouse promoter, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in regulation of mannose receptor expression in these species. From these results we conclude that, similar to other myeloid promoters, transcription of the rat mannose receptor is regulated by binding of PU.1 and a ubiquitous factor at an adjacent site. However, unlike other myeloid promoters, we have identified USF as the ubiquitous factor, and demonstrated that the promoter contains a functional TATA box.

The maturation of phagocytes during the latter stages of myeloid cell differentiation is accompanied by the appearance of a number of myeloid-restricted proteins.

Senior R.M. Stahl P.D. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1982; 32: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rouleux-Bonnin F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mannose receptor is a 175-kDa type I transmembrane protein and is a member of the C-type lectin family (3Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The protein has been purified from a variety of species (4Stephenson J.D. Shepherd V.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Blum J.S. Stahl P.D. Diaz R. Fiani M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the murine and human cDNA sequences have been reported (6Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several in vivofunctions have been proposed for the macrophage mannose receptor: endocytosis of extracellular peroxidases and hydrolases during the resolution phase of inflammation (8Shepherd V.L. Hoidal J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), phagocytosis of unopsonized pathogens (9Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and antigen capture for eventual presentation to T cells (10Prigozy T.I. Sieling P.A. Clemens D. Stewart P.L. Behar S.M. Porcelli S.A. Brenner M.B. Modlin R.L. Kronenberg M. Immunity. 1997; 6: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory for the past several years have focused on the mechanisms involved in regulation of expression of the mannose receptor in macrophages. Mannose receptor expression is a marker of the mature macrophage, although expression has also been reported on dendritic cells (11Longoni D. Piemonti L. Bernasconi S. Mantovani A. Allavena P. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1998; 28: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and retinal pigmented epithelial cells (12Shepherd V.L. Tarnowski B. McLaughlin B.J. Invest. Ophthamol. & Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 1779-1784Google Scholar). Mannose receptor protein is absent in freshly isolated monocytes and appears during in vitro differentiation in the presence of colony-stimulating factors (13Konish M. Shepherd V.L. Holt G. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recent studies from a number of laboratories have begun to shed some light on the mechanisms that regulate myeloid-restricted gene expression. Studies of the promoters of these genes have revealed a number of potential factors that modulate myeloid-specific gene expression, and a pattern of features required for activation of these genes during myeloid differentiation has emerged (14Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Valledor A.F. Borras F.E. Cullell-Young M. Celada A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Control of tissue specificity typically resides in approximately 150 bp 1The abbreviations used are:bp, base pair(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; MR, mannose receptor; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 5′ of the major transcriptional start site. All of the myeloid promoters contain consensus binding sites for PU.1, a member of the ets family of transcription factors (16Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). A role for this factor in myeloid cell differentiation has been supported by the findings that macrophage development is restricted in PU.1 null mice, and that PU.1 expression is up-regulated during commitment of multipotential stem cells to the myeloid lineage (17Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of a number of myeloid promoters requires an intact PU.1 site (18Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzales D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pahl H.L.

Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32392-39402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the PU.1 sites are in close proximity to a site that binds a second transcription factor. Binding elements for four of these factors have been identified to date: AML1, a member of the Runt/PEBP2/CBF family; C/EBPα or C/EBPβ; Sp1; and AP-1 (14Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of both PU.1 and this second factor are involved in controlling maximal activity. In addition, the promoters for many of these myeloid-restricted proteins lack a TATA box and have multiple transcriptional start sites. Some information on factors involved in mannose receptor regulation has come from the recent reports of the isolation and partial characterization of the promoters for the human and murine mannose receptor genes (27Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Eichbaum Q. Heney D. Raveh D. Chung M. Davidson M. Epstein J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1997; 90: 4135-4143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential regulatory mechanisms were identified in the murine sequence, and myeloid restricted activity was demonstrated for the human promoter. Both promoters contain PU.1 sites, and one of these sites appears to be involved in murine promoter activity. Using transient transfection of mannose receptor-negative myeloid cells, Eichbaum et al. (28Eichbaum Q. Heney D. Raveh D. Chung M. Davidson M. Epstein J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1997; 90: 4135-4143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that activity of the murine promoter required binding of PU.1 and Sp1 at sites within the first 200 bp. What has hampered further studies on a complete description of factors involved in mannose receptor transcriptional regulation is the inability to efficiently transfect primary macrophages. We have recently described mannose receptor expression in a rat alveolar macrophage cell line (29Lane K.B. Egan B. Vick S. Shepherd V.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and in the current study we have used this cell line to examine potential factors involved in mannose receptor transcriptional regulation. Studies of the control of mannose receptor expression are important for two reasons: first, the mannose receptor is a key phagocytic receptor involved in first-line host defense against a variety of invading pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (30Schlesinger L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar),Candida albicans (31Marodi L. Korchak H.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2783-2789PubMed Google Scholar), Pseudomonas aeruginosa(32Speert D.P. Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. Mah B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and Pneumocystis carinii (33Ezekowitz R.A.B. Williams D.J. Koziel H. Armstrong M.Y.K. Warner A. Richards F.F. Rose R.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Second, the mannose receptor is expressed only on the mature macrophage (1Shepherd V.L. Campbell E.J. Senior R.M. Stahl P.D. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1982; 32: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rouleux-Bonnin F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) making this a unique model system to study the mechanisms involved in monocyte to macrophage maturation. In the current study we report the isolation of 854 bp of the rat mannose receptor promoter and investigate the elements within this fragment that contribute to mannose receptor expression in mature macrophages. We have focused on sites that are potentially involved in myeloid-restricted expression of the rat mannose receptor, and have extended the findings from both the human and murine systems to include regulation and function of the mannose receptor promoter in a mannose receptor-positive macrophage cell line. NR8383 cells were obtained from Dr. R. Helmke (University of Texas Health Science Center) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium with 15% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The murine macrophage cell line RAW264, the human monocytic line HL60, and the human epithelial line A549 were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). RAW and HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A549 epithelial cells were maintained in F-12K supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Rat bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (34Shepherd V.L. Konish M.G. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 160-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by culture for 5–7 days in the presence of L cell-conditioned medium. Rat bone marrow macrophages were maintained following differentiation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The strategy for isolation of the rat mannose receptor promoter was a modification of the procedure used for cloning the human mannose receptor promoter (27Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as follows: a synthetic oligonucleotide of known sequence (Integrated DNA Technologies) was ligated to the ends of rat genomic DNA pieces generated by digestion with HincII. This oligonucleotide formed an “anchor” sequence to which a complementary primer could be hybridized as primer 1 for generation of mannose receptor promoter fragments by PCR using a mannose receptor-specific oligonucleotide as primer 2. The digests contained genomic DNA (1 μg), in a buffer containing 10 mm ATP and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Double-stranded, dephosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide and T4 DNA ligase were added to the DNA plus restriction enzyme mixture, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. These conditions favored the direction of complete digestion of the DNA at the respective restriction endonuclease sites, with a synthetic oligonucleotide ligated onto each blunt end. Any genomic DNA that re-ligated would again be cut by the restriction enzyme. At the completion of the overnight incubation, a PCR reaction was set up by addition of a mannose receptor-specific 3′ primer derived from the partial rat cDNA sequence obtained in our laboratory (5′-CCAAAGAATACTGCCCAAGTCCCCGG-3′) and a single-stranded oligonucleotide complementary to the synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-TCCAGGCCAGGGAAATTGGAGCACAGG-3′) using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 92 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 5 min. This procedure yielded a fragment of approximately 2.2 kilobases. This fragment was further digested withBglII/SpeI resulting in a fragment of approximately 900 bp. This fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced using vector-based primers. An oligonucleotide derived from the rat mannose receptor cDNA corresponding to positions +23 to +46 (5′-CCGGGTTGCCCCTTGGCTTAGTCC-3′) was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). A primer with the 5′-end at the predicted +1 position of the mannose receptor mRNA (5′-AGTCAGACGGCTCCCAGACC-3′) was used as a control to verify that no extension would occur from this site. Total RNA was isolated from rat bone marrow macrophages using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled primer and 5 μg of RNA were incubated in Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 0.15 m KCl and 1 mm EDTA for 90 min at 65 °C. Extension of the primer was initiated by addition of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, with 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, actinomycin D (7 μg), and 150 μmdNTP mixture. This mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h, then terminated by addition of salmon sperm DNA and RNase A. Nucleic acid was then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. The resulting pellet was collected by centrifugation and analyzed on a 9% polyacrylamide, 7 murea sequencing gel. The 854-bp mannose receptor promoter was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega) containing the luciferase cDNA after BglII/SspI digestion (MR854). The proximal 656-bp promoter fragment (MR656) was generated byHindIII digestion of the 854-bp promoter with subsequent ligation into a HindIII-digested pGL2 vector. A construct containing the proximal 228 bp of the mannose receptor promoter (MR228) was generated by digestion of the 854-bp construct with SmaI and PvuII, followed by re-ligation. The −108 (MR108) and −48 (MR48) constructs were generated by PCR using the MR656 as a template, the appropriate sense primers, and a vector-based antisense primer. The products were digested with HindIII, and ligated into the pGL2 basic vector at the HindIII/SmaI site. Mutations in the mannose receptor promoter were introduced using a PCR-based approach as described by Ho et al. (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.D. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). Complimentary sense and antisense primers containing the desired mutations were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The products of the PCR reactions containing the mutations were isolated, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into MR854 following removal of the specific mutated region. The dominant negative USF1 expression vector, ΔbTDU1, was a kind gift from Dr. Raymondjean (Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire). Electroporation was used for transfection of the cells lines under the following conditions: mannose receptor promoter-luciferase DNA (5 μg) and CMV-Renilla-luciferase (pRL-CMV, Promega) (1 μg) were added to 250 μl of serum-free media. RAW cells were transfected at a concentration of 107 cells/reaction at 280 V and 960 μfarads. NR8383 cells were transfected at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/reaction at 250 V and 960 μfarads. A549 cells (5 × 106) were transfected at 250 V and 960 μfarads. NR8383 and HL60 cells were also transfected using DEAE-dextran as follows: cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then resuspended in trypsin/EDTA for 3 min at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and suspended in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.7 mmK2HPO4. DNA (10 μg) and 50 μl of 4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran were added, and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The transfected cells were then plated into 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 24 h in the media used for routine culture. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pGL2-basic vector (Promega) was used as a negative control in transfection assays. The pRL-CMV vector was used to correct for transfection efficiency. Data are expressed as the luciferase activity for each sample normalized to theRenilla luciferase activity. Nuclear extract was isolated from cell preparations as follows: 107cells were suspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 500 ng/ml pepstatin), and placed on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 1 min at 14,000 rpm, the pellet containing the nuclei was washed once with buffer A, then suspended in 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, with 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus levels of protease inhibitors as in A) and vortexed for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and nuclear protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Single-stranded oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) were annealed and 5′ nucleotides were added using Klenow (Promega). The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Labeled oligonucleotide (2 × 105 cpm), single-stranded nonspecific DNA (200 ng), nuclear extract (10 μg), and binding buffer (3 μl) (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 20% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a total reaction volume of 15 μl. A 200-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was used in competition assays. For supershift analysis, 2 μg of anti-USF1, anti-USF2, anti-Sp1, or anti-PU.1 antibodies (Santa Cruz) were added immediately after the addition of labeled probe. Samples were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 0.5 × TBE at 150 volts. The gels were dried and bands visualized by autoradiography.

Open table in a new tab Primer extension analysis using rat bone marrow macrophage RNA was performed using a probe derived from the rat cDNA to determine the transcriptional start site of the rat mannose receptor gene. As shown in Fig. 1, a major extended product of 46 bp was found, with minor products of 52 and 58 bp upstream of the 5′-end of the probe. The start site of −1 indicated in Fig. 2 for the rat mannose receptor is based on the 46-bp extension product, and numbering of all oligonucleotides and positions of consensus sequences used in the current paper refer to this start site. The determined rat start site is 23 bp 5′ of the start site reported by Taylor et al. (7Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the human mannose receptor and by Harris et al. (6Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the murine mannose receptor, and 21 bp 3′ of the start site reported by Rouleux et al. (27Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) for the human mannose receptor gene. The reasons for these discrepancies are not known, although multiple start sites have been reported for other myeloid-restricted transcripts (14Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Figure 2Sequence of the 854-bp promoter region of the rat mannose receptor gene. The mannose receptor promoter region was isolated using PCR amplification of rat genomic DNA. The DNA was subcloned in pGEM-T and sequenced using vector-based primers. Consensus sites for PU.1 and Sp1, and a consensus E box motif are highlighted by the boxed areas. A potential TATA box isunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The rat mannose receptor 5′-flanking region was isolated using a PCR-based method similar to that reported for the isolation of the human mannose receptor promoter (27Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The resulting 854-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T and sequenced (Fig. 2). Southern analysis of rat genomic DNA using probes derived from the promoter sequence, and PCR using primers from both promoter and rat cDNA sequence confirmed that this fragment was the 5′-flanking region of the rat mannose receptor (data not shown). A comparison of the first 250 bp of the rat promoter sequence to both the human and murine mannose receptor promoter sequences is shown in Fig. 3. There is almost complete identity of murine and rat sequences over the first 150 bp, with a homology over the entire 250 bp of 87%. There is lower homology between the rodent sequences and the human, with very little agreement upstream of position −150. The homology of rat to human over the 250-bp sequence is 56%. The highest degree of homology among the three sequences occurs between −30 and −150, suggesting that important regulatory sites may be located within this region. Careful analysis of the first 250 bp of the rat sequence revealed a potential TATA box at −33, a core Sp1-binding site (CCGCCC) at position −91, and three potential PU.1-binding sites in the non-coding strand at −18 (GAGGAA), −106 (CAGGAA), and −163 (GAGGAA) which are conserved in the mouse and human sequences. To determine if the 854-bp 5′-region of the rat mannose receptor gene directs cell-specific expression, promoter activity was determined in mannose receptor-positive macrophages, mannose receptor-negative macrophages, and mannose receptor-negative non-macrophage cell lines using a reporter gene assay. In Fig. 4 A, NR8383 macrophages (open bars) and A549 epithelial cells (solid bars) were transfected with the pGL2-MR854, -MR656, -MR228, -MR108, -MR48, and promoterless pGL2 basic vectors. PU.1 sites are represented by the closed ovals, and the Sp1 sites by the open ovals. Cells were co-transfected with pRL-CMV as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The 228-bp fragment was almost as active as the 854-bp promoter in NR8383 cells, suggesting that this region contains the necessary myeloid-specific sites as suggested by Clarke and Gordon (14Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) for myeloid-restricted gene expression. Interestingly, there was a slight decrease in activity with the MR656 construct. This supports the observation by Rouleux et al. (27Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the region from −250 to −750 may contain a repressor site that is overcome by the additional 5′ bases in MR854. In addition, Eichbaum et al. (28Eichbaum Q. Heney D. Raveh D. Chung M. Davidson M. Epstein J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1997; 90: 4135-4143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that sequences 5′ of −200 bp in the murine promoter reduced activity. The MR108 construct showed approximately 50% of the activity of MR228. MR108 still contains two PU.1 sites and the Sp1 site, but maximal activity may require the upstream PU.1 site at −163. MR48 still exhibited some activity in NR8383 cells when compared with basic vector alone, suggesting that the one remaining PU.1 site (−18 bp) also contributes to macrophage-specific expression from this promoter. Mannose receptor promoter activity in A549 cells (Fig. 4 A) and Hep2 cells (data not shown) was comparable to levels observed when these cells were transfected with empty vector, supporting the conclusion that the mannose receptor promoter is active only in myeloid cell types. In Fig. 4 B activity of the MR854 construct is compared in cell lines representative of various stages of myelopoiesis. NR8383 cells express mannose receptor and are representative of mature macrophages, RAW cells are monocyte-like and do not express mannose receptor, and HL60 cells are p"
https://openalex.org/W2081698376,"The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) binds, among other ligands, the M r 40,000 receptor-associated protein (RAP) and a variety of serine proteinase-serpin complexes, including complexes of the proteinase urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) with the serpins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and protease nexin-1 (PN-1). We have analyzed the binding of RAP, uPA·PAI-1, and uPA·PN-1 to two naturally occurring VLDLR variants, VLDLR-I, containing all eight complement-type repeats, and VLDLR-III, lacking the third complement-type repeat, encoded by exon 4. VLDLR-III displayed ∼4-fold lower binding of RAP than VLDLR-I and ∼10-fold lower binding of the most C-terminal one of the three domains of RAP. In contrast, the binding of uPA·PAI-1 and uPA·PN-1 to the two VLDLR variants was indistinguishable. Surprisingly, uPA·PN-1, but not uPA·PAI-1, competed RAP binding to both VLDLR variants. These observations show that the third complement-type repeat plays a crucial role in maintaining the contact sites needed for optimal recognition of RAP, but does not affect the proteinase-serpin complex contact sites, and that two ligands can show full cross-competition without sharing the same contacts with the receptor. These results elucidate the mechanisms of molecular recognition of ligands by receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) binds, among other ligands, the M r 40,000 receptor-associated protein (RAP) and a variety of serine proteinase-serpin complexes, including complexes of the proteinase urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) with the serpins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and protease nexin-1 (PN-1). We have analyzed the binding of RAP, uPA·PAI-1, and uPA·PN-1 to two naturally occurring VLDLR variants, VLDLR-I, containing all eight complement-type repeats, and VLDLR-III, lacking the third complement-type repeat, encoded by exon 4. VLDLR-III displayed ∼4-fold lower binding of RAP than VLDLR-I and ∼10-fold lower binding of the most C-terminal one of the three domains of RAP. In contrast, the binding of uPA·PAI-1 and uPA·PN-1 to the two VLDLR variants was indistinguishable. Surprisingly, uPA·PN-1, but not uPA·PAI-1, competed RAP binding to both VLDLR variants. These observations show that the third complement-type repeat plays a crucial role in maintaining the contact sites needed for optimal recognition of RAP, but does not affect the proteinase-serpin complex contact sites, and that two ligands can show full cross-competition without sharing the same contacts with the receptor. These results elucidate the mechanisms of molecular recognition of ligands by receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family.

For example, α2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes and uPA-serpin complexes do not compete for binding to α2MR/LRP (42Nykjær A. Petersen C.M. Møller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L.

RAP is able to inhibit the binding of all known ligands, whereas almost all other ligands do not inhibit RAP binding (for reviews, see Refs. 1Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Equilibrium binding and competition patterns between different ligands have shown that different domains of RAP and of serine proteinase-serpin complexes make independent contacts with the receptors (15Kasza A.

Thus, these receptors exhibit unique principles of molecular recognition.To elucidate the mechanisms of molecular recognition of ligands by this receptor family, we have now compared the binding of RAP and of complexes between the serine proteinase uPA and the serpins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and protease nexin-1 (PN-1) to the VLDLR variants VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III, differing with respect to the presence of CTR-3 (Fig. 1).DISCUSSIONWe have compared the ligand binding properties of VLDLR variants resulting from translation of an mRNA with all known exons and of an mRNA without exon 4, encoding CTR-3. We found that VLDLR variants without CTR-3 bound RAP weaker than those with CTR-3, whereas all variants displayed indistinguishable binding of the serine proteinase-serpin complexes uPA·PAI-1 and uPA·PN-1. Our results are compatible with the notion that the CTR cluster is implicated in ligand binding, as expected from results with other receptors of the family. Our work represents the first study of the influence of individual CTRs on the ligand binding properties of VLDLR. Our findings suggest that also other ligands may have different affinities for VLDLR variants with and without CTR-3. VLDLR mRNA without exon 4 has so far only been shown to occur naturally in brain (26Christie R.H. Chung H. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in a neuroblastoma cell line (27Madsen B. Martensen P. Christensen A. Andreasen P.A. Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar).The following points strongly argue against the possibility that the lower RAP binding of the VLDLR variants without CTR-3 is an artifact due to abnormal folding of some of the molecules, for instance as a result of scrambling of disulfide bridges. 1) Differences in RAP binding could be demonstrated with receptors directly on the surface of intact cells. 2) The binding of the two serine proteinase-serpin complexes was indistinguishable, despite the different binding of RAP. 3) The residual RAP binding displayed by VLDLR-III had properties different from those of the RAP binding by VLDLR-I since it was more weakly competed by D3RAP. 4) VLDLR-III could be purified by affinity chromatography with immobilized RAP in a high yield, excluding the possibility that the low binding was due to a large fraction of the VLDLR-III molecules being in a misfolded state unable to bind to RAP. We are therefore confident that our data allow us to conclude that the weaker RAP binding of VLDLR-III is a property of a native, properly folded protein produced by translation of the mRNA without exon 4.The observation that VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III show different RAP binding, but indistinguishable serine proteinase-serpin complex binding, strongly suggests that different contributions by different CTRs to binding of different ligands are an important determinant of ligand binding specificity of VLDLR and other LDLR family members. An additional important, previously reported observation is that ligand binding involves multiple contacts between ligand and receptor. This observation was made by analyses of the binding of individual RAP domains to α2MR/LRP and gp330/megalin (40Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol.

The most simple binding model accounting for both the observations of the contributions from different CTRs and the multicontact hypothesis is one in which each of the multiple contact sites is localized in a particular CTR. In the present case, this model would imply that a direct contact between VLDLR CTR-3 and RAP contributes strongly to RAP binding. An alternative binding model is one in which binding of different ligands depends in different ways on receptor conformation, the different binding properties of VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III being due to a conformational effect of CTR-3, resulting in presentation of different RAP-binding surfaces in the two variants. This model would also imply that the spatial arrangement of the CTRs determining the binding surface for the proteinase-serpin complexes is unaffected by the lack of CTR-3. Along the same line, RAP binding could result in a change in the spatial arrangement of the CTRs, with RAP stabilizing a receptor conformation preventing the exposure of binding sites for other ligands, in agreement with previous proposals for the RAP-α2MR/LRP interaction (36Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13608-13613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The two models are not mutually exclusive. With both, a combined contribution from several CTRs to a multicontact binding of each ligand would explain how the same receptor can exhibit high affinity binding of several, structurally unrelated ligands and how the variations in amino acid sequence in CTRs in different receptors can give rise to different, but overlapping binding specificities. This proposal is in agreement with a previous hypothesis by Russell et al. (9Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), working with LDLR.A second important observation described here is the ability of uPA·PN-1 to compete RAP binding to VLDLR. RAP competes the binding of all known ligands to α2MR/LRP, gp330/megalin, and VLDLR (for a review, see Ref. 2Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Williams S.E. Argraves W.S. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 204-215Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the only other ligand so far reported to be able to inhibit RAP binding was lipoprotein lipase, in the case of α2MR/LRP (40Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The capability of uPA·PN-I for competition of VLDLR·RAP binding may be related to its unusually high affinity for VLDLR, the K d being ∼140 pm, ∼6-fold lower than the K d for binding of uPA·PAI-1 (15Kasza A. Petersen H.H. Heegaard C.W. Oka K. Christensen A. Dubin A. Chan L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since binding of RAP and uPA·PN-1 is differently affected by the lack of CTR-3, we must contend that two ligands can compete for binding without sharing the same contact sites.Important aspects of VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III ligand binding could be explained by the simple binding model R + L ⇄ RL. Thus, both the concentration dependence of steady-state RAP binding and the concentration dependence of inhibition of RAP binding by D3RAP were in agreement with those predicted by the simple binding model. Moreover, the whole cell binding assays showed an ∼5-fold difference in apparent K d for RAP binding to VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III, and the microtiter well binding assay showed an ∼10-fold difference in the apparent K i for competition of RAP binding to VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III by D3RAP, indicating a 10-fold difference inK d for D3RAP binding. The latter observations were in agreement with our a priori expectancy from the simple binding model of the different RAP binding resulting from differences in K d. But we were unable to detect a difference in the apparent K d for RAP binding to VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III in the microtiter well binding assay, suggesting that the difference in K d was <3-fold under these conditions and thus smaller than the difference observed in the whole cell binding assay. Differences concerning K ddeterminations by whole cell and in vitro binding assays have also been observed with other receptors (see, for instance, Ref.53Nykjær A. Møller B. Todd R.F. Christensen T. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 505-516PubMed Google Scholar) and are most likely caused by differences in the microenvironment rather than differences in the receptors themselves. In the present case, this would mean that the same structural difference between the two VLDLR variants would have different consequences for the difference in apparent K d in different microenvironments. The difference in K d for RAP binding to the variants was also considerably smaller than the difference in K dfor D3RAP binding. This observation can be explained by an assumption of the N-terminal two and the C-terminal one of the three domains of RAP, respectively, making independent binding contacts with VLDLR and only the contact of the C-terminal domain being affected by the lack of CTR-3. This is in agreement with the observation that D2D3RAP is a better competitor of RAP binding to VLDLR-III than D3RAP. At the moment, however, we cannot explain the unexpected observation that the total number of RAP-binding sites ([R]t) found with equal amounts of VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III differed ∼3-fold in the microtiter well binding assay. A possible explanation is that two out of a total of three RAP-binding sites per receptor molecule were inactivated by the lack of CTR-3, but although multiple RAP-binding sites per α2MR/LRP molecule have been reported (54Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Iadonato S.I. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), our chemical cross-linking experiment gave no indications of more than one RAP-binding site per VLDLR-I or VLDLR-III molecule (Fig. 9). Alternatively, the observed [R]tdifference could be due to both VLDLR-I and VLDLR-III existing in two conformations with a considerable difference in K dfor RAP and D3RAP binding, with the high affinity conformation being much less abundant in VLDLR-III than in VLDLR-I, but both conformations having a RAP affinity high enough to cause retention on RAP-Sepharose columns. This model is in line with the above-mentioned proposal that CTR-3 affects the binding properties by affecting receptor conformation.Conclusively, our data help to gain insight into the mechanisms by which this receptor class can bind many different ligands without obvious structural similarity, but each of which may make several independent contacts with the receptors and which do not show general cross-competition.

Less is known about the function and regulation of the homologous pocket protein p107. Here we present evidence for the posttranslational regulation of p107 by the Ca2+-activated protease calpain. Three negative growth regulators, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin, the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, and the cyclic nucleotide dibutyryl cAMP were found to induce cell type-specific loss of p107 protein which was reversible by the calpain inhibitor leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal but not by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, caspase inhibitors, or lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Purified calpain induced Ca2+-dependent p107 degradation in cell lysates. Transient expression of the specific calpain inhibitor calpastatin blocked the loss of p107 protein in lovastatin-treated cells, and the half-life of p107 was markedly lengthened in lovastatian-treated cells stably transfected with a calpastatin expression vector versus cells transfected with vector alone. The data presented here demonstrate down-regulation of p107 protein in response to various antiproliferative signals, and implicate calpain in p107 posttranslational regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2322148776,"tsBN462 cells, which have a point mutation in CCG1/TAF(II)250, a component of TFIID complex, arrest in G1 at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5 degrees C. Overexpression of D-type cyclins rescued the cell cycle arrest of tsBN462 cells, suggesting that the cell cycle arrest was through Rb. Consistent with this, overexpression of E2F-1, whose function is repressed by the hypophosphorylated form of Rb, also rescued the cell cycle arrest. Moreover, expression of the viral oncoproteins SV40 large T antigen and HPV16 E7, which both bind Rb and inactivate its function, rescued the cell cycle arrest, whereas HPV16 E6 did not. Mutation of the Rb-binding motif in E7 abrogated its ability to rescue the cell cycle arrest. Expression of exogenous cyclin D1, SV40 large T antigen or CCG1/TAF(II)250 increased cyclin A expression at 39.5 degrees C. Coexpression of HPV16 E7 and adenovirus E1b19K, which blocks apoptosis, rescued the proliferation of tsBN462 cells at 38.5 degrees C. To investigate the mechanism underlying the lack of cyclin D1 expression, deletion analysis of cyclin D1 promoter was performed. The 0.15 kbp cyclin D1 core promoter region, which lacks any transcription factor binding motifs, still exhibited a temperature-sensitive phenotype in tsBN462 cells suggesting that CCG1/TAF(II)250 is critical for the function of the cyclin D1 core promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2325001261,"Many cells, when cultured in suspension, fail to express cyclin A, a regulatory component of cell cycle kinases cdc2 and cdk2 and as a consequence, do not enter S phase. However, many cell type-specific differences are disclosed between not only normal and transformed cells, but also between cell lines whose proliferation is strictly anchorage-dependent. These apparent discrepancies are seen in established cell lines most probably because of adaptative events that have occurred during cell culture. We have therefore used primary cells to understand how cyclin A transcription is controlled by cell anchorage properties. To this aim, we have used embryonic fibroblasts from either wild type, Rb(-/-) or p107(-/-)/p130(-/-) mice and tested the effect of an ectopic expression of Rb mutants. In the experiments reported here, we show that anchorage-dependent expression of cyclin A (i) is reflected by the in vivo occupancy of a negative DNA regulatory element previously shown to be instrumental in the down regulation of cyclin A transcription in quiescent cells (Cell Cycle Responsive Element: CCRE) (ii) requires a functional Rb but neither p107 nor p130 (iii) mutation of the CCRE abolishes both adhesion-dependent regulation and response to Rb."
