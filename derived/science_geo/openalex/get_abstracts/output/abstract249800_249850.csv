https://openalex.org/W2111038577,"Mice experiencing repeated aggression develop a long-lasting aversion to social contact, which can be normalized by chronic, but not acute, administration of antidepressant. Using viral-mediated, mesolimbic dopamine pathway–specific knockdown of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), we showed that BDNF is required for the development of this experience-dependent social aversion. Gene profiling in the nucleus accumbens indicates that local knockdown of BDNF obliterates most of the effects of repeated aggression on gene expression within this circuit, with similar effects being produced by chronic treatment with antidepressant. These results establish an essential role for BDNF in mediating long-term neural and behavioral plasticity in response to aversive social experiences."

We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial “music market” in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible."
https://openalex.org/W2069328568,"Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4-K16Ac) is a prevalent and reversible posttranslational chromatin modification in eukaryotes. To characterize the structural and functional role of this mark, we used a native chemical ligation strategy to generate histone H4 that was homogeneously acetylated at K16. The incorporation of this modified histone into nucleosomal arrays inhibits the formation of compact 30-nanometer–like fibers and impedes the ability of chromatin to form cross-fiber interactions. H4-K16Ac also inhibits the ability of the adenosine triphosphate–utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling enzyme ACF to mobilize a mononucleosome, indicating that this single histone modification modulates both higher order chromatin structure and functional interactions between a nonhistone protein and the chromatin fiber."

https://openalex.org/W2159583680,"The current model of apoptosis holds that upstream signals lead to activation of downstream effector caspases. We generated mice deficient in the two effectors, caspase 3 and caspase 7, which died immediately after birth with defects in cardiac development. Fibroblasts lacking both enzymes were highly resistant to both mitochondrial and death receptor–mediated apoptosis, displayed preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and had defective nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Furthermore, the early apoptotic events of Bax translocation and cytochrome c release were also delayed. We conclude that caspases 3 and 7 are critical mediators of mitochondrial events of apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2084770232,"Mammalian circadian rhythms are based on transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops. Essentially, the activity of the transcription factors BMAL1 (also known as MOP3) and CLOCK is rhythmically counterbalanced by Period (PER) and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins to govern time of day–dependent gene expression1. Here we show that circadian regulation of the mouse albumin D element–binding protein (Dbp) gene involves rhythmic binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK and marked daily chromatin transitions. Thus, the Dbp transcription cycle is paralleled by binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK to multiple extra- and intragenic E boxes, acetylation of Lys9 of histone H3, trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 and a reduction of histone density. In contrast, the antiphasic daily repression cycle is accompanied by dimethylation of Lys9 of histone H3, the binding of heterochromatin protein 1α and an increase in histone density. The rhythmic conversion of transcriptionally permissive chromatin to facultative heterochromatin relies on the presence of functional BMAL1-CLOCK binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2011826549,"Cognitive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex, such as the ability to suppress behavior (response inhibition) and to learn from complex feedback (probabilistic learning), play critical roles in activities of daily life. To what extent do different neurochemical systems modulate these two cognitive functions? Here, using stop-signal and probabilistic learning tasks, we show a double dissociation for the involvement of noradrenaline and serotonin in human cognition. In healthy volunteers, inhibition of central noradrenaline reuptake improved response inhibition but had no effect on probabilistic learning, whereas inhibition of central serotonin reuptake impaired probabilistic learning with no effect on response inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1995782808,"Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates viral genome attachment to mitotic chromosomes. We find that N-terminal LANA docks onto chromosomes by binding nucleosomes through the folded region of histones H2A-H2B. The same LANA residues were required for both H2A-H2B binding and chromosome association. Further, LANA did not bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, which is deficient in H2A-H2B; chromatin binding was rescued after assembly of nucleosomes containing H2A-H2B. We also describe the 2.9-angstrom crystal structure of a nucleosome complexed with the first 23 LANA amino acids. The LANA peptide forms a hairpin that interacts exclusively with an acidic H2A-H2B region that is implicated in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. Our findings present a paradigm for how nucleosomes may serve as binding platforms for viral and cellular proteins and reveal a previously unknown mechanism for KSHV latency."

https://openalex.org/W2150108640,"Direct evidence for the requirement of transcriptional feedback repression in circadian clock function has been elusive. Here, we developed a molecular genetic screen in mammalian cells to identify mutants of the circadian transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1, which were uncoupled from CRYPTOCHROME (CRY)-mediated transcriptional repression. Notably, mutations in the PER-ARNT-SIM domain of CLOCK and the C terminus of BMAL1 resulted in synergistic insensitivity through reduced physical interactions with CRY. Coexpression of these mutant proteins in cultured fibroblasts caused arrhythmic phenotypes in population and single-cell assays. These data demonstrate that CRY-mediated repression of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex activity is required for maintenance of circadian rhythmicity and provide formal proof that transcriptional feedback is required for mammalian clock function."

https://openalex.org/W2094056928,"Despite the long history of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, carbon monoxide has proven remarkably resistant to selective homologation under mild conditions. Here, we find that an organouranium(III) complex induces efficient reductive trimerization of carbon monoxide at room temperature and pressure. The result is a triangular, cyclic C 3 O 2– 3 , or deltate, dianion held between two uranium(IV) units. The bonding within the C 3 O 2– 3 unit and its coordination to the two U centers have been analyzed by x-ray diffraction and density functional theory computational studies, which show a stabilizing C-C agostic interaction between the C 3 core and one U center. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal a rapid equilibration of the deltate unit between the U centers."
https://openalex.org/W2017850724,"Many neurological insults are accompanied by a marked acute inflammatory reaction, involving the activation of microglia. Using a model of exogenous application of fluorescence-labeled BV2 microglia in pathophysiologically relevant concentrations onto organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we investigated the specific effects of microglia on neuronal damage after ischemic injury. Neuronal cell death after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was determined by propidium iodide incorporation and Nissl staining. Migration and interaction with neurons were analyzed by time resolved 3-D two-photon microscopy. We show that microglia protect against OGD-induced neuronal damage and engage in close physical cell-cell contact with neurons in the damaged brain area. Neuroprotection and migration of microglia were not seen with integrin regulator CD11a-deficient microglia or HL-60 granulocytes. The induction of migration and neuron-microglia interaction deep inside the slice was markedly increased under OGD conditions. Lipopolysaccharide-prestimulated microglia failed to provide neuroprotection after OGD. Pharmacological interference with microglia function resulted in a reduced neuroprotection. Microglia proved to be neuroprotective even when applied up to 4 h after OGD, thus defining a time window. In acute injury such as trauma or stroke, appropriately activated microglia may primarily have a neuroprotective role. Anti-inflammatory treatment within the protective time window of microglia would therefore be counterintuitive."
https://openalex.org/W2122112067,"Periods of widespread warmth or cold are identified by positive or negative deviations that are synchronous across a number of temperature-sensitive proxy records drawn from the Northern Hemisphere. The most significant and longest duration feature during the last 1200 years is the geographical extent of warmth in the middle to late 20th century. Positive anomalies during 890 to 1170 and negative anomalies during 1580 to 1850 are consistent with the concepts of a Medieval Warm Period and a Little Ice Age, but comparison with instrumental temperatures shows the spatial extent of recent warmth to be of greater significance than that during the medieval period."

https://openalex.org/W2063167223,"Mixing and transport in turbulent flows-which have strong local concentration fluctuations-are essential in many natural and industrial systems including reactions in chemical mixers, combustion in engines and burners, droplet formation in warm clouds, and biological odor detection and chemotaxis. Local concentration fluctuations, in turn, are intimately tied to the problem of the separation of pairs of fluid elements. We have measured this separation rate in an intensely turbulent laboratory flow and have found, in quantitative agreement with the seminal predictions of Batchelor, that the initial separation of the pair plays an important role in the subsequent spreading of the fluid elements. These results have surprising consequences for the decay of concentration fluctuations and have applications to biological and chemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2169669635,"The identification of the cellular targets of small molecules with anticancer activity is crucial to their further development as drug candidates. Here, we present the application of a large-scale RNA interference–based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) barcode screen to gain insight in the mechanism of action of nutlin-3 (1). Nutlin-3 is a small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2, which can activate the p53 pathway. Nutlin-3 shows strong antitumor effects in mice, with surprisingly few side effects on normal tissues1. Aside from p53, we here identify 53BP1 as a critical mediator of nutlin-3–induced cytotoxicity. 53BP1 is part of a signaling network induced by DNA damage that is frequently activated in cancer but not in healthy tissues2. Our results suggest that nutlin-3's tumor specificity may result from its ability to turn a cancer cell–specific property (activated DNA damage signaling3) into a weakness that can be exploited therapeutically."

https://openalex.org/W2110795813,"One explanation for the abrupt increases in atmospheric CH 4 , that occurred repeatedly during the last glacial cycle involves clathrate destabalization events. Because marine clathrates have a distinct deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) isotope ratio, any such destabilization event should cause the D/H ratio of atmospheric CH 4 (δD CH4 ) to increase. Analyses of air trapped in the ice from the second Greenland ice sheet project show stable and/or decreasing δD CH4 values during the end of the Younger and Older Dryas periods and one stadial period, suggesting that marine clathrates were stable during these abrupt warming episodes. Elevated glacial δD CH4 values may be the result of a lower ratio of net to gross wetland CH 4 emissions and an increase in petroleum-based emissions."

Here, we show that two conserved translational regulators, MEX-3 and GLD-1, are essential for maintaining totipotency in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. In mex-3 gld-1 mutants, germ cells transdifferentiate into various somatic cell types such as muscles or neurons. Our findings implicate RNA regulation in the maintenance of totipotency, suggest that multiple mechanisms maintain totipotency at different stages of germline development, and establish a genetically tractable model for studying the development of teratomas."

https://openalex.org/W2019667607,"Negative feedback is a mechanism commonly employed in biological processes as a means of maintaining homeostasis. We have investigated the roles of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins in regulating the kinetics of negative feedback in response to cytokine signaling. In mouse livers and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both interferon-γ (IFNγ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3. STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was bi-phasic in response to continuous IL-6 signaling. In macrophages lacking Socs3, however, continuous IL-6 signaling induced uniformly high levels of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, and early IL-6-inducible genes were inappropriately expressed at intermediate time points. SOCS3 therefore imposes bi-phasic kinetics upon IL-6 signaling. Compared with Socs3 mRNA, Socs1 mRNA was induced relatively slowly, and SOCS1 simply attenuated the duration of IFNγ signaling. Surprisingly, heightened Socs1 mRNA expression but minimal STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed after prolonged stimulation with IFNγ, indicating that STAT1 may not play a large role in inducing Socs1 mRNA during steady-state IFNγ signaling. We also demonstrate that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can desensitize primary bone marrow-derived macrophages to IFNγ and IL-6 signaling, respectively. Consistent with the kinetics with which Socs1 and Socs3 mRNAs were induced, SOCS3 desensitized cells to IL-6 rapidly, whereas SOCS1-mediated desensitization to IFNγ occurred at later time points. The kinetics with which SOCS proteins are induced by cytokine may therefore be a parameter that is “hard-wired” into specific cytokine signaling pathways as a means of tailoring the kinetics with which cells become desensitized.

Signaling by IL-6 and IFNγ begins at the surface of the cell where the cytokines associate with their respective receptor complexes (1Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The IFNγ-receptor complex consists of the ligand-binding IFNγ-receptor α subunit and the signal-transducing IFNγ-receptor β subunit, whereas the IL-6-receptor complex consists of the ligand-binding IL-6-receptor α subunit and the signal-transducing glycoprotein-130 subunit (1Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Associated with the receptor subunits are the Janus kinases (JAKs), which become activated upon receptor dimerization, and phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factors (2Ihle J.N.

The phosphorylated STATs (P-STATs) then dimerize and are transported to the nucleus, where they bind to promoter sequences, and activate the transcription of a suite of genes, among which are those encoding the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 proteins (15Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

STAT3 activates the transcription of Socs3 mRNA by associating with the 5′ promoter region of the Socs3 gene (17Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The regulation of Socs1 mRNA by STAT1 is poorly understood, and it remains to be clarified whether STAT1 directly activates the transcription of Socs1. Interferon regulatory factor-1, which is induced by STAT1, does, however, activate the transcription of Socs1 (18Saito H. Morita Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Naka T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5833-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins can both inhibit JAK phosphorylation of STAT, thus creating a negative feedback loop that attenuates cytokine signal transduction, although the mechanisms by which they act appear to differ. Whereas SOCS1 functions by binding directly to JAK proteins, SOCS3 inhibits signaling by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine sites on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (19Endo T.A. Masuhara M.

IFNγ acts on cells to induce inflammatory and anti-viral responses, whereas IL-6 acts on cells to regulate the production of acute phase proteins (primarily in hepatocytes) as well as the growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types. Classically, this paradox has been explained by an understanding that IFNγ primarily signals via STAT1, whereas IL-6 primarily signals via STAT3 (21Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Physiologically, SOCS1 is the main inducible inhibitor of IFNγ signaling and in neonatal mice prevents the establishment of a lethal inflammatory disease characterized by heightened levels of circulating IFNγ, fatty degeneration of the liver, and necrosis of the liver and other organs (22Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J.

Surprisingly, IL-6 signaling in the absence of SOCS3 resulted in the prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and a qualitative shift in the transcriptional response of IL-6 toward that typical of IFNγ (16Wormald S.

This indicates that signaling by IFNγ and IL-6 is fundamentally similar, and that the activity of SOCS3 is required to sculpt the cellular response to IL-6 and thereby discriminate it from that of IFNγ. In addition to their role as inhibitors of cytokine signaling, a role for SOCS proteins in the desensitization of cytokine signaling was recently postulated (27Fischer P. Lehmann U. Sobota R.M. Schmitz J. Niemand C. Linnemann S. Haan S. Behrmann I. Yoshimura A. Johnston J.A. Muller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Desensitization, as opposed to inhibition, refers to the process by which an initial signaling event causes the cell to become refractory to subsequent signals. In the case of IFNγ signaling, the T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase has been shown to potently desensitize cells to repeated stimulation (28Sakamoto S. Qin J. Navarro A. Gamero A. Potla R. Yi T. Zhu W. Baker D.P. Feldman G. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3245-3253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although SOCS1 and SOCS3 are attractive candidates as mediators of desensitization to IFNγ and IL-6, respectively, detection of this activity has so far proved elusive (27Fischer P. Lehmann U.

In this study, we have explored the relationship between the kinetics of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinetics of Socs mRNA expression for both IFNγ and IL-6 signaling. We demonstrate marked differences in the kinetics with which SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit IFNγ and IL-6 signaling, respectively, and, furthermore, we show that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can desensitize cells to IFNγ and IL-6 signaling, respectively.

C57BL/6 (wild-type), Socs3-/Δ, Ifnγ-/-, and Socs1-/-Ifnγ-/- bone marrow cells were cultured in 8-cm tissue culture-treated plates (10 × 106/dish) overnight at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in 9 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 20% L-cell-conditioned medium (LCM, a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Cells and media were then transferred to 10-cm Petri dishes and incubated for a further 6 days, with 1 ml of LCM added to the cells on day 3. Adherent cells were then washed in mouse-tonicity phosphate-buffered saline (MTPBS) and resuspended in 4 ml of cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum/20% LCM. Cells, of which more than 95% were macrophages (as determined by morphology), were then plated into 12-well tissue culture-treated plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C, 10% CO2. The following day, cells were stimulated with maximal concentrations of either IL-6 (250 ng/ml) or IFNγ (125 ng/ml). Pulsed stimulations were performed by washing cells twice in MTPBS (37 °C), 15 min after stimulation, then adding Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum/20% LCM (37 °C). For mRNA stability experiments, inhibition of transcription was achieved by adding 2 μg/ml actinomycin-D (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 μl of dimethyl sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) to cells plated in 250 μl of media.

Immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies to STAT1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and SOCS1 or SOCS3 (generated at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Western blotting was carried out with antibodies specific for either tyrosine 701-phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), STAT1, tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3, Cell Signaling), STAT3, SOCS1, or SOCS3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA for real-time PCR and microarray analysis was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 20 μg of total RNA (for microarray analysis) or <1 μg of total RNA (for real-time PCR) in a 20-μl reaction for 1 h at 42 °C using 100 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and 5 μm T7 oligo(dT) primer (synthesized by GeneWorks, Thebarton, SA, Australia) as described in the GeneChip Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). For real-time PCR, cDNA products were diluted to 80 μl in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized for microarray analysis from 20 μl of single-stranded cDNA products according to Affymetrix methodology and was purified with Phase-Lock Gels (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was carried out on single-stranded cDNA samples using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) in 10-μl reactions containing 0.5 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 5 μl of QuantiTect Master Mix, and 4 μlof cDNA. Amplification was performed according to Qiagen's recommendations with a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer sequences were as follows: porphobilinogen deaminase (Pbgd)-forward: CCTGGTTGTTCACTCCCTGA; Pbgd-reverse: CAACAGCATCACAAGGGTTTT. Socs1-forward: GTGGTTGTGGAGGGTGAGAT; Socs1-reverse: CCCAGACACAAGCTGCTACA. Socs3-forward: TGAGCGTCAAGACCCAGTCG; Socs3-reverse: CACAGTCGAAGCGGGGAACT. Ttp-forward: CCTCTGCAACTCTGGTCTCC; Ttp-reverse: TTCTCAGGAGAGGCTTCGAC. Gadd45γ-forward: GCATCCTCATTTCGAATCC; Gadd45γ-reverse: CACCCAGTCGTTGAAGCTG. Expression was determined for the gene of interest relative to a standard curve created by serial dilution of the PCR product and was normalized against the expression of the housekeeping gene Pbgd. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis confirmed Pbgd to be stably expressed in livers and primary macrophages treated with IFNγ or IL-6 (data not shown). Where actinomycin-D was used to inhibit RNA transcription, and it was not appropriate to normalize to the expression level of Pbgd, gene expression was instead normalized to the number of cells plated. Microarray Time-course Analysis—Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized from double-stranded cDNA with the BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo, New York, NY). Samples were cleaned with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 15 μg of each cRNA sample was fragmented then hybridized overnight to MGU74Av2 Murine GeneChips (Affymetrix) following the manufacturer's instructions. GeneChips were stained with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner. Normalization and background correction was performed using the “Affy” package (www.bioconductor.org) of the “R” programming environment. Genes with a change in expression >1.7-fold between treated and control samples in two consecutive samples were considered to be differentially expressed. This cut-off was selected based on visual inspection of normalized quantile-quantile plots of the expression differences between pairs of microarrays. Genes displaying differential expression between control samples (either non-treated or PBS-treated) were removed. GeneCluster2 (31Reich M. Ohm K. Angelo M. Tamayo P. Mesirov J.P.

Differential Induction of STAT1 and STAT3 Tyrosine Phosphorylation by IFNγ and IL-6 in the Liver—Gene deletion studies in mice have revealed the importance of SOCS1 for regulating IFNγ and SOCS3 for regulating IL-6 signaling, however little is known of the comparative induction of SOCS proteins by IFNγ and IL-6. To investigate the in vivo activation of STAT1 and STAT3 and expression of Socs1 and Socs3 in response to these cytokines, we injected C57BL/6 mice with IFNγ or IL-6 and examined proteins in the livers of mice after various time periods. Immunoprecipitation (9Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and Western blotting demonstrated that, in response to either cytokine, tyrosine phosphorylation (a readout of STAT activation) of both STAT1 and STAT3 was maximal or near-maximal by 15 min after injection (Fig. 1, A and B). STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation declined to near basal levels after 4 h in response to either cytokine, and a much higher level was detected following injection of IL-6 compared with injection of IFNγ (Fig. 1A). In contrast, while the maximal levels of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation were similar following injections of both cytokines, phosphorylation declined to basal levels after 4 h in response to IFNγ but after only 1 h in response to IL-6 (Fig. 1B). These differences in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by IFNγ and IL-6 are consistent with the role of STAT1 as an important mediator of the response to IFNγ and the role of STAT3 as an important mediator of the response to IL-6 (21Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). IFNγ induced the robust expression of SOCS1 protein, with levels reaching a maximum at 2–4 h after injection of IFNγ, at a time when STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was waning (Fig. 1C; compare with Fig. 1, A and B). SOCS1 protein expression was maintained at a high level for at least 8 h, and declined to near basal levels by 16 h. In contrast, whereas the kinetics of induction of SOCS1 by IL-6 were similar to those induced by IFNγ, the magnitude was greatly reduced. In the case of SOCS3, the opposite appeared true; IL-6 induced the expression of SOCS3 protein very rapidly, with maximal levels detected 30 min to 1 h following injection, at a time that correlates with a decline in STAT1/STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1D; compare with Fig. 1, A and B), whereas IFNγ induced a barely detectable amount of SOCS3 (Fig. 1D). We confirmed the pattern of SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein expression in response to IFNγ and IL-6 at the mRNA level using a Q-PCR assay (Fig. 1E). Again, IFNγ induced Socs1 to greater levels than did IL-6, whereas IL-6 induced Socs3 to greater levels than did IFNγ. IL-6 induced both Socs1 and Socs3 mRNA to a similar extent, but more SOCS3 protein than SOCS1 protein, indicating that synthesis of SOCS3 protein may be more efficient than synthesis of SOCS1 protein. The kinetics of Socs3 mRNA and SOCS3 protein expression were similar, suggesting that the SOCS3 protein is highly labile, a finding that is consistent with the reported half-life of this protein (33Siewert E. Muller-Esterl W. Starr R. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Expression of SOCS1 protein, however, appeared to persist at 4 h and 8 h, despite declining levels of Socs1 mRNA, suggesting that the half-life of SOCS1 during active cytokine signaling in vivo is substantially greater than that of SOCS3. Continuous IL-6 Signaling in Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages Produces a Bi-phasic Response—The in vivo analysis of signaling confirmed the reciprocal relationship of IFNγ with SOCS1, and IL-6 with SOCS3. However, the intrinsic variability when working with mice, and the difficulty in precisely regulating cytokine levels following injection led us to investigate the kinetics of signaling in more tractable systems: cultures of primary cells. We initially examined IL-6 signaling in Socs3-deficient primary hepatocytes, but like Socs3-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (27Fischer P. Lehmann U. Sobota R.M. Schmitz J. Niemand C. Linnemann S. Haan S. Behrmann I. Yoshimura A. Johnston J.A. Muller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), these cells exhibited signs of basal STAT3 activation (albeit to a lesser extent), including low level STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and induction of IL-6-inducible genes (data not shown). Fortunately, Socs3-deficient primary bone marrow-derived macrophages did not show signs of basal STAT3 activation (Fig. 2A, lane 10). In bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with IL-6, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed during two distinct phases in response to IL-6 (Fig. 2, A and B). The first phase occurred between 15 and 30 min, and the second from 120 min onward. The decline in STAT3 phosphorylation from the initial peak at 15 min was rapid, and near-basal P-STAT3 levels were achieved by 60 min, suggesting that the half-life of STAT3 phosphorylation must be very short during this period. Expression of Socs3 mRNA was maximal at 30 min, 15 min after maximal STAT3 activation was observed (Fig. 3A). This was followed by a rapid reduction of Socs3 mRNA expression, with minimal expression observed between 60 to 90 min, and subsequent re-establishment of expression by 180 min. SOCS3 Is Responsible for Bi-phasic Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT3 and Expression of Genes in Response to IL-6—The observation of two separate phases of signaling by IL-6 in bone marrow-derived macrophages suggested that negative feedback by SOCS3 might impose a period of oscillation upon signaling by IL-6. To test this hypothesis, levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were determined in response to IL-6 in Socs3-/Δ bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). In the absence of Socs3, STAT3 phosphorylation was strongly induced after 15 min and was not substantially reduced for the remainder of the time course. SOCS3 is therefore responsible for imposing bi-phasic kinetics upon the signaling of IL-6. To determine how the expression levels of IL-6-responsive genes are affected by SOCS3-mediated regulation of IL-6 signaling, the responses of the IL-6-inducible genes growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45γ (Gadd45γ) (34Nakayama K.

Hearts from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice survived long-term when transplanted into BALB/c (H-2d) recipients treated with the tolerance-inducing regimen of anti-CD40L antibody (MR-1) plus donor-specific transfusion (DST). Grafts did not, however, survive long-term in (HO-1-/-) recipients given the same treatment. Similarly, long-term survival induced by DST was ablated when HO-1 activity was blocked by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX). We further asked whether modulation of HO-1 expression/activity could be used to promote the induction of graft tolerance. DST alone (day 0) failed to promote any prolongation of survival of DBA/2 (H-2d) hearts transplanted into B6AF1 (H-2(b,k/d)) recipients. However, long-term survival and (dominant peripheral) tolerance were readily induced when DST was combined with induction of HO-1 expression by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX). HO-1 induction plus DST led to a significant up-regulation of Foxp3, TGF-beta, IL-10, and CTLA4, which suggests a prominent role for CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). In fact, the tolerogenic effect of HO-1 plus DST was dependent on CD4+CD25+ Tregs as suggested by adoptively transferring these cells into irradiated recipients under various regimens. Taken together, these findings show that expression of HO-1 in a graft recipient can be essential for long-term graft survival and for induction of tolerance and that modulation of HO-1 expression/activity can be used therapeutically to synergize in the generation of graft tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2137061409,"Vasohibin is a recently identified protein that is up-regulated in cultured vascular endothelial cells by vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2. It inhibits endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation, and suppresses angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane, after subcutaneous implantation of matrigel, and in a tumor xenograft model. This has led to the hypothesis that vasohibin functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of angiogenesis. In this study, we tested that hypothesis in a well-characterized model of retinal neovascularization. In ischemic retina, increased expression of VEGF was accompanied by elevation of vasohibin mRNA and blocking of the increase in vegf mRNA with vegf siRNA significantly attenuated the rise in vasohibin mRNA. In transgenic mice in which the rhodopsin promoter drives expression of VEGF in the retina, there was also a significant increase in vasohibin mRNA. In mice with ischemic retinopathy, there was increased expression of vasohibin in vascular endothelial cells, and vasohibin knockdown caused an increase in neovascularization. Conversely, intraocular injection of recombinant vasohibin or an adenoviral vector containing a vasohibin expression cassette strongly suppressed retinal neovascularization in mice with ischemic retinopathy. Knockdown of vasohibin mRNA in ischemic retina had no significant effect on vegf or vegf receptor 1 mRNA levels but caused a significant elevation in the level of vegf receptor 2 mRNA. These data support the hypothesis that vasohibin acts as a negative feedback regulator of neovascularization in the retina and suggest that suppression of VEGF receptor 2 may play some role in mediating its activity."

The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and Lck play crucial roles in the signaling mechanism of various cellular processes. The enhanced expression of Syk in normal breast tissue but not in malignant breast carcinoma has prompted us to investigate its potential role in mammary carcinogenesis. Accordingly, we hypothesized that hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) may play an important role in regulating Syk activation, and Lck may be involved in this process. In this study, we have demonstrated that H/R differentially regulates Syk phosphorylation and its subsequent interaction and cross-talk with Lck in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, Syk and Lck play differential roles in regulating Sp1 activation and expressions of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MelCAM), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response to H/R. Overexpression of wild type Syk inhibited the H/R-induced uPA, MMP-9, and VEGF expression but up-regulated MelCAM expression. Our data also indicated that MelCAM acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating H/R-induced uPA secretion and MMP-9 activation.

Anderson S.J. Chan A.C. Bolen J. Loh D.Y. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9797-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The expression of Syk has also been reported in cell lines of epithelial origin (21Ulanova M. Puttagunta L. Marcet-Palacios M. Duszyk M. Steinhoff U. Duta F. Kim M.K. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Befus A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but its function in these cells is not well understood. It has been documented that Syk is commonly expressed in normal human breast tissue, benign breast lesions, and low tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (22Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Previous data indicated that Syk suppresses cell motility and NFκB-mediated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in breast cancer cells (23Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6209-6221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lck, a member of the Src family nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, is mostly expressed in T cells, breast cancer tissues, and cell lines and also in some B cells (24Koster A. Landgraf S. Leipold A. Sachse R. Gebhart E. Tulushan A.H. Ronay G. Schmidt C. Dingermann T. Anticancer Res. 1991; 11: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). Lck binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 and CD8 and plays an essential role in T cell activation and development (25Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Earlier reports have indicated that p72Syk plays a crucial role in activation of p56Lck through physical association and amino-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation at residues Tyr-518 and Tyr-519. Mutation of these residues to phenylalanines abolished its activity in vitro and toward cellular substrates in vivo and reduced its tyrosine phosphorylation by ∼90% (26Couture C. Deckert M. Williams S. Russo F.O. Altman A. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24294-24299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which H/R regulates Syk phosphorylation and its subsequent interaction with Lck leading to downstream signaling events in breast cancer cells are not well defined. MelCAM, previously known as MUC18 or MCAM, a newly recognized cell adhesion molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 113 kDa, belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (27Lehmann J.M. Holzmann B. Breitbart E.W. Schmiegelow P. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 841-845PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The presence of putative binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and cAMP-response element-binding protein in the promoter region suggests that MelCAM expression can be modulated by exogenous factors (30Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar). At the cellular level, phorbol ester and cyclic AMP have been shown to modulate MelCAM expression (31Rummel M.M. Sers C. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2218-2223PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier reports have indicated that MelCAM acts differently in the progression of breast carcinomas. It is expressed in normal and benign proliferative breast epithelium, and its expression is frequently lost in in situ and infiltrating breast carcinomas (32Shih L.M. Hsu M.Y. Palazzo J.P. Herlyn M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shih I.M. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The MelCAM core promoter contains four binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor, and deletion analyses have indicated that removal of all putative Sp1 sites reduced the promoter activity by 80%, suggesting that Sp1 is an important regulator of MelCAM expression (34Karlen S. Braathen L.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which H/R regulates Syk activation and Syk-dependent Lck-mediated Sp1 activation leading to the regulation of MelCAM expression in MCF-7 cells is not well defined. Degradation of extracellular matrix plays an important role in tumor metastasis. uPA is a member of the serine protease family that interacts with uPA receptor and facilitates the conversion of inert zymogen plasminogen into widely acting serine protease plasmin (35Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 36Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MMP-9, also referred as gelatinase-B, is not only associated with invasion and metastasis but also has been implicated in angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, retinopathy, and vascular stenosis and hence is considered to be a prioritized therapeutic target (37Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 38Folkman J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 749Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated the positive correlation between uPA/MMP-9 activation and the metastatic potential of tumors (39Rangaswami H. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38921-38935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which H/R regulates Syk/Lck-dependent MelCAM expression and uPA secretion and the uPA-dependent pro-MMP-9 activation in breast carcinoma cells is not well understood. Moreover, the roles of these molecules in regulating H/R-induced tumorigenesis and its clinical implications are not well defined. Hypoxia-induced VEGF production provides one of the main driving forces that stimulate the angiogenesis, which accompanies tumor progression (40Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7864) Google Scholar, 41Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). To date, VEGF is considered as the key factor that guided and regulated tumor angiogenesis (42Lutsenko S.V. Kiselev S.M. Severin S.E. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2003; 68: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Tumor cell-derived VEGF binds to its specific receptors and regulates tumor progression through neovascularization via autocrine and paracrine pathways (43Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Sci. STKE. 2001. 2001; (RE21)Google Scholar, 44Mercurio A.M. Bachelder R.E. Bates R.C. Chung J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggested that the VEGF promoter contains an Sp1-response element (45Bradbury D. Clarke D. Seedhouse C. Corbett L. Stocks J. Knox A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the role of Lck and Syk in H/R-induced VEGF expression in breast cancer is not defined clearly. In this study we have demonstrated the differential role of Syk and Lck in the H/R-induced uPA, MMP-9, and VEGF expression. Our findings suggested that H/R down-regulates Syk activation leading to enhanced uPA, MMP-9, and VEGF expression. Furthermore, overexpression of Syk restored H/R-induced down-regulation of Mel-CAM expression. In hypoxic cells, Lck also physically associates with Syk, and this association plays a crucial role in regulating the downstream signaling. The in vivo relevance of our study was further validated in a xenografted nude mice model, which also supports our in vitro findings. Clinical data also indicated that the higher grades of tumors showed significant HIF-1α expression compared with that of lower grades or normal breast tissue and also demonstrated an inverse correlation between Syk/MelCAM and uPA/MMP-9/VEGF expression, which further correlates with enhanced tumorigenic potential and neovascularization. Materials—The rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk, anti-Lck, anti-Sp1, anti-MelCAM, anti-uPA, anti-MMP-9, anti-actin, mouse monoclonal anti-Lck, anti-Syk, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and MelCAM blocking peptide were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGF was from Oncogene. Rabbit polyclonal anti-vWF antibody was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Lipofectamine Plus was obtained from Invitrogen. pp2, aminogenistein, and damnacanthal were from Calbiochem. The Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide was purchased from Bangalore Genei. Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences. The [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Hyderabad, India). The female nude mice (NMRI, nu/nu) were from National Institute of Virology (Pune, India). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—The MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Hypoxic/Reoxygenation Cultures—The MCF-7 cells grown to 50-70% confluence were made hypoxic in evacuation chambers by intermittent application of vacuum and sparging with 95% N2, 5% CO2. Cells were analyzed at this point or maintained under hypoxic conditions in the presence of 100 mm dithionate (an O2 scavenger) at 37 °C for the indicated time point. These cells were reoxygenated for the indicated periods by replacing the medium with fresh medium and incubating the cultures in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—To detect the effect of H/R on cellular localization of Syk, cells grown in monolayer on glass slides were induced by hypoxia for 2 h and reoxygenated for 45 min. The cells were fixed and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk antibody (1:50 dilution) followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature. The role of H/R in regulating Syk-Lck colocalization was determined by immunofluorescence studies using a mixture of mouse monoclonal anti-Syk and rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody followed by a mixture of TRITC- and FITC-conjugated IgG. The cells were washed and mounted with coverslips. All these samples were analyzed under confocal microscopy (Zeiss). The clinical specimens were analyzed by immunohistopathological studies. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) were subjected to antigen retrieval, and the Syk-Lck colocalization was determined by immunofluorescence studies using a mixture of rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk and mouse monoclonal anti-Lck antibodies followed by a mixture of FITC- and TRITC-conjugated IgGs. The levels of HIF-1α expression in these clinical samples were determined by Western blot analysis. The levels of MelCAM, uPA, MMP-9, and VEGF expressions in these samples were detected by immunofluorescence studies by using their specific antibodies. The tumor microvessel densities were detected by immunostaining with anti-vWF antibody. All these samples were analyzed under confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Plasmids and DNA Transfection—The dominant-negative form of Lck (DN Lck, K273R) in pcDNA3 was a kind gift from Dr. D. R. Branch (Canadian Blood Services, Toronto, Ontario). The wild type and kinase-negative Syk cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 were the generous gifts from Dr. Susette C. Mueller (Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical School, Washington, D. C.). MCF-7 cells were transfected with specific cDNA using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (46Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These transfected cells were used for Syk-Lck colocalization and interaction studies, detection of Sp1, Syk, Lck, MelCAM, uPA, MMP-9, and VEGF by Western blot analysis, and in vivo tumorigenicity experiments. Zymography Experiments—The gelatinolytic activity was measured as described (46Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 47Rangaswami H. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19381-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine whether H/R regulates MMP-9 activation and to investigate the effect of inhibition of MelCAM expression on H/R-induced MMP-9 activation, cells were either induced with H/R for 24 h or pretreated with MelCAM blocking peptide (50 μg) and then exposed with H/R. The conditioned media were collected, and the samples were analyzed by zymography as described (47Rangaswami H. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19381-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Negative staining showed the zones of gelatinolytic activity. Immunoprecipitation—To delineate the role of H/R in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, cells were exposed to hypoxia for 2 h followed by reoxygenation for 0-60 min. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with Lck inhibitors, pp2 (4 nm), aminogenistein (2 μm), and damnacanthal (0.8 μm), and then exposed to H/R. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk antibody and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-Syk antibody. To analyze whether Syk interacts with Lck and to determine whether H/R regulates this process, cells were exposed to H/R for 45 min. In other experiments, cells were transfected with wild type and kinase-negative Syk and then subjected to H/R. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates containing equal amount of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Lck antibody and analyzed by Western blot using anti-Syk antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-Lck antibody. Western Blot Analysis—To analyze the roles of Syk and Lck in regulating MelCAM, VEGF expression, and MMP-9 activation, cells were transfected with wild type and kinase-negative Syk or dominant-negative Lck and then exposed to H/R for 24 h as described earlier. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-MelCAM or anti-VEGF antibody. The levels of Lck and Syk in nontransfected or transfected cell lysates were also detected by Western blot using anti-Lck or anti-Syk antibody. The level of active MMP-9 in conditioned media was detected by Western blot. To analyze the effect of inhibition of MelCAM on H/R-induced uPA secretion, cells were pretreated with MelCAM-specific blocking peptide (50 μg/ml) for 24 h and subjected to H/R treatment. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-uPA antibody. The level of HIF-1α expression in the normal and breast tumor specimens of different grades was also detected by Western blot using anti-HIF-1α antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-actin antibody as loading control. Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot—To check whether H/R regulates Sp1 expression, cells were subjected to H/R for 0-180 min at 37 °C. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier (24Koster A. Landgraf S. Leipold A. Sachse R. Gebhart E. Tulushan A.H. Ronay G. Schmidt C. Dingermann T. Anticancer Res. 1991; 11: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were separated by spinning at 3300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as cytoplasmic extract. The nuclear pellet was extracted in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. The nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the level of Sp1 was detected by Western blot using rabbit anti-Sp1 antibody. In separate experiments, to examine the effects of Syk and Lck on H/R-induced Sp1 expression, cells were transfected with wild type and kinase-negative Syk or DN Lck and then induced with H/R. The nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using anti-Sp1 antibody. The levels of Lck and Syk in nuclear extracts were also detected by Western blot using anti-Lck or anti-Syk antibody. The level of expression of HIF-1α in hypoxia or H/R-induced nuclear extracts was detected by Western blot using anti-HIF-1α antibody. Actin was used as loading control. EMSA—To examine whether H/R induces the Sp1-DNA binding, cells were exposed to H/R for 0-180 min as described earlier. To check whether Syk and Lck play any role in regulating H/R-induced Sp1-DNA binding, cells were transfected with wild type and kinase-negative Syk or pretreated with Lck inhibitors, pp2 (4 nm), aminogenistein (2 μm), and damnacanthal (0.8 μm) followed by exposed to H/R for 1 h. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and incubated with 16 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded Sp1 oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGC-3′) in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complex was resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. In Vivo Xenograft Tumor Model—The tumorigenicity experiments were performed as described (47Rangaswami H. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19381-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, female athymic nude mice, NMRI, nu/nu (BALB/c) obtained from National Institute of Virology (Pune, India) were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and used for in vivo tumorigenicity studies. Cells were either exposed to H/R or transfected with wild type or mutant Syk and then exposed to H/R for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test, and only a single cell suspensions (5 × 102/0.2 ml) of >90% viability were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of female athymic NMRI (nu/nu) mice (6-8 weeks old). Five mice were used in each set of experiments. Growth of tumors was monitored weekly by measuring the tumors with calipers. The mice were killed after 4 weeks of injection, and the levels of uPA, VEGF, and MelCAM in the tumors were analyzed by Western blot. The level of Sp1-DNA binding in the nuclear extracts of the tumor samples was determined by EMSA. The tumor samples were also processed for histopathological studies. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) were subjected to antigen retrieval and then stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-9, anti-uPA antibody, or mouse monoclonal anti-MelCAM antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. The tumor microvessel densities were detected by immunostaining with anti-vWF antibody. The level of colocalization of Syk and Lck in these tumor specimens was determined by immunofluorescence using a mixture of mouse monoclonal anti-Syk and rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody followed by a mixture of FITC- and TRITC-conjugated IgG. All these samples were analyzed under confocal microscopy (Zeiss).

Eight of the 11 cloned Fanconi anemia gene products (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and -M) form a multisubunit nuclear complex (FA core complex) required for monoubiquitination of a downstream FA protein, FANCD2. FANCL, which possesses three WD40 repeats and a plant homeodomain (PHD), is the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the FA complex. Here, we demonstrate that the WD40 repeats of FANCL are required for interaction with other subunits of the FA complex. The PHD is dispensable for this interaction, although it is required for FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. The PHD of FANCL also shares sequence similarity to the canonical RING finger of c-CBL, including a conserved tryptophan required for E2 binding by c-CBL. Mutation of this tryptophan in the FANCL PHD significantly impairs in vivo mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and in vitro auto-ubiquitination activity, and partially impairs restoration of mitomycin C resistance. We propose a model in which FANCL, via its WD40 region, binds the FA complex and, via its PHD, recruits an as-yet-unidentified E2 for mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2.

Grompe M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Tischkowitz M.D. Hodgson S.V. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The most notable clinical features of FA are hematological, with high incidence of aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (2Tischkowitz M.D. Hodgson S.V. J. Med.

Additionally, FA patients are predisposed to many types of cancer, including leukemias, and solid tumors of the head, neck, or gynecological systems (1D'Andrea A.D. Grompe M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cells from FA patients are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linkers such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane, or cisplatin (4D'Andrea A.D. Grompe M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1725-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison to wild-type cells, treatment of FA cells with genotoxins results in high levels of chromosome breakage, radial chromosomes (particular triradials), and other cytogenetic abnormalities that occur during metaphase (4D'Andrea A.D.

Eight FA gene products (A, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M) form a core complex required for the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 (15D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has many functional roles. While it was first described for its involvement in proteasome-mediated degradation, it has since been shown to regulate a diverse set of processes, including cellular trafficking and DNA repair (16Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is carried out by a cascade of three enzymes: the E1 activates a ubiquitin through ATP hydrolysis and then transfers the moiety, via a thioester linkage, to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme. The E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates transfer of the ubiquitin to the substrate and, thereby, confers specificity. Consistent with this role, there are several classes of E3s, each with a distinct mechanism of ubiquitin transfer. HECT domain E3s bind ubiquitin via a thioester bond and then transfer it directly to the substrate (16Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Alternatively, RING domain E3 ligases recruit both the E2 and the substrate, bringing them into close proximity and allowing direct transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 to an isopeptide linkage with an internal lysine of the substrate. The E3/E2 interaction is mediated by the RING domain, while the E3/substrate interaction is mediated by a distinct substrate-recognition domain that varies with each ligase (17Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Several lines of in vivo evidence strongly suggest that the FA complex is the E3 ligase for FANCD2. Specifically, FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination is (a) lost in patient-derived cell lines lacking any single subunit of the complex (1D'Andrea A.D. Grompe M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar); and (b) reduced in “wild-type” cell lines (HeLa, U20S, 293T) following RNA interference knockdown of various members of the FA complex (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P.

Additionally, FANCL was recently identified as the putative catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the FA core complex (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It possesses three WD40 repeats and a plant homeodomain (PHD). In general, WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions, while PHD fingers have been ascribed various functions, including phosphoinositide binding (18Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is some debate, however, as to whether PHD E3s are, in fact, better categorized as RING finger variants (20Scheel H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 285-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro assays demonstrated auto-ubiquitination activity of FANCL in the presence of E1, E2, ATP, and ubiquitin, and this activity is lost upon mutation of a conserved zinc-coordinating cysteine that forms part of the PHD consensus sequence (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This mutant also fails to restore FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination in vivo. It has also been suggested that the FANCL PHD is required for complex stability (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C.

No study has shown in vitro ubiquitination of FANCD2 by FANCL. The precise roles of each domain of FANCL are poorly understood. Therefore, this study carries out structure/function analysis of the domains of FANCL. Through mutagenesis, we show that the FA complex is bound and stabilized by the WD40 repeats of FANCL and that the PHD is dispensable for this interaction. We also demonstrate that a tryptophan conserved in PHD and RING-variant E3s is required for full activity of FANCL, both in vivo and in vitro. We propose a model in which FANCL, via its WD40 repeats, binds the FA complex and, via its PHD, recruits an as-yet-unidentified E2 for mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and grown in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C. Wild-type (normal adult) lymphoblast lines (PD7 and GM02254) (22Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 2457-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the FA lymphoblast line, EUFA868 (FA-L) (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M.

Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). FANCL cDNA (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M.

Joenje, Department of Clinical Genetics and Human Genetics, Free University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was subcloned into the retroviral vector pMMP-puro. pMMP-puro-FLAG-FANCL was generated by adding the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) at the amino terminus of FANCL. Production of pMMP retroviral supernatants was performed as previously described (24Naf D. Kupfer G.M. Suliman A. Lambert K. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FLAG-FANCL point mutants were generated through directed PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange Kit, Stratagene). Truncations and deletions were generated with standard PCR cloning techniques. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of residues 275–375 of FANCL (GST-PHD) were generated with pGEX-6p-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Retroviral Infection—FA-L lymphoblasts underwent three rounds of infection with pMMP supernatants: each round lasted 24 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) and was followed by incubation for 24 h in regular RPMI (15% fetal bovine serum). After the final round, infected cells were washed free of viral supernatant and resuspended in growth media. After 48–72 h, the cells were transferred to media containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. Dead cells were removed over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) cushion after 5 days, and the surviving cells were grown under continuous selection in puromycin. MMC Sensitivity and Chromosomal Breakage Assays—MMC sensitivity assays for lymphoblasts were performed essentially as described previously (25Yamashita T. Barber D.L. Zhu Y. Wu N. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) but with a CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit (Invitrogen). Chromosome breakage analysis was performed by the Cytogenetics Core Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as described previously (26Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Taniguchi T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Anti-FLAG antibody (monoclonal M5 or rabbit polyclonal, Sigma) and anti-tubulin (monoclonal, Abcam) were purchased. Immunoprecipitation—Whole-cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) supplemented with protease tablets (Roche Applied Science). Each lysate was normalized to contain 2 mg of total protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and FLAG-FANCL was immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of packed M2 anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) for 24 h at 4 °C. The agarose was then washed three to four times with chilled lysis buffer. FLAG-FANCL was eluted with either 150 ng/ml FLAG peptide or with SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. In Vitro Auto-ubiquitination Assay—We carried out in vitro auto-ubiquitination assays essentially as described previously (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 31Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The 25-μl reaction mixture contained E1 (25 ng, Boston Biochem), UBCH5a (250 ng, Boston Biochem), GST-PHD fusion protein containing residues 275–375 of FANCL (0.6–1.2 μg), His-ubiquitin (20 μm, Sigma), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5, Sigma), ATP (2 mm, Sigma), MgCl2 (5 mm, Sigma), dithiothreitol (0.5 mm, Sigma), and okadaic acid (10 nm, Sigma). The reaction was incubated for 90 min at room temperature and terminated with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed with 2× sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 3–8% gradient gel with Tris acetate buffer (Invitrogen) for FANCD2 or a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) with MES buffer (Invitrogen) for FANCA, -F, -G, and -L. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a submerged transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) filled with Transfer Buffer (Invitrogen). After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody diluted in TBS-T (1:500 dilution for FANCA, -D2, -F, -G, and -L; 1:1000 for M5; and 1:250 for rabbit anti-FLAG), washed extensively, and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was used for detection. Generation of DNA Damage—For mitomycin C and hydroxyurea (Sigma) treatment, cells were continuously exposed to the drug for the indicated time. pMMP-FLAG-FANCL Functionally Corrects FA-L Lymphoblasts—EUFA868 lymphoblasts transcribe FANCL cDNA with an insertion at a splice junction between intron 10 and exon 11, resulting in the removal of the PHD and part of the third WD40 repeat from FANCL (11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, no wild-type FANCL is detectable in EUFA868 lymphoblasts. We complemented these cells with retroviral pMMP-FLAG-FANCL or pMMP-vector only. To confirm that the cells were functionally corrected, we assayed for FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and resistance to the DNA cross-linker, MMC. The upper band of FANCD2, representing the mono-ubiquitinated protein, was restored following treatment with MMC or hydroxyurea (Fig. 1A), and cell survival of complemented EUFA868 lymphoblasts in response to MMC treatment was similar to that of GM02254 wild-type lymphoblasts (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the cells complemented with FLAG-FANCL had significantly reduced radial chromosomes compared with FA-L lymphoblasts infected with vector control (Fig. 1C) following treatment with MMC. The WD40 Repeats of FANCL, but Not the PHD, Are Required for Interaction with the FA Complex—We characterized various FANCL domains for their ability to promote FA complex assembly. WD40 repeats form β-propeller structures that mediate protein-protein interactions (32Li D. Roberts R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Since FANCL is part of a large multisubunit protein complex, we hypothesized that its WD40 repeats mediate interaction with the FA complex. Therefore, we generated deletion mutants that lack each of these WD40 repeats (Fig. 2A). Unlike wild-type FLAG-FANCL, none of the deletion mutants co-immunoprecipitated with FANCA (Fig. 2B) or corrected FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (Fig. 2D). We also generated two C-terminal truncations of FANCL (Fig. 2A). FLAG-FANCL1–306 terminates immediately before the first conserved cysteine of the PHD; FLAG-FANCL1–275 terminates immediately after the third WD40 repeat and, therefore, is missing the linker region between the third WD40 and the PHD. FLAG-FANCL1–275 did not co-immunoprecipitate FANCA or FANCG (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 7). Interestingly, FLAG-FANCL1–306 bound and stabilized the FA complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 8), indicating that the linker region is required for this interaction, while the PHD is dispensable. Neither FLAG-FANCL1–275 (data not shown) nor FLAG-FANCL1–306 corrected FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (Fig. 2D), confirming that the PHD domain is required for this activity. Level of Interaction between FANCL Point Mutants and the FA Complex Correlates with FANCD2 Mono-ubiquitination—The loss of interaction observed in the WD40 deletion mutants could be explained by gross structural changes that disturb the overall fold of FANCL. To test whether the interaction with the FA complex was affected by less disruptive mutations, we altered individual residues in the FANCL WD40 region. We identified residues in FANCL that were completely conserved through Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and carried out either charge reversal or alanine substitutions as indicated (Fig. 3A). FLAG-FANCLR226E did not bind FANCA (Fig. 3B) and had no activity in FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (Fig. 3C). In contrast, FLAG-FANCLY111E, FLAG-FANCLW201A, and FLAG-FANCLW275A bound FANCA weakly (Fig. 3B), with a corresponding decrease in activity, as determined by the reduced levels of D2 upper band (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that the WD40 region of FANCL interacts with the FA complex and that the strength of this interaction correlates with the level of FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. A subset of WD40 repeat β-propellers, such as the β-TRCP subunit of SCF ligases, recognize phospho-proteins (33Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 34Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since at least one subunit of the FA complex, FANCM, is hyperphosphorylated following DNA damage (13Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J. Stone S. Dokal I. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we investigated whether FANCL association with the FA complex was enhanced in cells treated with MMC. We saw no change in FANCA co-immunoprecipitation following DNA damage (data not shown). Furthermore, FANCL did not co-immunoprecipitate with its putative substrate, FANCD2 (data not shown), which is hyperphosphorylated following MMC-treatment (35Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Xu B. Andreassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Kim S.T. Lane W.S. Kastan M.B. D'Andrea A.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Trp-341 of FANCL Is Required for Efficient Mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2—Next, we investigated the function of the FANCL PHD. Based on sequence, structural, and functional similarity, it has been postulated that PHD E3 ubiquitin ligases are variants of RING finger E3s (20Scheel H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 285-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Dodd R.B. Allen M.D. Brown S.E. Sanderson C.M. Duncan L.M. Lehner P.J. Bycroft M. Read R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53840-53847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two types of E3 domains share sequence similarity, we carried out a sequence alignment comparing the PHD of FANCL, the RING variant (RINGv) domains of several E3 ligases, and the well characterized RING of c-CBL (Fig. 4A), an E3 that ubiquitinates receptor tyrosine kinases. Sequence alignment revealed conservation of a tryptophan in PHD and RINGv E3 ligases, including FANCL, MEKK1, K3, and MIR1 (Fig. 4A) but not in canonical RING E3 ligases (17Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In c-CBL, a tryptophan at this position interacts with UBCH7, an E2 enzyme (17Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In FANCL, this tryptophan, Trp-341, is 100% conserved through fruit fly and mosquito, despite degeneracy in flanking sequences (Fig. 4B and Ref. 11Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Based on these alignments, we hypothesized that the PHD of FANCL plays a role similar to that of c-CBL by recruiting an E2 and that Trp-341 is involved in this interaction. To test this possibility, we expressed FLAG-FANCLW341G in EUFA868 lymphoblasts. As a control, we carried out a parallel infection of lymphoblasts with FLAG-FANCLC307A, which previously has been shown to be inactive and should be unable to coordinate a zinc ion, a key structural feature of PHD and RING fingers. FLAG-FANCLW341G had significantly reduced activity in comparison to the wild-type protein. In the absence of DNA damage, there was a lower level of mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 compared with cells corrected with wild-type FANCL (Fig. 4C, compare lane 3 with lane 7). This modification could not be further activated with MMC treatment (Fig. 4C, compare lane 7 with lane 8). In comparison, FLAG-FANCLC307A did not restore the FANCD2 upper band. To confirm that this mutation did not lead to gross structural instability that disrupts the association of FANCL with the FA complex, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-FANCLW341G and wild-type FLAG-FANCL. For both proteins, we observed normal binding to FANCA, FANCF, and FANCG, as compared with wild-type protein (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, both proteins stabilized the subunits of the FA complex to a similar extent (Fig. 4D). Tubulin is shown as a loading control for the input and as a negative control for binding. These data confirm that Trp-341 is necessary for full FANCL activity and are consistent with the hypothesis that the PHD plays a role independent of FA complex binding. Trp-341 Is Required for in Vitro Auto-ubiquitination of the FANCL PHD—To test whether reduced FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination in FA-L lymphoblasts expressing FLAG-FANCLW341G is due to a reduction in E3 ligase activity, we carried out in vitro ubiquitination with GST fusions of the FANCL PHD (GST-PHD). After incubation of GST-PHDWT with E1, E2, His-ubiquitin, and ATP, we observed an increase in higher molecular weight species by Coomassie stain (Fig. 5, top panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–5). These bands were immunoreactive with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5, lower panel) and anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 5, middle panel), indicating auto-ubiquitination of GST-PHDWT. The negative control, GST-PHDC307A, was inactive (Fig. 5, lane 6), indicating that auto-ubiquitination is mediated by an intact PHD. GST-PHDW341G was also inactive (Fig. 5, lane 7). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Trp-341 is required for full E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of FANCL and mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. FLAG-FANCLW341G Partially Rescues MMC Sensitivity and Chromosomal Breakage in EUFA868 Lymphoblasts—We tested several mutants for their functional effects downstream of FANCD2 ubiquitination. FLAG-FANCL constructs individually lacking each WD40 repeat displayed levels of MMC sensitivity similar to that of vector controls (Fig. 6A). Lymphoblasts corrected with FLAG-FANCLW341G, however, exhibited an intermediate phenotype. Unlike the other mutants presented in the graph, FLAG-FANCLW341G corrects the MMC sensitivity"

In this study, goldfish granulin was one of the most commonly identified transcripts in the differential cross-screening of macrophage cDNA libraries and was preferentially expressed in proliferating macrophages. Unlike mammalian granulins, which possess 7.5 repeats of a characteristic signature of 12 cysteine residues, the goldfish granulin encoded a putative peptide possessing only 1.5 cysteine repeats. Northern blot and real-time PCR analyses indicated that goldfish granulin was expressed only in the hematopoietic tissues of the goldfish, specifically the kidney and spleen, and in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We expressed granulin using a prokaryotic expression system and produced an affinity-purified rabbit anti-goldfish granulin IgG. Recombinant goldfish granulin induced a dose-dependent proliferative response of goldfish macrophages that was inversely related to the myeloid differentiation stage of the cells studied. The highest proliferative response was observed in macrophage progenitor cells and monocytes. This proliferative response of macrophages was abrogated by the addition of anti-granulin IgG. These results indicate that goldfish granulin is a growth factor that positively modulates cell proliferation at distinct junctures of macrophage differentiation.

Northern blot and real-time PCR analyses indicated that goldfish granulin was expressed only in the hematopoietic tissues of the goldfish, specifically the kidney and spleen, and in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We expressed granulin using a prokaryotic expression system and produced an affinity-purified rabbit anti-goldfish granulin IgG. Recombinant goldfish granulin induced a dose-dependent proliferative response of goldfish macrophages that was inversely related to the myeloid differentiation stage of the cells studied. The highest proliferative response was observed in macrophage progenitor cells and monocytes. This proliferative response of macrophages was abrogated by the addition of anti-granulin IgG. These results indicate that goldfish granulin is a growth factor that positively modulates cell proliferation at distinct junctures of macrophage differentiation. First identified as small (6 kDa) peptides, granulins are produced by the proteolysis of a larger precursor molecule by leukocyte derived elastase activity (1Bateman A. Belcourt D. Bennett H.

Progranulin was shown to be highly expressed in epithelial cells that exhibit rapid turnover, such as the columnar epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (29Daniel R. He Z. Carmichael K.P.

There are a number of published granulin-like sequences identified in lower vertebrates as well as invertebrates (e.g. zebrafish, GenBank™ accession numbers AF273479 and AF273480). Although a number of granulin genes have been identified in lower vertebrates and invertebrates, many of the peptides encoded by these genes have yet to be functionally characterized. We report on a unique granulin-like gene of the goldfish. Northern blot, real-time PCR, and RT-PCR 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; PKM, primary kidney macrophage; MAF, macrophage-activating factor; Grn, granulin; rgfGrn, recombinant goldfish granulin; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; Epi, epithelin. analyses revealed that this granulin gene was expressed exclusively in the hematopoietic tissues of the goldfish. Recombinant goldfish granulin induced dose-dependent proliferation of primary goldfish macrophages in vitro, which was abrogated by an affinity-purified anti-granulin IgG. Our findings indicate that granulin was present in macrophage culture supernatants and that it promoted growth of cells at discrete stages of myeloid differentiation pathway. Fish—Goldfish (Carassius auratus) were purchased from Mt. Parnell Fisheries Inc. (Mercersburg, PA) and maintained at the Aquatic Facility of the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta. The fish were kept at 20 °C in a flow-through water system and fed to satiation daily with trout pellets. The fish were acclimated to this environment for at least 3 weeks prior to use in experiments. Isolation of Primary Macrophages from Goldfish and RNA Isolation—Isolation of goldfish kidney leukocytes, and the generation of primary kidney macrophages (PKM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were performed as previously described (38Neumann N.F. Barreda D. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Neumann N.F. Barreda D.R. Belosevic M.

Immunol. 2003; 27: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The kinetics of PKM growth in culture were similar to those reported for mammalian macrophages derived from bone marrow cultures in the presence of conditioned medium from the L-929 fibroblast cell line (43Belosevic M. Davis C.E. Meltzer M.S. Nacy C.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 890-896PubMed Google Scholar). Three distinct macrophage subpopulations are a feature of PKM cultures: the early progenitors, the monocytes, and mature macrophages (44Barreda D.R. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2001; 11: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Barreda D.R. Neumann N.F. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2000; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PKM cultures were incubated at 20 °C until the cells were at a stage of active proliferation (proliferative phase) or nonproliferation (senescence phase), typically 6 and 10 days post-cultivation, respectively. PKM from the proliferative and senescence phases were isolated, flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used. The mRNA for the two macrophage subpopulations was isolated using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) and the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' specifications. Generation of Macrophage-activating Factor (MAF) Supernatants—MAF supernatants were prepared using protocols described previously (41Neumann N.F. Stafford J.L. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2000; 10: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These supernatants contain a complex mixture of factors that have been functionally characterized and shown to induce antimicrobial responses of goldfish macrophages (41Neumann N.F. Stafford J.L. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2000; 10: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Stafford J.L. Ellestad K.K. Magor K.E. Belosevic M. Magor B.G. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Construction of cDNA Libraries of Primary Kidney Macrophages of Goldfish—Complementary DNA libraries were constructed from 2 μg of proliferative or senescence phase PKM poly (A)+ RNA by directional ligation of PKM cDNA into λ ZAP bacteriophage using a ZAP cDNA synthesis kit, and the ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene) as described previously (46Barreda D.R. Hanington P.C. Walsh C.K. Wong P. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 727-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Non-amplified PKM proliferative and senescence phase cDNA libraries were screened using standard procedures described previously (46Barreda D.R. Hanington P.C. Walsh C.K. Wong P. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 727-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following the tertiary PCR-based screen, individual clones were PCR-amplified, sequenced, confirmed to encode for a single-sized insert, and stored individually at 4 °C in 500 μl of SM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.5) and chloroform. DNA Sequencing and Analysis—The PCR-amplified clone inserts corresponding to each of the confirmed granulin positive clones were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using a DYEnamic™ ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a PE-Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer. Sequences were analyzed using Genetool™ (Biotools) and subsequent gene annotations were conducted using BLAST programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Conserved motifs were identified, and predictions were based on analytical tools provided in the ExPASy proteomics server (www.expasy.org) (47Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX, version 1.83. Real-time PCR Analysis of Granulin Expression—Real-time PCR analysis was carried out using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system. The relative expression of goldfish granulin in relation to β-actin was assessed using primers generated with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for expression analysis of goldfish granulin were: 5′-TTGATGTTACTCATGGCAGCTCTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCCTGAGAGATCCATCATT-3′. The primers used for expression analysis of goldfish β-actin were: 5′-GCACGCGACTGACACTGAAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCCGCTCCGAGGTA-3′. Analysis of the relative tissue expression data from five fish was carried out using the 7500 Fast software (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR Analysis of Goldfish Granulin Expression in Macrophages—Cultured PKM were sorted into early progenitor, monocyte, and mature macrophage subpopulations using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described previously (39Neumann N.F. Barreda D.R. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2000; 10: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Barreda D.R. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2001; 11: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Barreda D.R. Neumann N.F. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2000; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the RNA was isolated immediately after sorting. First-strand synthesis was done using an oligo(dT) primer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 2.5 μg of total RNA according to manufacturer's protocols. The primers used to amplify goldfish granulin by RT-PCR were: sense 5′-AAGATGGTTCCAGTGTTGATGTTAC-3′, antisense 5′-ACCCCACTGGCCGGCTGCTGT-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Twenty five μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose, 20% formaldehyde gel and transferred overnight to Genescreen Plus nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were screened using 200 ng of a goldfish granulin probe created using RT-PCR. The probe was singly labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and purified using QIAquick gel extraction columns (Qiagen). Hybridization with the probe was allowed to proceed overnight at 42 °C, and then unbound probe was removed by three consecutive washes of 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min each and three times with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min. Blots were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film and stored at –80 °C for 24 h before being developed. Prokaryotic Expression of Goldfish Granulin—Goldfish granulin was expressed using a prokaryotic protein expression system. PCR amplification of the protein expression construct insert was performed as follows. 7 μl of the granulin clone template was added to 76 μl of double-distilled H2O, dNTPs (0.2 μl each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP in 100 mm solutions), 10× PCR buffer (10 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin), and expression primers (2.4 μl of each 20 μm solution (sense, 5′-CACCCTCATGGCAGCTCTTGTAG-3′; antisense, 5′-ACGGGGGTTGTTTACTTAC-3′) and a 15:1 ratio of Taq:Pfu DNA polymerases (1 μl of 5-unit solution). PCR amplification was conducted in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient™ thermal cycler. Amplification was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The granulin amplicon was cloned into the pET SUMO TA expression vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were plated onto LB-ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Randomly selected colonies were amplified by PCR, and positive clones were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids were isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Once positive clones were isolated, restriction digests followed by gel electrophoresis verified the presence of insert and vector DNA. Plasmids were sequenced, as described above, to confirm that inserts were ligated into the expression vector in the proper orientation and in-frame. Sequence data were analyzed using Genetool (Biotools). Production of Recombinant Granulin—Plasmid DNA containing the granulin expression construct was transformed into BL21 Star™(DE3) One Shot® E. coli (Invitrogen) for recombinant protein expression. 10 ng of plasmid DNA was transformed into the bacteria, which was then grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Induction of recombinant protein expression was performed in a pilot expression experiment by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside according to the manufacturer's protocols. The expression of recombinant granulin was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Individual samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for the presence of recombinant protein expression. For large scale expression and purification of the target proteins, 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin was grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking to an A600 of ∼1.0 to 2.0. Ten milliliters of this culture was then inoculated into 250 ml of LB (100 μg/ml carbenicillin), and a total of four flasks were prepared (1 liter total). Cultures were incubated until mid-log phase of growth was achieved followed by the induction of target protein expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were then grown for 2 h prior to the purification of the recombinant molecules. Recombinant granulin was engineered to contain a N-terminal His6 tag to facilitate subsequent detection and purification. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and supernatants were collected. Granulin was purified from culture supernatants using MagneHIS beads (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Purified proteins were eluted in a solution containing 100 mm HEPES and 500 mm imidazole and then were dialyzed overnight against 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Protein samples were then filter-sterilized in preparation for immunodetection and analysis of biological activity. Total protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunodetection of Recombinant Goldfish Granulin (rgfGrn)—rgfGrn was used as a source of antigen for rabbit immunizations. The primary immunization was performed by combining an equal volume of purified recombinant granulin (100 μg), with 750 μl of Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections were done exactly as the primary immunizations but substituted with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The IgG fraction was purified by precipitation using saturated ammonium sulfate, solubilization of precipitate in phosphate-buffered saline, and purification using a HiTrap protein A HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions containing IgG were pooled and filter-sterilized (0.22 μm filter, Millipore). The specificity of the antibody was determined by immunoblot using as a target rgfGrn under native and denaturing conditions. rgfGrn and native goldfish granulin (4× concentrated macrophage culture supernatants) were detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or with affinity-purified rabbit anti-goldfish rgfGrn IgG. Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of the primary antibody. Membranes were subsequently washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody, and developed using the ECL Advance™ Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Induction of Proliferation of Macrophages by Recombinant Granulin—PKM cultures were established, and distinct differentiation stages were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells well–1 in 96-well culture plates (Falcon). Cells were seeded in 50 μl of complete culture medium and treated with 5, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng of recombinant goldfish granulin suspended in 50 μl of incomplete cell culture medium and incubated for 52 h at 20 °C. Fifteen μl of bromodeoxyuridine labeling reagent (BrdUrd, Roche Applied Science) per well was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 20 °C. The reaction was developed according to the manufacturer's specifications, and optical densities were determined at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek). The colorimetric reaction was directly proportional to the number of proliferating PKM in culture (data not shown). The induction of macrophage proliferation by rgfGrn was determined after the addition of different amounts (1, 10, 50, 100, 300, 500 ng) of anti-rgfGrn to cultures. The most common transcript identified in differential cross-screening of proliferative and senescence phase goldfish macrophage cDNA libraries was granulin (Fig. 1). Thirty-one partial granulin-like transcripts were identified, and all exhibited higher expression in proliferating macrophages. All of the transcripts were sequenced and found to be identical. The fully sequenced cDNA transcript of goldfish granulin is 947 nucleotides in length with an open reading frame of 477 nucleotides. The predicted protein is 159 amino acids long and had 18 conserved cysteine residues, 12 of which represent a full granulin cysteine motif common for all known granulin proteins. The remaining 6 cysteine residues make up one-half of this motif (Fig. 2). The granulin sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number DQ369750).FIGURE 2cDNA sequence of goldfish granulin with the predicted amino acid translation of the open reading frame. The cysteine residues composing the 1.5-granulin cysteine motif are underlined (GenBank™ accession number DQ369750).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The predicted goldfish granulin protein possessed conserved amino acids found in granulins spanning the metazoans. Granulins have been identified in mammals, fish, insects, bivalves, and nematodes. The amino acid sequence alignment of goldfish granulin and other known fish granulins of carp, zebrafish, and goldfish intestine show highly conserved cysteine-rich motifs (Fig. 3B). Goldfish granulin was most similar to carp granulin 3, with an amino acid identity of 56%. Of all the granulins analyzed, goldfish granulin shared the highest identity with other fish granulins (Fig. 3A), a finding that was supported by phylogenetic analysis that grouped the goldfish granulin in close proximity to carp granulins 2 and 3 (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic analysis also suggested that all fish granulins share distinct features that separate them from the granulins of mammals. Although the granulin proteins identified in carp and from goldfish intestine have no corresponding mRNA transcript sequences, zebrafish granulins 1 and 2 and zebrafish hybrid granulin had transcript organization similar to that of goldfish granulin.FIGURE 4Phylogenetic tree of selected granulin peptides. Goldfish granulin groups closely to carp granulins 3 and 2, which are closely associated with the zebrafish granulins 1 and 2 and hybrid as well as with carp granulin-1 and the goldfish granulin identified from intestinal exudates. All of the progranulin peptides from Xenopus, human, mouse, and rat are closely grouped, and all are out-grouped by granulin-like peptides identified in C. elegans.

This protein has lost its DNA binding domain but has retained its sugar recognition site. The structure represents a novel sugar-binding fold. TrmBΔ2-109 bound maltose, glucose, sucrose, and maltotriose, exhibiting Kd values of 6.8, 25, 34, and 160 μm, respectively. TrmBΔ2-109 behaved as a monomer in dilute buffer solution in contrast to the full-length protein, which is a dimer. Co-crystallization with bound maltose identified a binding site involving seven amino acid residues: Ser229, Asn305, Gly320, Met321, Val324, Ile325, and Glu326. Six of these residues interact with the nonreducing glucosyl residue of maltose.

TrmB also binds to an inverted repeat sequence upstream of the BRE-TATA box and in front of frk, a gene divergently oriented to malE and encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase (24Qu Q. Lee S.-J. Boos W. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The transcriptional repression of the malE operon by TrmB in an in vitro transcription assay is overcome by the substrates of the trehalose/maltose ABC transporter (i.e. maltose and trehalose) (18Lee S-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, a second operon in P. furiosus encoding an ABC transporter for maltodextrins was identified (25Koning S.M. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J.M. Archaea. 2002; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The gene cluster encoding this transporter of P. furiosus consists of mdxE encoding the substrate-binding protein (PF1938), mdxF and mdxG encoding the two transmembrane permeases (PF1937 and 1936), pulA encoding amylopullulanase (PF1935), and mdxK encoding the ATP-hydrolyzing protein of the transporter (PF1933). MdxE, carrying the substrate recognition site of the transporter, has been crystallized with bound maltotriose (26Evdokimov A.G. Anderson D.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the maltodextrin ABC transporter is distinct in its substrate specificity from the trehalose/maltose ABC transporter, which recognizes maltose and trehalose but not maltodextrins. Recently, we found that TrmB also controls the mdxE operon of P. furiosus as a transcriptional repressor and showed that repression is abolished by maltotriose and sucrose but not by maltose or trehalose (19Lee S-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, TrmB appears to act as a bifunctional transcription regulator acting on two different promoters and being differentially controlled by binding to different sugars. We constructed a truncated form of TrmB in which the N-terminal DNA binding domain (amino acids 2-109) is deleted. In contrast to the full-length protein (which is dimeric) the truncated form behaved as a monomer during molecular sieve chromatography. Its binding affinity for the various substrates was increased, but its sigmoidal binding characteristic toward maltose could no longer be observed. Here, we report the crystal structure of the truncated form of TrmB. The structure contains bound maltose and represents a novel form of a sugar binding fold. Since the binding of the different sugars results in differential operator recognition, they will elicit differential conformational changes in the intact repressor protein. Construction of Truncated TrmB Proteins—All truncated TrmB mutants were cloned into pCS19, resulting in C-terminal His tag versions. We used 5′ target sequence primers containing an NcoI site (CCATGG) and a 3′ end encompassing the sequence primer of TrmB containing the BamHI site. PCR products and vector plasmid were digested with NcoI and BamHI and were ligated by T4 ligase. The resulting plasmids containing the target inserts began with methionine as the first translated codon within the NcoI site. The constructed plasmids were called pSL189, pSL190, and pSL191 for Δ2-30, Δ2-59, and Δ2-109, respectively. We transformed the constructed plasmids into Escherichia coli SF120 competent cells and purified the three mutants truncated in the N-terminal DNA binding domain, Δ2-30, Δ2-59, and Δ2-109 TrmB, by Ni2+-NTA 2The abbreviation used is: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. affinity chromatography. Site-directed Mutation Analysis in the Sugar Binding Motif of TrmB— We prepared coupled primers (codon and noncodon strands of the same length) containing a target site mutation in the middle position (MWG Biotech). 100 ng of plasmid DNA encoding TrmBΔ2-109 was used as template DNA for PCR with 20 pmol of both primers, 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, and 1.5 units of Pwo polymerase. The PCR protocol was 94 °C for 30 min, 55 °C for 45 min, and a long extension phase at 72 °C for 12 min. 16 cycles were performed. PCR products were purified by the Qiagen extraction kit. The eluted DNA samples were directly digested by DpnI for selective degradation of methylated template DNA for 1 h at 37 °C. DNAs were directly transformed into the E. coli SF120 competent cells. The transformants were selected on ampicillin (100 μg/ml)-containing LB plates. The plasmid DNAs were prepared by a plasmid mini-prep kit (Qiagen). All site-directed mutations were checked by sequencing analysis (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). Protein Purification and Molecular Sieve Chromatography—For the expression of truncated TrmB and the site-directed mutation proteins derived from it, cells were grown in 1 liter of NZA medium (10 g of NZ-amine A, 5 g of yeast extract, 7.5 g of NaCl/liter) and 100 μg of ampicillin/ml at 30 °C. 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added after the culture had reached OD 0.7 at 578 nm. Cells were grown for an additional 5 h at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Ni2+-NTA affinity solution (buffer I; 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), ruptured in a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged for 30 min at 17,300 × g. The supernatant was heated to 80 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation of the precipitated proteins, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA superflow column from Qiagen equilibrated with buffer I. The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole and eluted with 250 mm imidazole, both in the same buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. TrmBΔ2-109 was extremely well induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and remained soluble during incubation at 80 °C, allowing for removal of E. coli proteins. The final concentration of pure TrmBΔ2-109 was about 1.0 mg/ml. It was kept frozen at -70 °C. For molecular sieve chromatography of TrmBΔ2-109, we used Superdex 200 HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) with equilibration buffer, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, and 0.4 ml/min as the rate of elution. Despite the fact that wild type TrmB is retained by a Superdex column (19Lee S-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the truncated protein was successfully separated by this type of material. The column was calibrated by molecular mass standard: chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and aldolase, 158 kDa (Amersham Biosciences). Native molecular weight was calculated by comparison with standard marker proteins. Protein Purification Prior to Crystallization Experiments—Cells were grown as described above, but the cell pellet was resuspended in running buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole. Cells were ruptured twice in a French pressure cell at 11,000 p.s.i. and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min, and after centrifuging for 60 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was loaded onto an Ni2+-NTA superflow column from Qiagen equilibrated with running buffer. After it was loaded, the column was washed with running buffer and eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole) using a three-step gradient. The protein eluted at the final step (100% elution buffer) and was afterward concentrated in elution buffer (preventing protein precipitation) using Vivaspin concentrators from Vivascience equipped with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane. Final protein concentration was 10 mg/ml, determined using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm calculated according to Gill and Hippel (27Gill S. Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of TrmBΔ2-109 were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm maltose) were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.6, and 8% (w/v) PEG 4000 and equilibrated against the reservoir solution at 18 °C. Trigonal crystals (space group P3221) grew to a size of ∼50 × 40 × 50 μm3. Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the native crystals in reservoir solution containing in addition 1 mm platinum and 1 mm uranylacetate, respectively. Soaking time was 4 h for the platinum derivatives and 10 min for the uranylacetate derivatives. Diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in buffer corresponding to the equilibrated crystallization drops plus 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant. All data sets were collected at the Swiss Light Source (SLS; beamline X06SA) provided with a MarCCD detector and were processed using XDS (28Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) and subsequently merged in XSCALE.

One platinum site, one uranylacetate site, and four sulfur sites were found by SOLVE and used to determine initial phases. Subsequently, RESOLVE led to an interpretable electron density map and an initial model. Model building and refinement was done using the CCP4 suite (31Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr.

Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A 100-μl aliquot of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl containing 3.4 or 6.8 μm TrmBΔ2-109 was incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]maltose (0.65 μm) (Amersham Biosciences), [14C]maltotriose (0.47 μm), [14C]sucrose (0.4 or 0.8 μm) (Amersham Biosciences), or 14C-glucose (8 μm) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). [14C]Maltotriose was synthesized from [14C]maltose by the action of E. coli amylomaltase without loss of specific activity (36Dippel R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8322-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Prior to their addition, the labeled sugars had been mixed with unlabeled sugars to reach a final concentration between 5 and 1,000 μm. Incubation was for 5 min at 70 °C. The assay was stopped with 2 ml of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate in binding buffer and kept on ice for 10 min. The suspension was then filtered through cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Schleicher & Schüll; pore size 0.45 μm) and washed with 1 ml of 95% saturated ammonium sulfate in binding buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Also, labeled sugar-binding inhibition assays with other sugars (maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and glucose) were done in the same way with inhibiting sugars present between 25 and 500 μm, respectively. Purification of Truncated TrmB—Mainly due to the tendency of TrmB to precipitate from solutions exceeding 1 mg/ml, attempts to crystallize the full-length TrmB protein have so far not been successful. Because of our experience that eubacterial repressor fragments can be crystallized after deletion of the N-terminal DNA binding domain, we constructed several N-terminal truncated TrmB variants as C-terminal His tag versions and tested them for maltose-binding affinity. Of three constructs (Δ2-32, Δ2-59, and Δ2-109) 3In the following, amino acids are numbered as in the full-length protein. only one (Δ2-109) was not degraded, was highly soluble, and was expressed in large amounts after induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. TrmBΔ2-109 was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE after Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. From 1 liter of rich medium, 20 mg of pure TrmBΔ2-109 was routinely obtained. The protein was stored frozen in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml without loss of maltose binding activity. Using molecular sieve chromatography (Superdex 200) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl at room temperature TrmBΔ2-109 eluted with a peak corresponding to a species of 30 kDa (Fig. 1A), indicating that the protein was monomeric. However, the peak showed considerable trailing, which reflects interactions with the gel matrix. Sugar Binding Activity of TrmBΔ2-109—Full-length TrmB can bind maltose, trehalose, maltotriose, longer maltodextrins, sucrose, and glucose but not fructose, galactose, ribose, and lactose. TrmBΔ2-109 showed the same binding specificity but increased binding affinity toward the same sugars compared with intact TrmB. This was particularly evident with maltose as substrate. The binding isotherm for all sugars, including maltose, was hyperbolic and exhibited a stoichiometry of about 1:1 (substrate/polypeptide). It showed the following Kd values: 6.8 μm for maltose, 25 μm for glucose, 34 μm for sucrose, and 160 μm for maltotriose (Fig. 2). Inhibition studies (Table 1) showed mutual competitiveness, indicating that all sugars were bound at the same site. We emphasize that binding of these sugars by full-length TrmB is sigmoidal only for maltose (18Lee S-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol.

Experimental phases were obtained by isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering (see “Experimental Procedures” and Tables 2 and 3). Fig. 3 shows the structure of TrmBΔ2-109 in a ribbon representation. TrmBΔ2-109 consists of two domains, termed the N- and C-domains, formed by residues Ala110-Gly246 and Lys249-Ser342, respectively. The two residues Asn247 and Pro248 may serve as a hinge. The N-domain forms an 8-stranded sheet flanked by two large helices on one side and one large helix crossing the β-sheet on the other side. Because the latter helix provides the only maltose-binding residues of the N-domain, we shall designate it as the “sugar binding helix” in the following. The C-domain forms a strand, a helix, and an irregular, flattened, seven-stranded β-barrel with its axis roughly parallel to the strands of the N-domain sheet. Most of the residues binding the nonreducing part of the maltose molecule are contributed by two neighboring loops of the C-domain barrel. Maltose Binding in TrmBΔ2-109—In the interstice between the two domains of TrmBΔ2-109, electron density corresponding to maltose (α-d-glucosyl-1,4-α-d-glucose) was visible (Figs. 3 and 4). The nonreducing glucosyl residue of maltose forms hydrogen bonds with residues Asn305, Gly320, Met321, Val324, Ile325, and Glu326. All residues with the exception of Ser229 are in the C-domain and part of the β-sheet (Asn305) as well as part of a loop region (Gly320,Met321, Val324, Ile325, and Glu326). Ser229 in the sugar binding helix of the N-domain contributes the only hydrogen bond contacting the reducing glucosyl moiety of maltose. Based on the observed mode of binding for maltose, it appears likely that all substrates are bound with their nonreducing α-glucosyl moiety to the same six amino acid residues of the C-domain. Obviously, the fixation of the common nonreducing glucosyl residue is the basis for the surprisingly large range of different substrates. Four of the maltose-interacting residues (Ser229, Asn305,Gly320, and Glu326) were changed by site-directed mutagenesis into alanine, and the purified proteins were analyzed for their binding affinity to maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and glucose (Table 4). Whereas the mutant E326A lost all sugar binding affinity, mutants D305A and G320A showed reduced affinity. The mutant S229A showed reduced binding affinity only for maltose and maltotriose, whereas the affinity for sucrose and glucose remained the same as with the nonmutated TrmBΔ2-109.TABLE 4Kd values for sugar binding to TrmBΔ2-109 and site-directed mutants Shown are Kd values (μm) of site-directed mutants of TrmBΔ2-109 at a protein concentration of 3.4 μm. –, no binding; ND, not determined.ProteinsMaltoseGlucoseSucroseMaltotrioseμmTrmBΔ2–1096.82534160S229A102535250N305A50100801,000G320A250150200>2,000E326A––––N305A/G320A–ND––G320A/E326A–––– Open table in a new tab Comparison with Eubacterial Binding Proteins and Transcriptional Repressors—The maltose binding TrmBΔ2-109 structure should be compared with the effector binding domains of the eubacterial lac repressor family members and eubacterial periplasmic binding proteins, which are thought to form a common structural class (37Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 38Hars U. Horlacher R. Boos W. Welte W. Diederichs K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The periplasmic binding proteins are subdivided into groups with one, two, and three switches of the polypeptide between the two domains (39Clarke T.E. Ku S.-Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Borths E.L. Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These proteins undergo a large conformational change, moving the two domains against each other in such a way as to bury the substrate between them. The sugar binding pocket of TrmBΔ2-109 does not resemble the canonical substrate binding pocket of eubacterial sugar-binding transcriptional regulators and periplasmic binding proteins. Although the N-domain and the barrel domain of TrmBΔ2-109 participate in establishing the binding pocket, only the α-β N-domain resembles part of the eubacterial proteins, whereas the barrel domain has no counterpart among them. In addition, whereas isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and trehalose are bound to the eubacterial proteins deeply in the cleft between both domains and with their axis oriented roughly along the cleft (41Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), the bound maltose in TrmBΔ2-109 sticks to the surface-exposed edge of the cleft between the N- and the C-domain, oriented with its axis roughly perpendicular to the cleft (Fig. 5). The buried surface between the two domains is rich in phenylalanines and other hydrophobic residues, rendering a large movement of these domains in response to the sugar binding rather unlikely. Alteration of the amino acid residues that are in contact with the bound maltose reveal the special role of Ser229. The change to Ala only affects the binding of maltose and maltotriose but not the binding to sucrose and glucose (see Table 4). Ser229 is the only amino acid that contacts the reducing glucosyl residue of maltose. From these data, it is likely that sucrose interacts with the sugar binding helix on a site different from Ser229. Possibly, it is the differential lateral movement of this helix in response to the binding of the different sugars that elicits the differential response in operator recognition. According to the structure of TrmBΔ2-109, the DNA binding domain of the full-length TrmB is in proximity of the N-terminal end of the sugar binding helix, suggesting transduction of differential induced fit movements upon sugar binding via this helix. The TrmBΔ2-109 Structure Represents a Novel Sugar-binding Structure—The result of a Dali search (42Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) with TrmBΔ2-109 in the Protein Data Bank is summarized in Table 5. The three highest scores show only similarities between individual structural elements. Chain A of E. coli polyphosphate kinase (Protein Data Bank accession number 1xdo) yielded the highest score because of a similar barrel domain in both structures. Chain A of the calpain protease core was second because of the good superposition with the sugar binding helix of TrmBΔ2-109. Chain A of a biotin ligase was third due to a poor superposition with the N-domain of TrmBΔ2-109. Thus, the structure and its mode of sugar binding are entirely novel.TABLE 5Top hits of a Dali search with the structure of TrmBΔ2-109 PDB, Protein Data Bank entry code; Z-score, strength of structural similarity in S.D. values above expected according to Ref. 42Holm L.

One site is overlapping with and extending downstream of the BRE-TATA box of the malE operon (TM promoter) from T. litoralis and P. furiosus (18Lee S-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second site is nearly coincident with the transcriptional start point of the mdxE operon (MD promoter) in P. furiosus. The first site contains a palindromic motif 5′-TACTNNNAGTA-3′, whereas the second contains a distorted palindromic motif, 5′-TACTNNNATGG-3′ (19Lee S-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From the perfect palindrome of the first site, one can conclude that TrmB binds there as a dimer with 2-fold symmetry relating one TrmB molecule and half of the palindrome to the remainder of the complex. In the second site, most likely only the first half of the sequence (5′-TACTNNNA-3′) will contribute to the recognition of the TrmB dimer, resulting in a changed TrmB conformation. This prediction should hold despite the lack of knowledge about the structure of the N-terminal 109 residues of TrmB. A possible quaternary structure of dimeric TrmB was selected from all crystallographic binary associates of TrmBΔ2-109 as the one that buries the largest surface from solvent (2929 Å2). In this association, the N termini are approximately parallel at a distance of only 12.7 Å (Fig. 6). Such a dimer of full-length TrmB would allow for a solvent-sequestered interface between the two DNA binding domains and would resemble several bacterial repressors that also bind to palindromic operators. TrmB binding to DNA as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as well as transcriptional repression in vitro has been found to be reduced upon the addition of specific sugar molecules (18Lee S-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Lee S-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the inducibility by some of the sugars depended on the operons to which TrmB was bound, rendering TrmB a bifunctional transcriptional regulator: The TM operon was induced by maltose and trehalose but not by sucrose or maltodextrin, whereas the MD operon was induced by sucrose and maltodextrins but not by maltose or trehalose (19Lee S-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA, TrmB binds maltose, sucrose, glucose, maltotriose, and trehalose in decreasing order of affinity, and only maltose is bound in a cooperative manner. The structure of TrmBΔ2-109 suggests explanations for these observations. When TrmB docks to the operator in front of the TM operon, due to the perfectly symmetric palindrome a complex of perfect 2-fold symmetry will result, exhibiting increased binding affinity for maltose and trehalose. However, when TrmB binds to the operator in front of the MD operon, due to the broken symmetry of the palindrome, allosteric effects will change the affinities of the sugar binding site so that sucrose and maltodextrins are preferentially bound. The delicate design of the sugar binding site across the cleft of the N- and C-domain, with the common nonreducing end bound to the C-domain and the other end pushing the sugar binding helix of the N-domain, is well suited for such allosteric changes."

Their overall structures are very similar to those of the oxygenase domain of mammalian NOS, including the substrate-binding site.

At least two types of oxygenated complexes seem to exist: heme-oxyI and heme-oxyII (22Marchal S. Gorren A.C. Sorlie M. Andersson K.K. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol.

Heme-oxyII has a Soret absorption band near 430 nm and an intact O–O bond, as shown by resonance Raman spectroscopy (24Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

Although it is known that heme-oxyII is an oxygenated complex, its electronic configuration is not completely understood. In particular, the Fe–O bond has never been previously observed in NOS. We report here the characterization of the oxygenated complex of saNOS by resonance Raman spectroscopy, which provides important information about the electronic properties of this complex formed during catalysis by NOS. Materials—H4B, NOHA, and D2O (99.9% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. l-Arginine was from Alexis Biochemical (San Diego, CA). Argon and 16O2 gas were from Praxair (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). 18O2 gas (99% purity) was from Icon (Mt. Marion, NY). Enzyme Preparation—saNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli from the cloned gene and was purified as described previously (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Samples were maintained in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Where indicated, l-arginine (1 mm or 100 μm), NOHA (500 μm), and citrulline (500 μm) were added to the purified enzyme. For samples containing H4B, a concentration of 500 μm was used. The association of cofactor H4B and substrates with saNOS were monitored by the displacement of dithiothreitol bound to the ferric enzyme using optical spectroscopy (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow experiments were carried out with an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer installed inside an MBraun (Stratham, NH) LabMaster 100 glovebox where the oxygen concentration was maintained below 4 ppm. The dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus was 1.5 ms with the 10-mm path length cell. Anaerobic protein samples (5 μm) were reduced with a 1.25 molar ratio of sodium dithionite over heme. Rapid mixing experiments with reduced saNOS and oxygen were carried out at 21 °C. The O2 concentration used was 10% except for the experiment with NOHA described below, for which 100% O2 was used. The kinetics of formation and decay of the oxygenated complex were followed at individual wavelengths in kinetic scanning mode. Kinetic traces were recorded at 5 nm intervals, from 380 to 450 nm, which generated optical spectra versus time data sets. The kinetic data were analyzed using the Specfit global analysis software (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC) with a kinetic model involving three species: species A corresponded to the initial reduced saNOS, species B corresponded to the transient oxygenated complex, and species C corresponded to the final ferric form. From these analyses, the deconvoluted optical spectra, the fit at all wavelengths and the time course of appearance and decay of the three kinetic species were obtained. The decay of the oxygenated complex to the ferric enzyme followed single exponential kinetics for some conditions. In other conditions, two exponential functions were required to fit the data (Table 1). When two exponential rates were apparent, the rates were obtained from single wavelength kinetic traces recorded over a longer time period than the kinetic scanning experiments to ensure an accurate determination of the slow reaction rate.TABLE 1Rates of formation and decay of the oxygenated complexes of saNOS, drNOS, and bsNOS and the wavelength maxima of the Soret absorption band of the oxygenated complexesProteinFormation of FeIIIO2-Decay rateaThe rate of decay corresponds to autoxidation when catalysis cannot occur: - Arg/ - H4B, + Arg/ - H4B, and - Arg/ + H4B.

Open table in a new tab For single turnover experiments with NOHA, a reduced saNOS sample with 500 μm NOHA and 500 μm H4B was mixed with oxygen-saturated buffer (100%), and the kinetic traces were recorded in kinetic scanning mode from 380 to 460 nm and from 510 to 610 nm at 5 nm intervals. The kinetic model included a fourth species, which corresponded to the FeIIINO complex formed after the oxygenated complex and before the ferric resting protein. Construction of a Rapid Mixer—The continuous-flow rapid mixer was built according to the specifications of the rapid “T” mixer described by Takashi et al. (26Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, two solutions were injected in the upper part of the “T” mixer. The solutions were injected using glass syringes connected to two PEEK tubes, which were in turn attached to Nanoport assemblies (Upchurch Scientific Inc., Oak Harbor, WA). The solutions were forced into the opposite ends of a 100-μm-wide, 25-μm-deep channel etched into the upper part of the “T” (mixer) (Custom Precision Technology, Cokato, MN). They were mixed when they engaged into a 5-cm-long quartz tube with a 250 × 250-μm-wide internal channel (Friedrich & Dimmock Inc., Milville, NJ). Two modifications to the design of Takashi et al. were made. First, a piece of glass was used in place of the metal plate forming the upper part of the “T” mixer. Second, a thicker Teflon sheet (250 μm) containing a 250-μm-diameter hole was used to seal the upper part of the mixer and the quartz tube. The position of the assembled mixer with respect to the exciting light source was controlled using a digital micrometer with a resolution of one micron (Newport Instruments, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The efficiency of mixing was determined by the diffusion limited acid-base reaction between Na2HPO4 and HCl followed by Raman spectroscopy (27Takahashi S. Ching Y.C. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8405-8407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With this method, at the first observable point after mixing, 93% of HPO42- was converted into H2PO4- with a flow rate of 3 ml/min–1 (supplemental data, Fig. S1). The efficiency of mixing decreased to 92 and 88% at 2 and 1 ml/min, respectively. A 3 ml/min flow rate was used thereafter. The theoretical dead time of the mixer was 0.28 ms. The actual dead time determined from the fluorescence signal generated by the formation of a hydroxyquinoline.Mg2+ complex (28Brissette P. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was 0.49 ± 0.04 ms (supplemental data, Fig. S2). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy with the Continuous-flow Mixer—Prior to mixing, the reduced form of saNOS (80 μm) was prepared by equilibrating the enzyme with pure argon gas for at least 30 min at room temperature and by adding 1.25 molar equivalents of sodium dithionite. The concentration of the sodium dithionite stock solution was determined by the reduction of a small aliquot of the anaerobic saNOS sample. Complete reduction was assessed by optical spectroscopy. Air-saturated buffer was used for mixing experiments with 16O2. Buffer with 20% 18O2 was prepared from buffer equilibrated with one atmosphere of 18O2 (2 ml) and diluted to 10 ml with anaerobic buffer. For the experiments with NOHA, buffers saturated with 100% 16O2 and 18O2 were used. The rapid mixer was made anaerobic with a solution of 10 mm sodium dithionite followed by washing with anaerobic buffer to remove the excess dithionite. Two 10-ml syringes filled with oxygenated buffer and the 80 μm reduced saNOS solution, respectively, were used. The output at 441.6 nm from a He/Cd laser (Liconix laser, Melles-Griot, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), at ∼12 milliwatts was focused on the sample inside the channel of the quartz cell. The resonance Raman spectra were acquired using previously described equipment (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) at 4 ms to 100 ms after mixing, depending on the sample. Several 30-s spectra (12 to 13) were acquired and averaged. All resonance Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature (25 °C). The resonance Raman spectra were calibrated with the lines of indene. The resonance Raman spectrum of reduced myoglobin was recorded before each experiment to check for small differences between calibrations on different days. Equilibrium resonance Raman spectra were obtained as previously described (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Formation and Decay of the Oxygenated Complex—The kinetics of formation and decay of the oxygenated complex of saNOS were determined by stopped-flow optical spectroscopy. The results obtained by mixing oxygenated buffer with reduced saNOS, saturated with l-arginine are shown in Fig. 1. The kinetic traces at 415 nm and 440 nm and the fit to the three species kinetic model are shown in Fig. 1A. These wavelengths show the largest variations of absorbance. The good fit of the data to the kinetic model was shown by the very small amplitude of the residuals at all wavelengths (<0.0015 ΔA) over the course of the reaction (Fig. 1D). The deconvoluted absorption spectra of the reduced, oxygenated, and oxidized species were obtained (Fig. 1B). Reduced saNOS (solid line) displayed an absorption maximum at 412 nm, just like the spectrum of the starting material before mixing (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The transiently formed oxygenated species (dashed/dotted trace) displayed a Soret absorption maximum at 430 nm, whereas the oxidized form (dotted trace), which is the species obtained at the end of the kinetic reaction, displayed a Soret absorption band centered at 398 nm. Because l-arginine was bound at the active site, the ferric spectrum was that of the five-coordinate, high spin form (11Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The variation in concentration of the three species as a function of time is shown in Fig. 1C. The oxygenated complex reached a maximal concentration of 2.4 μm (96% of the total heme concentration) 15–30 ms after mixing. The rate of formation of the oxygenated complex was 106 s–1 (Table 1). Subsequently, the oxygenated species was converted to the oxidized form, with rate constants of 5.6 s–1 and 1 s–1, respectively (Table 1). In the absence of substrate, the appearance and decay of the oxygenated complex were faster, and the complex reached a concentration of 2.3 μm 2.1 ms after mixing (supplemental data, Fig. S3). The rate of formation of the oxygenated complex was 1880 s–1 (Table 1). This complex decayed with a single rate constant of 39.6 s–1 (Table 1). The addition of 500 μm H4B did not affect the rate of formation of the oxygenated complex, which remained at 2080 s–1 (Table 1). With both l-arginine and H4B, the rate of formation of the oxygenated complex (143 s–1) was similar to that with l-arginine alone (106 s–1). Although H4B had only a small effect on the rate of formation of the oxygenated complex, it increased the rate of decay in the presence of l-arginine, with rates of 18 and 5 s–1, respectively, compared with rates of 5.6 and 1.0 s–1 with l-arginine alone (Table 1). In the absence of l-arginine, H4B slowed the decay from a single rate of 39.6 s–1 to two rates of 32.8 and 3.6 s–1, respectively (Table 1). Optical Spectra of the Oxygenated Complexes—For every condition, an oxygenated species with a Soret absorption band centered at 430 nm was formed (Table 1). For samples with no H4B, this was the only oxygenated complex detected. For samples containing H4B without l-arginine, the data did not fit the simple three-species model well, pointing to a kinetic model with a fourth species. A species with a very short half-life (5 ms) that displayed a Soret absorption maximum near 425 nm was transiently detected before it was converted at a rate of 89 s–1 to the oxygenated species with the Soret absorption maximum at 430 nm (Table 1). The formation and decay of the two oxygenated species overlapped. The resonance Raman spectrum with H4B alone (see below) was thus obtained from a mixture of a majority of the 430 nm species (75%), some 425 nm species (23%) and 2% of the ferric form. Because the excitation wavelength was 442 nm, only the 430 nm species was characterized by resonance Raman spectroscopy. For the sample containing both l-arginine and H4B, the kinetic model included three species. The deconvoluted oxygenated spectrum had a wide Soret absorption band consisting of two peaks centered approximately at 405 and 430 nm (Table 1). These species could not be resolved by including a fourth species in the kinetic model. Either both oxygenated s"

We identified PSD95, Veli-2, and other PDZ domain-containing proteins as binding partners for Gγ13 by yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. In two-hybrid assays, Gγ13 interacted specifically with the third PDZ domain of PSD95, the sole PDZ domain of Veli-2, and the third PDZ domain of SAP97, a PSD95-related protein. Gγ13 did not interact with the other PDZ domains of PSD95. Coexpression of Gγ13 with its Gβ1 partner did not interfere with these two-hybrid interactions. The physical interaction of Gγ13 with PSD95 in the cellular milieu was confirmed in pull-down assays following heterologous expression in HEK293 cells. The interaction of Gγ13 with the PDZ domain of PSD95 was via the C-terminal CAAX tail of Gγ13 (where AA indicates the aliphatic amino acid); alanine substitution of the CTAL sequence at the C terminus of Gγ13 abolished its interactions with PSD95 in two-hybrid and pull-down assays. Veli-2 and SAP97 were identified in taste tissue and in Gγ13-expressing taste cells.

The interaction of Gγ13 with PDZ domain-containing proteins may provide a means to target particular Gβγ subunits to specific subcellular locations and/or macromolecular complexes involved in signaling pathways. A sophisticated and ordered protein network is essential to the proper functioning of cells. Precise assembly of individual components, through targeting and anchoring of proteins within designated subcellular compartments, ensures the integrity of these networks (1Brown D. Breton S. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 816-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Huber A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 769-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific protein-protein interactions are important for accomplishing this complex task. For example, PSD95 (postsynaptic density protein 95, also called SAP90), a member of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) protein family (3Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), helps to assemble a complex postsynaptic protein network via its interactions with several different proteins. Some of these interactions rely on three PDZ domains (named after PSD95, Disc-large, and ZO-1) located in the N-terminal half of PSD95. PDZ domains function as protein-protein interaction modules and consist of about 90 amino acids (4Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sheng M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). PDZ domains typically bind to the extreme C terminus of a target protein in a sequence-specific manner. The PDZ domains of PSD95 recognize a canonical -X(S/T)XA motif (where X represents any amino acid and A represents an aliphatic amino acid). PDZ domains have been identified in proteins in bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, metazoans, and plants and comprise the most common protein module identified in the sequenced genome (4Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition to their affinity for C-terminal motifs, PDZ domains can also bind to internal sequences that mimic free C termini. Finally, PDZ domains can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers, enabling them to participate widely in the formation of vast and complex cellular networks (4Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains containing Lin/MALS/Veli proteins have been implicated in protein trafficking and assembly (7Borg J.P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S.

In mammals this group includes members that are expressed ubiquitously (e.g. Mint-3) or selectively in neurons (e.g. MALS-1). MALS, along with CASK and Mint-1, forms a tightly associated heterotrimeric protein complex that is evolutionarily highly conserved (cf. the Lin-2-Lin-7-Lin-10 complex in Caenorhabditis elegans). Both CASK and Mint-1 also contain more than one PDZ domain, as well as other protein interaction modules, enabling the CASK-Mint-1-Veli complex to interact with an array of proteins during vesicle trafficking and protein targeting. The Lin-2-Lin-7-Lin-10 complex (the invertebrate equivalent of CASK-Mint-1-Veli) is required for the basolateral localization of LET-23, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Simske J.S.

This is achieved in part by the membrane targeting of heterotrimeric G proteins and their specific interactions with particular receptors. Specific lipid modification of Gα and Gγ plays an important role in targeting and anchoring these proteins to the cell membrane (15Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The Gβ subunit, although not modified by lipids, is membrane-bound by virtue of its tight interaction with Gγ. The prenylation of the Gγ is dictated by the conserved CAAX motif at its C terminus (15Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), where A and X represent an aliphatic amino acid and any amino acid, respectively. Isoprenoids are covalently attached to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif, whereas Gγ is still in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the last three amino acids are proteolytically cleaved, and the free C terminus is carboxymethylated. This carboxymethylation is believed to be a membrane-associated event, and the insertion of the attached lipids into the cellular membrane completes the anchoring of Gβγ on the inner side of the cellular membrane (16Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 17Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys.

In this study, we demonstrate interactions between Gγ13 and PDZ domain-containing proteins. These interactions provide a novel means of targeting and anchoring heterotrimeric G proteins to the cellular membrane and of assigning them to macromolecular complexes of receptors and channels. Plasmids—PCR amplification was used to prepare DNA from wild type and mutant Gγ13. Gγ13T65A contains a single nucleotide substitution leading to a threonine to alanine substitution at amino acid 65 of Gγ13. Gγ13 DNAs were subcloned into the two-hybrid vector pGBDU-1 (a gift of E. A. Craig and P. J. James of the University of Wisconsin, Madison (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

Plasmid pBD-Gβ1Gγ13 was created by subcloning PCR-amplified Gβ1 and Gγ13 DNAs into the vector pBridge (Clontech). pGAD424 plasmids containing various PDZ domains from PSD95 (pGAD424-PDZ1, pGAD424-PDZ2, pGAD424-PDZ3, pGAD424-PDZ12, pGAD424-PDZ23, and pGAD424-PDZ123;, see Table 1) were the kind gifts of Dr. M. Noda and have been described previously (21Kawachi H. Tamura H. Watakabe I. Shintani T. Maeda N. Noda M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain of SAP97 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGADT7 (Clontech). All PCRs were carried out according to the standard protocol accompanying the enzymes Taq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) DNA polymerases. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure no inadvertent errors. All two-hybrid plasmids used in this study, along with their derivation, are listed in Table 1. For example, plasmids pAD-PSD95Δ38, pAD-Veli2Δ3, and pAD-Veli2 were recovered from two-hybrid screening in this study (see details under “Results”). pAD-Veli2-L27 was created by cutting pAD-Veli2 with XhoI followed by self-ligation to remove 382-bp DNA. Partial digestion of pAD-Veli2 with EcoRI/XhoI, which removes 302-bp DNA, followed by blunt-end self-ligation, was used to create plasmid pAD-VeliΔ121. Similarly, plasmids pAD-PSD95-PDZs and pAD-PSD95-SHGUK were constructed by ApaI digestion and religation and XmaI/PvuII digestion and blunt end ligation of plasmid pAD-PSD95Δ38. Plasmid GW1-myc-PSD95 was a gift of Dr. Morgan Sheng and was described previously (22Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

Hemagglutinin-tagged Gγ13 (both wild type and mutantT65A versions) was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 + vector between the EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites.TABLE 1Two-hybrid plasmids usedPlasmidParentSelectionGene/fragmentRef.pBD-Gγ13pGBDU-1URA3Gγ13This studypBD-Gγ13 T65ApGBDU-1URA3Gγ13This studypAD-PDZ3pGADT7LEU2PDZ3 of SAP97This studypAD-PSD95Δ38pACT2LEU2PSD95Δ38This study and MachmakerIIpAD-PSD95-PDZspACT2LEU2PSD95 amino acids 39–435This study and MachmakerIIpAD-PSD95-SHGUKpACT2LEU2PSD95 amino acids 346–724This study and MachmakerIIpAD-Veli2pACT2LEU2Veli-2This study and MachmakerIIpAD-Veli2Δ3pACT2LEU2Veli-2Δ3This study and MachmakerIIpAD-Veli2-L27pACT2LEU2Veli-2 amino acids 1–121This study and MachmakerIIpAD-VeliΔ121pACT2LEU2Veli-2 amino acids 122–207This study and MachmakerIIpGAD424-PDZ123pGAD424LEU2PDZ123 of PSD9521Kawachi H.

Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system TRAFO protocol (23Agatep R. Kirkpatrick R.D. Parchaliuk D.L. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D.

The candidate genes recovered after two-hybrid selection were isolated, sequenced, and retested for interaction with Gγ13 by an independent two-hybrid assay using diploid cells; all independent two-hybrid interaction assays were carried out in PJ69-4a/PJ69-4α diploid cells using the strategy described (24Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity of the lacZ reporter gene was measured using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate according to the MatchMaker II manual (Yeast Protocols Handbook, Clontech). Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were used: Gγ13 5′ primer, CCCATCGATATGGAGGAGTGGGATGTG; Gγ13 3′ primer, GACGTCGACTCATAGGATGGTGCACTT; Gγ13T65A 3′ primer, GACGTCGACTCATAGGATGGCGCACT (the underlined C indicates the mutated residue); Gβ1 5′ primer, GGGCGGCCGCATGAGTGAACTTGACCAG; Gβ1 3′ primer, GGGGGATCCTTAGTTCCAGATCTTGAGG; PSD95 5′ primer, CGCCATCTTCATCCGTCC; PSD95 3′ primer, GGAATCAGAGTCTCTCTC; SAP97 5′ primer, CCCGGATCCATCACTAGGGAACCTAGA; and SAP97 3′ primer, CCCGTCGACACGACGTGACTCTTCGGG. Cell Culture—HEK293T and STC-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml. Cultured cells were transfected with HA-tagged Gγ13 and/or GW1-myc-PSD95 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies—The anti-HA monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was produced at the Hybridoma Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The polyclonal antibody directed against PSD95 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Gγ13 was as described previously (18Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Monoclonal SAP97 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blots—HEK293 cells were transfected by Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with wild type or mutant forms of Gγ13 alone or together with PSD95. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, placed at 4 °C, and then lysed for 30 min in 200 ml of Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cultured cell lysates were clarified by microcentrifugation for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cultured cell lysate total protein were used in immunoprecipitation assays. Lingual and brain tissues from mice were homogenized in Lysis Buffer; homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove tissue debris, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation pull-down assays. Antibodies to be used in pull-down assays were mixed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), incubated at room temperature for 1 h to enable conjugates to form, and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess antibody. Antibody-protein G-Sepharose conjugates were mixed with cell lysates, shaken for 2 h at 4 °C,and then washed two times with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), two times with 0.1 m Tris-HCl containing 0.5 m LiCl, and then two times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated in SDS gel loading buffer for 3 min at 95 °C, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the α-gustducin promoter was as described previously (18Huang L. Shanker Y.G.

Frozen sections (10 μm thick and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose) of lingual tissue from GFP mice were incubated in Blocking Buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum, and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified primary antibodies as follows: either polyclonal rabbit anti-Gγ13 (18Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-SAP97 (Affinity Bioreagent, Golden, CO), or goat anti-PSD95 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig for Gγ13 and SAP97 and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat Ig for PSD95 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope in the presence of Vector antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Incubation of sections with primary or secondary antibodies alone produced no observable immunofluorescence (data not shown). Interaction of Gγ13 with PSD95 and Veli-2—The yeast two-hybrid system is a valuable tool for studying protein-protein interactions and for identifying interacting partners of known proteins (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), and it has been used to characterize the interaction between the G protein β and γ subunits (26Yan K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7141-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a two-hybrid assay, the Gγ13 subunit can interact weakly with all five known Gβ subunits and shows no distinct preference among them (27Blake B.L. Wing M.R. Zhou J.Y. Lei Q. Hillmann J.R. Behe C.I. Morris R.A. Harden T.K. Bayliss D.A. Miller R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 3Z. Li and R. F. Margolskee, unpublished observations. Because the signaling specificity of the Gβγ dimer is largely dictated by Gγ, we searched for proteins that could interact directly with Gγ13. For this purpose we subcloned Gγ13 into vector pGBDU-1 and used it as “bait” to screen a mouse brain cDNA library in the GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system, where positive interactions of Gγ13 with unknown proteins would activate several reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ) of the host yeast cells. The activation of the HIS3 or ADE2 genes was monitored by yeast cell growth on media lacking the amino acids histidine or adenine. Activation of the lacZ reporter rendered yeast colonies blue in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in the growth media and was quantitatively measured using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate (Matchmaker II; Clontech). After screening approximately 10 million independent colonies (∼3 times the complexity of the library), we obtained four clones that activated the HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ reporter genes. Two of these were identical clones encoding a part of the PSD95 protein starting at amino acid 39 (pAD-PSD95Δ38). The other two clones were derivatives of the Veli-2 gene. One of these clones encoded the full-length Veli-2 protein (pAD-Veli2), although the other encoded a truncated form lacking the first three amino acids (pAD-Veli2Δ3). Both PSD95 and Veli-2 were retested in an independent two-hybrid assay using diploid cells to confirm their interaction with Gγ13 (Fig. 1A). PSD95 and Veli-2 failed to activate the reporter genes when combined with numerous unrelated genes in control two-hybrid assays (data not shown). Therefore, the interactions of Gγ13 with PSD95 and Veli-2 appeared to be specific. The strength of interaction of Gγ13 with PSD95 and Veli-2 was examined quantitatively using β-galactosidase activity in a yeast two-hybrid reporter assay. By this measure, PSD95 had higher affinity for Gγ13 than did Veli-2 (Fig. 1B). In these studies we relied on the ability of Gγ13 to interact with other proteins in the absence of Gβ. In vivo, however, Gβγ subunits comprise a nondissociating unit. Some Gγ13 domains exposed during our screening procedure might ordinarily be inaccessible within the context of the Gβγ dimer. To investigate this, we coexpressed Gγ13 with Gβ1 in our two-hybrid assay. Coexpression of Gγ13 with Gβ1 did not prevent PSD95 (Fig. 1C) or Veli-2 (data not shown) from activating the HIS3, ADE2, or lacZ reporter genes, suggesting that the Gγ13 domain(s) responsible for interaction with PSD95 or Veli-2 is not blocked by the presence of Gβ1. One PDZ Domain of PSD95 Interacts with the C Terminus of Gγ13—A common feature of PSD95 and Veli-2 proteins is the presence of one or more PDZ domains. To determine whether these PDZ domains underlie the interaction of PSD95 and Veli-2 with Gγ13, several deletion mutants of PSD95 and Veli-2 were generated and tested in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2). Splitting the Veli-2 gene within the PDZ motif yielded the following two fragments: the N-terminal amino acids 1–121, containing the L27 domain (28Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal amino acids 122–207. Neither of these fragments bound Gγ13 in a two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the PDZ domain of Veli-2 must be intact for this protein to interact with Gγ13. For PSD95, a deletion mutant (PDZ123, amino acids 39–435) containing all three PDZ domains, but lacking the C terminus, bound Gγ13 (Fig. 2B), indicating a role for one or more of PDZ domains of PSD95 in the interaction with Gγ13. To determine whether a particular PDZ domain of PSD95 was responsible for the interaction with Gγ13, individual PDZ domains of rat PSD95 (PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3; Fig. 2B) (21Kawachi H. Tamura H. Watakabe I. Shintani T. Maeda N. Noda M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), their combinations (PDZ123, Fig. 2B; PDZ12 and PDZ23; data not shown), and the SH3-GU kinase-like domains were subcloned and tested for their interaction with Gγ13. Plasmids containing these domains were expressed in PJ69-4a/PJ69-4a diploid cells (24Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and examined for activation of the two-hybrid reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2. As shown in Fig. 2B, only the third PDZ domain of PSD95 interacted with Gγ13; the first two PDZ domains alone or in combination and the SH3-GU kinase domains failed to do so. In this regard it should be noted that the third PDZ domain of PSD95 is the most similar to the PDZ domain of Veli-2 (Fig. 3; see “Discussion”). The PDZ domains of PSD95 and Veli recognize the canonical X(S/T)XA motif at the C terminus of proteins (where X represents any amino acid; S/T is serine or threonine; A is any aliphatic amino acid). A serine or threonine at the -3 position is critical for this interaction. Most interestingly, the C terminus of Gγ13 is CTAL, which is predicted to be a target of the PDZ domains of PSD95 and Veli-2. If this CTAL tail is indeed the target of PDZ domain binding, then mutation of the threonine at the -3 position should disrupt this interaction. As predicted, a threonine to alanine substitution mutation of Gγ13 (Gγ13T65A) eliminated the two-hybrid interaction of Gγ13 with PSD95 (Fig. 2C) and Veli-2 (data not shown). Heterologously Expressed Gγ13 and PSD95 Interact Physically—The above studies indicate that the C-terminal CAAX motif of Gγ13 interacts with specific PDZ domains within the setting of a yeast two-hybrid assay. To determine whether PSD95 and Gγ13 could interact in a less artificial cellular setting, we used a pull-down assay with heterologously expressed tagged proteins. HA-tagged wild type or mutant Gγ13, along with Myc-tagged PSD95, were coexpressed in transfected HEK293 cells; following lysis, proteins were immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA antibody and probed on Western blots (Fig. 4). Probing the blots with an anti-Myc antibody showed that HA-tagged wild type Gγ13 robustly pulled down PSD95 (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10). Carrying out this same experiment with mutant HA-tagged Gγ13 (Gγ13T65A) lacking the CAAX motif, we find that PSD95 is not pulled down at all (Fig. 4A, lanes 11 and 12). Multiple controls were done to ensure that the pull-down interaction of Gγ13 and PSD95 was specific. No pull-down of PSD95 was seen with the following: (a) untransfected cell lysates (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2); (b) lysates from cells transfected with wild type or mutant Gγ13 and vector (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–6); (c) lysates from cells transfected with PSD95-myc and vector (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8). Immunoblots of lysates confirmed reproducible expression and detection of HA-tagged Gγ13 and Myc-tagged PSD95 (Fig 4, B–D). In sum, in the cellular environment of transfected HEK293 cells there is a physical association of the C-terminal CAAX tail of Gγ13 with the PDZ domain of PSD95. Expression of PDZ Domain-containing Proteins in Taste Cells—Although first identified in taste receptor cells, Gγ13 is also expressed in brain and retina (18Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J.

Herein we present the crystal structure of the MHC class I protein H-2Kd (Kd) expressed by BALB/c mice in complex with an antigenic peptide derived from influenza A/PR/8/34 nucleoprotein (Flu, residues 147-155, TYQRTRALV). Analysis of our structure in conjunction with the sequences of naturally processed epitopes provides a comprehensive understanding of the dominant Kd peptide-binding motif. We find that Flu residues TyrP2, ThrP5, and ValP9 are sequestered into the B, C, and F pockets of the Kd groove, respectively. The shape and chemistry of the polymorphic B pocket make it an optimal binding site for the side chain of TyrP2 as the dominant anchoring residue of nonameric peptides. The non-polar F pocket limits the amino acid repertoire at P9 to hydrophobic residues such as Ile, Leu, or Val, whereas the C pocket restricts the size of the P5-anchoring side chain. We also show that Flu is accommodated in the complex through an unfavorable kink in the otherwise extended peptide backbone due to the presence of a prominent ridge in the Kd groove. Surprisingly, this backbone conformation is strikingly similar to Db-presented peptides despite the fact that these proteins employ distinct motif-anchoring strategies.

Peptides of 8-10 residues are bound in a predominantly extended conformation within a narrow groove formed by two antiparallel α-helices positioned above an eight-strand β-sheet platform. Conservative hydrogen bonding networks are established in the binding groove with peptide main-chain and terminal atoms that enable largely sequence-independent ligation. Although low affinity, kinetically short-lived peptide-MHC complexes can be established by highly diverse epitope sequences, stable association requires the anchoring of peptide side chains into specific pockets in the MHC groove. MHC polymorphisms are clustered in these pockets (3Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 10Garrett T.P. Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 3569-3575PubMed Google Scholar), and their shape and chemistry impose constraints that are reflected by allele-specific motifs found in the sequences of naturally processed peptides (12Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 13Rammensee H.G. Falk K. Rotzschke O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). For example, H-2d cell lines (P815) and H-2b cell lines (EL4) infected with the same influenza virus present different antigenic peptides for CTL recognition (14Rotzschke O. Falk K. Deres K. Schild H. Norda M. Metzger J. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Thus, outbred populations that express varied MHC proteins can survey diverse peptide fragments from a given pathogen despite specificity constraints imposed by each individual allele. The sequences of a number of naturally processed peptides that are presented by Kd have been identified, including self-peptides (12Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G.

The first virally encoded T-cell epitope ever described was in fact a Kd-binding peptide derived from influenza A/PR/8/34 nucleo-protein (27Taylor P.M. Davey J. Howland K. Rothbard J.B. Askonas B.A. Immunogenetics. 1987; 26: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although early studies using synthetic peptides suggested that an 11-residue peptide is presented (28Bodmer H.C. Pemberton R.M. Rothbard J.B. Askonas B.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 253-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), sequencing of the naturally processed peptide from virally infected cells revealed that the nucleo-protein epitope is only nine residues long (residues 147-155, TYQRTRALV) (14Rotzschke O. Falk K. Deres K. Schild H. Norda M. Metzger J. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In fact, the vast majority of Kd-binding peptides are nine residues in length, which nearly invariantly contain Tyr at the second position (P2) (29Maryanski J.L. Romero P. Van Pel A. Boon T. Salemme F.R. Cerottini J.C. Corradin G. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp.

To resolve the structural underpinnings of the dominant Kd-binding motif we have undertaken crystallographic studies of Kd in complex with the antigenic peptide from influenza virus nucleoprotein (Flu). The 2.6-Å resolution structure of Kd-Flu provided an excellent framework to delineate the role of polymorphic anchoring pockets in determining Kd-specific peptide binding. To extend our understanding of the overall binding motif to a broad population of Kd epitopes, we analyzed 95 naturally processed Kd peptides in conjunction with our structural data. Comparisons of Kd-Flu to other class I peptide-MHC complexes reveal that the conformation of Flu in the Kd groove is similar to that of peptides associated with Db despite differences in anchoring strategies between the two MHC proteins. Lastly, our structural studies provide a detailed framework for understanding the role of individual peptide residues in T-cell recognition events. Expression and Purification—The extracellular domains of Kd (heavy chain, residues 1-283; murine β2-microglobulin (mβ2m), residues 1-99, with signal peptides omitted) were expressed separately in the bacterial strain BL21CodonPlus® (DE3)RIL (Stratagene) as insoluble inclusion bodies. LB media (8 liters, 37 °C) was inoculated from a single colony, and protein expression was induced at A595 of 0.8 with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and suspended in 200 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25% (w:v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (w:v) NaN3. Lysozyme (0.4 mg/ml), DNase I (40 μg/ml), and MgCl2 (10 mm) were added to the suspension, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 200 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% (v:v) Triton X-100, 1% (w:v) sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3. After lysis, EDTA was added (12.5 mm) and insoluble protein was pelleted by centrifugation. The inclusion bodies were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3. To remove detergent the inclusion bodes were washed twice with buffer as described above but without Triton X-100. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The purified, detergent-free, inclusion bodies were solubilized overnight in 6 m Gdn·HCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To form the Kd-Flu complex, murine β2m, and heavy chain were refolded under oxidative conditions in the presence of 10 molar excess of Flu (influenza A/PR8/34 nucleoprotein residues 147-155, TYQRTRALV). Refolding was performed at 4 °C using a rapid dilution method. Briefly, Flu was diluted to 15 μm in 500 ml of refolding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm l-Arg, 2.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GSSG, 5.0 mm GSH, and protease inhibitors). Murine β2m was injected into the refolding reaction to concentration of 4.5 μm. Following 30 min of incubation the heavy chain (final concentration 1.5 μm) was injected in three separate batches spaced over a 24-h period. The final concentration of Gdn·HCl in the refolding reaction did not exceed 100 mm. After an overnight incubation the refolding reaction was concentrated to 4 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The Kd-Flu complex was purified from protein aggregates and other impurities on a Superdex75 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) size exclusion column using a running buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3. The fractions containing Kd-Flu were pooled, diluted 3-fold in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, loaded on an anion exchange Mono Q column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0 mm to 400 mm NaCl over 30 ml). Prior to crystallization the pure Kd-Flu complex was exchanged in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Typically 400 μg of purified complex were obtained from a 500-ml refolding reaction. Crystallization and Data Collection—Diffraction-quality crystals of Kd-Flu were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Protein at 6-8 mg/ml was equilibrated at 20 °C against 12% (w:v) polyethylene glycol 2000, 5% (w:v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.9. Small crystals obtained in these drops were used to microseed protein hanging drops equilibrated against similar conditions with marginally lower concentration of polyethylene glycol 2000. Larger crystals appeared overnight and grew over 3-4 weeks. As the crystallization conditions were cryoprotective, no additional compounds were added for liquid nitrogen flash cooling. X-ray diffraction data for Kd-Flu were collected on a Raxis IV detector (Rigaku/MCS, The Woodlands, TX) to 2.6-Å resolution. A total of 249 frames was collected each representing a 1.5° oscillation range. These data were indexed and integrated using DENZO (HKL Suite, HKL Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) in the primitive orthorhombic lattice with cell dimensions a = 117.2 Å, b = 85.3 Å, c = 42.6 Å and scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (HKL Suite, HKL Research, Inc., Charlottesville VA). Wilson scaling was applied to the final output structure factor amplitudes (Collaborative Computing Project 4 (CCP4), Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington UK (32Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar)). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of Kd-Flu was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (CCP4). The coordinates of Kb-Ova (PDB 1VAC) with the Ova peptide and water molecules omitted were used as a search model. The rotation search yielded a single, distinct solution, and translation searches were run in all possible orthorhombic symmetry groups. The highest signal (correlation coefficient = 33.1% and R value = 49.4% for all 15-4.0 Å data) was obtained in the P212121 space group, consistent with the systematic absences in the data. Rigid body refinement of the three domains of the search model (α1α2, α3, and murine β2m) against the Kd data yielded an R value of 41.8% for the 20- to 2.6-Å resolution data. Extensive model building was performed with the macromolecular modeling program O (O version 6.22, Uppsala Software Factory, Sweden) using 2Fo - Fc, Fo - Fc, and 2Fo - Fc composite omit maps (CNS, Yale University, New Haven CT (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar)). Atomic refinement was done employing simulated annealing, energy minimization, and restrained B-factor refinement protocols as implemented in CNS. The final model includes a total of 383 residues (residues A1 to A275 for the heavy chain, B1 to B99 for murine β2m, and P1 to P9 for Flu) and 114 water molecules. Atomic coordinates were not assigned to residues 276-283 from the heavy chain and the N-terminal methionine of β2m as no interpretable electron density was seen for these regions of Kd-Flu. Refinement of this final model against the 20- to 2.6-Å resolution data converged to an R value of 21.6% with an Rfree of 26.9% (4.3% test set) with good geometry (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of data collection and refinement statisticsCrystal space groupP212121Unit cell (Å)a = 117.2; b = 85.3; c = 42.6Data processingObservations to 2.6 Å/unique72,826/12,404Completeness (%)89.1 (92.6)aValues in parentheses are for data in the highest resolution shell for data processing (2.72-2.60) and refinement (2.76-2.60).RsymbStatistics as defined in SCALEPACK.0.129 (0.597)I/σ12.8 (2.17)RefinementData range (Å)20.0-2.6Reflections (F>0)12,244Completeness (%)85.0 (81.6)Reflections in Rfree set592 (86)Non-hydrogen atoms3,092Solvent molecules114r.m.s.

The Kd-Flu complex was formed in vitro under oxidative refolding conditions in the presence of excess peptide and was purified using size exclusion and anion exchange chromatographies. Electrospray mass spectral analysis of the complex confirmed the presence of abundant peaks at 32,865.69 Da and 11,817.81 Da corresponding to the predicted molecular weights of the heavy chain and murine β2m, respectively. Further inspection of the mass spectrum over lower mass ranges revealed a monoisotopic, singly charged peak at 1,106.7 Da corresponding to Flu. The Kd-Flu complex crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with one complex per asymmetric unit. Initial phase estimates were obtained by molecular replacement. After initial refinement, easily interpretable electron density was seen for the bound peptide that improved upon further building and refinement cycles. Diffraction data to 2.6-Å resolution were used for refinement of the final atomic model, which has an R factor of 21.6% (Rfree = 26.9%) with good angle and bond geometry (Table 1). The electron density maps for the whole complex were of good quality (Fig. 1A). No ambiguities were seen for the main chain and the side chains of the bound peptide except for a small break in the electron density between the Cβ and Cδ carbons of the exposed ArgP6 side chain (Fig. 1A). Overall Structural Features of the Complex—Kd-Flu is very similar to the structures of other MHC class I proteins (Fig. 1B). Minor differences were observed for the conformations of solvent-exposed loops and the terminal regions of the complex. Flu is bound in the Kd groove between the α1 and α2 helices and on top of the β-sheet platform (Fig. 1) in canonical manner (7Wilson I.A. Fremont D.H. Semin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Structural alignment of Kd-Flu to the structures of other murine MHC class I complexes yielded overall pairwise r.m.s.d. values of 1.14 Å (Dd, 80.4% sequence identity) to 2.15 Å (Db, 80.7% sequence identity). An alignment of the α1α2 domains alone yielded pairwise r.m.s.d. values of 0.63 Å (Kb, 80.4% sequence identity) to 1.01 Å (Ld, 81.1% sequence identity) reflecting the high degree of general similarity among these proteins. Backbone Conformation of Kd-presented Flu—Like most MHC-bound nonameric peptides, the backbone of Flu assumes a predominantly extended conformation with a bulge at residues P6 and P7. Surprisingly, the main-chain kink adopted by Flu results from an infrequently observed, unfavorable conformation of ArgP6 that is well supported by our experimental data (Fig. 1A). The P6-P7 bulge is associated with a hydrophobic ridge formed by polymorphic residues Tyr156 and Trp73 in the Kd groove. While favorable Ramachandran angles would be observed if the P6-P7 peptide bond were flipped, this conformation would preclude several favorable interactions and engender steric clashes with Kd (see Fig. 4A). We compared the conformation of Flu to that of nine-residue peptides bound to Kb (38Fremont D.H. Stura E.A. Matsumura M. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The main-chain conformations of Kb-presented peptides vary significantly from that of Flu with overall r.m.s.d. values ranging from 1.43 to 1.47 Å. The greatest differences were observed in the region between P5 and P7 where the r.m.s.d. values for the Cα atoms ranged from 1.22 to 3.66 Å (Fig. 2A). The conformation of the Ld peptide resembles more closely that of Flu with r.m.s.d. 0.95 Å, but nevertheless differs significantly between P4 and P6 (Fig. 2A). Comparison of Flu with Db-presented peptides reveals that they adopt nearly identical main-chain conformations all the way from P1 to P9 with r.m.s.d. values ranging from 0.62 to 0.81 Å (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, Db has a similar hydrophobic ridge as Kd located beneath the P6-P7 kink (43Ciatto C. Tissot A.C. Tschopp M. Capitani G. Pecorari F. Pluckthun A. Grutter M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also compared the dihedral angles of the aligned peptides (Fig. 2B). This analysis revealed that the backbones of the Db peptides adopt a P6-P7 bulge associated with unfavorable dihedral angles for their P6 residues similar to the one in Flu (Fig. 2B). This bulging at P6-P7 was absent in the Ld peptide (Fig. 2B) despite the presence of a similar hydrophobic ridge in the same region of the Ld groove (40Balendiran G.K. Solheim J.C. Young A.C. Hansen T.H. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6880-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hydrogen Bonding to the Flu Backbone—The Flu main chain has 19 nitrogen and oxygen atoms, 14 of which hydrogen bond with Kd either directly or through water-mediated networks. Of the 17 MHC amino acids that participate in hydrogen bonding 8 are invariant among MHC class I proteins. These residues anchor the N- and C-terminal regions of Flu through highly conservative hydrogen bonding networks at each end of the binding groove (Fig. 3). Eight main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms between GlnP3 and ValP8 mediate hydrogen bonds with polymorphic groove residues (Fig. 3). Of particular note are the hydrogen bonds to the main-chain oxygen of ArgP6 and the main-chain oxygen and nitrogen of AlaP7. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of both residues participate in a bifurcate hydrogen bonding network with the Nϵ1 nitrogen of Trp73, whereas on the opposite side of the Flu backbone the amide nitrogen atom of P7 hydrogen bonds with Asp152 (Fig. 3). This hydrogen bonding arrangement can only form as a result of the unfavorable turn in the Flu main chain at ArgP6. Binding Pockets in the Kd Groove—Specificity of peptide-MHC association is imparted through a myriad of interactions with peptide anchor side chains, which are sequestered in distinct pockets of the MHC groove. To visualize these pockets in Kd we calculated a solvent-accessible surface (46Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar) for a spherical probe with a radius of 1.4 Å for the α1α2 domain. Five distinct pockets are clearly apparent in the Kd groove, which correspond to pockets A, B, C, D, and F according to the nomen-clature of Matsumura et al. (47Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Pocket E, which is the most variable between the different MHC proteins, is absent in our structure. Instead, the polymorphic residues Trp73 and Tyr156 fill the E pocket location creating the hydrophobic ridge across the Kd groove that accommodates the P6-P7 turn in Flu (Fig. 4A).

This is achieved through modulation of the outer membrane Oep21 channel currents and tuning of its ion selectivity. Refined analysis of the Oep21 channel properties by biochemical and electrophysiological methods revealed a channel formed by eight β-strands with a wider pore vestibule of dvest ∼2.4 nm at the intermembrane site and a narrower filter pore of drestr ∼1 nm. The Oep21 pore contains two high affinity sites for ATP, one located at a relative transmembrane electrical distance δ = 0.56 and the second close to the vestibule at the intermembrane site. The ATP-dependent current block and reduction in anion selectivity of the Oep21 channel is relieved by the competitive binding of phosphorylated metabolic intermediates like 3-phosphoglycerate and glycerinaldehyde 3-phosphate. Deletion of a C-terminal putative FX4K binding motif in Oep21 decreased the capability of the channel to tune its ion selectivity by about 50%, whereas current block remained unchanged.

Plastid organelles perform vital biosynthetic functions in every plant organ. They are surrounded by double membranes, the inner and the outer envelope, which delimit spatially and temporally the plastid compartment from the cytoplasm. Both envelope membranes are distinguishable by their structure, function, and biochemical properties but also cooperate, for example, in the synthesis of lipids or in protein translocation. Chloroplasts are the site of carbon dioxide reduction and its assimilation into carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, and terpenoid compounds. The manifold biosynthetic functions of chloroplasts require the existence of different selective transport mechanisms across the envelope membranes to provide the cell with carbohydrates, organic nitrogen, and sulfur compounds chloroplasts On the other hand, (1Flügge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Neuhaus H.E. Wagner R. Biochim. Biophys.

Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, it was believed that the osmotic barrier against the cytosol is formed exclusively by the inner envelope membrane, containing specific carrier proteins, some of which have been identified on the functional and also on the molecular level (2Neuhaus H.E. Wagner R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, our recent reports reveal the presence of several specific solute pores in the outer envelope, indicating that the intermembrane space is not freely accessible to low molecular weight solutes (3Bölter B.

Soll J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ancestral relation between plastids and Gram-negative bacteria suggests the presence of different solute channel proteins in the organellar outer membrane. In pea chloroplasts, four channel proteins have been identified and functionally characterized so far. Toc75 (translocase of the outer chloroplastic membrane of 75 kDa), probably consisting of 16 amphipathic transmembrane β-strands, forms the preprotein-conducting channel (8Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J.

Oep16 allows the passage of molecules containing the amino acid backbone but excludes C4 and C5 sugars and other compounds, although the pore size of the channel would be large enough to allow the passage of these molecules. The current fluxes through the Oep16 channel were also regulated by the redox state of two spatial close cysteine residues. The third identified channel protein, Oep24, also constitutes a high conductance solute channel with a diameter of about 2.5 nm. The slightly cation-selective Oep24 channel allows the passage of triose phosphates, ATP, Pi, dicarboxylic acid, and positively or negatively charged amino acids (5Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Grimm R. Hill K. Wagner R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and has been shown to functionally replace the voltage-dependent anion channel in yeast mitochondria (14Röhl T. Motzkus M. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Oep21 displays an anion-selective channel with asymmetric transport properties that are modulated by nucleotides and phosphorylated metabolic intermediates (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Oep21 and Oep24 proteins reveal mainly β-sheet topology. In agreement with this, the voltage-dependent gating of both solute channels resembles closely the gating behavior observed for β-barrel membrane channels (15Bainbridge G. Gokce I. Lakey J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In summary, evidence is accumulating that transport of different solute classes across the outer chloroplast membrane is facilitated through distinct pores in a selective, regulated fashion.Here we describe the refined molecular characterization of the Oep21 channel and in particular the regulation of its transport properties by nucleotides and phosphorylated intermediates. Our results show that the currents through the Oep21 channel are regulated through tuning of its ion selectivity and by a modulated current block from the intermembrane space. The Oep21 channel has an asymmetric topology with a wider vestibule of about ∼2.4-nm diameter at the intermembrane space, whereas the restriction zone revealed at the lower limit a diameter of ∼1.0 nm. The Oep21 contains two binding sites modulating the selectivity of the channel. One of the binding sites is responsible for the block of the channel currents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—CHAPS, 3The abbreviations used are: CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; OEV, outer envelope membrane; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; GAP, glycerinaldehyde 3-phosphate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type.

The digestion was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a 10 mm final concentration or by the addition of a 2-fold excess of α-macroglobulin, respectively. Subsequently, the chloroplasts were reisolated over a 40% Percoll cushion (330 mm sorbit, 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. For import reactions, psOep21 in pET21b (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R.

Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Planar lipid bilayers were produced by the painting technique (21Mueller P. Rudin D. Tien R. Westcott W.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1963; 67: 534-535Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar) as described in detail (8Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The resulting bilayers had a typical capacitance of 0.5 microfarads/cm2 and a resistance of >100 gigaohms. The noise was 3 pA (r.m.s.) at 5-kHz bandwidth. An osmotic gradient was used for vesicle fusion, whereby a channel-permeant solute is (in addition with the absolute necessity of the channel in the vesicle being in the open state (22Woodbury D.J.

The resistivity of the standard buffer solution ρ for a 1 m KCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris (pH 7) solution was determined by a standard conductometer (Knick, GmbH) to be 13.8 ohms cm. Taking the correction factor of 5 for the effective channel resistivity (24Smart O.S. Breed J. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1109-1126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) into account, the effective value is ρ = 69 ohms cm.Data Analysis—Changes in the reversal potential were fitted according to the following equation for a two-site binding model by Equation 1, ΔVrev=b1·[ATP]k1+[ATP]+b2·[ATP]k2+[ATP](Eq. 1) and fitted for the one-site binding model by Equation 2, ΔVrev=b1·[ATP]k1+[ATP](Eq. 2) where ΔVrev represents the change in the reversal potential, bi is the maximal change in ΔVrev in the ith binding site, and ki is the concentration where ΔVrev of the ith component is half-maximal. Confidence analysis was performed as described (25Brandt S. Datenanalyse.4th Ed. Spektrum Akademischer Vlg., Heidelberg, Germany1999Google Scholar).RESULTSRefined Evaluation of the Oep21 Membrane Topology—To determine the topology of psOep21, we treated isolated chloroplasts with either thermolysin or endopeptidase GluC under conditions where the protease does not penetrate the outer envelope membrane (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-3). A few fragments of psOep21 were resistant to thermolysin as well as endopeptidase GluC, indicating the presence of membrane-protected regions (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). The treatment with thermolysin revealed a 14-kDa and a 10-12-kDa fragment, as previously described (Fig. 1A, lane 2 (3)). After digestion with GluC, we observed again two proteolytic fragments. Here, the fragments have a size of 18 and 14 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 3). To determine the localization of the N terminus, we took advantage of the presence of a single methionine at the N terminus of psOep21. Thus, we imported in vitro translated [35S]methioninelabeled psOep21 into isolated chloroplasts (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The insertion of the protein in the outer envelope membrane was controlled by carbonate extraction at pH 11.5 (data not shown). Subsequently, chloroplasts were reisolated and treated with either thermolysin or endopeptidase GluC (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), and the appearance of proteolytic fragments was controlled by immunoblotting (data not shown). Neither one of the proteolytic products detected by immunoblotting was radioactively labeled (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3, versus Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). We used these data to model the topological structure of psOep21 (Fig. 1C). psOep21 was proposed to form a transmembrane β-barrel structure (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The position of the transmembrane regions is based on the calculation of the exact β-sheet score as well as the alternating hydrophobicity of psOep21 (19Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structural model implies the presence of eight transmembrane β-sheets (Fig. 1C). According to the model, psOep21 provides two cleavage sites in transmembrane β-sheets for the endopeptidase GluC. Five cleavage sites for the endopeptidase GluC are present in loop regions exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane, where one cleavage site seems to be buried in the structure as discussed below. Since the fragment of 18 kDa was not radioactively labeled, the C and N termini have to be exposed toward the cytosol (Fig. 1C), because penetration of the membrane by GluC under the conditions used is not observed (see also Ref. 26Sveshnikova N. Grimm R. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We propose that GluC digested psOep21 at position 20, yielding an 18-kDa fragment and subsequently in loop VI, leading to a 14-kDa fragment (Fig. 1A, lane 3, and Fig. 1C). Therefore, loop IV seems to be shielded against both proteases, since no proteolytic product was observed, which could explain a cleavage event in this region (Fig. 1A). The cytosolic exposure of the N terminus is further supported by the appearance of a cleavage intermediate of 18 kDa by using thermolysin (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and by the production of exclusively nonradioactively labeled fragments by both proteases (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Moreover, according to the model, we suggest that both thermolysin and GluC cleave psOep21 in loop VI, resulting in the 14-kDa fragment. A subsequent cleavage in loop II not exposing any GluC cleavage side (Fig. 1C) explains the occurrence of the second breakdown product of 10 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Again, as for the GluC cleavage, loop IV seems to be protected against processing.Conductance Properties of Oep21 from Different Preparations—Arabidopsis thaliana contains two orthologs of psOep21, which are encoded for by the gene At1g20816 (atOep21-1) and At1g76405 (atOep21-2), respectively. Here, atOep21-1 contains the FX4K motif, whereas in atOep21-2 the phenylalanine is exchanged for a leucine (see Table 1). Expression profiling data reveal that both orthologs are expressed in leaves (Fig. 1D). We therefore heterologously expressed atOep21-1 and compared key electrophysiological properties of the purified reconstituted protein with the previous identified protein from pea (psOep21WT) and two mutant forms (psOep21m and psOep21ΔC; Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2). In addition, the pea protein was biochemically purified from plastid membranes (psOep21WT-bp), or outer membrane vesicles were used directly (OEV; see Table 2).FIGURE 2Rectifying current-voltage relationship of the Oep21 channel. Current-voltage relationship of the psOep21WT-r (A), psOep21WT-bc (B), atOep21-1 (D), psOEp21WT-OEV (E), and psOep21ΔC (G) deduced from the fully open channel state in symmetrical 1 m KCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7. The inset shows the linear approximations of the current-voltage relationship in the ranges -100 mV < Vh <-75 mV; -25 mV < Vh <+25 mV, and +75 mV < Vh <+100 mV.

The degree of rectification was obtained from the linear tangent extrapolations of I/V relations at the high conductance site as compared with the low conductance site (e.g. Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 2). The rectification was observed at both lower and higher symmetrical KCl concentrations (250 mm and 1 m, Fig. 2) (25Brandt S. Datenanalyse.4th Ed. Spektrum Akademischer Vlg., Heidelberg, Germany1999Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2, B and G, were collected from bilayers where the cis compartment corresponded to the intermembrane space. This is the reason why rectification in these graphs is opposite to Fig. 2, A, D, and E, where the trans compartment corresponded to the intermembrane space. Fig. 2F shows the current-voltage relation of a single psOep21WT-OEV channel, and Fig. 2H shows the one of psOep21ΔC in the presence of a transmembrane ion gradient. The channel formed by the C-terminal deletion revealed the same selectivity as full-length binant the recomprotein (PCl-/PK+=3:1, n = 5), whereas its conductance was significantly higher, and the rectification ratio was significantly lowered. For the psOep21WT-bc, the conductance of the open channel was close to the one observed for the recombinant protein, whereas its selectivity was slightly decreased (Table 2). Both psOep21WT-bc and psOep21WT-r revealed a rectifying current-voltage relation (Fig. 2, A and B) as well. Although the conductance (Fig. 2, C and G) and selectivity (Fig. 2F, data not shown) of psOep21ΔC were similar to that of atOep21-1 (Fig. 2D) (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) the rectification of these pore proteins was less pronounced than in the recombinant and the wild type channel of the pea. However, the reversal potential of the atOep21-1r channel was for ions with z >-1 dependent on the access side of the ions (Table 3).TABLE 3Site-Specific selectivity of the atOep21-1rIonPion/PCl- intermembrane spacePion/PCl- cytosolK+ (mean conductane)0.33 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.01K+ (subconductance)0.21 ± 0.010.21 ± 0.01NO2-1.3 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2NO3-2.4 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.4SO42-3.6 ± 1.50.4 ± 0.2H2PO42-6 ± 1.70.8 ± 0.3Malat2−2.8 ± 10.7 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Refined Analysis of the Interaction between the Oep21 Channel with ATP—To further characterize the regulation of Oep21 by metabolites, a refined analysis of the interactions with nucleotides and phosphorylated metabolic intermediates was performed. In order to mimic physiological conditions, we analyzed the psOep21WT-r channel characteristics at zero electrical driving force (Vh (holding potential) = 0 mV) but in the presence of a transmembrane ion gradient. We further investigated the effect of ATP on Vrev and on the current block at Vh = 0 mV for psOep21WT-bp. Unfortunately, it turned out that psOep21WT-bp was randomly incorporated into the liposomes, and subsequently, only liposomes containing a single active channel could be used in these experiments. Fig. 3A (inset) shows the current voltage relation of a single active Oep21 channel in the presence of an 8-fold transmembrane ion gradient (control), whereas in Fig. 3A, averaged data from n ≥ 3 bilayers are shown. When 3 mm ATP were added from the site corresponding to the intermembrane space (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the reversal potential (Vrev) was drastically changed (Vrev =-22 mV to Vrev =+8 mV). At zero electrical driving force (Vh = 0 mV), the positive current, which is equivalent to an anion current from the cytosol into the intermembrane space (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), changes to a small negative current, which is equivalent to an cation current from the cytosol into the intermembrane space. In the following, we used this current block at Vh = 0 mV to analyze the effect of different charged metabolites on the regulation of the currents through the Oep21 channels. As a second parameter, we used the changes in the reversal potential, which were observable when nucleotides and other metabolites were added from the site corresponding to the intermembrane space (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Change of the psOep21 selectivity in response to metabolites added from the intermembrane space. A, current voltage relation of single active psOep21WT-r in the presence of an 8-fold transmembrane ion gradient (control) and in the presence of 3 mm ATP added from the site corresponding to the intermembrane space (3Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Values present means of n ≥ 3 bilayers. Inset, current-voltage relation of a single active psOep21WT-r in the presence of an 8-fold transmembrane ion gradient (control) and in the presence of 3 mm ATP. B, the changes of the reversal potential (ΔVrev) of psOep21WT-r in the presence of different ATP concentrations at the trans compartment are given. Measurements were performed in 2 m/250 mm NaCl (cis/trans) 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7, with the indicated ATP concentrations in the trans compartment. The line shows the best fit of the data using a two-side binding model with a confidence of 97% according to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data points are averages from n ≥ 8 independent bilayers. The inset shows a logarithmic plot of the data for analysis according to a modified GHK approach (23Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 347-404Google Scholar) (confidence of 83%). C, E, and F, changes of the reversal potential (ΔVrev) of psOep21WT-r in the presence of different concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP (C), GAP and 3PGA (E), or Pi and glucose 6-phosphate (G6P)(F) at the trans compartment were determined as in B. The lines show the best fit of the data using a two-side binding model (Equation 1). Data points were averages from n ≥ 5 independent bilayers. The parameters of the fit are summarized in Table 3. D, the same measurements as in B were perfor"
