https://openalex.org/W2061362272,"Five independently occurring waxy (wx) mutants produce low frequencies of standard type (Wx) pollen grains (0.3 to 3.8 x 10(-5)). In crosses between these mutants, frequencies of Wx pollen grains range from 1.4 to 88 x 10(-5), depending on the cross. Data from the crosses allow the ordering of the mutants within the region. Functional complementation between the different mutants does not occur."
https://openalex.org/W2059893868,"A growth inhibitor in dormant peach flower buds was identified as naringenin (5,7,4'trihydroxyflavanone) from infrared and ultraviolet spectra, through determination of melting point, through paper chromatography, and from activity in the bioassay test."
https://openalex.org/W2038341827,"Patterns and waves of the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction are produced in membranes in which one reactant is immobilized. Convection is eliminated, the generation and deformation of wave forms are studied, and patterns are permanently fixed. Wave shape, frequency, length, and phase velocity are explained theoretically by the interactions of diffusion with reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2017012295,Deep sea drilling in the eastern Indian Ocean shows that the oceanic crust off Western Australia is approximately 140 million years old and becomes younger to the west; this dates the initial opening of the Indian Ocean.
https://openalex.org/W2053097034,Amorphous silicon in contact with silver films and amorphous germanium in contact with aluminum films form crystalline precipitates when heated to temperatures well below those at which any liquid phase is present. Crystallization occurs by an initial dissolution of the semiconductor into the metal filmsolvent followed by the growth of crystals out of the solvent.
https://openalex.org/W2046166658,"From over 200 observations of the decreasing spin rate of Vanguard I made during the year since its launching, eddy-current induction theory yields 0.115 Â± 0.001 gauss as the mean magnetic field normal to the spin axis of the satellite. This measured value agrees with that deduced from Bauer's model of the earth's dipole field."
https://openalex.org/W2023960978,"The discovery of an albino specimen of the hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii (Lockington), is reported, together with general notes regarding collection of this species for research purposes. The extreme abundance of hagfish in the area described refutes the generally accepted notion that they are of infrequent occurrence in southern California waters."

The cameras were placed adjacent to Emmons Glacier on Mount Rainier. The film obtained confirms the view that exterior time-lapse photography can be applied to the study of slow-acting geologic processes."
