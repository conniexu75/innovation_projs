https://openalex.org/W3127674322,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unhinged the lives of people across the globe. In particular, more than 30 million Chinese college students are home-schooling, yet there is little understanding of how academic workload, separation from school, and fears of contagion lead to a decrease in their health. This study examined the relationships between Chinese college students’ three critical stressors and two types of health in the COVID‐19 pandemic context. We used a three-wave lagged design with a one-week interval. All the constructs were assessed by self-report in anonymous surveys during the COVID‐19 pandemic. College students were asked to report their demographic information, academic workload, separation from school, fears of contagion, perceived stress, and health. The results of this study showed that academic workload, separation from school, and fears of contagion had negative effects on college students’ health via perceived stress. In the COVID-19 crisis, multiple prevention and control measures focusing on college students may lead them to have different degrees of stress and health problems. Our results enrich the literature on stress and health and offer novel practical implications for all circles of the society to ensure students’ health under the context of the COVID-19 epidemic."

https://openalex.org/W3128920907,"Despite the widespread use of the blockade of immune checkpoints, for a significant number of cancer patients, these therapies have proven ineffective, presumably due to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Critical drivers of immune escape in the TME include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which not only mediate immune suppression, but also facilitate metastatic dissemination and impart resistance to immunotherapies. Thus, strategies that convert them into tumor fighters may offer great therapeutic potential. In this study, we evaluated whether pharmacologic modulation of macrophage phenotype by HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) could produce an anti-tumor effect. We demonstrated that low-dose HDACi trichostatin-A (TSA) markedly reshaped the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating the suppressive activity of infiltrating macrophages and inhibiting the recruitment of MDSCs in various tumors. These actions, in turn, augmented anti-tumor immune responses and further enhanced anti-tumor effects of immunotherapies. HDAC inhibition, however, also upregulated PD-L1, thereby limiting the beneficial therapeutic effects. Indeed, combining low-dose TSA with anti-PD-L1 in this model significantly enhanced the durability of tumor reduction and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, compared with the effect of either treatment alone. These data introduce HDAC inhibition as a potential means to harness the anti-tumor potential of macrophages in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3126393481,"Fatty acid metabolism is essential for the biogenesis of cellular components and ATP production to sustain proliferation of cancer cells. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), a group of rate-limiting enzymes in fatty acid metabolism, catalyze the bioconversion of exogenous or de novo synthesized fatty acids to their corresponding fatty acyl-CoAs. In this study, systematical analysis of ACSLs levels and the amount of fatty acyl-CoAs illustrated that ACSL1 were significantly associated with the levels of a broad spectrum of fatty acyl-CoAs, and were elevated in human prostate tumors. ACSL1 increased the biosynthesis of fatty acyl-CoAs including C16:0-, C18:0-, C18:1-, and C18:2-CoA, triglycerides and lipid accumulation in cancer cells. Mechanistically, ACSL1 modulated mitochondrial respiration, β-oxidation, and ATP production through regulation of CPT1 activity. Knockdown of ACSL1 inhibited the cell cycle, and suppressed the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and growth of prostate xenograft tumors in vivo. Our study implicates ACSL1 as playing an important role in prostate tumor progression, and provides a therapeutic strategy of targeting fatty acid metabolism for the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3126427614,"Abstract The prognosis for patients with metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) is poor, and it is not improved by current treatments. RNA-binding motif protein X-linked (RBMX) are involved in the regulation of the malignant progression of various tumors. However, the role of RBMX in BCa tumorigenicity and progression remains unclear. In this study, we found that RBMX was significantly downregulated in BCa tissues, especially in muscle-invasive BCa tissues. RBMX expression was negatively correlated with tumor stage, histological grade and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that RBMX inhibited BCa cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hnRNP A1 was an RBMX-binding protein. RBMX competitively inhibited the combination of the RGG motif in hnRNP A1 and the sequences flanking PKM exon 9, leading to the formation of lower PKM2 and higher PKM1 levels, which attenuated the tumorigenicity and progression of BCa. Moreover, RBMX inhibited aerobic glycolysis through hnRNP A1-dependent PKM alternative splicing and counteracted the PKM2 overexpression-induced aggressive phenotype of the BCa cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that RBMX suppresses BCa tumorigenicity and progression via an hnRNP A1-mediated PKM alternative splicing mechanism. RBMX may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for clinical intervention in BCa."
https://openalex.org/W3128412142,"The liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis and hepatic insulin resistance constitutes a key feature of type 2 diabetes. However, platforms that accurately mimic human hepatic glucose disposition and allow for rapid and scalable quantification of glucose consumption dynamics are lacking. Here, we developed and optimized a colorimetric glucose assay based on the glucose oxidase-peroxidase system and demonstrate that the system can monitor glucose consumption in 3D primary human liver cell cultures over multiple days. The system was highly sensitive (limit of detection of 3.5 µM) and exceptionally accurate (R2 = 0.999) while requiring only nanoliter input volumes (250 nL), enabling longitudinal profiling of individual liver microtissues. By utilizing a novel polymer, off-stoichiometric thiol-ene (OSTE), and click-chemistry based on thiol-Michael additions, we furthermore show that the assay can be covalently bound to custom-build chips, facilitating the integration of the sensor into microfluidic devices. Using this system, we find that glucose uptake of our 3D human liver cultures closely resembles human hepatic glucose uptake in vivo as measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. By comparing isogenic insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive liver cultures we furthermore show that insulin and extracellular glucose levels account for 55% and 45% of hepatic glucose consumption, respectively. In conclusion, the presented data show that the integration of accurate and scalable nanoliter glucose sensors with physiologically relevant organotypic human liver models enables longitudinal profiling of hepatic glucose consumption dynamics that will facilitate studies into the biology and pathobiology of glycemic control, as well as antidiabetic drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W3126564464,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. It activates its target cells via binding to the membrane-bound IL-11 receptor (IL-11R), which then recruits a homodimer of the ubiquitously expressed, signal-transducing receptor gp130. Besides this classic signaling pathway, IL-11 can also bind to soluble forms of the IL-11R (sIL-11R), and IL-11/sIL-11R complexes activate cells via the induction of gp130 homodimerization (trans-signaling). We have previously reported that the metalloprotease ADAM10 cleaves the membrane-bound IL-11R and thereby generates sIL-11R. In this study, we identify the rhomboid intramembrane protease RHBDL2 as a so far unrecognized alternative sheddase that can efficiently trigger IL-11R secretion. We determine the cleavage site used by RHBDL2, which is located in the extracellular part of the receptor in close proximity to the plasma membrane, between Ala-370 and Ser-371. Furthermore, we identify critical amino acid residues within the transmembrane helix that are required for IL-11R proteolysis. We also show that ectopically expressed RHBDL2 is able to cleave the IL-11R within the early secretory pathway and not only at the plasma membrane, indicating that its subcellular localization plays a central role in controlling its activity. Moreover, RHBDL2-derived sIL-11R is biologically active and able to perform IL-11 trans-signaling. Finally, we show that the human mutation IL-11R-A370V does not impede IL-11 classic signaling, but prevents RHBDL2-mediated IL-11R cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W3128407926,"Cancer cells often depend on microenvironment signals from molecules such as cytokines for proliferation and metabolic adaptations. PRL-3, a cytokine-induced oncogenic phosphatase, is highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells and associated with poor outcome in this cancer. We studied whether PRL-3 influences metabolism. Cells transduced to express PRL-3 had higher aerobic glycolytic rate, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production than the control cells. PRL-3 promoted glucose uptake and lactate excretion, enhanced the levels of proteins regulating glycolysis and enzymes in the serine/glycine synthesis pathway, a side branch of glycolysis. Moreover, mRNAs for these proteins correlated with PRL-3 expression in primary patient myeloma cells. Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) was the most significantly induced metabolism gene. Forced GLDC downregulation partly counteracted PRL-3-induced aerobic glycolysis, indicating GLDC involvement in a PRL-3-driven Warburg effect. AMPK, HIF-1α, and c-Myc, important metabolic regulators in cancer cells, were not mediators of PRL-3’s metabolic effects. A phosphatase-dead PRL-3 mutant, C104S, promoted many of the metabolic changes induced by wild-type PRL-3, arguing that important metabolic effects of PRL-3 are independent of its phosphatase activity. Through this study, PRL-3 emerges as one of the key mediators of metabolic adaptations in multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W3126243513,"Macrophages and other immune cells are important contributors to obesity-associated inflammation; however, the cellular identities of these specific populations remain unknown. In this study, we identified individual populations of myeloid cells found in mouse epididymal/visceral adipose tissue by single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Multiple canonical correlation analysis identified 11 unique myeloid and myeloid-associate cell populations. In obese mice, we detected an increased percentage of monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cells expressing Cd9 and Trem2, as well as significantly decreased percentages of multiple cell populations, including tissue-resident cells expressing Lyve1, Mafb, and Mrc1. We have identified and validated a novel myeloid/macrophage population defined by Ly6a expression, exhibiting both myeloid and mesenchymal characteristics, which increased with obesity and showed high pro-fibrotic characteristics in vitro. Our mouse adipose tissue myeloid cell atlas provides an important resource to investigate obesity-associated inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3126887129,"Although a number of different methods have been used to quantify soil bacteria, identifying the optimal method(s) for soil bacterial abundance is still in question. No single method exists for undertaking an absolute microbial count using culture-dependent methods (CDMs) or even culture-independent methods (CIMs). This study investigated soil storage and pretreatment methods for optimal bacterial counts. Appropriate storage temperature (4°C) and optimal pretreatment methods (sonication time for 3 min and centrifugation at 1400 g ) were necessary to preserve bacterial cell viability and eliminate interference from soil particles. To better estimate soil bacterial numbers under various cellular state and respiration, this study also evaluated three CDMs (i.e., colony forming unit, spotting, and most probable number (MPN) and three CIMs (i.e., flow cytometry (FCM), epifluorescence microscopy (EM) count, and DNA quantitation). Each counting method was tested using 72 soil samples collected from a local arable farm site at three different depths (i.e., 10–20, 90–100, and 180–190 cm). Among all CDMs, MPN was found to be rapid, simple, and reliable. However, the number of bacteria quantified by MPN was 1–2 orders lower than that quantified by CIMs, likely due to the inability of MPN to count anaerobic bacteria. The DNA quantitation method appeared to overestimate soil bacterial numbers, which may be attributed to DNA from dead bacteria and free DNA in the soil matrix. FCM was found to be ineffective in counting soil bacteria as it was difficult to separate the bacterial cells from the soil particles. Dyes used in FCM stained the bacterial DNA and clay particles. The EM count was deemed a highly effective method as it provided information on soil mineral particles, live bacteria, and dead bacteria; however, it was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Combining both types of methods was considered the best approach to acquire better information on the characteristics of indigenous soil microorganisms (aerobic versus anaerobic, live versus dead)."
https://openalex.org/W3128131656,"There is a growing body of evidence for the utility of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) as a biomarker in asthma, including association with eosinophilic airway inflammation, assessment of disease severity and potential for predicting pathogenic risks, including exacerbations. However, to interpret any biomarker data with confidence, it is first important to understand the preanalytical factors and biological variation that may affect its reliable measurement and results interpretation. In this study we defined the healthy serum EDN reference range for men and women as 1.98 to 26.10 ng/mL, with no significant gender differences. Smoking did not impact the mean EDN levels and no circadian rhythm was identified for EDN, unlike blood eosinophils (EOS) where levels peaked at 00:00h. EDN expression in different cell types was investigated and shown to occur primarily in eosinophils, indicating they are likely to be the main cellular repository for EDN. We also confirm that the quantification of serum EDN is not influenced by the type of storage tube used, and it is stable at ambient temperature or when refrigerated for at least 7 days and for up to one year when frozen at -20°C or -80°C. In summary, EDN is a stable biomarker that may prove useful in precision medicine approaches by enabling the identification of a subpopulation of asthma patients with activated eosinophils and a more severe form of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3127979594,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall. It has been known that development of atherosclerosis is closely related to activation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of TNF-α blockade with brusatol on endothelial activation under pro-atherosclerotic conditions. To this end, we examined the effects of brusatol on TNF-α-induced intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) using western blot and THP-1 adhesion assays. Brusatol induced a decrease in TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression through inhibiting TNFR1 expression, leading to suppression of endothelial inflammation independently of the NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) pathway. The mechanism underlying brusatol-induced TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) inhibition was investigated with the aid of protein synthesis, co-immunoprecipitation, and cytokine arrays. Notably, brusatol inhibited TNFR1 protein synthesis and suppressed both the canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) signaling pathway and TNF-α-induced cytokine secretion. We further tested the functional effect of brusatol on atherosclerosis development in vivo using two different atherosclerosis mouse models, specifically, acute partial carotid ligation and conventional chronic high-fat diet-fed mouse models. Administration of brusatol led to significant suppression of atherosclerosis development in both mouse models. Our finding that brusatol prevents atherosclerosis via inhibition of TNFR1 protein synthesis supports the potential of downregulation of cell surface TNFR1 as an effective therapeutic approach to inhibit development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3126958293,"Sperm develop from puberty in the seminiferous tubules, inside the blood-testis barrier to prevent their recognition as “non-self” by the immune system, and it is widely assumed that human sperm-specific proteins cannot access the circulatory or immune systems. Sperm-specific proteins aberrantly expressed in cancer, known as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), are often pursued as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets based on the assumption they are neoantigens absent from the circulation in healthy men. Here, we identify a wide range of germ cell-derived and sperm-specific proteins, including multiple CTAs, that are selectively deposited by the Sertoli cells of the adult mouse and human seminiferous tubules into testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) that is “outside” the blood-testis barrier. From TIF, the proteins can access the circulatory- and immune systems. Disruption of spermatogenesis decreases the abundance of these proteins in mouse TIF, and a sperm-specific CTA is significantly decreased in TIF from infertile men, suggesting that exposure of certain CTAs to the immune system could depend on fertility status. The results provide a rationale for the development of blood-based tests useful in the management of male infertility and indicate CTA candidates for cancer immunotherapy and biomarker development that could show sex-specific and male-fertility-related responses."
https://openalex.org/W3127281642,"Purpose Shared decision-making (SDM) has only lately begun attaining recognition from the Japanese medical community. The purpose of this study was to create a Japanese version of the SDM-Q-Doc, which is a scale that measures SDM from the perspective of physicians, and to clarify its psychometric characteristics and identify the issues and factors that affect SDM. Methods The participants were 23 physicians and 130 patients who visited primary care clinics in Japan for the first time. Immediately following physician–patient interviews, the Japanese version of SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc were administered to patients and physicians, respectively. For convergent validity, physician confidence in the medical interview (PCMI) was used. After the determination of internal consistency and validity of the SDM-Q-Doc, the relations among each item of SDM-Q-Doc, SDM-Q-9, physicians’ sociodemographic attributes, and a presence or absence of nurse’s attendance during outpatient consultation were assessed by a multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results A factor analysis confirmed that the Japanese version of the SDM-Q-Doc displays a one-factor structure with a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.87, ω = 0.88). The correlation between the PCMI and SDM-Q-Doc confirmed an appropriate convergent validity (r = 0.406; p &lt; 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that the attendance of a nurse during consultation significantly affected one item of the SDM-Q-Doc, which in turn affected one item of the SDM-Q-9. SEM showed a good fit of model for these three items. Conclusion The Japanese version of the SDM-Q-Doc’s internal consistency and validity in the outpatient medical consultations in Japan were confirmed. Further, this study suggests the role of a nurse’s attendance during a physician–patient consultation on facilitating the SDM. Further, using the Japanese version of the SDM-Q-Doc will promote communication skills training for medical professionals by checking the quality of SDM."
https://openalex.org/W3128640022,"Abstract Metastasis is the fundamental cause of cancer mortality, but there are still very few anti-metastatic drugs available. Endosomal trafficking has been implicated in tumor metastasis, and we have previously found that small chemical vacuolin-1 (V1) potently inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and general endosomal-lysosomal degradation. Here, we assessed the anti-metastatic activity of V1 both in vitro and in vivo. V1 significantly inhibits colony formation, migration, and invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. It also compromises the assembly-disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions (FAs) by inhibiting the recycling and degradation of integrins. In various experimental or transgenic mouse models, V1 significantly suppresses the metastasis and/or tumor growth of breast cancer or melanoma. We further identified capping protein Zβ (CapZβ) as a V1 binding protein and showed that it is required for the V1-mediated inhibition of migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that V1 targets CapZβ to inhibit endosomal trafficking and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3129045429,"Background The World Health Organization has declared that infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic. Experiences with SARS in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 have shown that health professionals are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Hence, it has been recommended that aperiodic wide-scale assessment of the knowledge and preparedness of health professionals regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic is critical. Objectives This study aimed to assess the knowledge and preparedness of health professionals regarding COVID-19 among selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from the last week of March to early April, 2020. Government (n = 6) and private hospitals (n = 4) were included. The front-line participants with high exposure were proportionally recruited from their departments. The collected data from a self-administered questionnaire were entered using EpiData and analyzed in SPSS software. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) are presented. Results A total of 1334 health professionals participated in the study. The majority (675, 50.7%) of the participants were female. Of the total, 532 (39.9%) subjects were nurses/midwives, followed by doctors (397, 29.8%) and pharmacists (193, 14.5%). Of these, one-third had received formal training on COVID-19. The mean knowledge score of participants was 16.45 (±4.4). Regarding knowledge about COVID-19, 783 (58.7%), 354 (26.5%), and 196 (14.7%) participants had moderate, good, and poor knowledge, respectively. Lower scores were seen in younger age groups, females, and non-physicians. Two-thirds (63.2%) of the subjects responded that they had been updated by their hospital on COVID-19. Of the total, 1020 (76.5%) participants responded that television, radio, and newspapers were their primary sources of information. Established hospital preparedness measures were confirmed by 43–57% of participants. Conclusion The current study revealed that health professionals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, already know important facts but had moderate overall knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic. There were unmet needs in younger age groups, non-physicians, and females. Half of the respondents mentioning inadequate preparedness of their hospitals point to the need for more global solidarity, especially concerning the shortage of consumables and lack of equipment."
https://openalex.org/W3126624898,"Background Cervical cancer is a major global public health concern, with 85% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa, it is the second most common cancer amongst women. Screening and treatment of cervical cancer precursor lesions is associated with a lower incidence and mortality. This research determines the associations between women’s beliefs about cervical cancer and screening and the uptake of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears in Johannesburg, where cervical screening uptake is suboptimal. Methods This research was approved by the University of Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical), clearance certificate number: M170243 and the Johannesburg District Heath Research Committee prior to conducting the study. All participants signed a consent form prior to participating in this study. This cross-sectional analytical study used an interviewer-administered validated measurement scale based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) to describe health beliefs regarding cervical cancer and screening among 280 women aged 30 years and older, attending Johannesburg primary care facilities in 2017. Logistic regression models, with robust estimation of variance to account for clustering of women within clinics, were fitted to identify health beliefs (perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers and benefit, cues to action, and self-efficacy) associated with ever having had a Pap smear (screening uptake), while controlling for knowledge of screening and potential confounders. Results Of the 280 women, 177 (63.2%) had ever been screened, 180 (64.3%) were never married, 199 (71.1%) attained secondary education and 133 (47.5%) were employed full time. Women of older age (AOR = 1.6 for a 5-year increase in age; CI: 1.3–1.9; P&lt;0.001), with higher knowledge scores (AOR = 2.5 for a 5-point increase in knowledge score; 95% CI:1.0–6.3;P = 0.051), with lower perceived barriers scores (AOR = 0.4 for a 5-point increase in barriers score; 95% CI:0.3–0.5; P&lt;0.001) and higher perceived severity scores (AOR = 1.3 for a 5-point increase in severity score; 95% CI:1.0–1.6; P = 0.017) were more likely to have had a Pap smear. Conclusions This study shows that women who take up screening are older, more knowledgeable regarding cervical cancer and screening, less likely to perceive screening barriers, and more likely to perceive cervical cancer as a severe disease. This highlights that for public health interventions to increase screening uptake, the focus should include tailored behaviour change communication strategies that address women’s beliefs regarding screening barriers and emphasize the severity of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3126723632,"The complex and dynamic population of gut microbiota exerts a marked influence on the host during homeostasis and disease. Imbalance of gut microbiota metabolites may lead to cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure, which is related to myocardial infarction(MI) severity. However, the role of gut microbiota in the repair process after MI has rarely been reported. To explore the role of gut microbiota in MI repair and its underlying mechanism, we mixed antibiotics in drinking water to interfere with gut microbiota in rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Sirius red staining, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect tissue repair and fibrosis. We found that the expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities were significantly increased. We detected gut microbiota at different time points after MI using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and detected that Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were significantly altered among the butyric acid producers. We administered sodium butyrate via drinking water and discovered that sodium butyrate reduced HDAC activities and adverse repair. Therefore, we speculated that gut microbiota influences the acetylation level and tissue repair process after MI by affecting butyric acid production."
https://openalex.org/W3127661419,"The genus Cinnamomum consists of about 250 species spread globally. Out of these, C . verum ( C . zeylanicum ), also known as true cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, has gained worldwide attention due to its culinary uses and medicinal values. Sri Lanka is the largest true cinnamon producer in the world and accounts for about 80–90% of global production. Other than the cultivated species, Sri Lankan natural vegetation is home to seven endemic wild species of the genus Cinnamomum . While these are underutilized, proper identification and characterization are essential steps in any sustainable conservation and utilization strategies. Currently, species identification is purely based on morphological traits, and intraspecific diversity has made it more challenging. In this study, all the eight Cinnamomum species found in Sri Lanka, C . capparu-coronde , C . citriodorum C . dubium , C . litseifolium , C . ovalifolium , C . rivulorum , C . sinharajaense , and C . verum were collected in triplicates and identified using typical morphological traits. DNA extracted with the same collection was assessed with universal barcoding regions, rbc L, mat K, and trn H -psb A. While no intraspecific sequence differences were observed in C . citriodorum , C . rivulorum , and C . verum , the others had polymorphic sites in one, two, or all regions assessed. Interestingly, two individuals of C . sinharajaense had identical barcodes to the cultivated species C . verum , while the other one had one variable cite in mat K region and three cites in trn H -psb A reigon. Further, one C . dubium and one C . capparu-coronde accession each had identical, rbc L, and trn H -psb A sequences while those had only a single nucleotide variation observed in mat K region. Overall, the phylogeny of Cinnamomum species found in Sri Lanka could not be completely resolved with DNA barcoding regions studied."
https://openalex.org/W3126207988,"Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous disease that arises from connective tissues. Clinical outcome of patients with advanced tumors especially de-differentiated liposarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma remains unsatisfactory, despite intensive treatment regimens including maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) have been shown to contribute to oncogenic translation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). However, little is known about the role of MNK1/2 and their downstream targets in STS. In this study, we show that depletion of either MNK1 or MNK2 suppresses cell viability, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity of STS cells. We also identify a compelling antiproliferative efficacy of a novel, selective MNK inhibitor ETC-168. Cellular responsiveness of STS cells to ETC-168 correlates positively with that of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). Mirroring MNK1/2 silencing, ETC-168 treatment strongly blocks eIF4E phosphorylation and represses expression of sarcoma-driving onco-proteins including E2F1, FOXM1, and WEE1. Moreover, combination of ETC-168 and MCL1 inhibitor S63845 exerts a synergistic antiproliferative activity against STS cells. In summary, our study reveals crucial roles of MNK1/2 and their downstream targets in STS tumorigenesis. Our data encourage further clinical translation of MNK inhibitors for STS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3127179633,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, is a three-dimensional spinal deformity characterized by lateral curvature and axial rotation around the vertical body axis of the spine, the cause of which is yet unknown. The fast progression entails regular clinical monitoring, including X-rays. Here we present an approach to evaluate scoliosis from the three-dimensional image of a patient’s torso, captured by an ionizing radiation free body scanner, in combination with a model of the ribcage and spine. A skeletal structure of the ribcage and vertebral column was modelled with computer aided designed software and was used as an initial structure for macroscopic finite element method simulations. The basic vertebral column model was created for an adult female in an upright position. The model was then used to simulate the patient specific scoliotic spine configurations. The simulations showed that a lateral translation of a vertebral body results in an effective axial rotation and could reproduce the spinal curvatures. The combined method of three-dimensional body scan and finite element model simulations thus provide quantitative anatomical information about the position, rotation and inclination of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae within a three-dimensional torso. Furthermore, the simulations showed unequal distributions of stress and strain profiles across the intervertebral discs, due to their distortions, which might help to further understand the pathogenesis of scoliosis."
https://openalex.org/W3129122468,"In type 2 diabetes (T2D), both muscle and liver are severely resistant to insulin action. Muscle insulin resistance accounts for more than 80% of the impairment in total body glucose disposal in T2D patients and is often characterized by an impaired insulin signaling. Mitsugumin 53 (MG53), a muscle-specific TRIM family protein initially identified as a key regulator of cell membrane repair machinery has been suggested to be a critical regulator of muscle insulin signaling pathway by acting as ubiquitin E3 ligase targeting both the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Here, we show using in vitro and in vivo approaches that MG53 is not a critical regulator of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. First, MG53 expression is not consistently regulated in skeletal muscle from various preclinical models of insulin resistance. Second, MG53 gene knock-down in muscle cells does not lead to impaired insulin response as measured by Akt phosphorylation on Serine 473 and glucose uptake. Third, recombinant human MG53 does not alter insulin response in both differentiated C2C12 and human skeletal muscle cells. Fourth, ectopic expression of MG53 in HEK293 cells lacking endogenous MG53 expression fails to alter insulin response as measured by Akt phosphorylation. Finally, both male and female mg53 -/- mice were not resistant to high fat induced obesity and glucose intolerance compared to wild-type mice. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that MG53 is not a critical regulator of insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3129175103,"Abstract Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Despite current management, the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic RMS is ∼30%; underscoring the need to develop better treatment strategies. We have recently reported that pannexin 1 (PANX1) levels are downregulated in RMS and that restoring its expression inhibits RMS progression. Here, we have surveyed and characterized the molecular changes induced by PANX1 re-expression in RMS. We cataloged transcriptomic changes in this context by RNA sequencing. At the protein level, we unveiled PANX1 interactors using BioID, complemented by co-immunoprecipitation coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry performed in PANX1-enriched fractions. Using these data, we generated searchable public databases for the PANX1 interactome and changes to the RMS transcriptome occurring when PANX1 expression is restored. STRING network analyses revealed a PANX1 interactome involving plasma membrane and cytoskeleton-associated proteins including the previously undescribed interactor AHNAK. Indeed, AHNAK knockdown abrogated the PANX1-mediated reduction in RMS cell viability and migration. Using these unbiased approaches, we bring insight to the mechanisms by which PANX1 inhibits RMS progression, identifying the cell migration protein AHNAK as a key modifier of PANX1-mediated changes in RMS malignant properties."
https://openalex.org/W3129052970,"Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are globally recognized as a major cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis. A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2015 to May 2016 in Mekelle city to isolate, identify, and estimate the prevalence of C . jejuni and C . coli in raw meat samples and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. A total of 384 raw meat samples were randomly collected from bovine (n = 210), goat (n = 108), and chicken (n = 66), and isolation and identification of Campylobacter spp . were performed using standard bacteriological techniques and PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using disc diffusion method. Of the total 384 raw meat samples, 64 (16.67%) were found positive for Campylobacter spp . The highest prevalence of Campylobacter spp . was found in chicken meat (43.93%) followed by bovine meat (11.90%) and goat meat (9.25%). The most prevalent Campylobacter spp . isolated from meat samples was C . jejuni (81.25%). The overall prevalence of Campylobacter in restaurants, butcher shops, and abattoir was 43.93%, 18.30%, and 9.30%, respectively. 96.8%, 81.25%, 75%, and 71% of the Campylobacter spp . isolates were sensitive to norfloxacin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, respectively. However, 96.9%, 85.9%, and 50% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and streptomycin, respectively. Strains that developed multi-drug resistant were 68.7%. The result of this study revealed the occurrence of Campylobacter in bovine, goat, and chicken meats. Hence, there is a chance of acquiring infection via consumption of raw or undercooked meat. Thus, implementation of hygienic practices from a slaughterhouse to the retailers, proper handling and cooking of foods of meat are very important in preventing Campylobacter infection."

The aim of this study was to measure on-slope actual maximum speeds of snowboarders and to assess their ability to accurately them with regard to individual factors such as gender, skill level, age and risk-taking behaviour and actual maximum speed. The data were obtained from a sample of 312 (67% male, 33% female) adult recreational snowboarders taking lessons in one of the major resorts in the Spanish Pyrenees. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between maximal measured actual speed and estimated speed for all participants. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of individual factors on both the snowboarders’ actual maximum speed and their error of estimation. The Pearson correlation coefficient between estimated and actual maximum speed was 0.52 (P &lt; 0.001) for all participants. They underestimated their actual maximum speed on average by 10.05 km/h or 28.62%. All assessed factors were shown to significantly affect the snowboarders’ actual maximum speed. However, gender, skill level, age and actual maximum speed were shown to significantly affect the snowboarders’ error of estimation, while risk-taking behavior did not. Gender, skill level, age and risk-taking behaviour are associated with the actual maximum speed at which snowboarders ride, while the same individual factors, except for risk-taking behaviour, and their snowboarding speed seem to affect the ability to estimate actual maximum speeds in adult recreational snowboarders. The ability to estimate actual speed accurately is an important factor to avoid accidents on ski slopes and, therefore, having snowboarders informed about the benefits of speed self-awareness is a key matter for prevention purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3128064300,"Background Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause a wide range of symptoms, which can negatively affect the quality of life of patients and their entire families. No internationally and simultaneously developed disease-specific instrument exists for assessing pediatric health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after TBI. The aim of the current project is to provide original material from small group interviews with individuals after TBI concerning what they state is relevant for their HRQoL. This material is required for a further study to generate items for age-adapted questionnaires assessing the TBI-specific HRQoL of children and adolescents (C&amp;A): the QOLIBRI-Kiddy/Kid/Ado and proxy versions (Quality of Life after Brain Injury–Kiddy/Kids/Adolescents/Proxy) for individuals aged 6–17 and their parents. Methods The semi-structured interviews were conducted with separate small groups of C&amp;A (n = 19), divided into three age groups (5-7y, 8-12y, 13-17y), after mild, moderate, and severe TBI, and with groups of the corresponding parents (n = 26). All interviews lasted for about 60 minutes, were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The statements were investigated by qualitative analyses and sorted into categories relevant to the HRQoL of C&amp;A after TBI. Only descriptive group comparisons but no pairwise comparisons between children and corresponding parents were performed. Results The analyses led to 32 subcategories, which were assigned to six main theoretically based HRQoL categories. Many agreements exist between the C&amp;A’s and parents’ perspectives within the main categories, however their focus on HRQoL differs, especially concerning age-related contents. Parents of the youngest participant group already focus on topics such as autonomy, whereas this only becomes relevant for C&amp;A from the age of eight years on. Interestingly, even 5-year-old children were able to discuss their HRQoL, which indicates the importance of a self-report instrument. Conclusions Results obtained from this qualitative study identify the content of the HRQoL dimensions important for C&amp;A after TBI and their parents. Both, differences and similarities in the children’s and the parents’ views were investigated, to get a first insight in valid dimensions for the prospective questionnaires to be developed. In a future study, items for the questionnaires will be deducted from the small group interview material and psychometrically tested in C&amp;A after TBI from Germany. This study will address whether all statements were assigned to the suitable dimensions and whether differences between C&amp;A and parents persist."
https://openalex.org/W3128824639,"The estimation of the vertical components of built-up areas from free Digital Elevation Model (DEM) global data filtered by multi-scale convolutional, morphological and textural transforms are generalized at the spatial resolution of 250 meters using linear least-squares regression techniques. Six test cases were selected: Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Toronto. Five global DEM and two DEM composites are evaluated in terms of 60 combinations of linear, morphological and textural filtering and different generalization techniques. Four generalized vertical components estimates of built-up areas are introduced: the Average Gross Building Height (AGBH), the Average Net Building Height (ANBH), the Standard Deviation of Gross Building Height (SGBH), and the Standard Deviation of Net Building Height (SNBH). The study shows that the best estimation of the net GVC of built-up areas given by the ANBH and SNBH, always contains a greater error than their corresponding gross GVC estimation given by the AGBH and SGBH, both in terms of mean and standard deviation. Among the sources evaluated in this study, the best DEM source for estimating the GVC of built-up areas with univariate linear regression techniques is a composite of the 1-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM30) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D–30 m (AW3D30) using the union operator (CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U). A multivariate linear model was developed using 16 satellite features extracted from the CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U enriched by other land cover sources, to estimate the gross GVC. A RMSE of 2.40 m and 3.25 m was obtained for the AGBH and the SGBH, respectively. A similar multivariate linear model was developed to estimate the net GVC. A RMSE of 6.63 m and 4.38 m was obtained for the ANBH and the SNBH, respectively. The main limiting factors on the use of the available global DEMs for estimating the GVC of built-up areas are two. First, the horizontal resolution of these sources (circa 30 and 90 meters) corresponds to a sampling size that is larger than the expected average horizontal size of built-up structures as detected from nadir-angle Earth Observation (EO) data, producing more reliable estimates for gross vertical components than for net vertical component of built-up areas. Second, post-production processing targeting Digital Terrain Model specifications may purposely filter out the information on the vertical component of built-up areas that are contained in the global DEMs. Under the limitations of the study presented here, these results show a potential for using global DEM sources in order to derive statistically generalized parameters describing the vertical characteristics of built-up areas, at the scale of 250x250 meters. However, estimates need to be evaluated in terms of the specific requirements of target applications such as spatial population modelling, urban morphology, climate studies and so on."
https://openalex.org/W3127574814,"Histamine-induced vascular leakage is a core process of allergic pathologies, including anaphylaxis. Here, we show that glycolysis is integral to histamine-induced endothelial barrier disruption and hyperpermeability. Histamine rapidly enhanced glycolysis in endothelial cells via a pathway that involved histamine receptor 1 and phospholipase C beta signaling. Consistently, partial inhibition of glycolysis with 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) prevented histamine-induced hyperpermeability in human microvascular endothelial cells, by abolishing the histamine-induced actomyosin contraction, focal adherens junction formation, and endothelial barrier disruption. Pharmacologic blockade of glycolysis with 3PO in mice reduced histamine-induced vascular hyperpermeability, prevented vascular leakage in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and protected from systemic anaphylaxis. In conclusion, we elucidated the role of glycolysis in histamine-induced disruption of endothelial barrier integrity. Our data thereby point to endothelial glycolysis as a novel therapeutic target for human pathologies related to excessive vascular leakage, such as systemic anaphylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W3127658817,"Social hierarchies are ubiquitous in all human relations since birth, but little is known about how they emerge during infancy. Previous studies have shown that infants can represent hierarchical relationships when they arise from the physical superiority of one agent over the other, but humans have the capacity to allocate social status in others through cues that not necessary entail agents’ physical formidability. Here we investigate infants’ capacity to recognize the social status of different agents when there are no observable cues of physical dominance. Our results evidence that a first presentation of the agents' social power when obtaining resources is enough to allow infants predict the outputs of their future. Nevertheless, this capacity arises later (at 18 month-olds but not at 15 month-olds) than showed in previous studies, probably due the increased complexity of the inferences needed to make the predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3128386949,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection is becoming a first-line choice for treatment of ROP. However, there is a major concern that intravitreally injected anti-VEGF agents could escape from the eye into the systemic circulation and impair systemic development. Moreover, escaped anti-VEGF agents could have an effect on the retina of the fellow eye. In this study, we investigated the hematogenous effect of a single intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in a mouse model of ROP. Here, we showed that single intravitreal aflibercept injection to one eye can affect body weight gain, the fellow eye, and renal vessels, although no apparent effect was observed in brain vessels. Furthermore, this hematogenous effect was dose-dependent. Our results provide very important insights into the clinical use of anti-VEGF agents for ROP treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3128857185,"Acute liver failure (ALF) causes severe liver dysfunction that can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Previous studies suggest that sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) protects against hepatocyte injury, yet not much is still known about its involvement in ALF. This study examines the role of SphK1 in D-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALF, which is a well-established experimental mouse model that mimics the fulminant hepatitis. Here we report that deletion of SphK1, but not SphK2, dramatically decreased GalN/LPS-induced liver damage, hepatic apoptosis, serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and mortality rate compared to wild-type mice. Whereas GalN/LPS treatment-induced hepatic activation of NF-κB and JNK in wild-type and SphK2–/– mice, these signaling pathways were reduced in SphK1–/– mice. Moreover, repression of ALF in SphK1−/− mice correlated with decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Adoptive transfer experiments indicated that SphK1 in bone marrow-derived infiltrating immune cells but not in host liver-resident cells, contribute to the development of ALF. Interestingly, LPS-induced TNFα production was drastically suppressed in SphK1-deleted macrophages, whereas IL-10 expression was markedly enhanced, suggesting a switch to the anti-inflammatory phenotype. Finally, treatment with a specific SphK1 inhibitor ameliorated inflammation and protected mice from ALF. Our findings suggest that SphK1 regulates TNFα secretion from macrophages and inhibition or deletion of SphK1 mitigated ALF. Thus, a potent inhibitor of SphK1 could potentially be a therapeutic agent for fulminant hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3126187118,"Interpersonal skills require mastering a wide range of competencies such as communication and adaptation to different situations. Effective training includes the use of videos in which role models perform the desired behaviours such that trainees can learn through behavioural mimicry. However, new technologies allow new ways of designing training. In the present study, given that virtual reality is emerging as a valuable training setting, we compare two different demonstration conditions within virtual reality by investigating the extent to which the use of doppelgangers as role models can boost trainees’ interpersonal skills development as compared to a role model that does not resemble the trainees. We also assess trainees’ level of self-efficacy and gender as potential moderators in this relationship. Participants delivered a speech in front of a virtual audience twice. Before delivering their second speech, they watched a role model giving a speech in front of the same audience. The role model was either their doppelganger or an avatar of the same gender depending on the condition they were randomly assigned to. Results showed that the doppelganger-based training was the most beneficial for male trainees low in self-efficacy. These findings have important implications for training design, suggesting that doppelganger-based training might be effective only for a specific subset of trainees."
https://openalex.org/W3128274271,"Some but not all of the species of ’little brown mushrooms’ in the genus Galerina contain deadly amatoxins at concentrations equaling those in the death cap, Amanita phalloides . However, Galerina ’s ~300 species are notoriously difficult to identify by morphology, and the identity of toxin-containing specimens has not been verified with DNA barcode sequencing. This left open the question of which Galerina species contain toxins and which do not. We selected specimens for toxin analysis using a preliminary phylogeny of the fungal DNA barcode region, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we analyzed amatoxins from 70 samples of Galerina and close relatives, collected in western British Columbia, Canada. To put the presence of toxins into a phylogenetic context, we included the 70 samples in maximum likelihood analyses of 438 taxa, using ITS, RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene ( RPB2 ), and nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU) gene sequences. We sequenced barcode DNA from types where possible to aid with applications of names. We detected amatoxins only in the 24 samples of the G . marginata s.l. complex in the Naucoriopsis clade. We delimited 56 putative Galerina species using Automatic Barcode Gap Detection software. Phylogenetic analysis showed moderate to strong support for Galerina infrageneric clades Naucoriopsis , Galerina , Tubariopsis , and Sideroides . Mycenopsis appeared paraphyletic and included Gymnopilus . Amatoxins were not detected in 46 samples from Galerina clades outside of Naucoriopsis or from outgroups. Our data show significant quantities of toxin in all mushrooms tested from the G . marginata s.l. complex. DNA barcoding revealed consistent accuracy in morphology-based identification of specimens to G . marginata s.l. complex. Prompt and careful morphological identification of ingested G . marginata s.l. has the potential to improve patient outcomes by leading to fast and appropriate treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3128419541,"Changing sleep rhythms in adolescents often lead to sleep deficits and a delay in sleep timing between weekdays and weekends. The adolescent brain, and in particular the rapidly developing structures involved in emotional control, are vulnerable to external and internal factors. In our previous study in adolescents at age 14, we observed a strong relationship between weekend sleep schedules and regional medial prefrontal cortex grey matter volumes. Here, we aimed to assess whether this relationship remained in this group of adolescents of the general population at the age of 16 (n = 101; mean age 16.8 years; 55% girls). We further examined grey matter volumes in the hippocampi and the amygdalae, calculated with voxel-based morphometry. In addition, we investigated the relationships between sleep habits, assessed with self-reports, and regional grey matter volumes, and psychological functioning, assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and tests on working memory and impulsivity. Later weekend wake-up times were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdalae, and greater weekend delays in wake-up time were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the right hippocampus and amygdala. The medial prefrontal cortex region mediated the correlation between weekend wake up time and externalising symptoms. Paying attention to regular sleep habits during adolescence could act as a protective factor against the emergence of psychopathology via enabling favourable brain development."
https://openalex.org/W3127392811,"Background Medical students encounter pharmaceutical promotion from the very start of their training. Medical schools have an important role to play in educating medical students regarding the interactions between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and industry and in protecting them from commercial influence and conflict of interest (COI). In 2019, medical student associations in Belgium and abroad called for more preparation in dealing with COI and for a more independent medical training. As little information is available on the situation in our country, we undertook an assessment of conflict of interest policies at Belgium’s medical schools. We relied on a methodology already used in studies from USA, Canada, Australia, France and Germany and adapted it to the Belgian context. Methods We identified 10 medical schools in Belgium. We searched the website of each medical school in November 2019 with standardized keywords for COI policies and learning activities on COI in the curriculum. The deans of medicine were invited to participate by sending us information that we could have overlooked during our web-based searches. We also consulted personal contacts within faculties among students and teachers. Based on a list of 15 criteria adapted from North American and French studies, we calculated a total for each faculty of medicine with a maximum score of 30 points. Results By December 2019, we had gathered a set of written documents for four faculties of medicine (40%) containing policies with varying degrees of precision and relevance to our survey. We found elements of the curriculum addressing the COI issue for one faculty (10%). In all cases, these policies consisted of “moderate” initiatives with little or no “restrictive” elements. Only one faculty showed interest in our study by providing us with relevant information (10%). Half of the faculty notified us of their refusal to participate in the study (50%) and the other faculties either did not respond or did not provide us with any information (40%). The maximum score obtained was 3 out of 30 points with six faculties scoring 0 (60%). Conclusion There is little transparency regarding interactions between medical students and pharmaceutical companies at Belgian medical faculties, which may create COI issues. Initiatives to protect students from pharmaceutical promotion and to train them to manage their future interaction with pharmaceutical companies have a limited scope and are isolated. This is inconsistent with international recommendations from Health Action International, World Health Organization or the American Medical Students’ Association. The Belgian government has legislated in favor of more transparency in the relation between HCPs and pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, it made the disclosure of benefits granted by the industry compulsory and limited their value. Our results show that there is still some way to go to ensure an independent medical training for future Belgian physicians."

A potential role of intramuscular calcium (Ca 2+ ) dysregulation in RER has led to the use of dantrolene to prevent episodes of rhabdomyolysis. We examined differentially expressed proteins (DEP) and gene transcripts (DEG) in gluteal muscle of Thoroughbred race-trained mares after exercise among three groups of 5 horses each; 1) horses susceptible to, but not currently experiencing rhabdomyolysis, 2) healthy horses with no history of RER (control), 3) RER-susceptible horses treated with dantrolene pre-exercise (RER-D). Tandem mass tag LC/MS/MS quantitative proteomics and RNA-seq analysis (FDR &lt;0.05) was followed by gene ontology (GO) and semantic similarity of enrichment terms. Of the 375 proteins expressed, 125 were DEP in RER-susceptible versus control, with 52 ↑DEP mainly involving Ca 2+ regulation (N = 11) (e.g. RYR1, calmodulin, calsequestrin, calpain), protein degradation (N = 6), antioxidants (N = 4), plasma membranes (N = 3), glyco(geno)lysis (N = 3) and 21 DEP being blood-borne. ↓DEP (N = 73) were largely mitochondrial (N = 45) impacting the electron transport system (28), enzymes (6), heat shock proteins (4), and contractile proteins (12) including Ca 2+ binding proteins. There were 812 DEG in RER-susceptible versus control involving the electron transfer system, the mitochondrial transcription/translational response and notably the pro-apoptotic Ca 2+- activated mitochondrial membrane transition pore ( SLC25A27 , BAX , ATP5 subunits). Upregulated mitochondrial DEG frequently had downregulation of their encoded DEP with semantic similarities highlighting signaling mechanisms regulating mitochondrial protein translation. RER-susceptible horses treated with dantrolene, which slows sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ release, showed no DEG compared to control horses. We conclude that RER-susceptibility is associated with alterations in proteins, genes and pathways impacting myoplasmic Ca 2+ regulation, the mitochondrion and protein degradation with opposing effects on mitochondrial transcriptional/translational responses and mitochondrial protein content. RER could potentially arise from excessive sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ release and subsequent mitochondrial buffering of excessive myoplasmic Ca 2+ ."
https://openalex.org/W3128701769,"Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling regulates diverse biological processes. Upon ligand binding, BMP receptors (BMPRs) phosphorylate SMAD1/5 and other noncanonical downstream effectors to induce transcription of downstream targets. However, the precise role of individual BMP receptors in this process remains largely unknown due to the complexity of downstream signaling and the innate promiscuity of ligand-receptor interaction. To delineate unique downstream effectors of individual BMPR1s, we analyzed the transcriptome of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) expressing three distinct constitutively active BMPR1s of which expression was detected in endothelial cells (ECs). From our analyses, we identified a number of novel downstream targets of BMPR1s in ECs. More importantly, we found that each BMPR1 possesses a distinctive set of downstream effectors, suggesting that each BMPR1 is likely to retain unique function in ECs. Taken together, our analyses suggest that each BMPR1 regulates downstream targets non-redundantly in ECs to create context-dependent outcomes of the BMP signaling."

Results showed that European Canadians (Study 1) mostly ignored background gaze cues and were uninfluenced by the self-construal primes. However, East Asian Canadians (Study 2), who have cultural backgrounds relevant to both independence and interdependence, showed different attention patterns by prime: those primed with interdependence were more distracted by mismatched (vs. matched) background gaze cues, whereas there was no change for those primed with independence. These findings suggest activating an interdependent self-construal modulates social attention mechanisms to attend broadly, but only for those who may find these representations meaningful."

Lifestyle and caloric oversupply are the main causes of such array of disorders, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their etiology remain elusive. Nuclear Protein 1 (NUPR1) expression increases upon cell injury in all organs including liver. Recently, we reported NUPR1 actively participates in the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR typically maintains protein homeostasis, but downstream mediators of the pathway regulate metabolic functions including lipid metabolism. As increases in UPR and NUPR1 in obesity and liver disease have been well documented, the goal of this study was to investigate the roles of NUPR1 in this context. To establish whether NUPR1 is involved in these liver conditions we used patient-derived liver biopsies and in vitro and in vivo NUPR1 loss of functions models. First, we analyzed NUPR1 expression in a cohort of morbidly obese patients (MOPs), with simple fatty liver (NAFL) or more severe steatohepatitis (NASH). Next, we explored the metabolic roles of NUPR1 in wild-type (Nupr1+/+) or Nupr1 knockout mice (Nupr1−/−) fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks. Immunohistochemical and mRNA analysis revealed NUPR1 expression is inversely correlated to hepatic steatosis progression. Mechanistically, we found NUPR1 participates in the activation of PPAR-α signaling via UPR. As PPAR-α signaling is controlled by UPR, collectively, these findings suggest a novel function for NUPR1 in protecting liver from metabolic distress by controlling lipid homeostasis, possibly through the UPR."

Prominent interventions for atypical rearfoot eversion include foot orthoses, footwear, and taping but a modification derived from gait retraining to correct atypical rearfoot in/eversion is lacking. We aimed to investigate changes in rearfoot in/eversion, subtalar pronation, medial longitudinal arch angle, and selected lower limb joint biomechanics while performing toe-in/toe-out running using real-time visual feedback. Fifteen female runners participated in this study. Subjects performed toe-in/toe-out running using real-time visual feedback on foot progression angle, which was set ±5° from habitual foot progression angle. 3D kinematics of rearfoot in/eversion, subtalar supination/pronation, medial longitudinal arch angle, foot progression angle, hip flexion, ab/adduction and internal/external rotation, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and ankle power were analyzed. A repeated-measures ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons was used to analyze changes between three conditions. Toe-in running compared to normal and toe-out running reduced peak rearfoot eversion (mean difference (MD) with normal = 2.1°; p&lt;0.001, MD with toe-out = 3.5°; p&lt;0.001), peak pronation (MD with normal = -2.0°; p&lt;0.001, MD with toe-out = -3.4; p = &lt;0.001), and peak medial longitudinal arch angle (MD with normal = -0.7°; p = 0.022, MD with toe-out = -0.9; p = 0.005). Toe-out running significantly increased these kinematic factors compared to normal and toe-in running. Toe-in running compared to normal running increased peak hip internal rotation (MD = 2.3; p&lt;0.001), and reduced peak knee flexion (MD = 1.3; p = 0.014). Toe-out running compared to normal running reduced peak hip internal rotation (MD = 2.5; p&lt;0.001), peak hip ab/adduction (MD = 2.5; p&lt;0.001), peak knee flexion (MD = 1.5; p = 0.003), peak ankle dorsiflexion (MD = 1.6; p&lt;0.001), and peak ankle power (MD = 1.3; p = 0.001). Runners were able to change their foot progression angle when receiving real-time visual feedback for foot progression angle. Toe-in/toe-out running altered rearfoot kinematics and medial longitudinal arch angle, therefore supporting the potential value of gait retraining focused on foot progression angle using real-time visual feedback when atypical rearfoot in/eversion needs to be modified. It should be considered that changes in foot progression angle when running is accompanied by changes in lower limb joint biomechanics."
https://openalex.org/W3126494810,"Stable isotope analysis is an increasingly used molecular tool to reconstruct the diet and ecology of elusive primates such as unhabituated chimpanzees. The consumption of C 4 plant feeding termites by chimpanzees may partly explain the relatively high carbon isotope values reported for some chimpanzee communities. However, the modest availability of termite isotope data as well as the diversity and cryptic ecology of termites potentially consumed by chimpanzees obscures our ability to assess the plausibility of these termites as a C 4 resource. Here we report the carbon and nitrogen isotope values from 79 Macrotermes termite samples from six savanna woodland chimpanzee research sites across equatorial Africa. Using mixing models, we estimated the proportion of Macrotermes C 4 plant consumption across savanna woodland sites. Additionally, we tested for isotopic differences between termite colonies in different vegetation types and between the social castes within the same colony in a subset of 47 samples from 12 mounds. We found that Macrotermes carbon isotope values were indistinguishable from those of C 3 plants. Only 5 to 15% of Macrotermes diets were comprised of C 4 plants across sites, suggesting that they cannot be considered a C 4 food resource substantially influencing the isotope signatures of consumers. In the Macrotermes subsample, vegetation type and caste were significantly correlated with termite carbon values, but not with nitrogen isotope values. Large Macrotermes soldiers, preferentially consumed by chimpanzees, had comparably low carbon isotope values relative to other termite castes. We conclude that Macrotermes consumption is unlikely to result in high carbon isotope values in either extant chimpanzees or fossil hominins."
https://openalex.org/W3127260653,"Teacher’s pupil control ideology is a central feature for the quality of the teacher-student relationship, which, in turn, impacts the teacher’s level of well-being. The pupil control ideology refers to a teacher’s belief system along a continuum from humanistic to custodial views. Teachers with humanistic orientation view students as responsible and, therefore, they exert a lower degree of control to manage students’ classroom behaviors. Teachers with a custodial orientation view students as untrustworthy and, therefore, they exert a higher degree of control to manage students’ classroom behaviors. The relationship between pupil control ideology and dysfunctional beliefs originated from the cognitive-behavioral therapy framework has not been investigated, despite existing evidence suggesting that the pupil control ideology is linked to stress and burnout. One hundred fifty-five teachers completed a set of self-report questionnaires measuring: (i) teacher’s pupil-control ideology; (ii) perfectionistic and hostile automatic thoughts; (iii) irrational beliefs; (iv) unconditional self-acceptance; (v) early maladaptive schemas; and (vi) dimensions of perfectionism. The result suggests that teachers who adopt a custodial view on pupil control ideology endorse more dysfunctional beliefs than teachers who adopt a humanistic view. They tend to present a higher level of perfectionism, unrelenting standards, and problematic relational beliefs, including schemas of mistrust and entitlement. They also present more often other-directed demands and derogation of other thoughts. Such results picture a dysfunctional view on pupils who misbehave, as adversaries who threaten their rigid and/or perfectionistic expectations."
https://openalex.org/W3127938372,"In the early phase of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was postulated that the renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) increase the infection risk. This was primarily based on numerous reports, which stated that the RASi could increase the organ Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in rodents. RASi can theoretically antagonize the potential influence of angiotensin II (Ang II) on ACE2. However, while Ang II decreases the ACE2 levels in cultured cells, there is little evidence that supports this phenomenon in living animals. In this study, we tested whether Ang II or Ang II combined with its antagonist would alter the ACE2 and other molecules associated with the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Male C57BL6/J mice were administered vehicle, Ang II (400 ng/kg/min), or Ang II with losartan (10 mg/kg/min) for 2 weeks. ACE2 knockout mice were used as a negative control for the ACE2 assay. We found that both Ang II, which elevated blood pressure by 30 mm Hg, and Ang II with losartan, had no effect on the expression or protein activity of ACE2 in the lung, left ventricle, kidney, and ileum. Likewise, these interventions had no effect on the expression of Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Furin, proteases that facilitate the virus-cell fusion, and the expression or activity of Tumor Necrosis Factor α-Convertase (TACE) that cleaves cell-surface ACE2. Collectively, physiological concentrations of Ang II do not modulate the molecules associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results support the recent observational studies suggesting that the use of RASi is not a risk factor for COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W3128176315,"Objectives Although several self-reported questionnaire-based studies have found an association between smoking and moderately increased albuminuria, this result remains controversial. We investigated whether moderately increased albuminuria was associated with smoking status, verified by urinary cotinine (an objective biomarker of tobacco exposure), using population-based, nationally representative data. Methods This study included 2059 participants aged ≥ 50 years from the 2014 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Individuals with a urinary cotinine level ≥ 50 ng/mL were identified as cotinine-verified smokers. Moderately increased albuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ranging between ≥ 30 mg/g and &lt; 300 mg/g. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between cotinine-verified smoking status and moderately increased albuminuria. Results Among the study participants, 16.9% were cotinine-verified smokers, 84.8% of whom were men. After adjustment for multiple covariates, cotinine-verified smokers showed a significant positive association with moderately increased albuminuria (adjusted odds ratio: 4.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.63–11.71) compared with cotinine-verified non-smokers. The association between urinary cotinine and moderately increased albuminuria did not differ with age, sex, obesity, or comorbidities (P-value for interaction &gt; 0.05 in all cases). Conclusion This large-scale observational study showed that cotinine-verified smoking is associated with moderately increased albuminuria in the Korean middle-aged and older general population, suggesting that smoking must be strictly controlled to reduce the risk of moderately increased albuminuria."
https://openalex.org/W3129114963,"Owing to the recent development in deep learning, machine vision has been widely used in intelligent manufacturing equipment in multiple fields, including precision-manufacturing production lines and online product-quality inspection. This study aims at online Machine Vision Inspection, focusing on the method of online semantic segmentation under complex backgrounds. First, the fewer-parameters optimization of the atrous convolution architecture is studied. Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and residual network (ResNet) are selected as the basic architectures of η seg and η main , respectively, which indicate that the improved proportion of the participating input image feature is beneficial for improving the accuracy of feature extraction during the change of the number and dimension of feature maps. Second, this study proposes five modified ResNet residual building blocks, with the main path having a 3 × 3 convolution layer, 2 × 2 skip path, and pooling layer with l s = 2, which can improve the use of image features. Finally, the simulation experiments show that our modified structure can significantly decrease segmentation time T seg from 719 to 296 ms (decreased by 58.8%), with only a slight decrease in the intersection-over-union from 86.7% to 86.6%. The applicability of the proposed machine vision method was verified through the segmentation recognition of the China Yuan (CNY) for the 2019 version. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed model of semantic segmentation visual detection effectively reduces the detection time while ensuring the detection accuracy and has a significant effect of fewer-parameters optimization. This slows for the possibility of neural network detection on mobile terminals."
https://openalex.org/W3129140545,"The decline of muscle regenerative potential with age has been attributed to a diminished responsiveness of muscle progenitor cells (MPCs). Heterochronic parabiosis has been used as a model to study the effects of aging on stem cells and their niches. These studies have demonstrated that, by exposing old mice to a young systemic environment, aged progenitor cells can be rejuvenated. One interesting idea is that pregnancy represents a unique biological model of a naturally shared circulatory system between developing and mature organisms. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the muscle regeneration potential of pregnant mice using a cardiotoxin (CTX) injury mouse model. Our results indicate that the pregnant mice demonstrate accelerated muscle healing compared to nonpregnant control mice following muscle injury based on improved muscle histology, superior muscle regeneration, and a reduction in inflammation and necrosis. Additionally, we found that MPCs isolated from pregnant mice display a significant improvement of myogenic differentiation capacity in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo when compared to the MPCs from nonpregnant mice. Furthermore, MPCs from nonpregnant mice display enhanced myogenic capacity when cultured in the presence of serum obtained from pregnant mice. Our proteomics data from these studies provides potential therapeutic targets to enhance the myogenic potential of progenitor cells and muscle repair."
