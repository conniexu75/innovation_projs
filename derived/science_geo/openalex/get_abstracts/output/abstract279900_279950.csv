https://openalex.org/W2065653401,The polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) residues in the aquatic sediments from six PCB spill sites showed changes in PCB isomer and homolog (congener) distribution that indicated the occurrence of reductive dechlorination. The PCB dechlorinations exhibited several distinct congener selection patterns that indicated mediation by several different localized populations of anaerobic microorganisms. The higher (more heavily chlorinated) PCB congeners that were preferentially attacked by the observed dechlorination processes included all those that are either pharmacologically active or persistent in higher animals. All the lower (less heavily chlorinated) PCB congeners formed by the dechlorinations were species that are known to be oxidatively biodegradable by the bacteria of aerobic environments.

Lee, as well as with a wide group of colleagues and co-workers who have been responsible for bringing this field to its current state. That state is summarized in the title; we now have some concepts relevant to the motions of atoms and molecules in simple reactions, and some examples of the application of these concepts. We are, however, richer in vocabulary than in literature. The great epics of reaction dynamics remain to be written. I shall confine myself to some simple stories."
https://openalex.org/W2054343501,"Shocked quartz grains displaying planar features were isolated from Cretaceous- Tertiary boundary clays at five sites in Europe, a core from the north-central Pacific Ocean, and a site in New Zealand. At all of these sites, the planar features in the shocked quartz can be indexed to rational crystallographic planes of the quartz lattice. The grains display streaking indicative of shock in x-ray diffraction photographs and also show reduced refractive indices. These characteristic features of shocked quartz at several sites worldwide confirm that an impact event at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary distributed ejecta products in an earth-girdling dust cloud, as postulated by the Alvarez impact hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2075173498,Calcium-41 has been suggested as a new tool for radiometric dating in the range of 10(5) to 10(6) years. The concentration of cosmogenic calcium-41 in natural samples of terrestrial origin has now been determined by high-sensitivity accelerator mass spectrometry after pre-enrichment in calcium-41 with an isotope separator. Ratios of calcium-41 to total calcium between 2 x 10(-14) and 3 x 10(-15) were measured for samples of contemporary bovine bone and from limestone deposits. Some prospects for the use of calcium-41 for dating Middle and Late Pleistocene bone and for other geophysical applications are discussed.

(16 Apr., p. 326), the revised System III rotation rate of the drift was incorrectly calculated. It should not have been ""810.737 degrees +/- 0.008 degrees per day,"" as stated (line 21, col. 1, p. 329), but rather ""810.851 degrees +/-0.008 degrees per day."""
