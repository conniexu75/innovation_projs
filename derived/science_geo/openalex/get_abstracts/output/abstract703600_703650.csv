https://openalex.org/W4308098986,"Game-based virtual reality phone applications can create a realistic environment to prepare for clinical applications and improve students' knowledge of and compliance with standard precautions. An experimental study was performed among 126 nursing students' from the third and fourth nursing levels to determine the effect of online education and game-based virtual reality phone applications related to standard precautions. Students were divided randomly into two groups; the experimental group used online education and game-based virtual reality phone applications, while the control group used traditional education. The study was performed between July and August 2019 to prevent clashes with lectures and midterm and final examinations. A tool package including knowledge, attitude, and compliance with standard precautions was used in pre-and post-tests among nursing students. The results showed that the knowledge of, attitudes towards, and compliance with standard precautions differed between the two groups. The performance of the experimental group of nursing students significantly improved with online instruction and game-based virtual reality phone applications. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of online education and game-based virtual reality phone application among nursing students."
https://openalex.org/W4308045225,"Background Several studies have shown significant variation in overall survival rates from childhood cancer between countries, using population-based cancer registry (PBCR) data for all cancers combined and for many individual tumour types among children. Without accurate and comparable data on Tumour stage at diagnosis, it is difficult to define the reasons for these survival differences. This is because measurement systems designed for adult cancers do not apply to children’s cancers and cancer registries often hold limited information on paediatric tumour stage and the data sources used to define it. Aims The BENCHISTA project aims to test the application of the international consensus “Toronto Staging Guidelines” (TG) for paediatric tumours by European and non-European PBCRs for six common paediatric solid tumours so that reliable comparisons of stage at diagnosis and survival rates by stage can be made to understand any differences. A secondary aim is to test the data availability and completeness of collection of several ‘Toronto’ consensus non-stage prognostic factors, treatment types given, occurrence of relapse/progression and cause of death as a descriptive feasibility study. Methods PBCRs will use their permitted data access channels to apply the Toronto staging guidelines to all incident cases of six solid childhood cancers (medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewings sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour) diagnosed in a consecutive three-year period within 2014–2017 in their population. Each registry will provide a de-identified patient-level dataset including tumour stage at diagnosis, with only the contributing registry holding the information that would be needed to re-identify the patients. Where available to the registry, patient-level data on ‘Toronto’ non-stage prognostic factors, treatments given and clinical outcomes (relapse/progression/cause of death) will be included. More than 60 PBCRs have been involved in defining the patient-level dataset items and intend to participate by contributing their population-level data. Tumour-specific on-line training workshops with clinical experts are available to cancer registry staff to assist them in applying the Toronto staging guidelines in a consistent manner. There is also a project-specific help desk for discussion of difficult cases and promotion of the CanStaging online tools, developed through the International Association of Cancer Registries, to further ensure standardisation of data collection. Country-specific stage distribution and observed survival by stage at diagnosis will be calculated for each tumour type to compare survival between countries or large geographical regions. Discussion This study will be promote and enhance the collection of standardized staging data for childhood cancer by European and non-European population-based cancer registries. Therefore, this project can be seen as a feasibility project of widespread use of Toronto Staging at a population-level by cancer registries, specifying the data sources used and testing how well standardized the processes can be. Variation in tumour stage distribution could be due to real differences, to different diagnostic practices between countries and/or to variability in how cancer registries assign Toronto stage. This work also aims to strengthen working relationships between cancer registries, clinical services and cancer-specific clinical study groups, which is important for improving patient outcomes and stimulating research."
https://openalex.org/W4308067666,"Importance The rapid proliferation of COVID-19 has left governments scrambling, and several data aggregators are now assisting in the reporting of county cases and deaths. The different variables affecting reporting (e.g., time delays in reporting) necessitates a well-documented reliability study examining the data methods and discussion of possible causes of differences between aggregators. Objective To statistically evaluate the reliability of COVID-19 data across aggregators using case fatality rate (CFR) estimates and reliability statistics. Design, setting, and participants Cases and deaths were collected daily by volunteers via state and local health departments, as primary sources and newspaper reports, as secondary sources. In an effort to begin comparison for reliability statistical analysis, BroadStreet collected data from other COVID-19 aggregator sources, including USAFacts, Johns Hopkins University, New York Times, The COVID Tracking Project. Main outcomes and measures COVID-19 cases and death counts at the county and state levels. Results Lower levels of inter-rater agreement were observed across aggregators associated with the number of deaths, which manifested itself in state level Bayesian estimates of COVID-19 fatality rates. Conclusions and relevance A national, publicly available data set is needed for current and future disease outbreaks and improved reliability in reporting."
https://openalex.org/W4308099021,"Providing consumers with product-specific environmental impact information for food products (ecolabels) may promote more sustainable purchasing, needed to meet global environmental targets. Two UK studies investigated the effectiveness of different ecolabels using an experimental online supermarket platform. Study 1 (N = 1051 participants) compared three labels against control (no label), while Study 2 (N = 4979) tested four designs against control. Study 1 found significant reductions in the environmental impact score (EIS) for all labels compared to control (labels presented: values for four environmental indicators [-3.9 percentiles, 95%CIs: -5.2,-2.6]; a composite score [taking values from A to E; -3.9, 95%CIs: -5.2,-2.5]; or both together [-3.2, 95%CIs: -4.5,-1.9]). Study 2 showed significant reductions in EIS compared to control for A-E labels [-2.3, 95%CIs: -3.0,-1.5], coloured globes with A-E scores [-3.2, 95%CIs:-3.9,-2.4], and red globes highlighting 'worse' products [-3.2, 95%CIs:-3.9,-2.5]. There was no evidence that green globes highlighting 'better' products were effective [-0.5, 95%CIs:-1.3,0.2]. Providing ecolabels is a promising intervention to promote the selection of more sustainable products."
https://openalex.org/W4308067624,"Since 2013, the usage of preprints as a means of sharing research in biology has rapidly grown, in particular via the preprint server bioRxiv. Recent studies have found that journal articles that were previously posted to bioRxiv received a higher number of citations or mentions/shares on other online platforms compared to articles in the same journals that were not posted. However, the exact causal mechanism for this effect has not been established, and may in part be related to authors' biases in the selection of articles that are chosen to be posted as preprints. We aimed to investigate this mechanism by conducting a mixed-methods survey of 1,444 authors of bioRxiv preprints, to investigate the reasons that they post or do not post certain articles as preprints, and to make comparisons between articles they choose to post and not post as preprints. We find that authors are most strongly motivated to post preprints to increase awareness of their work and increase the speed of its dissemination; conversely, the strongest reasons for not posting preprints centre around a lack of awareness of preprints and reluctance to publicly post work that has not undergone a peer review process. We additionally find evidence that authors do not consider quality, novelty or significance when posting or not posting research as preprints, however, authors retain an expectation that articles they post as preprints will receive more citations or be shared more widely online than articles not posted."
https://openalex.org/W4308077902,"Micromechanical cracking processes in rocks directly control macro mechanical responses under compressive stresses. Understanding these micro-scale observations has paramount importance in predicting macro-field problems encountered in rock engineering. Here, our study aims to investigate the development of precursory damage zones resulting from microcracking pertinent to macro-scale rock failure. A series of laboratory tests and three-dimensional (3D) numerical experiments are conducted on andesite samples to reveal the characteristics of damage zones in the form of strain fields. Our results from discrete element methodology (DEM) predict that the crack damage threshold (σcd) values are 61.50% and 67.44% of relevant peak stress under two different confining stresses (σ3 = 0.1 MPa and σ3 = 2 MPa), respectively. Our work evaluates the strain fields within the range of the σcd to the peak stress through discrete analysis for both confining stresses. We note that the representative strain field zones of failure are not observed as soon as the σcd is reached. Such localized zones develop approximately 88% of peak stress levels although the confinement value changes the precursory strain localization that appears at similar stress levels. Our results also show that the distinct strain field patterns developed prior to failure control the final size of the macro-damage zone as well as their orientation with respect to the loading direction (e.g 17° and 39°) at the post-failure stage. These findings help to account for many important aspects of precursory strain field analysis in rock mechanics where the damage was rarely quantified subtly."
https://openalex.org/W4308077988,"Atmospheric air temperature is the most crucial metrological parameter. Despite its influence on multiple fields such as hydrology, the environment, irrigation, and agriculture, this parameter describes climate change and global warming quite well. Thus, accurate and timely air temperature forecasting is essential because it provides more important information that can be relied on for future planning. In this study, four Data-Driven Approaches, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Quantile Regression Tree (QRT), ARIMA, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), have been applied to forecast short-, and mid-term air temperature (daily, and weekly) over North America under continental climatic conditions. The time-series data is relatively long (2000 to 2021), 70% of the data are used for model calibration (2000 to 2015), and the rest are used for validation. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions have been used to select the best input combination for the forecasting models. The quality of predicting models is evaluated using several statistical measures and graphical comparisons. For daily scale, the SVR has generated more accurate estimates than other models, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 3.592°C), Correlation Coefficient (R = 0.964), Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 2.745°C), and Thiels’ U-statistics (U = 0.127). Besides, the study found that both RT and SVR performed very well in predicting weekly temperature. This study discovered that the duration of the employed data and its dispersion and volatility from month to month substantially influence the predictive models’ efficacy. Furthermore, the second scenario is conducted using the randomization method to divide the data into training and testing phases. The study found the performance of the models in the second scenario to be much better than the first one, indicating that climate change affects the temperature pattern of the studied station. The findings offered technical support for generating high-resolution daily and weekly temperature forecasts using Data-Driven Methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W4308078228,"Prolonged periods of social isolation are known to have significant negative health consequences and reduce quality of life, an effect that is particularly pronounced in older populations. Despite the known deleterious effects of social isolation, a key component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the issuance of stay at home and/or shelter in place orders. Relatively little is known about the potential effects these periods of social isolation could have on older adults, and less still is known about potential risk factors or protective factors that modulate these effects. Here, we describe results from a longitudinal study in which we measured quality of life both prior to and immediately following a one-month period of social isolation associated with the issuance and revocation of a shelter in place order (April 6, 2020 through May 4, 2020) in the state of South Carolina. Healthy adult participants (N = 62) between the ages of 60 and 80 who had already completed quality of life questionnaires prior to isolation again completed the questionnaires following a one-month order to shelter in place. Quality of life significantly decreased during the social isolation period, with older participants showing the greatest declines. Participants with higher levels of physical activity and better physical/mental health going into the isolation period tended to show greater decreases in quality of life over time. These results highlight the negative consequences of even short bouts of social isolation for the elderly and suggest that reductions in social contact related to COVID-19 may have significant effects on mental health and emotional well-being, at least among older individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4308099133,"Differences in national responses to COVID-19 have been associated with the cultural value of collectivism. The present research builds on these findings by examining the relationship between collectivism at the individual level and adherence to public health recommendations to combat COVID-19 during the pre-vaccination stage of the pandemic, and examines different characteristics of collectivism (i.e., concern for community, trust in institutions, perceived social norms) as potential psychological mechanisms that could explain greater compliance. A study with a cross-section of American participants ( N = 530) examined the relationship between collectivism and opting-in to digital contact tracing (DCT) and wearing face coverings in the general population. More collectivistic individuals were more likely to comply with public health interventions than less collectivistic individuals. While collectivism was positively associated with the three potential psychological mechanisms, only perceived social norms about the proportion of people performing the public health interventions explained the relationship between collectivism and compliance with both public health interventions. This research identifies specific pathways by which collectivism can lead to compliance with community-benefiting public health behaviors to combat contagious diseases and highlights the role of cultural orientation in shaping individuals’ decisions that involve a tension between individual cost and community benefit."
https://openalex.org/W4308077984,"The present study intends to formulate, characterize and appraise the phospholipid-based nanovesicular system for enhanced delivery of Hesperetin (HT). The quality by design (QbD) approach was employed to prepare Hesperetin naturosomes (HTN) using the solvent evaporation technique and assessed for physicochemical and pharmacological attributes. The FTIR, DSC, and PXRD studies confirmed the successful formation of a vesicular drug-phospholipid complex, while photomicroscopy, SEM, and TEM analysis revealed the morphology of HTN. The functional attributes substantially enhanced the HT's aqueous solubility, drug release, and membrane permeation. The aqueous solubility of HTN was ~10-fold more than that of pure HT. Likewise, the in-vitro dissolution data of HTN showed better competence in releasing the HT (>93%) than the pure HT (~64%) or the physical mixture (~74%). Furthermore, HTN significantly altered HT permeation (>53%) when compared to pure HT (23%) or the physical mixture (28%). The current study showed that naturosomes are a promising way to improve the solubility in water, bioavailability, and therapeutic effectiveness of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4308077895,"This study examines the causal nexus between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the economic growth of seven (7) regions encompassing 117 countries. A more recent panel dataset over the period 2010-2020 was analysed using the Granger causality approach and panel VAR/block exogeneity test to conduct predictive analysis among the panel series. Wavelet coherence techniques too were adapted in bringing novelty and further justifications to the research in exploring the interaction effects of the variables, which are yet to be popularised in the studied discipline. The empirical results indicate the presence of bi-directional causality between FDI and economic growth globally and in the Asian region. In contrast, the causality is uni-directional in the American region. A non-directional causality was discovered in European, Oceanian, Mediterranean, and African regions, and the findings were consistent with the outcome of the wavelet coherence technique results. The study further classifies the regions into three cross-market categories such as developed, emerging and frontier markets. The results imply no causality for most developed and emerging economies in the regional analysis. Findings also provide insights for governments and policymakers worldwide to formulate policies on directing FDI flows and propositions for a host country to become a more conducive destination for FDI and accelerate economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W4308077912,"Recently, the number of adults with Developmental Disabilities (DD) who live with their parents has increased. This study aims to explore how parents report retrospectively and interpret their experience in the context of self-actualization in the long-term care of a child with a developmental disability. Four forms of parents' experiences emerged from the analysis: ""This child is my whole world""-Total devotion; ""I Can Do Both""-Actualizing personal and familial goals as well as caregiving issues; ""It's a mission, it's a calling, it's a full-time job""-Self-actualization through caregiving; and ""Disability will not stop me""-Emphasizing self-actualization. While prior studies have created a distinct separation between caregiving and self-actualization, the current study focuses on the complex dynamics of lifelong parental caregiving for a child with DD, illustrating the parents' ways of actualizing their life goals in the context of caregiving over the years."
https://openalex.org/W4308099316,"In many practical situations, there is an interest in modeling bounded random variables in the interval (0, 1), such as rates, proportions, and indexes. It is important to provide new continuous models to deal with the uncertainty involved by variables of this type. This paper proposes a new quantile regression model based on an alternative parameterization of the unit Burr XII (UBXII) distribution. For the UBXII distribution and its associated regression, we obtain score functions and observed information matrices. We use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters of the regression model, and conduct a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the performance of its estimates in samples of finite size. Furthermore, we present general diagnostic analysis and model selection techniques for the regression model. We empirically show its importance and flexibility through an application to an actual data set, in which the dropout proportion of Brazilian undergraduate animal sciences courses is analyzed. We use a statistical learning method for comparing the proposed model with the beta, Kumaraswamy, and unit-Weibull regressions. The results show that the UBXII regression provides the best fit and the most accurate predictions. Therefore, it is a valuable alternative and competitive to the well-known regressions for modeling double-bounded variables in the unit interval."
https://openalex.org/W4308045214,"Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) primarily affects the pediatric population, which is highly colonized by S . aureus . However, little is known about the genetic features of this microorganism and other staphylococcal species that colonize AD patients. Objective This study aimed to characterize Staphylococcus spp. isolated from the nares and skin (with and without lesion) of 30 AD and 12 non-AD Brazilian children. Methods Skin and nasal swabs were cultured onto mannitol salt agar, and bacterial colonies were counted and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by phenotypic and genotypic tests. In S . aureus isolates, Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes were detected by PCR, and their clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Results S . aureus was more prevalent in the nares ( P = 0.005) and lesional skin ( P = 0.0002) of children with AD, while S . hominis was more frequent in the skin of non-AD children ( P &lt; 0.0001). All children in the study, except one from each group, were colonized by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and 24% by methicillin-resistant S . aureus . Despite the great clonal diversity of S . aureus (18 sequence types identified), most AD children (74.1%) were colonized by the same genotype in both niches. Conclusion High colonization by polyclonal S . aureus isolates was found among children with AD, while S . hominis was more frequent among non-AD children. The high prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates highlights the importance of continued surveillance, especially when considering empiric antibiotic therapy for the treatment of skin infections in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4308067805,"Understanding the national burden and epidemiological profile of childhood malnutrition is central to achieving both national and global health priorities. However, national estimates of malnutrition often conceal large geographical disparities. This study examined the prevalence of childhood malnutrition across provinces in Zambia, changes over time, and identified factors associated with the changes.We analyzed data from the 2013/4 and 2018 Zambia demographic and health surveys (ZDHS) to examine the spatial heterogeneity and mesoscale correlates of the dual burden of malnutrition in children in Zambia. Maps illustrating the provincial variation of childhood malnutrition were constructed. Socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with childhood malnutrition in 2013 and 2018 were assessed independently using a multivariate logistic model.Between 2013/4 and 2018, the average prevalence of stunting decreased from 40.1% (95% CI: 39.2-40.9) to 34.6% (95% CI:33.6-35.5), wasting decreased from 6.0% (95% CI: 5.6-6.5) to 4.2% (95% CI: 3.8-4.7), underweight decreased from 14.8% (95% CI: 14.1-15.4) to 11.8% (95% CI: 11.2-12.5) and overweight decreased from 5.7% (95% CI: 5.3-6.2) to 5.2% (95% CI: 4.8-5.7). High variability in the prevalence of childhood malnutrition across the provinces were observed. Specifically, stunting and underweight in Northern and Luapula provinces were observed in 2013/14, whereas Lusaka province had a higher degree of variability over the two survey periods.The study points to key sub-populations at greater risk and provinces where malnutrition was prevalent in Zambia. Overall, these results have important implications for nutrition policy and program efforts to reduce the double burden of malnutrition in Zambia."
https://openalex.org/W4308067855,"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can improve autonomic nerve function and is currently undergoing extensive clinical research; however, its efficacy heterogeneity has caused great controversy. Heart rate variability (HRV), a biomarker reflecting autonomic function, exhibits a time-varying pattern with circadian rhythms, which may be the main reason for the inconsistent stimulation effects. To test this conjecture, we performed isochronous acute stimulation experiments at intervals of 12 h. The results showed that HRV indicators representing vagal nerve activity significantly increased when stimulation was performed in the morning, and the enhancement of high frequency continued into the recovery period. However, the evening stimulation did not yield similar results. In addition, we found that improvements in the measures of autonomic balance were more pronounced in the presence of lower vagal activity. By increasing the stimulation duration, we also found that the effect of taVNS on HRV was not regulated by duration; in other words, HRV changes only had the best effect at the beginning of stimulation. These studies allowed us to determine the optimal stimulation phase and duration and potentially screen the optimal candidates for taVNS."
https://openalex.org/W4308077839,"Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies; however, optimal diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis remains challenging. We used the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown policy as a natural experiment to explore potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment of acute appendicitis in Thailand. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment of acute appendicitis in Thailand by examining service utilization before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown policy.A secondary data analysis of patients admitted with acute appendicitis under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) in Thailand over a 6-year period between 2016 and 2021 was conducted. The trend of acute appendicitis was plotted using a 14-day rolling average of daily cases. Patient characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes were descriptively presented and compared among three study periods, namely pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-lockdown.The number of overall acute appendicitis cases decreased from 25,407 during pre-pandemic to 22,006 during lockdown (13.4% reduction) and 21,245 during post-lockdown (16.4% reduction). This reduction was mostly due to a lower incidence of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, whereas cases of generalized peritonitis were scarcely affected by the pandemic. There was an increasing trend towards the usage of diagnostic computerized tomography for acute appendicitis but no significant difference in treatment modalities and complication rates.The stable rates of generalized peritonitis and complications during the COVID-19 lockdown, despite fewer admissions overall, suggest that there may have been overdiagnosis and overtreatment of acute appendicitis in Thailand. Policy makers could use these findings to improve clinical practice for acute appendicitis in Thailand and support the efficient utilization of surgical services in the future, especially during pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4308077913,"Urban malaria is becoming a major public health concern in major cities in Cameroon. To improve malaria vector control, a pilot larviciding trial was conducted to assess its impact on mosquito density and malaria transmission intensity in Yaoundé. The present study investigated perceptions and practices of communities on malaria control during the larviciding trial implemented in Yaoundé.Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in non-intervention and intervention areas. Quantitative data were collected during three cross-sectional surveys using a structured pre-tested questionnaire while qualitative data were obtained through interviews. A total of 26 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions with community members were performed. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the perception of the community on larviciding impact on some malaria or bed nets use indicators.People living in intervention areas were 2.64 times more likely to know the mode of malaria transmission (95% CI: 1.82-3.84; p<0.001) and 1.3 time more likely to know mosquito breeding habitats (95% CI: 1.06-1.56; p = 0.009) compared to those living in non-intervention areas. In intervention areas, interviewee opinions on larviciding were generally good i.e. most interviewees reported having noticed a reduction in mosquito nuisance and malaria cases following larviciding implementation; whereas in non-intervention areas no report of reduction of mosquito nuisance was recorded. LLINs were regularly used by the population despite the implementation of larviciding treatments. There was high interest in larviciding program and demand for continuation, even if this needs the community involvement.The larviciding program in the city of Yaoundé did not negatively affected community members' behaviour and practices concerning the use of treated nets. The study indicated the acceptance of larviciding program by the population. This positive environment could favour the implementation of future antilarval control activities in the city of Yaoundé."
https://openalex.org/W4308077972,"The successful occupation of the eastern Eurasian Steppe in the Late Pleistocene improved cultural connections between western Eurasia and East Asia. We document multiple waves of lithic technological transmission between the eastern Eurasian Steppe and northern China during 50–11 cal. ka BP. These waves are apparent in the sequential appearance of three techno-complexes in northern China: (1) the Mousterian techno-complex, (2) the blade techno-complex mixed with Mousterian elements, (3) and the microlithized blade techno-complex. These lithic techno-complexes were transmitted under different paleoenvironmental conditions along different pathways through the eastern Eurasian Steppe. The Mousterian techno-complex and the blade techno-complex mixed with Mousterian elements were only dispersed in the north and west peripheries of northern China (50–33 cal. ka BP). We argue that these techno-complexes failed to penetrate into the hinterland of northern China because they were not well suited to local geographical conditions. In contrast, the microlithized blade technology which diffused from the eastern Eurasian Steppe was locally modified into a Microblade techno-complex which was highly suited to local environmental conditions, and proliferated across the hinterland of northern China (28/27-11 cal. ka BP). The subsequent spread of microblade technology over vast regions of Mongolia and Siberia indicates that the Pleistocene inhabitants of northern China not only adopted and modified technologies from their neighbors in the Eurasian Steppe, but these modified variants were subsequently transmitted back into the Eurasian Steppe. These episodes of technological transmission indicate complicated patterns of population dispersal and technological interaction across northern China and the eastern Eurasian Steppe."
https://openalex.org/W4308098919,"Background and objective Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lower airways, and COPD patients show two to five times higher risk of lung cancer than smokers with normal lung function. COPD is associated with increased oxidative stress, which may cause DNA damage and lung carcinogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate DNA damage and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status) and their relationship in patients with COPD with and without lung cancer. Methods We evaluated 18 patients with COPD, 18 with COPD with lung cancer, and 18 controls (former or current smokers). DNA damage was evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes using a comet assay; the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrophilic antioxidant performance (HAP) were measured in the plasma. Results DNA damage was higher in patients with COPD with cancer than in the controls (p = 0.003). HAP was significantly lower in patients with COPD with cancer than in those without cancer and controls. The presence of lung cancer and COPD showed a positive association with DNA strand breaks and the concentration of MDA. Conclusion COPD with lung cancer was associated with elevated DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes, and cancer and COPD showed a positive correlation with DNA damage. The antioxidant capacity showed a negative association with the interaction COPD and cancer and presence of COPD. The mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of lung cancer in COPD are unknown; DNA damage may be involved. Further research may provide insights into their development and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4308098924,"The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) needs to be improved. We investigated if hippocampal subfield volume measured by structural imaging, could supply information, so that the diagnosis of AD could be improved. In this study, subjects were classified based on clinical, neuropsychological, and amyloid positivity or negativity using PET scans. Data from 478 elderly Korean subjects grouped as cognitively unimpaired β-amyloid-negative (NC), cognitively unimpaired β-amyloid-positive (aAD), mild cognitively impaired β-amyloid-positive (pAD), mild cognitively impaired—specific variations not due to dementia β-amyloid-negative (CIND), severe cognitive impairment β-amyloid-positive (ADD+) and severe cognitive impairment β-amyloid-negative (ADD-) were used. NC and aAD groups did not show significant volume differences in any subfields. The CIND did not show significant volume differences when compared with either the NC or the aAD (except L-HATA). However, pAD showed significant volume differences in Sub, PrS, ML, Tail, GCMLDG, CA1, CA4, HATA, and CA3 when compared with the NC and aAD. The pAD group also showed significant differences in the hippocampal tail, CA1, CA4, molecular layer, granule cells/molecular layer/dentate gyrus, and CA3 when compared with the CIND group. The ADD- group had significantly larger volumes than the ADD+ group in the bilateral tail, SUB, PrS, and left ML. The results suggest that early amyloid depositions in cognitive normal stages are not accompanied by significant bilateral subfield volume atrophy. There might be intense and accelerated subfield volume atrophy in the later stages associated with the cognitive impairment in the pAD stage, which subsequently could drive the progression to AD dementia. Early subfield volume atrophy associated with the β-amyloid burden may be characterized by more symmetrical atrophy in CA regions than in other subfields. We conclude that the hippocampal subfield volumetric differences from structural imaging show promise for improving the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W4308099073,"Copernicia prunifera (Miller) H. E. Moore is a palm tree native to Brazil. The products obtained from its leaf extracts are a source of income for local families and the agroindustry. Owing to the reduction of natural habitats and the absence of a sustainable management plan, the maintenance of the natural populations of this palm tree has been compromised. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of 14 C . prunifera populations using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to provide information that contributes to the conservation of this species. A total of 1,013 SNP markers were identified, of which 84 loci showed outlier behavior and may reflect responses to natural selection. Overall, the level of genomic diversity was compatible with the biological aspects of this species. The inbreeding coefficient ( f ) was negative for all populations, indicating excess heterozygotes. Most genetic variations occurred within populations (77.26%), and a positive correlation existed between genetic and geographic distances. The population structure evaluated through discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed low genetic differentiation between populations. The results highlight the need for efforts to conserve C . prunifera as well as its distribution range to preserve its global genetic diversity and evolutionary potential."

In this retrospective single-centre study in patients hospitalized due to suicidal poisoning in a specialized clinical toxicology unit, we aimed to identify predictive factors associated with severe or fatal course of self-poisoning. All patients underwent at least one psychiatric exploration during their inpatient stay. Severity of poisoning was assessed on admission and after 24 hours according to the Poison Severity Score index (PSS). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to test the association of PSS with sociodemographic, anamnestic and (pre-)clinical parameters. Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive factors for severe and/or fatal self-poisoning. 1090 patients were included in the study. Median age was 39 years (range 13–91), 66.7% of patients were female. PSS was classified in the majority as “minor” (n = 558, 51.2%) or “moderate” (n = 264, 24.2%). 61 patients (5.6%) had PSS “severe”; 14 patients (1.3%) died. A higher severity of poisoning positively correlated with duration of inpatient therapy (p&lt;0.001, Spearman’s rho = 0.454) and duration of ventilation (p&lt;0.001, rho = 0.474), and it inversely correlated with initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p&lt;0.001, rho = -0.437). Multivariable analysis identified no alcohol co-ingestion (OR 3.23; 95%CI 1.3, 8.07; p = 0.012) and self-poisoning with non-medicinal substances (OR 5.4; 95%CI 1.78, 16.34; p = 0.003) as factors predictive for “severe” or “fatal” suicide outcome. In contrast, female gender (OR 0.4; 95%CI 0.2, 0.81; p = 0.011), not using an antidepressant as the method for self-poisoning (OR 0.27; 95%CI 0.12, 0.59; p = 0.001) and a higher initial GCS score (OR 0.79; 95%CI 0.73, 0.85; p&lt;0.001) reduced the risk of a severe or fatal course of self-poisoning. The conclusion for clinical practice is that male patients hospitalized due to self-poisoning, with a low initial GCS score, who did not co-ingest alcohol, attempted suicide with non-pharmaceutical substances or antidepressants are at a higher risk of severe/fatal outcome of suicide. Determination of these risk factors at admission could be potentially used to guide treatment intensification in patients hospitalized due to deliberate self-poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W4308101980,"Systemic glucose levels can be modulated with specific solar wavelengths that influence mitochondrial metabolism. Mitochondrial respiration can be modulated using light that shifts ATP production with exceptional conservation of effect across species, from insects to humans. Known wavelengths have opposing effects of photobiomodulation, with longer wavelengths (660–900 nm red/infrared) increasing ATP production, and 420 nm (blue) light suppressing metabolism. Increasing mitochondrial respiration should result in a greater demand for glucose, and a decrease should result in a reduced demand for glucose. Here we have tested the hypothesis that these wavelengths alter circulating glucose concentration. We first established an oral glucose tolerance test curve in a bumblebee model, which showed sustained increase in systemic glucose beyond that seen in mammals, with a gradual normalisation over eight hours. This extended period of increased systemic glucose provided a stable model for glucose manipulation. Bees were starved overnight and given a glucose load in the morning. In the first group glucose levels were examined at hourly intervals. In the second group, bees were additionally exposed to either 670 nm or 420 nm light and their blood glucose examined. Increasing mitochondrial activity with 670 nm light at the peak of circulating glucose, resulted in a significant 50% reduction in concentration measured. Exposure to 420nm light that retards mitochondrial respiration elevated systemic glucose levels by over 50%. The impact of 670 nm and 420 nm on mitochondria is highly conserved. Hence, different wavelengths of visible light may be used to modulate systemic metabolism bidirectionally and may prove an effective agent in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4308045204,"Physical education (PE) teachers and strength and conditioning (S&C) coaches are well placed to develop motor competence within youth populations. However, both groups' perceptions of important motor competencies are relatively unknown, especially when considering stage of maturity. Therefore, this study aimed to 1) present PE teachers and S&C coaches' perceptions of motor competence importance according to stage of maturity; 2) compare perceptions of motor competence between stages of maturity, and between PE teachers and S&C coaches; and 3) explore factors that influence PE teachers and S&C coaches' perceptions of motor competence importance. Via a mixed-method questionnaire, 47 PE teachers (professional experience = 10.3±6.6 years) and 48 S&C coaches (professional experience = 8.6±4.8 years) rated the importance of developing 21 motor competencies across four stages of maturity (childhood, pre-peak height velocity [PHV], circa-PHV, and post-PHV) using a Likert-scale (1 = not important, 5 = very important). Participants also provided open-ended explanations for their perceptions. Frequency analysis indicated that participants rated a broad range of competencies important, with S&C coaches rating more competencies important than PE teachers across all stages of maturity. Mixed-model analysis highlighted several differences in motor competence importance when comparing perceptions between participant groups, and between stages of maturity for PE teachers and S&C coaches. For example, S&C coaches rated strength-based motor competencies less important during childhood (d = -1.83 to -0.43), while PE teachers rated them less important during childhood (d = -2.22 to -0.42) and pre-PHV (d = -1.70 to -0.51) compared to other stages of maturity. Codebook thematic analysis showed several factors that influenced participant's perceptions of motor competence importance (e.g., participants understanding of themselves). The findings suggest that multiple environments may be required to adequately facilitate motor competence development amongst youth. Coach education should target misunderstandings around the risks of strength-based activity during early stages of maturity and the benefits of developing strength-based motor competencies across youth populations."
https://openalex.org/W4308045316,"MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) is the most commonly used tool to identify motifs within deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein sequences. However, the results generated by the MEMEare saved using file formats . xml and . txt , which are difficult to read, visualize, or integrate with other widely used phylogenetic tree packages, such as ggtree . To overcome this problem, we developed the ggmotif R package, which provides two easy-to-use functions that can facilitate the extraction and visualization of motifs from the results files generated by the MEME. ggmotif can extract the information of the location of motif(s) on the corresponding sequence(s) from the . xml format file and visualize it. Additionally, the data extracted by ggmotif can be easily integrated with the phylogenetic data. On the other hand, ggmotif can obtain the sequence of each motif from the . txt format file and draw the sequence logo with the function ggseqlogo from the ggseqlogo R package. The ggmotif R package is freely available (including examples and vignettes) from GitHub at https://github.com/lixiang117423/ggmotif or from CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggmotif ."
https://openalex.org/W4308067702,"The displacement damage dose (DDD) is a common index used to predict the life of semiconductor devices employed in space-based environments where they will be exposed to radiation. The DDD is commonly estimated from the non-ionizing energy loss based on the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) model, although a new definition for a so-called effective DDD considers the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation with the amorphization in semiconductors. The present work developed a new model for calculating the conventional and effective DDD values for silicon carbide (SiC), indium arsenide (InAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors. This model was obtained by extending the displacement per atom tally implemented in the particle and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS). This new approach suggests that the effective DDD is higher than the conventional DDD for arsenic-based compounds due to the amorphization resulting from direct impacts, while this relationship is reversed for SiC because of recombination defects. In the case of SiC and GaN exposed to protons, the effective DDD/conventional DDD ratio decreases with proton energy. In contrast, for InAs and GaAs, this ratio increases to greater than 1 at proton energies up to 100 MeV and plateaus because the defect production efficiency, which is the ratio of the number of stable displacements at the end of collision cascade simulated by MD simulations to the number of defects calculated by NRT model, does not increase at damage energy values above 20 keV. The practical application of this model was demonstrated by calculating the effective DDD values for semiconductors sandwiched between a thin glass cover and an aluminum plate in a low-Earth orbit. The results indicated that the effective DDD could be dramatically reduced by increasing the glass cover thickness to 200 μm, thus confirming the importance of shielding semiconductor devices used in space. This improved PHITS technique is expected to assist in the design of semiconductors by allowing the effective DDD values for various semiconductors having complex geometries to be predicted in cosmic ray environments."
https://openalex.org/W4308077838,"Presently, coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide without an effective treatment method. For COVID-19, which is often asymptomatic, it is essential to adopt a method that does not cause aggravation, as well as a method to prevent infection. Whether aggravation can be predicted by analyzing the extent of lung damage on chest computed tomography (CT) scans was examined. The extent of lung damage on pre-intubation chest CT scans of 277 patients with COVID-19 was assessed. It was observed that aggravation occurred when the CT scan showed extensive damage associated with ground-glass opacification and/or consolidation (p < 0.0001). The extent of lung damage was similar across the upper, middle, and lower fields. Furthermore, upon comparing the extent of lung damage based on the number of days after onset, a significant difference was found between the severe pneumonia group (SPG) with intubation or those who died and non-severe pneumonia group (NSPG) ≥3 days after onset, with aggravation observed when ≥14.5% of the lungs exhibited damage at 3-5 days (sensitivity: 88.2%, specificity: 72.4%) and when ≥20.1% of the lungs exhibited damage at 6-8 days (sensitivity: 88.2%, specificity: 69.4%). Patients with aggravation suddenly developed hypoxemia after 7 days from the onset; however, chest CT scans obtained in the paucisymptomatic phase without hypoxemia indicated that subsequent aggravation could be predicted based on the degree of lung damage. Furthermore, in subjects aged ≥65 years, a significant difference between the SPG and NSPG was observed in the extent of lung damage early beginning from 3 days after onset, and it was found that the degree of lung damage could serve as a predictor of aggravation. Therefore, to predict and improve prognosis through rapid and appropriate management, evaluating patients with factors indicating poor prognosis using chest CT is essential."
https://openalex.org/W4308098983,"Despite evidence of their importance to marine ecosystems, at least 32% of all chondrichthyan species are estimated or assessed as threatened with extinction. In addition to the logistical difficulties of effectively conserving wide-ranging marine species, shark conservation is believed to have been hindered in the past by public perceptions of sharks as dangerous to humans. Shark Week is a high-profile, international programming event that has potentially enormous influence on public perceptions of sharks, shark research, shark researchers, and shark conservation. However, Shark Week has received regular criticism for poor factual accuracy, fearmongering, bias, and inaccurate representations of science and scientists. This research analyzes the content and titles of Shark Week episodes across its entire 32 years of programming to determine if there are trends in species covered, research techniques featured, expert identity, conservation messaging, type of programming, and portrayal of sharks. We analyzed titles from 272 episodes (100%) of Shark Week programming and the content of all available (201; 73.9%) episodes. Our data demonstrate that the majority of episodes are not focused on shark bites, although such shows are common and many Shark Week programs frame sharks around fear, risk, and adrenaline. While criticisms of disproportionate attention to particular charismatic species (e.g. great whites, bull sharks, and tiger sharks) are accurate and supported by data, 79 shark species have been featured briefly at least once. Shark Week’s depictions of research and of experts are biased towards a small set of (typically visual and expensive) research methodologies and (mostly white, mostly male) experts, including presentation of many white male non-scientists as scientific experts. While sharks are more often portrayed negatively than positively, limited conservation messaging does appear in 53% of episodes analyzed. Results suggest that as a whole, while Shark Week is likely contributing to the collective public perception of sharks as bad, even relatively small alterations to programming decisions could substantially improve the presentation of sharks and shark science and conservation issues."

We conducted a qualitative monocentric study between May and November 2020. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with infertile women with deep infiltrating endometriosis who achieved a first pregnancy by IVF and delivered at least two years prior to the interview. Data analysis was performed using an inductive approach to identify recurrent categories and themes. Fifteen interviews were conducted to reach data saturation. Pregnancy appeared to improve all components of the experience of endometriosis that were explored (psychological and physical well-being, social relationships, professional life, and sexuality). This improvement was only temporary and all symptoms and negative aspects of the women's quality of life reappeared after a variable period."
https://openalex.org/W4308099057,"An original method for analyzing the influence of the meteorological, as well as physical-geographical conditions on the flooding of stormwater in small urban catchment areas is proposed. A logistical regression model is employed for the identification of the flooding events. The elaborated model enables to simulate the stormwater flooding in a single rainfall event, on the basis of the rainfall depth, duration, imperviousness of the catchment and its spatial distribution within the analyzed area, as well as the density of the stormwater network. The rainfall events are predicted considering the regional convective rainfall model for 32 rain gauges located in Poland, based on 44 years of rainfall data. In the study, empirical models are obtained to calculate the rainfall duration conditioning the flooding of stormwater in a small urban catchment area depending on the characteristics of the examined urban basins. The empirical models enabling to control the urbanization process of catchment areas, accounting for the local rainfall and meteorological characteristics are provided. The paper proposes a methodology for the identification of the areas especially sensitive to stormwater flooding in small urban catchment areas depending to the country scale. By employing the presented methodology, the regions with most sensitive urban catchments are identified. On this basis, a ranking of towns and cities is determined from the most sensitive to flooding in small urban catchment areas to the regions where the risk of flooding is lower. Using the method developed in the paper, maximum impervious catchment area are determined for the selected regions of the country, the exceedance of which determines the occurrence of stormwater flooding."

It aims to maintain weight-bearing and independent ambulation while eliminating the risk of spreading soft tissue infection or gangrene. This study aimed to explore the risk factors and surgical outcomes of TMA in patients with diabetes at an academic tertiary referral center in Jordan. Medical records of all patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent TMA at King Abdullah University Hospital, Jordan, between January 2017 and January 2019 were retrieved. Patient characteristics along with clinical and laboratory findings were analyzed retrospectively. Pearson's chi-square test of association, Student's t-test, and multivariate regression analysis were used to identify and assess the relationships between patient findings and TMA outcome. The study cohort comprised 81 patients with diabetes who underwent TMA. Of these, 41 (50.6%) patients achieved complete healing. Most of the patients were insulin-dependent (85.2%). Approximately half of the patients (45.7%) had severe ankle-brachial index (ABI). Thirty patients (37.1%) had previous revascularization attempts. The presence of peripheral arterial disease (P<0.05) exclusively predicted poor outcomes among the associated comorbidities. Indications for TMA included infection, ischemia, or both. The presence of severe ABI (≤0.4, P<0.01) and a previous revascularization attempt (P<0.05) were associated with unfavorable outcomes of TMA. Multivariate analysis that included all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables in the model revealed that insulin-dependent diabetes, low albumin level (< 33 g/L), high C-reactive protein level (> 150 mg/L), and low score of Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC, <6) were the main factors associated with poor TMA outcomes. TMA is an effective technique for the management of diabetic foot infection or ischemic necrosis. However, attention should be paid to certain important factors such as insulin dependence, serum albumin level, and LRINEC score, which may influence the patient's outcome."

Previous research has employed cellular and molecular techniques to describe hematological and gene expression variation that coincides with BRD development. Here, we utilized weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to leverage total gene expression patterns from cattle at arrival and generate hematological and clinical trait associations to describe mechanisms that may predict BRD development. Gene expression counts of previously published RNA-Seq data from 23 cattle (2017; n = 11 Healthy, n = 12 BRD) were used to construct gene co-expression modules and correlation patterns with complete blood count (CBC) and clinical datasets. Modules were further evaluated for cross-populational preservation of expression with RNA-Seq data from 24 cattle in an independent population (2019; n = 12 Healthy, n = 12 BRD). Genes within well-preserved modules were subject to functional enrichment analysis for significant Gene Ontology terms and pathways. Genes which possessed high module membership and association with BRD development, regardless of module preservation (""hub genes""), were utilized for protein-protein physical interaction network and clustering analyses. Five well-preserved modules of co-expressed genes were identified. One module (""steelblue""), involved in alpha-beta T-cell complexes and Th2-type immunity, possessed significant correlation with increased erythrocytes, platelets, and BRD development. One module (""purple""), involved in mitochondrial metabolism and rRNA maturation, possessed significant correlation with increased eosinophils, fecal egg count per gram, and weight gain over time. Fifty-two interacting hub genes, stratified into 11 clusters, may possess transient function involved in BRD development not previously described in literature. This study identifies co-expressed genes and coordinated mechanisms associated with BRD, which necessitates further investigation in BRD-prediction research."

Seventy-seven episodes of ESBL-UPEC satisfying the inclusion criteria were matched 1:1 with 77 non-ESBL-UPEC for age, gender, and year of culture.The most common ST-type and ESBL gene was ST131 (55%), and blaCTX-M-15 (47%), respectively. Risk factors for ESBL-UPEC were: previous genitourinary invasive procedure (RR 4.66; p = 0.005) or history of ESBL-producing E. coli (RR 12.14; p = 0.024). There was significant difference between ESBL-UPEC and non-ESBL-UPEC regarding time to microbiologically appropriate antibiotic therapy (27:15 h vs. 02:14 h; p = <0.001) and hospital days (9 vs. 5; p = <0.001), but no difference in 30-day mortality (3% vs. 3%; p = >0.999) or sepsis within 36 hours (51% vs. 62%; p = 0.623) was observed.The predominant risk factors for ESBL-UPEC were history of ESBL-Ec infection and history of genitourinary invasive procedure. The overall mortality was low and the delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy did not increase the risk for 30-day mortality or risk for sepsis within 36 hours among patients infected with ESBL UPEC.

Ct-values were obtained from the Maastricht University Medical Centre laboratory. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between COVID-19, symptoms, CFR, and viral load.Of 1,457 staff and 1,540 residents, 35.1% and 45.2% tested positive for COVID-19. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 for female staff were fever, cough, muscle ache and loss of taste and smell. Associated symptoms for men were cough, and loss of taste and smell. Associated symptoms for residents were subfebrility, fatigue, and fever for male residents only. LTCF residents had a higher mean viral load compared to staff. Male residents had a higher CFR (35.8%) compared to women (22.5%). Female residents with Ct-values 31 or less had increased odds of mortality.Subfebrility and fatigue seem to be associated with COVID-19 in LTCF residents. Therefore, physicians should also consider testing residents who (only) show aspecific symptoms whenever available resources prohibit testing of all residents. Viral load was higher in residents compared to staff, and higher in male residents compared to female residents. All COVID-19 positive male residents, as well as female residents with a medium to high viral load (Ct-values 31 or lower) should be monitored closely, as these groups have an overall increased risk of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4308067708,"Background First-time mothers are prone to prolonged labor, defined as the crossing of partograph alert or action lines. Prolonged labor may occur among as many as one out of five women, and is associated with a range of adverse birth outcomes. Oxytocin is the standard treatment for prolonged labor, but has a narrow therapeutic window, several adverse effects and limited efficacy. Despite poor evidence, labor wards often use antispasmodic agents to treat prolonged labor. The antispasmodic drug butylscopolamine bromide (Buscopan ® ) may shorten duration of labor, but studies on prevention of prolonged labor are lacking. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, we aim to evaluate the effect of butylscopolamine bromide on duration of labor in first-time mothers showing first signs of slow labor progress by crossing the World Health Organization partograph alert line. Methods and analysis The study is a single center study at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. We will recruit 250 primiparous women with spontaneous labor start at term. Women are included in the first stage of labor if they show signs of slow labor progress, defined as the crossing of the partograph alert line with a cervical dilation between 3–9 cm. Participants are randomized 1:1 to either 20 mg intravenous butylscopolamine bromide or intravenous placebo (1 mL sodium chlorine 9 mg/mL). We considered a mean difference of 60 minutes in labor duration clinically relevant. The primary outcome is duration of labor from the provision of the investigational medicinal product to vaginal delivery. The secondary outcomes include change in labor pain, use of oxytocin augmentation, delivery mode, and maternal birth experience. The primary data for the statistical analysis will be the full analysis set and will occur on completion of the study as per the prespecified statistical analysis plan. The primary outcome will be analyzed using Weibull regression, and we will treat cesarean delivery as a censoring event."
https://openalex.org/W4308077680,"In this paper, we propose a portmanteau test for whether a graph-structured network dataset without replicates exhibits autocorrelation across units connected by edges. Specifically, the well known Ljung-Box test for serial autocorrelation of time series data is generalized to the network setting using a specially derived central limit theorem for a weakly stationary random field. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation is shown to be chi-squared, yielding a simple and easy-to-implement procedure for testing graph-structured autocorrelation, including spatial and spatial-temporal autocorrelation as special cases. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate and confirm the derived asymptotic results. Convergence is found to occur quickly depending on the number of lags included in the test statistic, and a significant increase in statistical power is also observed relative to some recently proposed permutation tests. An example application is presented by fitting spatial autoregressive models to the distribution of COVID-19 cases across counties in New York state."

The results reveal that embodied emissions of waste gas and solid waste in Guangdong's export trade are increasing, while the increase in wastewater emissions is not apparent. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) is used to analyze the influencing factors of pollution, specifically, the structural, scale, and technical effects. We discovered that emissions of the top five industries account for about 80% of total emissions and the wastewater emissions' technical effect has more impact; however, it is difficult for this technical effect in terms of embodied waste gas and solid waste to offset the scale and structural effects' impacts. Moreover, the trends and factors influencing various industries' pollution emissions differ. This study proposes that when the government carries out environmental pollution control measures, they should consider the embodied pollution caused by products from foreign trade and focus on treating industries with severe pollution. Simultaneously, the pollution controlling measures of different industries should also vary."

This communication pattern corresponds to the worse-case scenario of consensus achievement, even under asynchronous network conditions. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for a network to operate under better conditions, where a consensus can be reached with a lower communication cost. Hence, with the addition of a faster optimistic path toward an agreement, the idea of dual-mode consensus has been proposed as a promising approach to enhance the performance of asynchronous BFT protocols. However, this opportunity is not completely exploited by existing dual-mode protocols as the fast path can be followed only in a nonfaulty and synchronous network. This article presents a novel dual-mode protocol consisting of fast and backup subprotocols. To create different consensus committees for fast and backup-mode operations, the network contains both active and passive nodes. A consensus can be expedited through a fast-mode operation when majority of the active nodes can communicate synchronously. Under non-ideal conditions, the backup protocol takes over the agreement process from its fast-mode counterpart without starting over the suspended round. The safety and liveness of the proposed protocol are guaranteed with lower communication costs, which balance the trade-off between protocol efficiency and availability."
https://openalex.org/W4308098927,"Background External eye infection caused by bacteria can lead to reduced vision and blindness. Therefore, pathogen isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are vital for the prevention and control of ocular diseases. Objective The main aim of this study was to assess bacterial isolates, their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, and associated factors of external ocular infection (EOI) among patients attended eye clinic at Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (DMCSH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with external ocular infections from January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021, at DMCSH. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires. Following standard protocols, external ocular swabs were collected and inoculated onto blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar (MSA). Finally, bacterial isolates were identified by Gram stain, colony morphology, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by using the modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. Cleaned and coded data were entered into EpiData version 4.2 software and exported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 for analysis. Bivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the association between predictors and outcome variables. P- values ≤ 0.05 with 95% confidence interval were considered statistically significant. Results Two hundred seven study participants were enrolled in this study. More than half of them (57.5%, 119/207) were males, and 37.7% (78/207) of them were ≥ 65 years old. A total of 130 (62.8%) bacterial isolates were identified, with Gram-positive bacteria accounting for 78.5% (102/130) of the isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate with a 46.2% (60/130) prevalence. Ciprofloxacin was comparatively effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The prevalence of culture-confirmed bacteria was significantly associated with age groups 15–24 (AOR: 9.18, 95%CI: 1.01–82.80; P = 0.049) and 25–64 (AOR: 7.47, 95%CI: 1.06–52.31; P = 0.043). Being farmer (AOR: 5.33, 95% CI: 1.04–37.33; P = 0.045), previous history of eye surgery (AOR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.66–17.48; P = 0.005), less frequency of face washing (AOR: 5.32, 95% CI: 1.31–7.23; P = 0.010) and face washing once a day (AOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.13–25.13; P = 0.035) were also significantly associated with the prevalence of culture-confirmed bacteria. Conclusion The prevalence of culture-confirmed bacteria among patients with EOI was high in the study area. A considerable proportion of bacterial isolates exhibited mono and/or multi-drug resistance. Age (15–64 years), being farmer, previous history of eye surgery and less frequency of face washing were significantly associated with the prevalence of culture-confirmed bacteria. Bacterial isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing should be routinely performed in the study area to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4308099256,"Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have become increasingly popular biomarker candidates in various diseases. However, heparin-based anticoagulants might affect the detection of target miRNAs in blood samples during quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based analysis of miRNAs involving RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and the polymerase catalyzed reaction. Because low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are widely used in routine healthcare, we aimed to investigate whether a prophylactic dose of the LMWH tinzaparin influences qPCR-based quantification of circulating miRNAs. A total of 30 subjects were included: 16 fracture patients with tinzaparin treatment and 14 non-fracture controls without anticoagulation therapy. To control for the effect of tinzaparin on miRNA analysis an identical concentration of synthetic miRNAs was added to plasma, isolated RNA and prepared complementary DNA (cDNA) from all samples in both groups. No significant difference was observed for cDNA synthesis or qPCR when comparing tinzaparin-treated patients with untreated controls. Among the tinzaparin-treated patients, plasma levels of six endogenous miRNAs (hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-30e-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-133b) were measured before and one to six hours after a subcutaneous injection of tinzaparin 4500IU. No significant effect was observed for any of the investigated miRNAs. A prophylactic dose of 4500IU tinzaparin does not seem to affect cDNA synthesis or qRT-PCR-based quantification of circulating miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4308099315,"Cardiac fibrosis is a common cause of most cardiovascular diseases. Leonurine, an alkaloid from Herba leonuri, had been indicated to treat cardiovascular diseases due to its cardioprotective effects. Recently, pyroptosis, a programmed form of cell death that releases inflammatory factors, has been shown to play an important role in cardiovascular diseases, especially cardiac fibrosis. This study examined the novel mechanism by which leonurine protects against cardiac fibrosis. In rats with isoprenaline-induced cardiac fibrosis, leonurine inhibited the expression of proteins related to pyroptosis and improved cardiac fibrosis. In vitro, leonurine inhibited the expression of proteins related to pyroptosis and fibrosis. Additionally, leonurine regulated the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway and inhibited pyroptosis to protect cardiomyocytes and improve cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, leonurine might improve cardiac fibrosis induced by isoprenaline by inhibiting pyroptosis via the TGF-β/Smad2 signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4308099322,"Very little is known about the role of early interactions in the development of peer relationships among toddlers. The present study examined whether behaviors early in the formation of toddler relationships predict interactions later in their relationships. Twenty-eight unfamiliar 20- and 30-month-old toddlers from a predominately European background met separately with each of two other toddlers for 18 playdates. Both positive and negative behaviors at the beginning of the relationship predicted a higher frequency of games later in the relationship. Positive behaviors at the beginning of the relationship predicted fewer conflicts later in the relationship. Negative behaviors at the beginning predicted more conflicts later in the relationship. These findings suggest that toddlers' behaviors, when they initially meet, underlie the pathway in which their relationship develops."
https://openalex.org/W4308099325,"Background Higher postoperative mortality has been observed among patients who received emergency colorectal surgery on the weekend compared to during the week. The aim of this study was to determine whether the weekday of emergency surgery affects the 30-day mortality and postoperative course in emergency colorectal surgery. Methods Prospectively acquired data from the 2010–2017 German StuDoQ|Colorectal surgery registries were analysed. Differences in 30-day mortality, transfer and length of stay (MTL30) (primary endpoints), postoperative complications, length of stay and pathological results of resected specimens (secondary endpoints) were assessed. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative outcome. Results In total, 1,174 patients were included in the analysis. Major postoperative complications and the need for reoperation were observed more frequently for emergency colorectal surgery performed during the week compared to the weekend (23.01 vs. 15.28%, p = 0.036 and 17.96% vs. 11.11%, p = 0.040, respectively). In contrast, patients who received emergency surgery on the weekend presented with significantly higher UICC tumour stages (UICC III 44.06 vs. 34.15%, p = 0.020) compared to patients with emergency colorectal surgery on a weekday. Emergency surgery performed during the week was an independent risk factor for the development of severe postoperative complications (OR 1.69 [1.04–2.74], p = 0.033) and need for reoperation (OR 1.79 [1.02–3.05], p = 0.041) in the multivariable analysis. Conclusion Emergency surgery for colorectal carcinoma in Germany is performed with equal postoperative MTL30 and mortality throughout the entire week. However, emergency surgery during the week seems to be associated with a higher rate of severe postoperative complications and reoperation."
https://openalex.org/W4308099571,"Contrast enhanced ultrasound is a powerful diagnostic tool and ultrasound contrast media are based on microbubbles (MBs). The use of MBs in drug delivery applications and molecular imaging is a relatively new field of research which has gained significant interest during the last decade. MBs available for clinical use are fragile with short circulation half-lives due to the use of a thin encapsulating shell for stabilization of the gas core. Thick-shelled MBs can have improved circulation half-lives, incorporate larger amounts of drugs for enhanced drug delivery or facilitate targeting for use in molecular ultrasound imaging. However, methods for robust imaging of thick-shelled MBs are currently not available. We propose a simple multi-pulse imaging technique which is able to visualize thick-shelled polymeric MBs with a superior contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) compared to commercially available harmonic techniques. The method is implemented on a high-end ultrasound scanner and in-vitro imaging in a tissue mimicking flow phantom results in a CTR of up to 23 dB. A proof-of-concept study of molecular ultrasound imaging in a soft tissue inflammation model in rabbit is then presented where the new imaging technique showed an enhanced accumulation of targeted MBs in the inflamed tissue region compared to non-targeted MBs and a mean CTR of 13.3 dB for stationary MBs. The presence of fluorescently labelled MBs was verified by confocal microscopy imaging of tissue sections post-mortem."
https://openalex.org/W4308099601,"Background Connective tissue links the skeletal muscles, creating a body-wide network of continuity. A recent in-vivo experiment demonstrated that passive elongation of the calf caused a caudal displacement of the semimembranosus muscle, indicating force transmission across the dorsal knee joint. However, it remains unclear as to whether this observation is dependent on the joint angle. If force would not be transmitted at flexed knees, this would reduce the number of postures and movements where force transmission is of relevance. Our trial, therefore, aims to investigate the influence of passive calf stretching with the knee in extended and flexed position on dorsal thigh soft tissue displacement. Methods Participants are positioned prone on an isokinetic dynamometer. The device performs three repetitions of moving the ankle passively (5°/s) between plantar flexion and maximum dorsiflexion. With a washout-period of 24 hours, this procedure is performed twice in randomised order, once with the knee extended (0°) and once with the knee flexed (60°). Two high-resolution ultrasound devices will be used to visualize the soft tissue of the calf and dorsal thigh during the manoeuvre. Maximal horizontal displacement of the soft tissue [mm] during ankle movement will be quantified as a surrogate of force transmission, using a frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis of the obtained US videos. Discussion Understanding myofascial force transmission under in-vivo conditions is a pre-requisite for the development of exercise interventions specifically targeting the fascial connective tissue. Our study may thus provide health and fitness professional with the anatomical and functional basis for program design.

https://openalex.org/W4308099709,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led nucleic acid collection and detection became a measure to ensure normal life in China. Considering the huge detection demand, it has emerged that robots replace manual sample collection. However, the cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid collection by robots instead of humans remain unknown. Methods This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shenzhen Luohu District People’s Hospital, number 2021-LHQRMYY-KYLL-031a. All participants signed the written informed consent of this study. 273 volunteers were recruited on December 1 st 2021 from Shenzhen and divided into six groups: one group to be sampled by robots and the others to be sampled manually with varying specifications for swab rotation and insertion time. Questionnaires were distributed to the robot group to ask them sampling feeling. The effectiveness and safety of sampling were evaluated through the sampling efficiency, adverse events and sampling feeling of different groups. The economics of the different methods were judged by comparing the sampling cost for each. Results The sampling efficiency of the robot group was 96.9%, and there was no statistically significant difference between the other five manually sampled groups (p = 0.586). There were no serious adverse events in any of the six groups, but nasal soreness and tearing did occur in all group. Of the volunteers who underwent robotic sampling, 85.94% reported that the experience was either no different or more comfortable than the manual sampling. In economic terms, a single robot used to replace medical staff for sample collection becomes economically advantageous when the working time is ≥ 455 days. If multiple robots are used to replace twice the number of manual collections, it becomes more economical at 137 days and remains so as long as the robot is used. Conclusions It appears safe and effective for robots to replace manual sampling method. Implementation of robotic sampling is economical and feasible, and can significantly save costs when working over a long term."
https://openalex.org/W4308099805,"To determine the expression profile of microRNAs in the peripheral blood of pregnant women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) compared to that of healthy pregnant women.This was a pilot study with case-control design in pregnant patients enrolled between January 2017 and June 2019. Patients with healthy pregnancies and those affected by PPROM between 20- and 33+6 weeks of gestation were matched by gestational age and selected for inclusion to the study. Patients were excluded for multiple gestation and presence of a major obstetrical complication such as preeclampsia, diabetes, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. A total of ten (n = 10) controls and ten (n = 10) patients with PPROM were enrolled in the study. Specimens were obtained before administration of betamethasone or intravenous antibiotics. MicroRNA expression was analyzed for 800 microRNAs in each sample using the NanoString nCounter Expression Assay. Differential expression was calculated after normalization and log2- transformation using the false discovery rate (FDR) method at an alpha level of 5%.Demographic characteristics were similar between the two groups. Of the 800 miRNAs analyzed, 116 were differentially expressed after normalization. However, only four reached FDR-adjusted statistical significance. Pregnancies affected by PPROM were characterized by upregulation of miR-199a-5p, miR-130a-3p and miR-26a-5p and downregulation of miR-513b-5p (FDR adjusted p-values <0.05). The differentially expressed microRNAs participate in pathways associated with altered collagen and matrix metalloprotease expression in the extracellular matrix.Patients with PPROM have a distinct peripheral blood microRNA profile compared to healthy pregnancies as measured by the NanoString Expression Assay."
https://openalex.org/W4308101914,"Background Fear of childbirth (FoB) and depressive symptoms (DS) are experienced by many women and can negatively affect women during and after pregnancy. This study assessed patterns of FoB and DS over time and associations of postpartum FoB and DS with sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study at six health facilities in Tanzania in 2018–2019. Pregnant women were consecutively assessed for FoB and DS before and after childbirth using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire versions A &amp; B and the Edinburgh antenatal and postnatal depressive scale. This paper is based on 625 women who completed participation. Results The prevalence rates of FoB and DS during pregnancy were 16% and 18.2%, respectively, and after childbirth, 13.9% and 8.5%. Some had FoB (6.4%) and DS (4.3%) at both timepoints. FoB was strongly associated with DS at both timepoints (p &lt; 0.001). Both FoB (p = 0.246) and DS (p &lt; 0.001) decreased after childbirth. Never having experienced obstetric complications decreased the odds of postpartum and persisting FoB (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23–0.83). Giving birth by caesarean section (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.11–3.65) and having more than 12 hours pass between admission and childbirth increased the odds of postpartum FoB (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.03–4.16). Postpartum DS was more common in women with an ill child/stillbirth/early neonatal death (aOR 4.78, 95% CI 2.29–9.95). Persisting DS was more common in single (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.02–6.59) and women without social support from parents (aOR 0.28, 95% 0.11–0.69). Conclusions FoB and DS coexist and decrease over time. Identifying predictors of both conditions will aid in recognising women at risk and planning for prevention and treatment. Screening for FoB and DS before and after childbirth and offering psychological support should be considered part of routine antenatal and postnatal care. Furthermore, supporting women with previous obstetric complications is crucial. Using interviews instead of a self-administered approach might have contributed to social desirability. Also, excluding women with previous caesarean sections could underestimate FoB and DS prevalence rates."
