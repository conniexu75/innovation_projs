https://openalex.org/W2170397537,"Animal groups on the move can take different configurations. For example, groups of fish can either be ‘shoals’ or ‘schools’: shoals are simply aggregations of individuals; schools are shoals exhibiting polarized, synchronized motion. Here we demonstrate that polarization distributions of groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are bimodal, showing two distinct modes of collective motion corresponding to the definitions of shoaling and schooling. Other features of the group's motion also vary consistently between the two modes: zebrafish schools are faster and less dense than zebrafish shoals. Habituation to an environment can also alter the proportion of time zebrafish groups spend schooling or shoaling. Models of collective motion suggest that the degree and stability of group polarization increases with the group's density. Examining zebrafish groups of different sizes from 5 to 50, we show that larger groups are less polarized than smaller groups. Decreased fearfulness in larger groups may function similarly to habituation, causing them to spend more time shoaling than schooling, contrary to most models' predictions."

Results: Interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 signaling lead to different durations of STAT3 activation and consequently distinct responses. Conclusion: The duration of receptor and STAT3 activation determines the specific cytokine response. Significance: This work reveals a signaling coding mechanism that relieves a cellular information bottleneck. Cytokines are small, secreted peptides that play a key role in regulating and directing the immune response. Individual cells receive many different cytokine stimuli that each yield specific cellular responses, yet there are relatively few signaling pathways available to process the myriad inputs and produce the appropriate output responses. Cases in which different cytokines regulate the same signaling molecule but differ in their effects illustrate the limitation of the current understanding of the mechanism of action of cytokines and other extracellular stimuli. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) both regulate the same signaling molecule, STAT3, yet generate different cellular responses. IL-6 is primarily a pro-inflammatory cytokine, whereas IL-10 generates a strong anti-inflammatory response. IL-6 and IL-10 each bind to their cognate receptor, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and a cytokine-specific gene activation pattern. Aberrant IL-6 and IL-10 signaling has been implicated in a wide range of inflammatory diseases (1Ishihara K. Hirano T.

Paralleling its discordant role in mediating IL-6 and IL-10 responses, STAT3 has been considered both an important pro-inflammatory regulator of the tumor microenvironment (7Bollrath J.

Explaining how activation of the same signaling molecule can paradoxically be both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory is important for clarifying the mechanism of STAT3-related malignancies and immunological diseases and facilitating therapeutic drug discovery in this area. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) 2The abbreviations used are: DCdendritic cellIL10RαIL-10 receptor αIP-10interferon gamma-induced protein 10. were obtained from anonymized healthy human blood donors (New York Blood Center) using a standard Ficoll density centrifugation, immunomagnetic purification, and differentiation protocol described elsewhere (11Fernandez-Sesma A.

DCs were generated as described above and treated with 10 ng/ml hIL-6 (Peprotech), 10 ng/ml hIL-10 (Peprotech), and/or 100 ng/ml LPS from Salmonella minnesota (InvivoGen). Following treatment, cells were used for flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, or microarray analysis. Supernatants were used for ELISA or Luminex analysis. An effective inhibitory concentration for anti-IL10Rα monoclonal antibodies (R&D Systems) was determined by treating cells with 10 ng/ml IL-10 and 0, 0.8, 1.6, 4, or 8 μg/ml anti-IL10Rα monoclonal antibodies and measuring STAT3 phosphorylation by flow cytometry. To truncate STAT3 activation following IL-10 stimulation, DCs were treated with 4–5 μg/ml anti-IL10Rα monoclonal antibodies (depending on the lot) 30 min after initiation of IL-10 stimulation. To control for nonspecific effects of antibody treatment, DCs were treated with an equivalent concentration of mouse IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems) antibodies 30 min after initiation of IL-10 stimulation. STAT3 phosphorylation was measured by flow cytometry. Cells were fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), washed with FACSFlow sheath buffer (BD Biosciences), permeabilized with 100% cold methanol (Fisher Scientific), washed with FACS staining buffer (BD Biosciences), and stained with mAbs for Tyr(P)705-STAT3 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (BD Biosciences). For high resolution analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation dynamics (and for the untreated barcoding setup and control set), cells were fluorescently barcoded to increase throughput, as described previously (12Krutzik P.O. Nolan G.P. Fluorescent cell barcoding in flow cytometry allows high-throughput drug screening and signaling profiling.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed, washed, and then permeabilized in methanol containing different combinations of 0, 6.25, or 100 ng/ml Alexa Fluor 350-NHS and 0, 6.25, or 100 ng/ml Alexa Fluor 750-NHS (Invitrogen), washed with FACS staining buffer, and then stained with mAbs. Single-color fluorescence compensation control samples were obtained by staining DCs with Alexa Fluor 350, Alexa Fluor 750, or a mAb against CD45-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (BioLegend). Stained cells were assayed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Imaging flow cytometry was used to measure the nuclear localization of STAT3 at a single cell level. DCs were fixed and permeabilized as described previously. DCs were then stained with a mAb for Tyr(P)705-STAT3 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (BD Biosciences) and the DNA dye Draq5 (Biostatus Limited). Single cell images were acquired using an ImageStream 100 (Amnis), and nuclear localization was quantified using image analysis software (IDEAS 4; Amnis), as described elsewhere (13George T.C. Fanning S.L. Fitzgeral-Bocarsly P. Medeiros R.B. Highfill S. Shimizu Y. Hall B.E. Frost K. Basiji D. Ortyn W.E. Morrissey P.J. Lynch D.H. Quantitative measurement of nuclear translocation events using similarity analysis of multispectral cellular images obtained in flow.J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 311: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In brief, the pixel-by-pixel Pearson correlation, ρ, of the intensity of pSTAT3 staining with the intensity of Draq5 was calculated for each cell, and then log-transformed to give the similarity score, where similarity = ln((1 + ρ)/(1 − ρ)). Total RNA was isolated from DCs using a Qiagen Mini RNeasy kit or a Qiagen BioRobot Universal with RNeasy 96 kit, with on-column DNase treatment, according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). RNA was isolated from DCs from four anonymous healthy human donors, treated with either IL-6 or IL-10 for 45 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, or 12 h. The RNA integrity of all samples was confirmed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression analysis was performed utilizing the Illumina human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip arrays. As an additional quality control measure, the STAT3 phosphorylation response to IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by flow cytometry. Microarrays were processed at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. BeadChips were scanned using the Illumina iScan, and data were analyzed using Matlab (Mathworks). Data were first quantile-normalized, and then for each donor the expression value of each gene was normalized by the median expression value of each gene in that donor. Low expression genes were filtered out, and the remaining expression data were log2-transformed. Differentially expressed genes (versus untreated cells) were selected using a two-tail unpaired t test with a false discovery rate-corrected threshold of 0.05 (14Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. B Stat. Methods. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Principal component analysis was performed using the Statistics Toolbox in Matlab (Mathworks) using the normalized, log2-transformed expression values for the differentially expressed genes. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the Bioinformatics Toolbox in Matlab (Mathworks). For each of the differentially expressed genes, its median -fold change was calculated (relative to untreated), and clustering was performed on this data using correlation as the distance metric. RNA expression was quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using AffinityScript MultiTemp RT (Agilent) with an oligo(dT)18 primer. Real-time PCR was performed using PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green (Invitrogen) on an ABI7900HT thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems), as described previously (15Bordería A.V. Hartmann B.M. Fernandez-Sesma A. Moran T.M. Sealfon S.C. Antiviral-activated dendritic cells: a paracrine-induced response state.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A robust global normalization algorithm, using expression levels of the housekeeping genes ribosomal protein S11 (rps11), β-actin (actb), and α-tubulin (tuba), was used for all experiments, as described elsewhere (15Bordería A.V. Hartmann B.M. Fernandez-Sesma A. Moran T.M. Sealfon S.C. Antiviral-activated dendritic cells: a paracrine-induced response state.J.

Accuracy and calibration of commercial oligonucleotide and custom cDNA microarrays.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e48Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In brief, all crossing threshold values were first adjusted by median difference of all samples from actb. Each individual sample was then further corrected by the median crossing threshold value of the three corrected housekeeping control for that sample. Finally, nominal copy numbers were calculated by assuming 2500 molecules of actB mRNA per cell, and an amplification efficiency of 93%. PCR primer sequences can be found in the supplementary Materials. DCs were left untreated or treated for 6 h with LPS, LPS, and IL-6, LPS and IL-10, or LPS and IL-10 with neutralizing antibody, and the supernatants were isolated. The TNFα concentration in the supernatants was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioLegend). DCs were left untreated or treated for 6 h with IL-6, IL-10, or IL-10 with neutralizing antibody, and the supernatants were isolated. The IP-10 and IL-10 concentrations in the supernatants were assayed by Luminex (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We developed stochastic and deterministic models of IL-6 and IL-10 signaling to investigate the dynamics of STAT3 activation. These models build on previously developed JAK/STAT models (17Mahdavi A.

In silico identification of the key components and steps in IFN-γ-induced JAK-STAT signaling pathway.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and used parameter values from previous models of STAT3 signaling (17Mahdavi A. Davey R.E. Bhola P. Yin T. Zandstra P.W. Sensitivity analysis of intracellular signaling pathway kinetics predicts targets for stem cell fate control.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e130Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The deterministic versions of these models used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on mass action kinetics (similar to the initial models). The stochastic versions of these models were implemented using Gillespie's method (20Gillespie D.T. A general method for numerically simulating the stochastic time evolution of coupled chemical reactions.J. Comput. Physics. 1976; 22: 403-434Crossref Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 21Gillespie D.T. Stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2007; 58: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). All model simulations were performed in Matlab. Details of the model can be found in the supplementary Materials. The computer simulations were used to predict time evolution of signaling components following the addition of IL-6 or IL-10 ligand. The model includes ligand-induced receptor activation, ligand-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 dephosphorylation, STAT3 nuclear import, STAT3 nuclear export, phosphorylated STAT3 binding to and unbinding from the socs3 promoter, socs3 mRNA production, mRNA nuclear export, mRNA degradation, mRNA translation SOCS3 protein production, SOCS3 protein degradation, and in the case of IL-6 signaling, SOCS3-mediated receptor degradation. A metric was created to determine whether a simulation with a given parameter set predicted that IL-6 would generate a transient activation of STAT3 and IL-10 would generate a sustained activation. The mean STAT3 phosphorylation responses over early time points (0–30 min) and late time points (120–180 min) were compared for IL-6 and IL-10 signaling according to the following metric: D = (IL-60–30min/IL-6120–180min)/(IL-100–30min/IL-10120–180min). Each simulation with a value of D ≥ 2 was considered to qualitatively recapitulate the transient versus sustained STAT3 dynamics. We tested the global robustness of the model predictions by simultaneously selecting each parameter randomly from a 1,000,000-fold range (logarithmically uniform sampling centered around the parameter values used for the original simulations) and measuring whether the same qualitative STAT3 activation patterns (transient versus sustained) were observed using the D metric, similar to a method described previously (22von Dassow G. Meir E. Munro E.M. Odell G.M. The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module.Nature. 2000; 406: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). We ran ∼100,000 simulations with randomly chosen parameter sets and calculated the percentage of simulations with D ≥ 2. We calculated the fraction of values, C, that for the average parameter in the 1,000,000-fold range are compatible with the previously predicted STAT3 activation patterns, using Cn = (fraction of simulations with D > 2), where n is the number of parameters in the model. We measured the local robustness of the model predictions by systematically varying each parameter value individually (while keeping all others constant) over a range from 4096-fold decrease to a 4096-fold increase, simulating the IL-6 and IL-10 models, and calculating an associated D value for each simulation. We constructed a compartmentalized mathematical model of IL-6 and IL-10 signaling and simulated the responses to each cytokine. IL-6 and IL-10 both signal through STAT3 but differ in the architectures of their signaling networks. The signaling of the IL-6 receptor is inhibited by the STAT3-induced protein SOCS3, which does not affect the IL-10 receptor (23Niemand C. Nimmesgern A. Haan S. Fischer P. Schaper F. Rossaint R. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Activation of STAT3 by IL-6 and IL-10 in primary human macrophages is differentially modulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The model for IL-6 signaling included ligand-induced receptor activation, phosphorylation, and nuclear localization of STAT3, and negative feedback through SOCS3 (Fig. 1A). The IL-10 model was identical except for lacking SOCS3 negative feedback (Fig. 1B). Model simulations predicted that the temporal dynamics of STAT3 activation obtained with each cytokine were distinct (Fig. 2). IL-6 elicited transient STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, with a decline in STAT3 activation corresponding to the effects of the induced feedback inhibitor SOCS3 (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, IL-10 signaling resulted in sustained STAT3 activation (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 2). The robustness of the model behavior to changes in model parameters was studied by individual parameter sensitivity analysis (supplemental Fig. 3) and by global parameter variation (Fig. 2C). Model stability to global parameter variation was tested by randomly selecting values for each parameter over a 106 range and determining whether the simulation produced distinct STAT3 activation responses to IL-6 and IL-10. The response patterns were stable to large variations in model parameters. More than one third of the global parameter variation simulations (36.98%), representing on average 93.6% of the range of each randomly chosen parameter, displayed the same qualitatively distinct responses to IL-6 and IL-10 signaling. The differing temporal dynamics of STAT3 activation predicted by the simulations were tested experimentally in human monocyte-derived DCs. The dynamics of STAT3 phosphorylation in response to different concentrations of IL-6 (Fig. 3A) and IL-10 (Fig. 3B) were measured using high resolution imaging flow cytometry. For all concentrations tested, IL-6 produced a transient increase in STAT3 phosphorylation that returned to base line at about 100 min. IL-10, in contrast, produced a sustained STAT3 phosphorylation that reached peak levels after ∼20 min and remained well above base line for the entire 2-h period of study. These results indicate that, as predicted by the model, the duration of STAT3 activation elicited by IL-6 and IL-10 signaling has a distinct temporal dynamics for each cytokine that is conserved for different concentrations. For subsequent experiments, we chose a concentration of 10 ng/ml for IL-6 and for IL-10, levels that caused similar initial patterns of activation of STAT3 for both cytokines. Similar responses to IL-6 and IL-10 were obtained with multiple donors (supplemental Fig. 4). Because STAT1 has been reported to be activated by IL-10 (24Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. IL-10 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 and the differential assembly of STAT1 α and STAT3 complexes in human T cells and monocytes.J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wehinger J. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Finke J. Mertelsmann R. Weber-Nordt R.M. IL-10 induces DNA binding activity of three STAT proteins (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5) and their distinct combinatorial assembly in the promoters of selected genes.FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the specificity of the patterns of JAK-STAT signaling was evaluated by measuring the levels of STAT1 activation. In dendritic cells, no significant activation of STAT1 by IL-6 or IL-10 was observed (supplemental Fig. 5). Our signaling model identifies SOCS3 as the main factor responsible for the difference in signaling dynamics observed between IL-6 and IL-10 due to its ability to inhibit the IL-6 receptor and not the IL-10 receptor. As a result, model simulations further predicted that the dynamics of socs3 mRNA expression would mirror the temporal pattern of STAT3 activation, with IL-6 transiently inducing socs3 expression (Fig. 4A) and IL-10 producing a more sustained increase in socs3 mRNA (Fig. 4B). The dynamics of socs3 expression induced by IL-6 and IL-10 were tested experimentally using quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4C). IL-6 rapidly induced socs3 expression, and mRNA levels returned to base line after ∼90 min. IL-10 also rapidly induced socs3, but expression remained sustained above base line. In line with model predictions, the differing pattern of socs3 induction over time with each cytokine resembled the different dynamics of STAT3 activation. Having established the difference in the dynamics of STAT3 activation elicited by IL-6 and IL-10, we explored whether these dynamics were responsible for the different gene responses associated with each of these two cytokines. First, we proceeded to test whether the duration in STAT3 activation was a feature conserved following nuclear translocation of this transcription factor. A fine grain time course was obtained for phosphorylated STAT3 (Fig. 5A) and compared with STAT3 translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 5B) measured by high resolution imaging flow cytometry. As hypothesized by the model, IL-6 produced a transient increase in STAT3 nuclear translocation that attenuated after 60 min. IL-10 produced a sustained and stable increase in STAT3 nuclear translocation. The levels of active STAT3 were nearly identical early after IL-6 and IL-10 stimulation and markedly different at later time points. We hypothesized that if the cellular responses result from STAT3 activation, the cellular programs activated by each cytokine should show a similar divergence over time. This prediction was tested on a genome-wide scale by determining the transcriptional programs induced by IL-6 and IL-10 over time by microarray analysis. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis performed on differentially expressed genes showed that IL-6 and IL-10 produced similar transcriptional responses at early times following stimulation and divergent responses at later times (Fig. 5, C and D). Together, these results suggest that the temporal pattern of STAT3 activation dictates the specific cellular response. We further studied the relationship of the temporal pattern of STAT3 activation and DC response by using a receptor antibody to abrogate IL-10 signaling. Blocking the receptor inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-10 in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). When the receptor-blocking antibody was added to cells 30 min after treatment with IL-10, STAT3 activation was truncated, such that IL-10 caused a transient increase in STAT3 phosphorylation that resembled the pattern obtained with IL-6 (Fig. 6A). The transcriptional and functional effects of truncating STAT3 activation following IL-10 stimulation was determined by measuring differentially regulated transcripts and secreted factors (Fig. 6, B–D) chosen based on our microarray study results and their established involvement with inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Namely, the induction of gene mRNA transcripts of three chemokines ccl3, ccl4, and cxcl1 was used to characterize the inflammatory response elicited by IL-6. In contrast, the absence of these transcripts together with the induction of cepbd was chosen to characterize the anti-inflammatory response elicited by IL-10. These responses were consistent for different concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 (see supplemental Fig. 6). Truncating the IL-10–induced activation of STAT3 caused IL-10 to induce an IL-6–like response. IL-10 alone caused induction of cebpd and reduction of ccl3 and ccl4 mRNAs. In contrast, IL-10 with STAT3 activation truncation caused induction of ccl3, ccl4, and cxcl1 transcripts, a response indistinguishable from that seen with IL-6 stimulation. Control experiments using isotype control antibodies showed no effects (supplemental Fig. 7). IL-10 suppresses the LPS-stimulated secretion of TNFα, a marker of its anti-inflammatory actions (24Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. IL-10 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 and the differential assembly of STAT1 α and STAT3 complexes in human T cells and monocytes.J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 has no effect on TNFα induction and stimulates the inflammatory chemokine IP-10. When STAT3 activation was truncated following IL-10 stimulation, a functional response corresponding to the IL-6 response was observed (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, although IL-6 and IL-10 both activate STAT3, they encode different temporal patterns of activation (transient versus sustained) that are associated with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cellular programs, respectively. Simulations predicted and imaging flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the topology of the IL-6 and IL-10 signaling networks lead, respectively, to transient and sustained activation of STAT3. The steady divergence of the gene program induced by each cytokine over time suggested that the duration of STAT3 activation might dictate the specific cellular responses. SOCS3 expression is necessary for the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6 (26Yasukawa H. Ohishi M. Mori H. Murakami M. Chinen T. Aki D. Hanada T. Takeda K. Akira S. Hoshijima M. Hirano T. Chien K.R. Yoshimura A. IL-6 induces an anti-inflammatory response in the absence of SOCS3 in macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We showed that prolonged activation of STAT3 is necessary for the anti-inflammatory response to IL-10. Shortening the activation of STAT3 by IL-10 transforms the IL-10 cellular response into an IL-6–like response. These results support the hypothesis that the pro- and anti-inflammatory signals of IL-6 and IL-10 are encoded at the level of STAT3 by its transient and sustained activation. The antibody blockade experiment shows that transient activation of the IL-10 receptor elicits an IL-6–like response. The absence of STAT1 activation eliminates this signal from contributing to the response specificity. However, our results cannot categorically exclude the contribution of some unmeasured or unknown signaling process to the divergent response elicited by IL-6 and IL-10. The evidence that the distinct responses elicited by activation of the two receptors result from the differences in the temporal dynamics of STAT3 activation includes (i) differing concentrations of IL-6 or IL-10 or of peak STAT3 activation levels do not influence the cytokine-specific pattern of the cellular responses observed. (ii) The microarray responses are similar at early time points, when the STAT3 activation patterns also correspond, and diverge at later time points. (iii) The STAT3 activation patterns correlate with the patterns of cell response observed in the antibody inhibition experiment and not with the cytokine used for stimulation. Without accounting for the temporal pattern information encoding, it would be difficult to predict the cellular and physiological effects of STAT3 modulators. Temporal encoding may have contributed to the challenge of developing STAT3 modulators as therapeutic drugs and has implications for drug discovery in general. The current target-based drug discovery paradigm relies on selecting important therapeutic targets, such as STAT3, developing target modulators, and advancing them through preclinical characterization and clinical trials. The decreasing efficiency of this approach has been attributed to the so-called “valley of death,” the difficulty of bringing target modulators into clinical trials (27Butler D. Translational research: crossing the valley of death.Nature. 2008; 453: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 28Coller B.S. Califf R.M. Traversing the valley of death: a guide to assessing prospects for translational success.Sci. Transl. Med. 2009; 1: 10cm19Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the decreasing success rate of drugs entering clinical trials (29Arrowsmith J. Trial watch: phase II failures, 2008–2010.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 328-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) suggests that the pharmacology of target-based drug candidates predicts their therapeutic efficacy and toxicity poorly. The mechanism of IL-6 and IL-10 information encoding we describe points to the need to refine the pharmacology underlying the current drug discovery paradigm. Temporal pattern encoding relieves the cellular information bottleneck, where many stimuli must signal through few intracellular pathways to generate diverse and specific cellular responses (30Fribourg M.

To date, a genome-wide overview of the AAT gene family in rice is not yet available. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, a total of 85 AAT genes were identified in rice genome and were classified into eleven distinct subfamilies based upon their sequence composition and phylogenetic relationship. A large number of OsAAT genes were expanded via gene duplication, 23 and 24 OsAAT genes were tandemly and segmentally duplicated, respectively. Comprehensive analyses were performed to investigate the expression profiles of OsAAT genes in various stages of vegetative and reproductive development by using data from EST, Microarrays, MPSS and Real-time PCR. Many OsAAT genes exhibited abundant and tissue-specific expression patterns. Moreover, 21 OsAAT genes were found to be differentially expressed under the treatments of abiotic stresses. Comparative analysis indicates that 26 AAT genes with close evolutionary relationships between rice and Arabidopsis exhibited similar expression patterns. Conclusions/Significance This study will facilitate further studies on OsAAT family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsAATs."
https://openalex.org/W1989236218,"The CDC73 gene is mutationally inactivated in hereditary and sporadic parathyroid tumors. It negatively regulates β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-MYC. Down-regulation of CDC73 has been reported in breast, renal, and gastric carcinomas. However, the reports regarding the role of CDC73 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are lacking. In this study we show that CDC73 is down-regulated in a majority of OSCC samples. We further show that oncogenic microRNA-155 (miR-155) negatively regulates CDC73 expression. Our experiments show that the dramatic up-regulation of miR-155 is an exclusive mechanism for down-regulation of CDC73 in a panel of human cell lines and a subset of OSCC patient samples in the absence of loss of heterozygosity, mutations, and promoter methylation. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HEK293 cells dramatically reduced CDC73 levels, enhanced cell viability, and decreased apoptosis. Conversely, the delivery of a miR-155 antagonist (antagomir-155) to KB cells overexpressing miR-155 resulted in increased CDC73 levels, decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and marked regression of xenografts in nude mice. Cotransfection of miR-155 with CDC73 in HEK293 cells abrogated its pro-oncogenic effect. Reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of KB cells were dependent on the presence or absence of the 3'-UTR in CDC73. In summary, knockdown of CDC73 expression due to overexpression of miR-155 not only adds a novelty to the list of mechanisms responsible for its down-regulation in different tumors, but the restoration of CDC73 levels by the use of antagomir-155 may also have an important role in therapeutic intervention of cancers, including OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1981407503,"Background Although recent studies have identified genes expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that induce pluripotency, the molecular underpinnings of normal stem cell function remain poorly understood. The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene is highly expressed in hESCs and poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers; however, its role in these settings has been unclear. Methods/Principal Findings We show that HMGA1 is highly expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs and hESCs, with intermediate levels in ECCs and low levels in fibroblasts. When hESCs are induced to differentiate, HMGA1 decreases and parallels that of other pluripotency factors. Conversely, forced expression of HMGA1 blocks differentiation of hESCs. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC – OSKM). HMGA1 increases the number and size of iPSC colonies compared to OSKM controls. Surprisingly, there was normal differentiation in vitro and benign teratoma formation in vivo of the HMGA1-derived iPSCs. During the reprogramming process, HMGA1 induces the expression of pluripotency genes, including SOX2, LIN28, and cMYC, while knockdown of HMGA1 in hESCs results in the repression of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that HMGA1 binds to the promoters of these pluripotency genes in vivo. In addition, interfering with HMGA1 function using a short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative construct blocks cellular reprogramming to a pluripotent state. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming from a somatic cell to a fully pluripotent stem cell. These findings identify a novel role for HMGA1 as a key regulator of the stem cell state by inducing transcriptional networks that drive pluripotency. Although further studies are needed, these HMGA1 pathways could be exploited in regenerative medicine or as novel therapeutic targets for poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007539090,"Vertebrate interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) genes have been demonstrated to have extensive and diverse functions, playing important roles in the evolution of vertebrates. Despite observance of their functionality, the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family are complex and currently unknown. Here, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses to unravel the evolutionary history of the vertebrate IFITM family. A total of 174 IFITM orthologous genes and 112 pseudogenes were identified from 27 vertebrate genome sequences. The vertebrate IFITM family can be divided into immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families in phylogeny, implying origins from three different progenitors. In general, vertebrate IFITM genes are located in two loci, one containing the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus containing IFITM5 and various numbers of IR-IFITM genes. Conservation of evolutionary synteny was observed in these IFITM genes. Significant functional divergence was detected among the three IFITM sub-families. No gene duplication or positive selection was found in IFITM5 sub-family, implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution, which is involved in bone formation. No IFITM5 locus was identified in the marmoset genome, suggesting a potential association with the tiny size of this monkey. The IFITM10 sub-family was divided into two groups: aquatic and terrestrial types. Functional divergence was detected between the two groups, and five IFITM10-like genes from frog were dispersed into the two groups. Both gene duplication and positive selection were observed in aquatic vertebrate IFITM10-like genes, indicating that IFITM10 might be associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. A large number of lineage- and species-specific gene duplications were observed in IR-IFITM sub-family and positive selection was detected in IR-IFITM of primates and rodents. Because primates have experienced a long history of viral infection, such rapid expansion and positive selection suggests that the evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes is associated with broad-spectrum antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2149868956,"Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for the de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats. In addition to its established reverse transcriptase and terminal transferase activities, recent reports have revealed unexpected cellular activities of telomerase, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. This telomerase characteristic, distinct from other reverse transcriptases, indicates that clinically relevant reverse transcriptase inhibitors might have unexpected telomerase inhibition profiles. This is particularly important for the newer generation of RT inhibitors designed for anti-HIV therapy, which have reported higher safety margins than older agents. Using an in vitro primer extension assay, we tested the effects of clinically relevant HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors on cellular telomerase activity. We observed that all commonly used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, didanosine and abacavir, inhibit telomerase effectively in vitro. Truncated telomere synthesis was consistent with the expected mode of inhibition by all tested NRTIs. Through dose-response experiments, we established relative inhibitory potencies of NRTIs on in vitro telomerase activity as compared to the inhibitory potencies of the corresponding dideoxynucleotide triphosphates. In contrast to NRTIs, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine and efavirenz did not inhibit the primer extension activity of telomerase, even at millimolar concentrations. Long-term, continuous treatment of human HT29 cells with select NRTIs resulted in an accelerated loss of telomere repeats. All tested NRTIs exhibited the same rank order of inhibitory potencies on telomerase and HIV RT, which, according to published data, were orders-of-magnitude more sensitive than other DNA polymerases, including the susceptible mitochondria-specific DNA polymerase gamma. We concluded that telomerase activity could be inhibited by common NRTIs, including currently recommended RTI agents tenofovir and abacavir, which warrants large-scale clinical and epidemiological investigation of the off-target effects of long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with these agents."
https://openalex.org/W2095143857,"Metastasis is the most frequent cause of treatment failure and death in colorectal cancer. Early detection of tumors and metastases is crucial for improving treatment strategies and patient outcome. Development of reliable biomarkers and simple tests routinely applicable in the clinic for detection, prognostication, and therapy monitoring is of special interest. We recently identified the novel gene Metastasis-Associated in Colon Cancer 1 (MACC1), a key regulator of the HGF/Met-pathway. MACC1 is a strong prognostic biomarker for colon cancer metastasis and allows identification of high-risk subjects in early stages, when determined in patients' primary tumors. To overcome the limitation of a restricted number of molecular analyses in tumor tissue, the establishment of a non-invasive blood test for early identification of high-risk cancer patients, for monitoring disease course and therapy response is strongly needed.For the first time, we describe a non-invasive assay for quantification of circulating MACC1 transcripts in blood of more than 300 colorectal cancer patients. MACC1 transcript levels are increased in all disease stages of the cancer patients compared to tumor-free volunteers. Highest MACC1 levels were determined in individuals with metastases (all P<0.05). Importantly, high MACC1 levels correlate with unfavorable survival (P<.0001). Combining MACC1 with circulating transcripts of the metastasis gene S100A4, a transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin-pathway, improves survival prediction for newly diagnosed cancer patients.This blood-based assay for circulating MACC1 transcripts, which can be quantitated on a routine basis, is clinically applicable for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of cancer patients. Here we demonstrate the diagnostic and prognostic value of circulating MACC1 transcripts in patient plasma for metastasis and survival. Since MACC1 represents a promising target for anti-metastatic therapies, circulating MACC1 transcripts may prove to be an ideal read-out for monitoring therapeutic response of future interventions targeting MACC1-induced metastasis in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2164086277,"The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) is one of the most common bats in the tropical Americas. It is thought to be a potential reservoir host of Tacaribe virus, an arenavirus closely related to the South American hemorrhagic fever viruses. We performed transcriptome sequencing and annotation from lung, kidney and spleen tissues using 454 and Illumina platforms to develop this species as an animal model. More than 100,000 contigs were assembled, with 25,000 genes that were functionally annotated. Of the remaining unannotated contigs, 80% were found within bat genomes or transcriptomes. Annotated genes are involved in a broad range of activities ranging from cellular metabolism to genome regulation through ncRNAs. Reciprocal BLAST best hits yielded 8,785 sequences that are orthologous to mouse, rat, cattle, horse and human. Species tree analysis of sequences from 2,378 loci was used to achieve 95% bootstrap support for the placement of bat as sister to the clade containing horse, dog, and cattle. Through substitution rate estimation between bat and human, 32 genes were identified with evidence for positive selection. We also identified 466 immune-related genes, which may be useful for studying Tacaribe virus infection of this species. The Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome dataset is a resource that should provide additional candidate markers for studying bat evolution and ecology, and tools for analysis of the host response and pathology of disease."

We aimed to characterize the clinical presentation and course of atopic dermatitis associated with filaggrin mutations within the first 7 years of life.The COPSAC cohort is a prospective, clinical birth cohort study of 411 children born to mothers with a history of asthma followed during their first 7 years of life with scheduled visits every 6 months, as well as visits for acute exacerbations of dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis was defined in accordance with international guidelines and described at every visit using 35 predefined localizations and 10 different characteristics.A total of 170 (43%) of 397 Caucasian children developed atopic dermatitis. The R501X and/or 2282del4 filaggrin null mutations were present in 26 (15%) of children with atopic dermatitis and were primarily associated with predilection to exposed skin areas (especially the cheeks and back of the hands) and an up-regulation of both acute and chronic dermatitis. Furthermore, we found the filaggrin mutations to be associated with a higher number of unscheduled visits (3.6 vs. 2.7; p=0.04) and more severe (moderate-severe SCORAD 44% vs. 31%; p=0.14), and widespread dermatitis (10% vs. 6% of the body area, p<0.001) with an earlier age at onset (246 vs. 473 days, p<0.0001) compared to wild-type.In children, filaggrin mutations seem to define a specific endotype of atopic dermatitis primarily characterized by predilection to exposed areas of the body, in particular hands and cheeks, and an up-regulation in both acute and chronic morphological markers. Secondary, this endotype is characterized by an early onset of dermatitis and a more severe course, with more generalized dermatitis resulting in more frequent medical consultations."
https://openalex.org/W1984990382,"The trans-activator Tat protein is a viral regulatory protein essential for HIV-1 replication. Tat trafficks to the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. The nucleolus, a highly dynamic and structured membrane-less sub-nuclear compartment, is the site of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis and is involved in numerous cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control and viral infection. Importantly, transient nucleolar trafficking of both Tat and HIV-1 viral transcripts are critical in HIV-1 replication, however, the role(s) of the nucleolus in HIV-1 replication remains unclear. To better understand how the interaction of Tat with the nucleolar machinery contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis, we investigated the quantitative changes in the composition of the nucleolar proteome of Jurkat T-cells stably expressing HIV-1 Tat fused to a TAP tag. Using an organellar proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry, coupled with Stable Isotope Labelling in Cell culture (SILAC), we quantified 520 proteins, including 49 proteins showing significant changes in abundance in Jurkat T-cell nucleolus upon Tat expression. Numerous proteins exhibiting a fold change were well characterised Tat interactors and/or known to be critical for HIV-1 replication. This suggests that the spatial control and subcellular compartimentaliation of these cellular cofactors by Tat provide an additional layer of control for regulating cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Pathway analysis and network reconstruction revealed that Tat expression specifically resulted in the nucleolar enrichment of proteins collectively participating in ribosomal biogenesis, protein homeostasis, metabolic pathways including glycolytic, pentose phosphate, nucleotides and amino acids biosynthetic pathways, stress response, T-cell signaling pathways and genome integrity. We present here the first differential profiling of the nucleolar proteome of T-cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. We discuss how these proteins collectively participate in interconnected networks converging to adapt the nucleolus dynamic activities, which favor host biosynthetic activities and may contribute to create a cellular environment supporting robust HIV-1 production."
https://openalex.org/W1965465732,"Phagocytes are the principal component of the innate immune system, playing a key role in the clearance of foreign particles that include potential pathogens. In vertebrates, both neutrophils and mononuclear cells like monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are all professional phagocytes. In teleosts, B-lymphocytes also have potent phagocytic ability. We have isolated a population of small (<5 µm), mononuclear blood cells from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) not previously characterized. In order to identify them, we have performed morphological, gene expression, flow cytometry, cytochemical, ultrastructural and functional analyses. Interestingly, they highly express the gene encoding CD83, the most characteristic cell surface marker for dendritic cells in mammals, and MHC class II limited to professional antigen presenting cells. They did not express genes nor did they have cell markers for B-cells, T-cells, monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils as shown by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunoblotting. A remarkable feature of these cells is their potent phagocytic capacity. Their oxygen-independent killing mechanism, as shown by intense acid phosphatase staining, is supported by lack of respiratory burst and myeloperoxidase activity and the acid phosphatase's sensitivity to tartrate. They show a high level of morphological plasticity, as, upon stimulation with mitogens, they change morphology and obtain branching protrusions similarly to dendritic cells. We suggest, based on our findings, that the small, round cells described here are progenitor cells with potential to differentiate into dendritic like cells, although we can not exclude the possibility that they represent a novel cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2093694511,"Aim To investigate the influence of metformin use on liver dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy in a retrospective cohort of diabetic cirrhotic patients. To analyze the impact of metformin on glutaminase activity and ammonia production in vitro. Methods Eighty-two cirrhotic patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Forty-one patients were classified as insulin sensitizers experienced (metformin) and 41 as controls (cirrhotic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without metformin treatment). Baseline analysis included: insulin, glucose, glucagon, leptin, adiponectin, TNFr2, AST, ALT. HOMA-IR was calculated. Baseline HE risk was calculated according to minimal hepatic encephalopathy, oral glutamine challenge and mutations in glutaminase gene. We performed an experimental study in vitro including an enzymatic activity assay where glutaminase inhibition was measured according to different metformin concentrations. In Caco2 cells, glutaminase activity inhibition was evaluated by ammonia production at 24, 48 and 72 hours after metformina treatment. Results Hepatic encephalopathy was diagnosed during follow-up in 23.2% (19/82): 4.9% (2/41) in patients receiving metformin and 41.5% (17/41) in patients without metformin treatment (logRank 9.81; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, metformin use [H.R.11.4 (95% CI: 1.2–108.8); p = 0.034], age at diagnosis [H.R.1.12 (95% CI: 1.04–1.2); p = 0.002], female sex [H.R.10.4 (95% CI: 1.5–71.6); p = 0.017] and HE risk [H.R.21.3 (95% CI: 2.8–163.4); p = 0.003] were found independently associated with hepatic encephalopathy. In the enzymatic assay, glutaminase activity inhibition reached 68% with metformin 100 mM. In Caco2 cells, metformin (20 mM) decreased glutaminase activity up to 24% at 72 hours post-treatment (p<0.05). Conclusions Metformin was found independently related to overt hepatic encephalopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Metformin inhibits glutaminase activity in vitro. Therefore, metformin use seems to be protective against hepatic encephalopathy in diabetic cirrhotic patients."

The transfer of HCs to high molecular weight (HMW) HA is a reversible event whereby TSG-6 can shuffle HCs from one HA molecule to another. Therefore, HMW HA can serve as both an HC acceptor and an HC donor. In the present study, we show that transfer of HCs to low molecular weight HA oligosaccharides is an irreversible event where subsequent shuffling does not occur, i.e. HA oligosaccharides from 8 to 21 monosaccharide units in length can serve as HC acceptors, but are unable to function as HC donors. We show that the HC-HA complex is present in the synovial fluid of mice subjected to systemic and monoarticular mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis.

Genome. 1992; 2: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HC4 is unique in that it is not part of IαI, is not transferred to HA, and is secreted as a free HC species (9Salier J.P. Rouet P.

HA is present at relatively high levels (3–4 mg/ml) in the synovial fluid (SF) of healthy articular joints where it functions as a hydrated, viscoelastic lubricant (11Decker B. McGuckin W.F. McKenzie B.F. Slocumb C.H. Concentration of hyaluronic acid in synovial fluid.Clin. Chem. 1959; 5: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The HC-HA complex has been detected in the SF of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and leukocytes have been shown to preferentially bind HC-HA when compared with HA alone (1Zhuo L. Kanamori A. Kannagi R. Itano N. Wu J. Hamaguchi M. Ishiguro N. Kimata K. SHAP potentiates the CD44-mediated leukocyte adhesion to the hyaluronan substratum.J. Biol.

This finding is significant because leukocyte counts from inflamed SF are 10–500-fold above normal levels and are important factors in driving irreversible inflammatory changes in RA disease. HC transfer from IαI to HA is a dynamic process whereby TSG-6 can shuffle HCs between different HA molecules in a reversible manner (12Sanggaard K.W. Scavenius C. Rasmussen A.J. Wisniewski H.G. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. The TSG-6/hc2-mediated transfer is a dynamic process shuffling heavy chains between glycosaminoglycans.J. Biol.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that low molecular weight (LMW) HA oligosaccharides are irreversible HC acceptors in contrast to higher molecular weight HA molecules, which function as both HC acceptors and HC donors (Fig. 1C). If true, then HA oligosaccharides could be used as inert HC acceptors to deplete HCs from pathological HC-HA matrices, thereby serving as “bait” to remove the signal for leukocyte adhesion to HA matrices. IαI/pre-IαI sources were either mouse serum (S7273; Sigma-Aldrich) or human serum as noted (donor 736; Equitech-Bio Inc., Kerrville, TX). They were not purified from other serum components with the exception that the human serum was dialyzed into a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1 mm MgCl2 using a 20-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane. We dialyzed the serum to rule out the possibility that endogenous LMW HC acceptors were present in serum and responsible for the HC gel shift when serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone. Because dialysis had no effect on this phenomenon (data not shown), the mouse serum was not dialyzed. The mouse serum was also used in the presence of PBS and 1 mm MgCl2 because the ability of TSG-6 to transfer HCs is dependent upon divalent cations (7Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. Characterization of complexes formed between TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor that act as intermediates in the covalent transfer of heavy chains onto hyaluronan.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TSG-6 incubated with human serum dialyzed into PBS containing no divalent cations was unable to transfer HCs to HA, whereas nondialyzed human serum and serum dialyzed into PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 showed equal ability to promote HC transfer to HA (data not shown). The rest of the experiments in this study used human serum dialyzed into PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 defining the amount and identity of the divalent cation present. Because the mouse serum was not dialyzed, other cations were present. In addition, PBS and an additional 1 mm MgCl2 were also added to the samples containing mouse serum. Recombinant human TSG-6 (2104-TS; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was resuspended at 0.005 mg/ml. HA oligosaccharides 4, 6, 8, and 10 monosaccharide units in length and monodisperse 1,000-kDa HA (̄Mw/̄Mn = 1.007), where ̄Mw and ̄Mn indicate weight average molecular weight and weight average molecular number, were purchased from Hyalose, L.L.C. (Oklahoma City, OK). HA of 12, 14, 18, and 21 monosaccharide units in length was kindly provided by Hyalose. Antibodies against HC1 (SC-33944 anti-mouse; SC-21968 anti-human), HC2 (SC-21978 anti-mouse; SC-21975 anti-human), or HC3 (SC-21979 anti-mouse and human) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were employed. Streptomyces hyaluronidase (100740-1, Seikagaku, East Falmouth, MA) was used at 8 milliunits/μl of reaction volume. The reaction volumes were 25 μl of PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 5% serum supplemented with 1.25 μg HA, and/or 0.005 μg of TSG-6. TSG-6 was always added last and marked the beginning of the incubation period (time 0). EDTA was used to stop the reaction by adding 0.5 μl of a 0.5 m (pH 8.0) solution. In HC swapping studies, HCs were first transferred to HA molecules of a specific size, and after a specified time, equal mass amounts of HA molecules of a different size were added to the same reaction mixture for a specified time. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) was used to assess the purity of the HA oligosaccharides used in the size-range study. This method has been previously described (13Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Microanalysis of enzyme digests of hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The systemic proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) and the monoarticular antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) models of rheumatoid arthritis in BALB/c mice have been previously described (14Szántó S. Gál I. Gonda A. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Expression of l-selectin, but not CD44, is required for early neutrophil extravasation in antigen-induced arthritis.J.

Clinical features and histopathology.Arthritis Rheum. 1987; 30: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Synovial fluids were obtained from several affected knee and ankle joints. The samples were harvested 7–10 days after the onset of arthritis using a 25-gauge needle and by lavaging the joints with an equal or double volume of saline containing 0.5 unit of heparin, which was then pooled with the original synovial fluid extract. Typically, the extracts were 4–6 μl from ankle and knee joints of mice with PGIA and 8–10 μl from the affected knee joints of mice with AIA. The extracts and lavages from several knees (n = 3–4) or ankles (n = 3–4) were pooled. For AIA, an extra 10-fold saline lavage (by synovial fluid volume) was used. When loading the TGX electrophoresis gel (described later), equal volumes of synovial fluid were added to each lane, taking into consideration the -fold dilution of the synovial fluid by the saline lavages. Synovial fluid samples (2.5 μl) were incubated with 2 units of Streptomyces hyaluronidase in a final reaction volume of 25 μl in PBS for 18 h at 37 °C before loading onto the gel. Loading 2.5 μl of 1:2 diluted synovial fluid, pretreated with hyaluronidase, per lane gave a strong heavy chain signal by Western blot with anti-HC antibodies. Synovial fluid was collected from the knee joint of RA patients during a routine arthrocentesis at their clinic visit under approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols with samples de-identified. The analysis was the same as described for the mouse synovial fluid. Samples were electrophoresed on 4–15% Mini-Protean TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted using the Bio-Rad nitrocellulose and Trans-Blot Turbo system. Samples of 25 μl with 1.25 μl of serum gave a strong HC signal on the blots with antibodies used in this study. The molecular weight standard was purchased from LI-COR (928-40000). The blots were blocked for 1 h with LI-COR blocking buffer (927-40000; LI-COR) and then probed with antibodies against HC1, HC2, or HC3 (dilution 1:1000) in the blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The blots were washed 5× in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with an IRDYE secondary antibody (LI-COR; 926-32214) at 1:15,000 dilution in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% lauryl sulfate for 45 min. The blots were washed as before and imaged on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). It has been previously reported that the enzyme TSG-6 binds HC-bikunin molecules prior to forming a HC-TSG-6 intermediate (7Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. Characterization of complexes formed between TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor that act as intermediates in the covalent transfer of heavy chains onto hyaluronan.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Subsequent noncovalent binding by this HC-TSG-6 intermediate to HA via the TSG-6 link module allows transfer of HCs to HA. We were interested in the effect of HA size on the kinetics of HC transfer by TSG-6 from bikunin to HA. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of HC transfer by recombinant TSG-6 from human serum HC-bikunin to high molecular weight (HMW) 1,000-kDa HA (HA1000K, ∼5,300 monosaccharides in length, panel A) or to LMW ∼1.5-kDa HA oligosaccharide (HA8, 8 monosaccharides in length, panel B) or in the absence of HA (panel C). Human serum HC-bikunin is primarily in the form of IαI (two HCs per bikunin). In Fig. 2, all reactions were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 mm Mg2+ with addition of EDTA at the times indicated (0–24 h, lanes 3–10) to stop the reaction (10 mm final concentration). In lane 2, serum alone (no TSG-6 or HA) incubated at 37 °C for 24 h was run as control. Blots were probed with a mixture of antibodies against human HC1- and HC2-specific peptides. Fig. 2 shows TSG-6-mediated transfer of HCs from HC-bikunin to HMW HA (Fig. 2A, HA1000k; HC disappears from the blot as the HMW prevents entry into the stacking gel or from transfer during blotting; hyaluronidase control was done but not shown) and to LMW HA oligosaccharide (Fig. 2B, HA8). Transfer was complete within 2–4 h with no detectable formation of a pre-IαI (one HC per bikunin) intermediate. Interestingly, in the absence of any HA (Fig. 2C), after 1 h of incubation, TSG-6 initially shuffled HCs on bikunin forming a mixture of bikunin molecules with one (pre-IαI), two (IαI), and three HCs per bikunin molecule followed by the slow release of free HCs by 4 h ending in release of all HCs as free HCs by 24 h. Once released or “chucked” as free HCs, these HCs could not be subsequently transferred by TSG-6 to HA of any size (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Free HCs chucked by TSG-6 cannot be transferred to hyaluronan. Western blot simultaneously probed with antibodies against HC1 and HC2. Lanes 2 and 6 show human serum alone, incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. In lane 3, human serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone for 24 h, at which point EDTA was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 24 h. In lane 7, human serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone for 48 h, at which point EDTA was added. In lanes 4 and 5, human serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone for 24 h, and then an aliquot of HA14 or HA1000K (respectively) was added to the reaction mixture in the presence of EDTA for an additional 24 h. In lanes 8 and 9, human serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone for 24 h, and then an aliquot of HA14 or HA1000K (respectively) was added to the reaction mixture for an additional 24 h, after which EDTA was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows the kinetics of HC transfer by TSG-6 from mouse serum HC-bikunin, which is primarily in the form of pre-IαI (one HC) with lower amounts of IαI (two HCs). The predominance of pre-IαI in mouse serum and full-length IαI in human serum was a common trend found in other isolates (data not shown). In Fig. 4, blots were probed with a mixture of antibodies against mouse HC1- and HC2-specific peptides. Similar to human serum IαI, HC transfer from mouse serum IαI to HMW HA1000k (Fig. 4A) and LMW HA8 oligosaccharide (Fig. 4B) was completed very quickly (within 1 h), However transfer from mouse pre-IαI was relatively slow, requiring 24 h. Although release of free HCs from mouse IαI in the absence of HA (Fig. 4C) was similar to that of human IαI, release of free HCs from mouse pre-IαI was slower and incomplete by 24 h. We were interested in the role that HC isotype might have in the differences in kinetics seen between HC transfer by TSG-6 from human and mouse HC-bikunin (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Fig. 5 shows the kinetics of HC transfer by recombinant TSG-6 from human (panels A and B) and mouse (panel C) serum HC-bikunin to LMW HA8 oligosaccharides, but probed separately with HC isotype-specific antibodies. As seen in Fig. 5, A and B, human HC-bikunin contains both HC1 and HC2. The human HC1-bikunin was in the form of IαI with no detectable pre-IαI (panel A, lane 1). The human HC2-bikunin was predominantly in the form of IαI, but with detectable amounts of pre-IαI (panel B, lane 1). The relative staining of human HC1 was significantly stronger than staining for human HC2 (compare band intensities between panel A, lane 1 and panel B, lane 1a). To allow visualization of the bands in panel B, the gain was increased for lanes 1–10. In Fig. 5A, transfer of HC1 from human IαI to HA8 was complete within 2–4 h with no detectable pre-IαI intermediate similar to the results in Fig. 2B. However, although transfer of the first HC2 from human IαI was completed within 2–4 h, transfer of the second HC2 was slower, generating a pre-IαI intermediate (Fig. 5B). By 24 h, there was still HC2 that had not been transferred from the pre-IαI intermediate to the HA8 oligosaccharide. Thus, the results from probing the blot in Fig. 2 with both HC1 and HC2 antibodies are representative of those obtained with the HC1 antibody alone in Fig. 5 as the antibody against HC1 gave a much stronger signal than the antibody against HC2 in human serum. Mouse HC-bikunin was positive for HC2 (Fig. 5C), although completely negative when probed with a similar antibody against HC1 (not shown). The mouse HC2-bikunin was predominantly in the form of pre-IαI, with lower amounts of IαI (panel C, lane 1). However, although transfer of the first HC2 from mouse IαI was complete within 1 h, transfer of the second HC2 was slower, generating a pre-IαI intermediate (Fig. 5C). By 24 h, there was still HC2 that had not been transferred from the pre-IαI intermediate to HA8 oligosaccharide. This was similar to the transfer results for human HC2 in panel B. As no HC1 was detected by the HC1-specific antibody in mouse serum, the kinetics of transfer to HA8 seen in Fig. 5C are the same as in Fig. 4B. It has previously been reported that TSG-6-mediated HC transfer from HC-bikunin to HA is followed by reversible swapping of HCs from site to site on the same and different HA molecules (12Sanggaard K.W. Scavenius C. Rasmussen A.J. Wisniewski H.G. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. The TSG-6/hc2-mediated transfer is a dynamic process shuffling heavy chains between glycosaminoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21988-21993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We were interested in the effect that HA size would have on this swapping by TSG-6. In Fig. 6, blots show HC swapping from HMW HA (HA1000K) to HA14 (HA oligosaccharide containing 14 monosaccharides) via recombinant TSG-6. In panel A, the HCs of IαI from human serum (lane 1) were transferred to HA14 (lane 2) or to HA1000K (lane 3) for 24 h at 37 °C. Note that most of the HCs transferred to HA1000K and thus did not enter the gel because the HC-HA complex was too large, thus giving the appearance that they disappeared. Also, note that small portions of HCs were chucked as free HCs, either from IαI (as shown in Fig. 2C) or from HC-HA1000K (as will be shown in Fig. 8). In lane 4, HCs were first transferred to HA1000K for 24 h, after which the reaction mixture was spiked with HA14 to allow swapping of HCs from HA1000K to HA14 for 72 h at 37 °C. In lane 5, the reverse sequence was applied (i.e. transfer of HCs to HA14 for the first 24 h followed by incubation for 72 h with HA1000K). Although the HCs were able to swap from HA1000K to HA14 (lane 4), the reverse of this did not occur (lane 5). Thus, unlike for HMW HA, transfer of HCs to LMW HA14 oligosaccharide is an irreversible event. This effect is further illustrated in lane 6 in which both HA1000K and HA14 were applied simultaneously for 72 h. Thus, although HA1000K is both an HC acceptor and an HC donor, HA14 is exclusively an irreversible HC acceptor. Similar results were obtained with mouse serum (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 8Release of free HCs from HMW HC-HA. The Western blot depicts HC chucking from HMW HC-HA. HCs were transferred to HA1000K by the addition of serum, and recombinant TSG-6 and EDTA were added 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h later (lanes 2–6, respectively) to inhibit TSG-6 activity. In lane 7, after the formation of HC-HA1000K for 24 h, an HA oligosaccharide 21 monosaccharides in length was added to demonstrate HC swapping from HC-HA1000K to HA21. Lane 8 shows HC transfer to HA21 (alone) in 4 h. Lane 9 shows HC transfer to HA21 (alone) for 96 h. All reactants were incubated at 37 °C for the entire 96-h incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of TSG-6-mediated swapping of human HCs between HMW HA (HA1000K) and LMW HA (HA8) are shown in Fig. 7, A and B. In panel A, all HCs were transferred to HA1000K from human serum IαI via TSG-6 for 24 h, after which HA8 was added and the reaction was stopped at different time points by the addition of EDTA. All samples were kept at 37 °C for the entire 96-h period to control for the stability of the reactants. Panel B is similar to panel A except that all of the HCs were first transferred from human serum IαI to HA8 for 24 h, after which HA1000K was added and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA at the times indicated. In panel A, lane 9 shows the complete transfer of HCs from HC-bikunin in serum to HA8 as a positive, end point control (i.e. no HA1000K was used in lane 9). Panel A shows that swapping of human HCs from HMW HA to LMW HA oligosaccharide is relatively slow, taking 72 h to near completion. This was in contrast to human HC transfer from bikunin to either HMW or LMW HA, which was completed in 2–4 h (Fig. 2). In panel B, lane 9 shows the complete transfer of HCs from HC-bikunin in serum to HA1000K as a positive, end point control (i.e. no HA8 used in lane 9). Panel B shows no swapping of HCs from the LMW HA to the HMW HA during the 72-h incubation as the LMW HA8 oligosaccharide, although able to accept HCs, is unable to serve as an HC donor. Similar results were seen for the TSG-6-mediated swapping of mouse HCs (Fig. 7, C and D). Thus, unlike HC transfer from bikunin to HA, there does not appear to be species, or HC isotype, differences in the kinetics of HC swapping. Because TSG-6 released (or chucked) free HCs from the CS chain of HC-bikunin in the absence of HA as an HC acceptor (Figs. 2C and 4C), we investigated the possibility that TSG-6 might also release HCs from HMW HC-HA. As shown in Fig. 8, TSG-6 transferred all of the HCs from serum-derived HC-bikunin to HA1000K (compare lanes 1 and 2) by 4 h. At later time points (i.e. 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the reaction had started), TSG-6 released free HCs from HA1000K, albeit to a much less, and slower, extent than the release of HCs from the CS chain of HC-bikunin. The release of free HCs was not likely the result of general hydrolysis of the HCs from HA over the 96-h reaction period because hydrolysis was not observed in lanes 1 or 2, although the samples were incubated for the entire 96-h period. Swapping of HCs from HC-HA1000K to HA21 induced a gel shift to slightly higher than the free HC, and much stronger in intensity, demonstrating that although TSG-6 can release free HCs from HMW HC-HA, the number of free HCs released were minor in comparison with the number of HCs transferred to the HA21. Furthermore, the near absence of the faster migrating free HC band in samples incubated with HA21 (lanes 7–9) suggests that TSG-6 cannot release free HCs from irreversible HC acceptors such as HA21 (as shown in Fig. 9). We were interested in defining the range of HA oligosaccharide sizes that serve as irreversible HC acceptors. HA oligosaccharides that were 4 (HA4), 6 (HA6), 8 (HA8), 10 (HA10), 12 (HA12), 14 (HA14), 18 (HA18), and 21 (HA21) monosaccharide units in length were tested. The purity of these oligosaccharides was confirmed by FACE analysis (Fig. 9A). In Fig. 9, B and C, recombinant TSG-6 was used to covalently transfer HCs from human serum-derived IαI (lane 1) to HA oligosaccharides of different sizes for 4 h at 37 °C to form HC-HA complexes with these oligosaccharides (−, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). After separation by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, blots were probed with a mixture of antibodies against human HC1 and HC2. After this initial 4 h, samples were incubated an additional 24 h at 37 °C with (+, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) or without (−, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) HA1000K. The results show that once HCs were transferred to HA oligosaccharides containing 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 21 monosaccharides, TSG-6 could not remove the HCs from these oligosaccharides for transfer to the HA1000k (note that HC-HA1000K is too large to enter the gel or to be transferred to the blot). In contrast, HA1000K accepted HC transfer in the presence of HA4 and HA6 (Fig. 9B, lanes 3 and 5), indicating that they are too small to be HC acceptors. Thus, HA oligosaccharides with sizes 8–21 monosaccharides in length serve as irreversible HC acceptors via TSG-6 from either HC-bikunin or HMW HC-HA, but are unable to serve as HC donors. In FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, we showed that in the absence of HA, TSG-6 slowly released or chucked HCs from bikunin. This is seen in Fig. 9B for the HA4 (lane 2) and HA6 (lane 4) oligosaccharides, which are too small to accept TSG-6-mediated HC transfer from bikunin (5Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2164376067,"Cotton (Gossypium) fiber is the most prevalent natural product used in the textile industry. The two major cultivated species, G. hirsutum (Gh) and G. barbadense (Gb), are allotetraploids with contrasting fiber quality properties. To better understand the molecular basis for their fiber differences, EST pyrosequencing was used to document the fiber transcriptomes at two key development stages, 10 days post anthesis (dpa), representing the peak of fiber elongation, and 22 dpa, representing the transition to secondary cell wall synthesis. The 617,000 high quality reads (89% of the total 692,000 reads) from 4 libraries were assembled into 46,072 unigenes, comprising 38,297 contigs and 7,775 singletons. Functional annotation of the unigenes together with comparative digital gene expression (DGE) revealed a diverse set of functions and processes that were partly linked to specific fiber stages. Globally, 2,770 contigs (7%) showed differential expression (>2-fold) between 10 and 22 dpa (irrespective of genotype), with 70% more highly expressed at 10 dpa, while 2,248 (6%) were differentially expressed between the genotypes (irrespective of stage). The most significant genes with differential DGE at 10 dpa included expansins and lipid transfer proteins (higher in Gb), while at 22 dpa tubulins, cellulose, and sucrose synthases showed higher expression in Gb. DGE was compared with expression data of 10 dpa-old fibers from Affymetrix microarrays. Among 543 contigs showing differential expression on both platforms, 74% were consistent in being either over-expressed in Gh (242 genes) or in Gb (161 genes). Furthermore, the unigene set served to identify 339 new SSRs and close to 21,000 inter-genotypic SNPs. Subsets of 88 SSRs and 48 SNPs were validated through mapping and added 65 new loci to a RIL genetic map. The new set of fiber ESTs and the gene-based markers complement existing available resources useful in basic and applied research for crop improvement in cotton."
https://openalex.org/W2142953963,"Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) occurs naturally on human glioblastomas. Its activation mediates glioma cell proliferation. However, it is unknown whether NK1R is directly involved in tumor cell migration. In this study, we found human hemokinin-1 (hHK-1), via NK1R, dose-dependently promoted the migration of U-251 and U-87 cells. In addition, we showed that hHK-1 enhanced the activity of MMP-2 and the expression of MMP-2 and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which were responsible for cell migration, because neutralizing the MMPs with antibodies decreased cell migration. The involved mechanisms were then investigated. In U-251, hHK-1 induced significant calcium efflux; phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 reduced the calcium mobilization, the up-regulation of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, and the cell migration induced by hHK-1, which meant the migration effect of NK1R was mainly mediated through the G(q)-PLC pathway. We further demonstrated that hHK-1 boosted rapid phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and Akt; inhibition of ERK and Akt effectively reduced MMP-2 induction by hHK-1. Meanwhile, inhibition of ERK, JNK, and Akt reduced the MT1-MMP induction. hHK-1 stimulated significant phosphorylation of p65 and c-JUN in U-251. Reporter gene assays indicated hHK-1 enhanced both AP-1 and NF-κB activity; inhibition of ERK, JNK, and Akt dose-dependently suppressed the NF-κB activity; only the inhibition of ERK significantly suppressed the AP-1 activity. Treatment with specific inhibitors for AP-1 or NF-κB strongly blocked the MMP up-regulation by hHK-1. Taken together, our data suggested NK1R was a potential regulator of human glioma cell migration by the up-regulation of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP."
https://openalex.org/W2023502027,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Since CD40-CD154 binding has direct consequences on inflammation process initiation, we aimed to replicate previous findings related to disease susceptibility in Spanish RA population. Furthermore, as the major complication in RA disease patients is the development of CV events due to accelerated atherosclerosis, and elevated levels of CD40L/CD154 are present in patients with acute myocardial infarction, we assessed the potential association of CD40 and CD154/CD40L gene variants with CV risk in Spanish RA patients.One thousand five hundred and seventy-five patients fulfilling the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA and 1600 matched controls were genotyped for the CD40 rs1883832, rs4810485 and rs1535045 and CD154 rs3092952 and rs3092920 gene polymorphisms, using predesigned TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays. Afterwards, we investigated the influence of CD40-CD154 gene variants in the development of CV events. Also, in a subgroup of 273 patients without history of CV events, we assessed the influence of these polymorphisms in the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis determined by carotid ultrasonography.Nominally significant differences in the allele frequencies for the rs1883832 CD40 gene polymorphism between RA patients and controls were found (p=0.038). Although we did not observe a significant association of CD40-CD154 gene variants with the development of CV events, an ANCOVA model adjusted for sex, age at the time of the ultrasonography assessment, follow-up time, traditional CV risk factors and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies disclosed a significant association (p=0.0047) between CD40 rs1535045 polymorphism and carotid intima media thickness, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis.Data from our pilot study indicate a potential association of rs1883832 CD40 gene polymorphism with susceptibility to RA. Also, the CD40 rs1535045 gene variant may influence development of subclinical atherosclerosis in RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W1966121663,"Background Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors present an exciting new approach to activate HIV production from latently infected cells to potentially enhance elimination of these cells and achieve a cure. M344, a novel HDAC inhibitor, shows robust activity in a variety of cancer cells and relatively low toxicity compared to trichostatin A (TSA). However, little is known about the effects and action mechanism of M344 in inducing HIV expression in latently infected cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the Jurkat T cell model of HIV latency, we demonstrate that M344 effectively reactivates HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected cells. Moreover, M344-mediated activation of the latent HIV LTR can be strongly inhibited by a NF-κB inhibitor aspirin. We further show that M344 acts by increasing the acetylation of histone H3 and histone H4 at the nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) site of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and by inducing NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and direct RelA DNA binding at the nuc-1 region of the HIV-1 LTR. We also found that M344 synergized with prostratin to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter in latently infected cells. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest the potential of M344 in anti-latency therapies and an important role for histone modifications and NF-κB transcription factors in regulating HIV-1 LTR gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2030551757,"We have developed a rapid, simple and reliable, antibody-based flow cytometry assay for the quantitative determination of membrane proteins in human erythrocytes. Our method reveals significant differences between the expression levels of the wild-type ABCG2 protein and the heterozygous Q141K polymorphic variant. Moreover, we find that nonsense mutations on one allele result in a 50% reduction in the erythrocyte expression of this protein. Since ABCG2 polymorphisms are known to modify essential pharmacokinetic parameters, uric acid metabolism and cancer drug resistance, a direct determination of the erythrocyte membrane ABCG2 protein expression may provide valuable information for assessing these conditions or for devising drug treatments. Our findings suggest that erythrocyte membrane protein levels may reflect genotype-dependent tissue expression patterns. Extension of this methodology to other disease-related or pharmacologically important membrane proteins may yield new protein biomarkers for personalized diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2059727811,"In humans, chronic inflammation, severe injury, infection and disease can result in changes in steroid hormone titers and delayed onset of puberty; however the pathway by which this occurs remains largely unknown. Similarly, in insects injury to specific tissues can result in a global developmental delay (e.g. prolonged larval/pupal stages) often associated with decreased levels of ecdysone – a steroid hormone that regulates developmental transitions in insects. We use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to examine the pathway by which tissue injury disrupts developmental progression. Imaginal disc damage inflicted early in larval development triggers developmental delays while the effects are minimized in older larvae. We find that the switch in injury response (e.g. delay/no delay) is coincident with the mid-3rd instar transition – a developmental time-point that is characterized by widespread changes in gene expression and marks the initial steps of metamorphosis. Finally, we show that developmental delays induced by tissue damage are associated with decreased expression of genes involved in ecdysteroid synthesis and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2026748545,"Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a major embryonic growth factor belonging to the insulin-like growth factor family, which includes insulin and IGF-I. Its expression in humans is tightly controlled by maternal imprinting, a genetic restraint that is lost in many cancers, resulting in up-regulation of both mature IGF-II mRNA and protein expression. Additionally, increased expression of several longer isoforms of IGF-II, termed ""pro"" and ""big"" IGF-II, has been observed. To date, it is ambiguous as to what role these IGF-II isoforms have in initiating and sustaining tumorigenesis and whether they are bioavailable. We have expressed each individual IGF-II isoform in their proper O-glycosylated format and established that all bind to the IGF-I receptor and both insulin receptors A and B, resulting in their activation and subsequent stimulation of fibroblast proliferation. We also confirmed that all isoforms are able to be sequestered into binary complexes with several IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-5). In contrast to this, ternary complex formation with IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 and the auxillary protein, acid labile subunit, was severely diminished. Furthermore, big-IGF-II isoforms bound much more weakly to purified ectodomain of the natural IGF-II scavenging receptor, IGF-IIR. IGF-II isoforms thus possess unique biological properties that may enable them to escape normal sequestration avenues and remain bioavailable in vivo to sustain oncogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1986022917,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a highly variable, multi-system disorder resulting from the expansion of an untranslated CTG tract in DMPK. In DM1 expanded CUG repeat RNAs form hairpin secondary structures that bind and aberrantly sequester the RNA splice regulator, MBNL1. RNA splice defects resulting as a consequence of MBNL1 depletion have been shown to play a key role in the development of DM1 pathology. In patient populations, both the number and severity of DM1 symptoms increase broadly as a function of CTG tract length. However significant variability in the DM1 phenotype is observed in patients encoding similar CTG repeat numbers. Here we demonstrate that a gradual decrease in MBNL1 levels results both in the expansion of the repertoire of splice defects and an increase in the severity of the splice alterations. Thus, MBNL1 loss does not have an all or none outcome but rather shows a graded effect on the number and severity of the ensuing splice defects. Our results suggest that once a critical threshold is reached, relatively small dose variations of free MBNL1 levels, which may reflect modest changes in the size of the CUG tract or the extent of hairpin secondary structure formation, can significantly alter the number and severity of splice abnormalities and thus contribute to the phenotype variability observed in DM1 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2048502130,"The polymerization of laminins into a cell-associated network is a key process in basement membrane assembly. Network formation is mediated by the homologous short arm tips of the laminin heterotrimer, each consisting of a globular laminin N-terminal (LN) domain followed by a tandem of laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LEa) domains. How the short arms interact in the laminin network is unclear. Here, we have addressed this question by reconstituting laminin network nodes in solution and analyzing them by size exclusion chromatography and light scattering. Recombinant LN-LEa1-4 fragments of the laminin α1, α2, α5, β1, and γ1 chains were monomeric in solution. The β1 and γ1 fragments formed the only detectable binary complex and ternary complexes of 1:1:1 stoichiometry with all α chain fragments. Ternary complex formation required calcium and did not occur at 4 °C, like the polymerization of full-length laminins. Experiments with chimeric short arm fragments demonstrated that the LEa2-4 regions of the β1 and γ1 fragments are dispensable for ternary complex formation, and an engineered glycan in the β1 LEa1 domain was also tolerated. In contrast, mutation of Ser-68 in the β1 LN domain (corresponding to a Pierson syndrome mutation in the closely related β2 chain) abolished ternary complex formation. We conclude that authentic ternary nodes of the laminin network can be reconstituted for structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W1985184937,"Palmitoylation of NMDARs occurs at two distinct cysteine clusters in the carboxyl-terminus of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits that differentially regulates retention in the Golgi apparatus and surface expression of NMDARs. Mutations of palmitoylatable cysteine residues in the membrane-proximal cluster to non-palmitoylatable serines leads to a reduction in the surface expression of recombinant NMDARs via enhanced internalization of the receptors. Mutations in a cluster of cysteines in the middle of the carboxyl-terminus of GluN2A and GluN2B, leads to an increase in the surface expression of NMDARs via an increase in post-Golgi trafficking. Using a quantitative electrophysiological assay, we investigated whether palmitoylation of GluN2 subunits and the differential regulation of surface expression affect functional synaptic incorporation of NMDARs. We show that a reduction in surface expression due to mutations in the membrane-proximal cluster translates to a reduction in synaptic expression of NMDARs. However, increased surface expression induced by mutations in the cluster of cysteines that regulates post-Golgi trafficking of NMDARs does not increase the synaptic pool of NMDA receptors, indicating that the number of synaptic receptors is tightly regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2030144389,"The nonantibiotic small molecule cyslabdan, a labdan-type diterpene produced by Streptomyces sp. K04-0144, markedly potentiated the activity of the β-lactam drug imipenem against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To study the mechanism of action of cyslabdan, the proteins that bind to cyslabdan were investigated in an MRSA lysate, which led to the identification of FemA, which is involved in the synthesis of the pentaglycine interpeptide bridge of the peptidoglycan of MRSA. Furthermore, binding assay of cyslabdan to FemB and FemX with the function similar to FemA revealed that cyslabdan had an affinity for FemB but not FemX. In an enzyme-based assay, cyslabdan inhibited FemA activity, where as did not affected FemX and FemB activities. Nonglycyl and monoglycyl murein monomers were accumulated by cyslabdan in the peptidoglycan of MRSA cell walls. These findings indicated that cyslabdan primarily inhibits FemA, thereby suppressing pentaglycine interpeptide bridge synthesis. This protein is a key factor in the determination of β-lactam resistance in MRSA, and our findings provide a new strategy for combating MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W2062040610,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were collected from damaged and intact mulberry leaves (Morus alba L., Moraceae) and from Hyphantria cunea larvae by headspace absorption with Super Q columns. We identified their constituents using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and evaluated the responses of male H. cunea antennae to the compounds using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection coupled with electroantennographic detection. Eleven VOC constituents were found to stimulate antennae of male H. cunea moths: β-ocimene, hexanal, cis-3-hexenal, limonene, trans-2-hexenal, cyclohexanone, cis-2-penten-1-ol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, trans-3-hexen-1-ol, and 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol. Nine of these chemicals were released by intact, mechanically-damaged, and herbivore-damaged leaves, while cis-2-penten-1-ol was released only by intact and mechanically-damaged leaves and β-ocimene was released only by herbivore-damaged leaves. Results from wind tunnel experiments conducted with volatile components indicated that male moths were significantly more attracted to herbivory-induced volatiles than the solvent control. Furthermore, male moths' attraction to a sex pheromone lure was increased by herbivory-induced compounds and β-ocimene, but reduced by cis-2-penten-1-ol. A proof long-range field trapping experiment showed that the efficiency of sex pheromone lures in trapping male moths was increased by β-ocimene and reduced by cis-2-penten-1-ol."
https://openalex.org/W2089023857,"Recent studies suggest that the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle is populated by heterogeneous populations of stem and progenitor cells that, depending on their exact location, are biased to acquire specific neuronal fates. This newly described heterogeneity of SVZ stem and progenitor cells underlines the necessity to develop methods for the accurate quantification of SVZ stem and progenitor subpopulations. In this study, we provide 3-dimensional topographical maps of slow cycling “stem” cells and progenitors based on their unique cell cycle properties. These maps revealed that both cell populations are present throughout the lateral ventricle wall as well as in discrete regions of the dorsal wall. Immunodetection of transcription factors expressed in defined progenitor populations further reveals that divergent lineages have clear regional enrichments in the rostro-caudal as well as in the dorso-ventral span of the lateral ventricle. Thus, progenitors expressing Tbr2 and Dlx2 were confined to dorsal and dorso-lateral regions of the lateral ventricle, respectively, while Mash1+ progenitors were more homogeneously distributed. All cell populations were enriched in the rostral-most region of the lateral ventricle. This diversity and uneven distribution greatly impede the accurate quantification of SVZ progenitor populations. This is illustrated by measuring the coefficient of error of estimates obtained by using increasing section sampling interval. Based on our empirical data, we provide such estimates for all progenitor populations investigated in this study. These can be used in future studies as guidelines to judge if the precision obtained with a sampling scheme is sufficient to detect statistically significant differences between experimental groups if a biological effect is present. Altogether, our study underlines the need to consider the SVZ of the lateral ventricle as a complex 3D structure and define methods to accurately assess neural stem cells or progenitor diversity and population sizes in physiological or experimental paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W1985170649,"Notch receptors regulate osteoblastogenesis, and Notch activation induces cleavage and nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which associates with Epstein-Barr virus latency C-promoter binding factor-1/suppressor of hairless/lag-1 (CSL) and induces transcription of Notch target genes, such as hairy enhancer of split-related with YRPW motif (Hey)1 and Hey2. Nuclear factors of activated T-cells (NFAT) are transcription factors that regulate osteoclastogenesis, but their function in osteoblasts is not clear. Notch inhibits NFATc1 transcription, but interactions between Notch and NFAT are understood poorly. To determine the regulation of NFAT expression by Notch, osteoblasts from Rosa(Notch) mice, where NICD is transcribed following excision of a loxP flanked STOP cassette, were used. Alternatively, wild-type C57BL/6 osteoblasts were exposed to the Notch ligand Delta-like (Dll)1 to induce Notch signaling or to bovine serum albumin as control. In Rosa(Notch) osteoblasts, Notch suppressed NFATc1 expression, increased Nfatc2 mRNA by post-transcriptional mechanisms, and had no effect on NFATc3 and NFATc4 transcripts. Induction of Nfatc2 transcripts by Notch was confirmed in C57BL/6 osteoblasts exposed to Dll1. To investigate NFATc2 function in osteoblasts, constitutively active NFATc2 was overexpressed in Rosa(Notch) osteoblasts. NFATc2 suppressed Notch transactivation and expression of Hey genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that NFATc2 and CSL bind to similar DNA sequences, and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that NFATc2 displaced CSL from the Hey2 promoter. The effects of NICD and NFATc2 in Rosa(Notch) osteoblasts were assessed, and both proteins inhibited osteoblast function. In conclusion, Notch stabilizes Nfatc2 transcripts, NFATc2 suppresses Notch signaling, and both proteins inhibit osteoblast function."
https://openalex.org/W2066982984,"Melanoma is generally refractory to current chemotherapy, thus new treatment strategies are needed. In this study, we synthesized a series of spirooxindole derivatives (SOID-1 to SOID-12) and evaluated their antitumor effects on melanoma. Among the 12 spirooxindole derivatives, SOID-8 showed the strongest antitumor activity by viability screening. SOID-8 inhibited viability of A2058, A375, SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 human melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. SOID-8 also induced apoptosis of these tumor cells, which was confirmed by positive Annexin V staining and an increase of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. The antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, was downregulated and correlated with SOID-8 induced apoptosis. In addition, SOID-8 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Signal Tansducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) in both dose- and time-dependent manners. This inhibition was associated with decreased levels of phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase-2 (JAK2), an upstream kinase that mediates STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705. Accordingly, SOID-8 inhibited IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 and JAK2 in melanoma cells. Finally, SOID-8 suppressed melanoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model, accompanied with a decrease of phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Our results indicate that the antitumor activity of SOID-8 is at least partially due to inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in melanoma cells. These findings suggest that the spirooxindole derivative SOID-8 is a promising lead compound for further development of new preventive and therapeutic agents for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2105607559,"HIV can spread through its target cell population either via cell-free transmission, or by cell-to-cell transmission, presumably through virological synapses. Synaptic transmission entails the transfer of tens to hundreds of viruses per synapse, a fraction of which successfully integrate into the target cell genome. It is currently not understood how synaptic transmission affects viral fitness. Using a mathematical model, we investigate how different synaptic transmission strategies, defined by the number of viruses passed per synapse, influence the basic reproductive ratio of the virus, R0, and virus load. In the most basic scenario, the model suggests that R0 is maximized if a single virus particle is transferred per synapse. R0 decreases and the infection eventually cannot be maintained for larger numbers of transferred viruses, because multiple infection of the same cell wastes viruses that could otherwise enter uninfected cells. To explain the relatively large number of HIV copies transferred per synapse, we consider additional biological assumptions under which an intermediate number of viruses transferred per synapse could maximize R0. These include an increased burst size in multiply infected cells, the saturation of anti-viral factors upon infection of cells, and rate limiting steps during the process of synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2028830825,"Elevated extracellular free fatty acids (FFAs) can induce pancreatic beta cell apoptosis, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in FFA-induced beta cell apoptosis. However, molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction and FFA-induced beta cell apoptosis are not clear. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP-1) is a mitochondrial fission modulator. In this study, we investigated its role in FFA-induced INS-1 beta cell apoptosis. DRP-1 protein was promptly induced in INS-1 cells and rat islets after stimulation by FFAs, and this DRP-1 upregulation was accompanied by increased INS-1 cell apoptosis. Induction of DRP-1 expression significantly promoted FFA-induced apoptosis in DRP-1 WT (DRP-1 wild type) inducible INS-1-derived cell line, but not in DRP-1K38A (a dominant negative mutant of DRP-1) inducible INS-1-derived cell line. To validate these in vitro results, we transplanted DRP-1 WT or DRP-1 K38A cells into renal capsules of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice to study the apoptosis in xenografts. Consistent with the in vitro results, the over-expression of DRP-1 led to aggravated INS-1-derived cell apoptosis triggered by FFAs. In contrast, dominant-negative suppression of DRP-1 function as represented by DRP-1 K38A significantly prevented FFA-induced apoptosis in xenografts. It was further demonstrated that mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, while cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were enhanced by the induction of DRP-1WT, but prevented by DRP-1 K38A in INS-1-derived cells under FFA stimulation. These results indicated that DRP-1 mediates FFA-induced INS-1-derived cell apoptosis, suggesting that suppression of DRP-1 is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for protecting against beta cell loss that leads to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2078551594,"Macroautophagy in Leishmania, which is important for the cellular remodeling required during differentiation, relies upon the hydrolytic activity of two ATG4 cysteine peptidases (ATG4.1 and ATG4.2). We have investigated the individual contributions of each ATG4 to Leishmania major by generating individual gene deletion mutants (Δatg4.1 and Δatg4.2); double mutants could not be generated, indicating that ATG4 activity is required for parasite viability. Both mutants were viable as promastigotes and infected macrophages in vitro and mice, but Δatg4.2 survived poorly irrespective of infection with promastigotes or amastigotes, whereas this was the case only when promastigotes of Δatg4.1 were used. Promastigotes of Δatg4.2 but not Δatg4.1 were more susceptible than wild type promastigotes to starvation and oxidative stresses, which correlated with increased reactive oxygen species levels and oxidatively damaged proteins in the cells as well as impaired mitochondrial function. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reversed this phenotype, reducing both basal and induced autophagy and restoring mitochondrial function, indicating a relationship between reactive oxygen species levels and autophagy. Deletion of ATG4.2 had a more dramatic effect upon autophagy than did deletion of ATG4.1. This phenotype is consistent with a reduced efficiency in the autophagic process in Δatg4.2, possibly due to ATG4.2 having a key role in removal of ATG8 from mature autophagosomes and thus facilitating delivery to the lysosomal network. These findings show that there is a level of functional redundancy between the two ATG4s, and that ATG4.2 appears to be the more important. Moreover, the low infectivity of Δatg4.2 demonstrates that autophagy is important for the virulence of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2142115560,"To explore the molecular function of Osteopontin (OPN) in the pathogenesis of human OA, we compared the expression levels of OPN in synovial fluid with clinical parameters such as arthroscopic observation of cartilage damage and joint pain after joint injury.Synovial fluid was obtained from patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery from 2009 through 2011 in our university hospital. The amounts of intact OPN (OPN Full) and it's N-terminal fragment (OPN N-half) in synovial fluid from each patient were quantified by ELISA and compared with clinical parameters such as severity of articular cartilage damage (TMDU cartilage score) and severity of joint pain (Visual Analogue Scale and Lysholm score).Within a month after ACL rupture, both OPN Full and N-half levels in patient synovial fluid were positively correlated with the severity of joint pain. In contrast, patients with ACL injuries greater than one month ago felt less pain if they had higher amounts of OPN N-half in synovial fluid. OPN Full levels were positively correlated with articular cartilage damage in lateral tibial plateau.Our data suggest that OPN Full and N-half have distinct functions in articular cartilage homeostasis and in human joint pain."

We evaluated here whether MAPKs are involved in this effect. Design ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK activation was assessed by the increase in their phosphorylation status. Hepatocanalicular function was evaluated in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets (IRHCs) by quantifying the apical secretion of fluorescent Bsep and Mrp2 substrates, and in isolated, perfused rat livers (IPRLs), using taurocholate and 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, respectively. Protein kinase participation in E217G-induced secretory failure was assessed by co-administering selective inhibitors. Internalization of Bsep/Mrp2 was assessed by confocal microscopy and image analysis. Results E217G activated all kinds of MAPKs. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin prevented ERK1/2 activation, whereas the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 prevented p38 activation, suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 are downstream of PI3K and cPKC, respectively. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, but not the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP600125, partially prevented E217G-induced changes in transporter activity and localization in IRHCs. p38 and ERK1/2 co-inhibition resulted in additive protection, suggesting complementary involvement of these MAPKs. In IPRLs, E217G induced endocytosis of canalicular transporters and a rapid and sustained decrease in bile flow and biliary excretion of Bsep/Mrp2 substrates. p38 inhibition prevented this initial decay, and the internalization of Bsep/Mrp2. Contrarily, ERK1/2 inhibition accelerated the recovery of biliary secretion and the canalicular reinsertion of Bsep/Mrp2. Conclusions cPKC/p38 MAPK and PI3K/ERK1/2 signalling pathways participate complementarily in E217G-induced cholestasis, through internalization and sustained intracellular retention of canalicular transporters, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2024211405,"Nanoparticle (NP) compositions such as hydrophobicity and surface charge are vital to determine the presence and amount of human serum albumin (HSA) binding. The HSA binding influences drug release, biocompatibility, biodistribution, and intercellular trafficking of nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we prepared 2 kinds of nanomaterials to investigate HSA binding and evaluated drug release of HSA-bound NPs. Polysaccharides (pullulan) carboxyethylated to provide ionic derivatives were then conjugated to cholesterol groups to obtain cholesterol-modified carboxyethyl pullulan (CHCP). Cholesterol-modified pullulan (CHP) conjugate was synthesized with a similar degree of substitution of cholesterol moiety to CHCP. CHCP formed self-aggregated NPs in aqueous solution with a spherical structure and zeta potential of −19.9±0.23 mV, in contrast to −1.21±0.12 mV of CHP NPs. NPs could quench albumin fluorescence intensity with maximum emission intensity gradually decreasing up to a plateau at 9 to 12 h. Binding constants were 1.12×105 M−1 and 0.70×105 M−1 to CHP and CHCP, respectively, as determined by Stern-Volmer analysis. The complexation between HSA and NPs was a gradual process driven by hydrophobic force and inhibited by NP surface charge and shell-core structure. HSA conformation was altered by NPs with reduction of α-helical content, depending on interaction time and particle surface charges. These NPs could represent a sustained release carrier for mitoxantrone in vitro, and the bound HSA assisted in enhancing sustained drug release."

Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall ribitol polymer from Gram-positive organisms, mediates inflammation through the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The effect of LTA on lung endothelial permeability is not known. We tested the hypothesis that LTA from Staphylococcus aureus induces alterations in the permeability of pulmonary microvessel endothelial monolayers (PMEM) that result from activation of TLR2 and are mediated by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS). The permeability of PMEM was assessed by the clearance rate of Evans blue-labeled albumin, the activation of the TLR2 pathway was assessed by Western blot, and the generation of RONS was measured by the fluorescence of oxidized dihydroethidium and a dichlorofluorescein derivative. Treatment with LTA or the TLR2 agonist Pam(3)CSK(4) induced significant increases in albumin permeability, IκBα phosphorylation, IRAK1 degradation, RONS generation, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation (as measured by the p-eNOSser1177:p-eNOSthr495 ratio). The effects on permeability and RONS were effectively prevented by co-administration of the superoxide scavenger Tiron, the peroxynitrite scavenger Urate, or the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME and these effects as well as eNOS activation were reduced or prevented by pretreatment with an IRAK1/4 inhibitor. The results indicate that the activation of TLR2 and the generation of ROS/RNS mediates LTA-induced barrier dysfunction in PMEM."
https://openalex.org/W1966259608,"Mitochondria play an essential role in cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that decreased mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with cancer progression. In mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) regulates the activities of multiple nuclear receptors and transcription factors involved in mitochondrial proliferation. Previously, we showed that overexpression of PGC-1α leads to mitochondrial proliferation and induces apoptosis in human malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) cells in vitro. We also demonstrated that transcutaneous application of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to rat skeletal muscle induces PGC-1α expression and causes an increase in mitochondrial proliferation. In this study, we utilized a murine model of human MFH to determine the effect of transcutaneous CO(2) exposure on PGC-1α expression, mitochondrial proliferation and cellular apoptosis. PGC-1α expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, while mitochondrial proliferation was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and the relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was assessed by real-time PCR. Immunofluorescence staining and DNA fragmentation assays were used to examine mitochondrial apoptosis. We also evaluated the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis related proteins, such as caspases, cytochorome c and Bax, by immunoblot analysis. We show that transcutaneous application of CO(2) induces PGC-1α expression, and increases mitochondrial proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells, significantly reducing tumor volume. Proteins involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, including caspase 3 and caspase 9, were elevated in CO(2) treated tumors compared to control. We also observed an enrichment of cytochrome c in the cytoplasmic fraction and Bax protein in the mitochondrial fraction of CO(2) treated tumors, highlighting the involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis. These data indicate that transcutaneous application of CO(2) may represent a novel therapeutic tool in the treatment of human MFH."

Saunders ( = Laminaria japonica Aresch.), with macroscopic monoecious sporophytes and microscopic diecious gametophytes. Female gametophytes are genetically different from males. It is very difficult to identify the parent of a sporophyte using only routine cytological techniques due to homomorphic chromosomes. A sex-specific marker is one of the best ways to make this determination.To obtain clear images, chromosome preparation was improved using maceration enzymes and fluorochrome 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The chromosome number of both male and female haploid gametophytes was 31, and there were 62 chromosomes in diploid sporophytes. Although the female chromosomes ranged from 0.77 µm to 2.61 µm in size and were larger than the corresponding ones in the males (from 0.57 µm to 2.16 µm), there was not a very large X chromosome in the females. Based on the known female-related FRML-494 marker, co-electrophoresis and Southern blot profiles demonstrated that it was inheritable and specific to female gametophytes. Using modified fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), this marker could be localized on one unique chromosome of the female gametophytes as well as the sporophytes, whereas no hybridization signal was detected in the male gametophytes.Our data suggest that this marker was a female chromosome-specific DNA sequence. This is the first report of molecular marker localization on algal chromosomes. This research provides evidence for the benefit of using FISH for identifying molecular markers for sex identification, isolation of specific genes linked to this marker in the females, and sex determination of S. japonica gametophytes in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2012154629,"Under certain circumstances such as lack of information or bounded rationality, human players can take decisions on which strategy to choose in a game on the basis of simple opinions. These opinions can be modified after each round by observing own or others payoff results but can be also modified after interchanging impressions with other players. In this way, the update of the strategies can become a question that goes beyond simple evolutionary rules based on fitness and become a social issue. In this work, we explore this scenario by coupling a game with an opinion dynamics model. The opinion is represented by a continuous variable that corresponds to the certainty of the agents respect to which strategy is best. The opinions transform into actions by making the selection of an strategy a stochastic event with a probability regulated by the opinion. A certain regard for the previous round payoff is included but the main update rules of the opinion are given by a model inspired in social interchanges. We find that the dynamics fixed points of the coupled model is different from those of the evolutionary game or the opinion models alone. Furthermore, new features emerge such as the resilience of the fraction of cooperators to the topology of the social interaction network or to the presence of a small fraction of extremist players."
https://openalex.org/W2077628441,"The introduction of the term 'Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP)-like proteins' is suggested. They constitute a eukaryotic protein superfamily, characterized by the presence of the p25alpha domain (Pfam05517, IPR008907), and named after the first identified member, TPPP/p25, exhibiting microtubule stabilizing function. TPPP-like proteins can be grouped on the basis of two characteristics: the length of their p25alpha domain, which can be long, short, truncated or partial, and the presence or absence of additional domain(s). TPPPs, in the strict sense, contain no other domains but one long or short p25alpha one (long- and short-type TPPPs, respectively). Proteins possessing truncated p25alpha domain are first described in this paper. They evolved from the long-type TPPPs and can be considered as arthropod-specific paralogs of long-type TPPPs. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the two groups (long-type and truncated TPPPs) split in the common ancestor of arthropods. Incomplete p25alpha domains can be found in multidomain TPPP-like proteins as well. The various subfamilies occur with a characteristic phyletic distribution: e. g., animal genomes/proteomes contain almost without exception long-type TPPPs; the multidomain apicortins occur almost exclusively in apicomplexan parasites. There are no data about the physiological function of these proteins except two human long-type TPPP paralogs which are involved in developmental processes of the brain and the musculoskeletal system, respectively. I predict that the superfamily members containing long or partial p25alpha domain are often intrinsically disordered proteins, while those with short or truncated domain(s) are structurally ordered. Interestingly, members of this superfamily connected or maybe connected to diseases are intrinsically disordered proteins."

A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay showed that PUB20 interacted with AGB1 in the nuclei and the cytosol. The expression levels of PUB20 and its closest homolog, PUB21 were stable under many conditions. GUS driven by the PUB20 promoter was active in anthers, pollen, premature seeds and receptacles and GUS driven by the PUB21 promoter was active in anthers and funiculi. PUB20 was found to have autoubiquitination activity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2089559943,"The Sec61 translocon of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane forms an aqueous pore, allowing polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into membranes. Protein translocation into the ER can occur co- and posttranslationally. In yeast, posttranslational translocation involves the heptameric translocase complex including its Sec62p and Sec63p subunits. The mammalian ER membrane contains orthologs of yeast Sec62p and Sec63p, but their function is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the effects of excess and deficit Sec63 on various ER cargoes using human cell culture systems. The overexpression of Sec63 reduces the steady-state levels of viral and cellular multi-spanning membrane proteins in a cotranslational mode, while soluble and single-spanning ER reporters are not affected. Consistent with this, the knock-down of Sec63 increases the steady-state pools of polytopic ER proteins, suggesting a substrate-specific and regulatory function of Sec63 in ER import. Overexpressed Sec63 exerts its down-regulating activity on polytopic protein levels independent of its Sec62-interacting motif, indicating that it may not act in conjunction with Sec62 in human cells. The specific action of Sec63 is further sustained by our observations that the up-regulation of either Sec62 or two other ER proteins with lumenal J domains, like ERdj1 and ERdj4, does not compromise the steady-state level of a multi-spanning membrane reporter. A J domain-specific mutation of Sec63, proposed to weaken its interaction with the ER resident BiP chaperone, reduces the down-regulating capacity of excess Sec63, suggesting an involvement of BiP in this process. Together, these results suggest that Sec63 may perform a substrate-selective quantity control function during cotranslational ER import."
https://openalex.org/W2101708659,"The pattern of binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 16 epitopes on human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) comprise a conformational ACE fingerprint and is a sensitive marker of subtle protein conformational changes.Toxic substances in the blood of patients with uremia due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) can induce local conformational changes in the ACE protein globule and alter the efficacy of ACE inhibitors.The recognition of ACE by 16 mAbs to the epitopes on the N and C domains of ACE was estimated using an immune-capture enzymatic plate precipitation assay. The precipitation pattern of blood ACE by a set of mAbs was substantially influenced by the presence of ACE inhibitors with the most dramatic local conformational change noted in the N-domain region recognized by mAb 1G12. The ""short"" ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (tripeptide analog) and ""long"" inhibitor teprotide (nonapeptide) produced strikingly different mAb 1G12 binding with enalaprilat strongly increasing mAb 1G12 binding and teprotide decreasing binding. Reduction in S-S bonds via glutathione and dithiothreitol treatment increased 1G12 binding to blood ACE in a manner comparable to enalaprilat. Some patients with uremia due to ESRD exhibited significantly increased mAb 1G12 binding to blood ACE and increased ACE activity towards angiotensin I accompanied by reduced ACE inhibition by inhibitory mAbs and ACE inhibitors.The estimation of relative mAb 1G12 binding to blood ACE detects a subpopulation of ESRD patients with conformationally changed ACE, which activity is less suppressible by ACE inhibitors. This parameter may potentially serve as a biomarker for those patients who may need higher concentrations of ACE inhibitors upon anti-hypertensive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2001381161,"Agonist responses and channel kinetics of native α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are modulated by transmembrane accessory proteins. Stargazin, the prototypical accessory protein, decreases desensitization and increases agonist potency at AMPA receptors. Furthermore, in the presence of stargazin, the steady-state responses of AMPA receptors show a gradual decline at higher glutamate concentrations. This ""autoinactivation"" has been assigned to physical dissociation of the stargazin-AMPA receptor complex and suggested to serve as a protective mechanism against overactivation. Here, we analyzed autoinactivation of GluA1-A4 AMPA receptors (all flip isoform) expressed in the presence of stargazin. Homomeric GluA1, GluA3, and GluA4 channels showed pronounced autoinactivation indicated by the bell-shaped steady-state dose response curves for glutamate. In contrast, homomeric GluA2i channels did not show significant autoinactivation. The resistance of GluA2 to autoinactivation showed striking dependence on the splice form as GluA2-flop receptors displayed clear autoinactivation. Interestingly, the resistance of GluA2-flip containing receptors to autoinactivation was transferred onto heteromeric receptors in a dominant fashion. To examine the relationship of autoinactivation to physical separation of stargazin from the AMPA receptor, we analyzed a GluA4-stargazin fusion protein. Notably, the covalently linked complex and separately expressed proteins expressed a similar level of autoinactivation. We conclude that autoinactivation is a subunit and splice form dependent property of AMPA receptor-stargazin complexes, which involves structural rearrangements within the complex rather than any physical dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2036100957,"TVP1022, the S-enantiomer of rasagiline (Azilect®) (N-propargyl-1R-aminoindan), exerts cyto/cardio-protective effects in a variety of experimental cardiac and neuronal models. Previous studies have demonstrated that the protective activity of TVP1022 and other propargyl derivatives involve the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In the current study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of action and signaling pathways of TVP1022 which may account for the cyto/cardio-protective efficacy of the drug. Using specific receptor binding and enzyme assays, we demonstrated that the imidazoline 1 and 2 binding sites (I(1) & I(2)) are potential targets for TVP1022 (IC(50) =9.5E-08 M and IC(50) =1.4E-07 M, respectively). Western blotting analysis showed that TVP1022 (1-20 µM) dose-dependently increased the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated p42 and p44 MAPK in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). This effect of TVP1022 was significantly attenuated by efaroxan, a selective I(1) imidazoline receptor antagonist. In addition, the cytoprotective effect of TVP1022 demonstrated in NRVM against serum deprivation-induced toxicity was markedly inhibited by efaroxan, thus suggesting the importance of I(1)imidazoline receptor in mediating the cardioprotective activity of the drug. Our findings suggest that the I(1)imidazoline receptor represents a novel site of action for the cyto/cardio-protective efficacy of TVP1022."
https://openalex.org/W1990173693,"p53 is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in >50% of human cancers, while p53 deficiency in mice results in cancers and accelerated mortality. Thymic T cell lymphoma is the most common malignancy in p53-deficient mice, making it difficult to study the role of p53 in other malignancies. To overcome this limitation, we attempted to generate mice with a reversible p53 knockout (p53rev/rev) by inserting a floxed transcriptional stop into the first exon of p53, anticipating that this would allow tissue-specific Cre-mediated expression of p53. Contrary to expectations, functional p53 protein was expressed in the thymus and multiple other tissues of p53rev/rev mice in the absence of Cre, whereas B cells expressed p53 protein only in the presence of B cell-specific CD19-Cre. In the absence of Cre, 76% of p53rev/rev mice developed splenic marginal zone B cell lymphomas, indicating sensitivity of this B cell subset to transformation caused by p53 deficiency. 5′-RACE identified p53 mRNA transcribed from a novel start site utilized in thymocytes but not normal B cells or B cell lymphomas from p53rev/rev mice. The p53rev/rev mouse thus demonstrates an effect of p53 deficiency in development of splenic marginal zone lymphomas and provides a model for study of p53-deficient human B cell lymphomas."

Under strict sterile conditions the strain could successfully nodulate Acacia confusa, A. crassicarpa and A. mangium, with nitrogenase activity ranging from 18.90 to 19.86 nmol·g−1·min−1. In the phylogenetic tree based on a complete 16S rRNA gene sequence, the sequence of strain D5 shared 99% homology with that of four species of genus Pseudomonas. The 685 bp nodA fragment amplified from strain D5 shared 95% homology with the nodA sequence of 9 species of genus Bradyrhizobium, with a genetic distance of 0.01682. The 740 bp nifH gene fragment was amplified from strain D5. This strain D5 nifH gene and Bradyrhizobium spp. formed a branch, showing 98% homology and a genetic distance of 0. The homology between this branch and the Bradyrhizobium spp. DG in another branch was 99%, with a genetic distance of 0.007906. These results indicate that this strain D5 is a new type of nitrogen-fixing bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1965006438,"While humans are capable of mentally transcending the here and now, this faculty for mental time travel (MTT) is dependent upon an underlying cognitive representation of time. To this end, linguistic, cognitive and behavioral evidence has revealed that people understand abstract temporal constructs by mapping them to concrete spatial domains (e.g. past=backward, future=forward). However, very little research has investigated factors that may determine the topographical characteristics of these spatiotemporal maps. Guided by the imperative role of episodic content for retrospective and prospective thought (i.e., MTT), here we explored the possibility that the spatialization of time is influenced by the amount of episodic detail a temporal unit contains. In two experiments, participants mapped temporal events along mediolateral (Experiment 1) and anterioposterior (Experiment 2) spatial planes. Importantly, the temporal units varied in self-relevance as they pertained to temporally proximal or distal events in the participant's own life, the life of a best friend or the life of an unfamiliar other. Converging evidence from both experiments revealed that the amount of space used to represent time varied as a function of target (self, best friend or unfamiliar other) and temporal distance. Specifically, self-time was represented as occupying more space than time pertaining to other targets, but only for temporally proximal events. These results demonstrate the malleability of space-time mapping and suggest that there is a self-specific conceptualization of time that may influence MTT as well as other temporally relevant cognitive phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1998605382,"Genomic data from micro-array and sequencing projects consist of associations of measured values to chromosomal coordinates. These associations can be thought of as functions in one dimension and can thus be stored, analyzed, and interpreted as piecewise-polynomial curves. We present a general framework for building piecewise polynomial representations of genome-scale signals and illustrate some of its applications via examples. We show that piecewise constant segmentation, a typical step in copy-number analyses, can be carried out within this framework for both array and (DNA) sequencing data offering advantages over existing methods in each case. Higher-order polynomial curves can be used, for example, to detect trends and/or discontinuities in transcription levels from RNA-seq data. We give a concrete application of piecewise linear functions to diagnose and quantify alignment quality at exon borders (splice sites). Our software (source and object code) for building piecewise polynomial models is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/locsmoc/."
