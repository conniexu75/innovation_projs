https://openalex.org/W2044474088,"The concept of working memory is central to theories of human cognition because working memory is essential to such human skills as language comprehension and deductive reasoning. Working memory is thought to be composed of two parts, a set of buffers that temporarily store information in either a phonological or visuospatial form, and a central executive responsible for various computations such as mental arithmetic. Although most data on working memory come from behavioural studies of normal and brain-injured humans, there is evidence about its physiological basis from invasive studies of monkeys. Here we report positron emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral blood flow in normal humans that reveal activation in right-hemisphere prefrontal, occipital, parietal and premotor cortices accompanying spatial working memory processes. These results begin to uncover the circuitry of a working memory system in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1500109515,"Acidic phosphorylated proteins have been shown to be prominent constituents of the extracellular matrix of bone and dentin. The acidic phosphoproteins of bone contain more glutamic acid than aspartic acid and a lower serine content than either. On the other hand, the major dentin acidic phosphoproteins, phosphophoryns, have been defined as aspartic acid- and serine-rich proteins, with a lesser content of glutamic acid. Both sets of phosphoproteins have been implicated as key participants in regulating mineralization, but it has been difficult to unify their mechanisms of action. We have now identified, by cDNA cloning, a new serine-rich acidic protein of the dentin matrix, AG1, with a composition intermediate between the bone acidic proteins and dentin phosphophoryns. AG1 has numerous acidic consensus sites for phosphorylation by both casein kinases I and II. Immunochemical and organ culture biosynthetic studies show that AG1 is present in phosphorylated form at low levels in the dentin matrix. If fully phosphorylated, AG1 would bear a net charge of -175/molecule of 473 residues. AG1 contains single RGD integrin binding and N-glycosylation sequences. The overall picture that emerges is that of a matrix-associated acidic phosphoprotein, with a potentially high calcium ion binding capacity, present at levels compatible with a regulatory role in dentin mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1672750600,"To evaluate their usefulness as chemical indicators of cumulative oxidative damage to proteins, we studied the kinetics and extent of formation of ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr), dityrosine (DT), and dityrosine-like fluorescence (Ex = 317 nm, Em = 407 nm) in the model proteins RNase and lysozyme exposed to radiolytic and metal-catalyzed (H2O2/Cu2+) oxidation (MCO). Although there were protein-dependent differences, o-Tyr, DT, and fluorescence increased coordinately during oxidation of the proteins in both oxidation systems. The contribution of DT to total dityrosine-like fluorescence in oxidized proteins varied from 2-100%, depending on the protein, type of oxidation, and extent of oxidative damage. In proteins exposed to MCO, DT typically accounted for > 50% of the fluorescence at DT wavelengths. These studies indicate that o-Tyr and DT should be useful chemical markers of cumulative exposure of proteins to MCO in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1588262878,"When reconstituted with cytochrome b5 and NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, cytochrome P450 2E1 metabolized lauric, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid to multiple metabolites. Two major metabolites, accounting for 78% of the total metabolism, were produced with arachidonic acid. The Vmax for total metabolite formation from arachidonic acid was 5 nmol/min/nmol P450 with an apparent Km of 62 microM. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified the two major metabolites as monohydroxylated eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). The major HETE was 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE) and comprised 46% of the total metabolite produced. The second metabolite was the omega-2 hydroxylated metabolite (18-HETE) and comprised 32% of the total product formed. Chiral analysis demonstrated that 19-HETE was 70% 19(S)-HETE and 30% 19(R)-HETE. In contrast, 18-HETE was essentially 100% R isomer. Approximately 18% of the total metabolite produced from arachidonic acid coeluted with epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) standards. The EET metabolites were 56.4% 14,15-EET and 43.6% as a mixture of 11,12-EET and 8,9-EET. 5,6-EET was not detected. Anti-P450 2E1 IgG inhibited arachidonic acid metabolism by renal and hepatic microsomes prepared from acetone-treated rabbits. With renal cortex microsomes, the formation of 18-HETE and 19-HETE was inhibited 67 and 25%, respectively, by the antibody. Liver microsomal formation of 18-HETE was inhibited by 87% and 19-HETE by 70%. Thus, under conditions where cytochrome P450 2E1 is induced, the enzyme could contribute significantly to the formation of the omega-1 and omega-2 hydroxylated metabolites of arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1595899260,"Biopesticides based on the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis have attracted wide attention as safe alternatives to chemical pesticides. In this paper, we report, for the first time, the identification and purification of a single binding protein from a lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, that is specific for a cryIA toxin of B. thuringiensis. The purified protein appeared as a single band of 210 kDa on a two-dimensional gel, had a pI of approximately 5.5, and stained with Schiff's reagent. The band material was sensitive to proteolytic digestion and was rich with acidic amino acids, indicating its protein nature. Radiolabeled toxin bound to the protein with a Kd value of 708 pM and could be specifically blocked by unlabeled toxin but not by toxins from other subspecies of B. thuringiensis. This study lays the groundwork to clone the toxin binding protein and to determine the molecular mechanism(s) of toxin action."
https://openalex.org/W1479915402,"The molecular chaperone BiP purified from bovine liver (bBiP) exhibits a low basal level of ATPase activity that can be stimulated 3-6-fold by synthetic peptides (Flynn, G. C., Chappell, T. G., and Rothman, J. E. (1989) Science 245, 385-390). By contrast, recombinant murine BiP (rBiP) purified to homogeneity following expression in Escherichia coli exhibits a higher basal level of ATPase activity and is much less stimulated by synthetic peptides. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed that rBiP is predominantly monomeric, while bBiP exists in multiple forms probably corresponding to differentially modified monomeric, dimeric, and higher oligomeric species. Some, but not all, synthetic peptides cause conversion of the oligomeric and modified species of bBiP to a monomeric form. We propose that the peptide-dependent ATPase stimulation observed for BiP reflects the conversion of inactive oligomeric and/or modified species into active monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1571036104,"Vertebrate ferritins are iron storage proteins composed by 24 subunits of one or more types. The recombinant homopolymers of human ferritin H- and L-type chains differ in iron uptake and in physical stability, but the properties of heteropolymers with various proportions of H- and L-type chains cannot be predicted. Present study shows that unfolded human ferritin H- and L- type chains renature under similar conditions to form homopolymers indistinguishable from the native ones and that, when mixed, the unfolded H and L chains renature to form heteropolymers with restricted heterogeneity and with the expected H:L ratios. Seven of these ferritins with different H:L ratios were analyzed; electrophoretic mobility, immunological reactivity, and stability to guanidine denaturation varied as predicted, based on the homopolymers. In contrast, the rate of iron uptake, monitored by the variation of absorbance at 310 nm, increased in the ferritins that ranged in H chain content from 0 to 35%; further increments in H chains had no additional effect. This finding indicates that, under the present conditions, only a limited number of H chains are needed for the maximum rate of ferritin iron uptake. Variations of L- and H-type chains in vivo may thus have biological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1548309530,"To investigate whether the phase preference of Escherichia coli membrane lipids is regulated by adjustment of the ratio of bilayer to non-bilayer lipids, the lipid biosynthetic mutant AD93 was used. This strain lacks the ability to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine, a non-bilayer lipid which normally accounts for 70-80% of the phospholipids in the E. coli membrane. The lack of phosphatidylethanolamine is compensated by a large increase in the levels of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. This strain has an absolute requirement for high concentrations of divalent cations. Since divalent cations are known to induce HII phase formation in cardiolipin model systems, this suggests that cardiolipin in combination with divalent cations replaces phosphatidylethanolamine in the membrane and that it is the non-bilayer forming property of the latter which is important for membrane functioning. The growth of the mutant strain was found to be dependent on the type and concentration of divalent cations present in the growth medium. In media supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2, growth was maximal at concentrations of 30-50 mM. In the presence of SrCl2 a growth optimum was observed at 15 mM. The cells did not grow in the presence of BaCl2 or at high concentrations of SrCl2. Furthermore, this strain was found to adapt the lipid composition of the membrane in reaction to the type of cation present during growth. The phase behavior of dispersions of mutant and parental E. coli derived lipids was studied under a variety of conditions, using 31P NMR. In the presence of the growth-promoting cations at concentrations where there is maximal growth, a bilayer to non-bilayer transition was observed in the lipid dispersions in a narrow temperature range, approximately 10 degrees C above the growth temperature, whereas at concentrations where there is no growth, a bilayer structure was observed at all temperatures tested. This suggests a polymorphic regulation of membrane lipid composition in order to maintain a propensity toward type II structure formation in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1537185729,"Abstract The concentrations of ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr) and dityrosine (DT) were measured in noncataractous human lenses in order to assess the role of protein oxidation reactions in the aging of lens proteins. The measurements were conducted by selected ion monitoring-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using deuterium-labeled internal standards, which provided both high sensitivity and specificity for the quantitation of o-Tyr and DT. Between ages 1 and 78 years, the o-Tyr concentration in lens proteins varied from 0.3 to 0.9 mmol of o-Tyr/mol of Phe (n = 19), while DT ranged from 1 to 3 mumol of DT/mol of Tyr (n = 30). There were no significant changes in levels of o-Tyr with lens age. There was a statistically significant, but only slight, increase in DT in lens proteins with age (approximately 33% increases between ages 1 and 78, r = 0.5, p < 0.01). At the same time, total protein fluorescence, measured at DT wavelengths (Ex = 317 nm, Em = 407 nm), increased 11-fold between ages 1 and 78 and correlated strongly with age (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Although the fluorescence maxima of lens proteins were similar to those of DT, DT accounted for less than 1% of the DT-like fluorescence in lens protein at all ages. These observations indicate that oxidation of Phe and Tyr plays a limited role in the normal aging of lens proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1519104903,"Transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene is induced in response to increased carbohydrate metabolism in the liver. We have demonstrated previously that a segment of the 5'-flanking region of the L-PK gene between -183 and -96 is necessary and sufficient for the glucose response in primary hepatocytes. To explore the protein factors that are involved in carbohydrate regulation, we have performed mutational analyses and in vitro binding studies of this segment. Sequences critical for the glucose response were mapped from -171 to -124. This segment contains the consensus binding sites for two nuclear transcription factors: LF-A1 and MLTF. Both factors are capable of binding to the corresponding L-PK sites in vitro. Mutational and functional analyses indicated that LF-A1 is indeed involved in glucose induction of the L-PK gene. The PK MLTF-like site consists of two imperfect CACGTG motifs, the core binding site for a family of transcription factors related to c-myc. Unexpectedly, mutations in either motif that resulted in defective glucose stimulation retained in vitro binding to MLTF. Furthermore, an authentic MLTF binding site from the adenovirus major late promoter was not functionally interchangeable with the natural sequence. These data indicate that binding of MLTF, in presence of LF-A1, is not capable of supporting the glucose response. Conversion of either imperfect motif to CACGTG within the context of the mutations disrupting the opposite site restored the response to elevated glucose. Thus, the factor that recognizes the PK MLTF-like site and participates in mediating the carbohydrate response of the L-PK gene appears to be a member of the c-myc family distinct from MLTF."
https://openalex.org/W1588436096,Neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cell cultures were used to investigate the mechanisms by which insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) up-regulates aortic elastogenesis. The addition of IGF-I (50 ng/ml) to quiescent smooth muscle cell cultures resulted in a 5-fold increase in the steady-state levels of tropoelastin mRNA beginning between 2 and 4 h and reaching maximal levels at 8 h. Addition of cycloheximide blocked the effect of IGF-I. Nuclear run-on transcription analyses of nuclei isolated from IGF-I-treated cells showed increased synthesis of new tropoelastin transcripts indicating that transcriptional activation is a major component of IGF-I up-regulation. Transient transfections with deletion constructs containing different portions of the elastin 5'-upstream region localized the IGF-I-responsive area to sequences between -195 and -136 base pairs and further showed that this region contains a negative element. Gel retardation assays using nuclear proteins extracted from control and IGF-I-treated cells demonstrated that IGF-I treatment results in the loss of binding complexes. Footprint analyses of specific binding complexes affected by IGF-I show the deprotection of two closely positioned sequences spanning positions -165 to -137 base pairs. These results suggest that IGF-I up-regulation of elastogenesis involves the abrogation of a negative element functionality.
https://openalex.org/W1521301888,"Sorting of the newly synthesized membrane-bound precursor of lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) involves internalization from the plasma membrane via clathrin-coated pits. Using an in vitro system, we present direct evidence for high affinity interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of LAP with the amino-terminal trunk portion of plasma membrane-coated vesicle adaptors. Coated vesicle adaptors of the trans-Golgi network displayed poor binding to LAP, but high affinity binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which is included in clathrin-coated pits of the trans-Golgi network. Binding of plasma membrane adaptors to the tail peptide of LAP required an internalization signal that contains either tyrosine or phenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1525583184,"S-100 protein, a Ca(2+)-binding protein of the EF-hand type, interacts with the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The binding of S-100 protein to GFAP was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy using acrylodan-S-100 protein and cross-linking experiments using the bifunctional cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate. The binding affinity was observed to be in the nanomolar range with a stoichiometry of 2 mol of GFAP/mol of S-100 protein (dimer). S-100 protein was found to inhibit the polymerization of GFAP in a dose- and Ca(2+)-dependent manner, with a half-maximal effect at an S-100 protein/GFAP molar ratio of 0.2 and maximal effect at a molar ratio of 0.5. Identical results were obtained irrespective of whether the unfractionated bovine brain S-100 protein mixture (S-100a plus S-100b), S-100ao, S-100a, or S-100b was used. S-100 protein was observed to be maximally effective as an inhibitor of GFAP polymerization at approximately 3 microM free Ca2+. Calmodulin neither bound to GFAP nor inhibited its polymerization. Altogether, the present results suggest that S-100 protein might be involved in the regulation of the state of assembly of glial filaments by binding to and sequestering unpolymerized GFAP."
https://openalex.org/W2142750016,"In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) secretion in response to the change of intracellular cholesteryl ester contents by adding low density lipoprotein (LDL) and an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (pravastatin) in rabbit hepatocyte culture system. LDL caused a significant dose-dependent increase in apoB secretion. On the other hand, the addition of pravastatin decreased apoB secretion significantly. LDL caused a dose-dependent increase in cellular cholesteryl ester, while cellular cholesteryl ester was decreased by pravastatin significantly. Therefore, these results indicate that the change of apoB secretion was in parallel with the change of cellular cholesteryl ester contents. Cellular contents of free cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid did not change. To investigate intracellular degradation of apoB prior to secretion, pulse-chase experiments were performed. It was shown that the addition of pravastatin accelerated intracellular degradation of apoB, while LDL slowed the apoB intracellular degradation rate. We also investigated whether the change of cellular cholesteryl ester could affect the apoB mRNA level. Northern blot analysis and solution hybridization RNase protection assay demonstrated that neither LDL nor pravastatin caused a significant change in cellular apoB mRNA level. We conclude that intracellular cholesteryl ester contents play a critical role in apoB secretion, and the intracellular apoB degradation rate could be the main mechanism that regulates apoB secretion in response to the change of intracellular cholesteryl ester level."
https://openalex.org/W1485158076,"Abstract Elongation factor SII is required to increase the efficiency of transcription by RNA polymerase II through intrinsic arrest sites. RNA polymerase II ternary complexes exhibit a ribonuclease activity in the presence of SII, truncating nascent transcripts in a 3'-->5' direction. We show here that transcript cleavage is an obligatory step in re-establishing the elongation competency of complexes that have become blocked in elongation at an intrinsic arrest site. SII-facilitated transcript cleavage by these arrested complexes released 7-14 nucleotide RNA fragments. In contrast, SII-facilitated transcript cleavage by elongation competent complexes, which are stalled because of the absence of a nucleoside triphosphate from the reaction mixture, occurred primarily in dinucleotide increments. We can partially recreate the arrested phenotype and the preference for the large cleavage increment by stalling ternary complexes such that the 3'-end of the transcript contains consecutive U residues, which mimics the sequence of the 3'-ends of transcripts in arrested complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1587234113,"Iodination of fasciculin 3 (FAS3) from Dendroaspis viridis venom provided us with a fully active specific probe of fasciculin binding sites on rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Binding and inhibition are concomitant, as association and inhibition rate constants k1 and ki are identical. The 125I-FAS3.AChE complex dissociates very slowly (t 1/2 = 48 h) and is characterized by a dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.4 pM. All the specific binding of 125I-FAS3 to AChE is prevented by FAS3 as from D. angusticeps venom (Kd = 0.4, 14, and 25 pM, respectively). It is also prevented by propidium iodide, BW284C51, and d-tubocurarine, which bind to peripheral anionic sites of AChE, by Ca2+ and Mg2+, known to enhance AChE activity through an allosteric phenomenon and by acetylthiocholine concentrations which lead to excess substrate inhibition of the enzyme. Diisopropyl fluorphosphate and paroxon, which inhibit AChE by phosphorylating the catalytic serine, have no effect on either the binding rate or the number of binding sites of 125I-FAS3. O-Ethyl-S2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothionate, however, which binds irreversibly to the AChE catalytic site but reversibly to a peripheral site, induces a 130% increase in the binding rate of 125I-FAS3, without changing the total number of 125I-FAS3 binding sites. Our results demonstrate that fasciculins bind on a peripheral site of AChE, distinct from the catalytic site and, at least partly, common with the sites on which some cationic inhibitors and the substrate in excess bind. Since phosphorylation of the catalytic serine (esteratic subsite) by [1,3-3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate can still occur on the FAS3.AChE complex, the structural modification induced by fasciculins may affect the anionic subsite of AChE catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1520810257,"The 52-nucleotide 5'-untranslated region of the human erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA contains a 28-nucleotide iron-responsive element-like stem-loop motif. We fused the 5'-untranslated region upstream to the coding sequence of the human growth hormone cDNA. A chimeric construct containing a mutated variant of the presumptive iron-responsive element was similarly synthesized. Translation of the wild type chimeric transcript was markedly repressed (approximately 95%) in rabbit reticulocyte lysates as opposed to the mutant. Both transcripts translated with comparable efficiency in wheat germ extracts. Purified placental iron regulatory factor selectively and markedly inhibited translation of the wild type chimeric transcript (> 90%) when tested in wheat germ extracts. By contrast, translations of either the mutant chimeric transcript or other control mRNA species were unaffected. The proximal position of the iron-responsive element relative to the cap site was shown to be important for translational control, in vitro. Our studies suggest that interaction of the iron regulatory factor with the iron-responsive element sterically hinders formation of the preinitiation complex, resulting in translational repression. Thus inactivation of the repressor protein by critical levels of iron or heme would trigger translation of this mRNA in erythroid cells. Consequently, protoporphyrin and heme synthesis would be subtly coordinated with iron supply."

https://openalex.org/W120074575,"The association of nuclear DNA with the nuclear matrix (scaffold) is mediated by defined segments of DNA called matrix association region (MAR). By using a plasmid harboring a portion of the Ig kappa gene within which MAR had been located, we searched for proteins recognizing MAR in the nuclear scaffold components electrophoretically separated and blotted onto a membrane. In the presence of nonspecific competitor DNA, the labeled plasmid selectively bound to a protein with apparent molecular weight of 120,000 (designated SP120). The protein was purified directly from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and renatured by a guanidine hydrochloride procedure. The DNA region in the plasmid responsible for the binding to the solubilized SP120 coincided with the 365-base pair HindIII-HinfI fragment that had been identified as MAR. In solution, SP120 exhibited a cooperative mode of interaction with the end-labeled MAR fragment. Measurement of relative affinities of MAR subfragments to SP120 showed that the whole region is required for efficient binding. This is consistent with the minimal length for MAR estimated thus far by in situ mapping experiments. The MAR derived from another gene, fushitarazu, also bound specifically to SP120. Immunostaining of whole cells and isolated nuclei with a monoclonal antibody raised against SP120 indicated that the protein is localized in a nuclear skeletal structure. These results suggest the involvement of SP120 in the MAR-mediated anchorage of nuclear DNA to the nuclear scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W1518023895,"Abstract RNA polymerase II ternary complex cleaves its nascent transcript in a 3'-->5' direction in the presence of elongation factor SII (Izban, M. G., and Luse, D. S. (1992) Genes & Dev. 6, 1342-1356; Reines, D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). We have characterized the cleavage products generated during the truncation process with a variety of stalled RNA polymerase II ternary complexes containing uniformly labeled transcripts. These complexes, which remain elongation competent, had stopped transcription because one nucleoside triphosphate was missing from the reaction mixture. Using a novel assay system, we demonstrate that cleavage occurs in predominantly dinucleotide increments, liberating 5'-phosphodinucleotides (pNpNs). In one instance with a particular C20 complex, the first cleavage event was equally partitioned between either a di-or trinucleotide increment with all subsequent truncations occurring by the preferred dinucleotide step. Our data indicate that both the kinetics and the exact increment of SII-facilitated transcript cleavage are influenced by transcript sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1512964013,"The role of protein kinase C in the mechanism of phospholipase D activation by platelet-derived growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was studied in Swiss/3T3 fibroblasts that overexpress protein kinase C-alpha. Production of [3H]phosphatidylpropanol (specific product of the phospholipase D-catalyzed transphosphatidylation reaction) was determined in cells which were prelabeled with [3H]oleic acid. Accumulation of [3H]phosphatidylpropanol in response to platelet-derived growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was 2-3-fold greater in protein kinase C-alpha-overexpressing SF1.4 cells compared with the vector control cells, SC1. Basal [3H] phosphatidylpropanol production also was 2-fold higher in SF1.4 cells than in SC1 cells. Hence, -fold stimulation of basal phospholipase D activity by platelet-derived growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate was comparable in the two cell lines and was not significantly altered by the overexpression of protein kinase C-alpha. Similarly, overexpression of protein kinase C-alpha did not affect either the kinetics of phospholipase D activation nor its dependence on platelet-derived growth factor or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate concentration. In vitro assay of phospholipase D activity in membranes isolated from the cells, utilizing exogenous [3H]phosphatidylcholine as a substrate, revealed nearly 2-fold higher phospholipase D activity in SF1.4 cell membranes. Kinetic analysis of detergent-solubilized phospholipase D activity indicated that the apparent Vmax and Km of phospholipase D derived from SF1.4 and SF3.2 (protein kinase C-alpha-overexpressing) cells are significantly higher than those of phospholipase D from control cells. These results indicate that in Swiss/3T3 cells overexpression of protein kinase C-alpha elevates basal and agonist-stimulated phospholipase D activity in intact cells as well as phospholipase D activity in vitro. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that overexpression of protein kinase C-alpha up-regulates phospholipase D, leading to a constitutive higher level of enzyme activity. Thus, protein kinase C-alpha may play a role in regulating phospholipase D expression."
https://openalex.org/W1524038318,The high affinity IgE receptor is a multisubunit complex that participates in IgE-dependent activation of mast cells and basophils. The IgE-binding portion of the receptor resides exclusively in the alpha-subunit and specifically within the 180 residues of the mature extracytoplasmic portion. In this study the contiguous two-domain human alpha-subunit has been displayed on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage in a form that specifically binds both human and murine IgE but not other isotypes. Phage display of the individual immunoglobulin-like domains reveals that the IgE-binding portion resides exclusively in the COOH-terminal domain and that this domain appears to bind IgE with lower affinity than the comparably displayed two-domain fragment. Phage display results using a chimeric rat-human alpha-subunit fragment suggest that structural elements within the NH2-terminal domain are necessary to impart high affinity IgE binding activity to the alpha-chain ectodomain. The two-domain human receptor fragment was also expressed in a soluble form from Escherichia coli and purified in one step by affinity chromatography. The solution binding of the purified receptor fragment to IgE was measured by fluorescence quench which afforded an approximate equilibrium affinity constant of 2 x 10(9) M-1 together with a stoichiometry of 1 receptor molecule/molecule of IgE. The complementary approach of phage display and E. coli expression used in this study represents a useful strategy for further analysis of discrete receptor epitope(s) that contribute to IgE binding activity.
https://openalex.org/W1584634864,"Topological structure of quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli was determined by constructing protein fusions with alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase. Analysis of the fusions revealed that the dehydrogenase possesses five membrane-spanning segments, and the N-terminal and C-terminal portions resided at the cytoplasmic and periplasmic side of the membrane, respectively. These results agreed with the hydropathy profile based on its primary structure. The topological structure suggests that the predicted binding site of the prosthetic group pyrroloquinoline quinone is located at the periplasmic side and that the amino acid residues corresponding to those that were presumed to interact with ubiquinone in one subunit of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase also occur at the periplasmic side. When the purified glucose dehydrogenase and cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase were reconstituted together with ubiquinone into liposomes, a membrane potential could be generated by the electron transfer at the site of the ubiquinol oxidase but not of the dehydrogenase. These results suggest that glucose dehydrogenase has a ubiquinone reacting site close to the periplasmic side of the membrane, and thus its electron transfer to ubiquinone appears to be incapable of forming a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1567209145,"Protein synthesis is dramatically reduced upon exposure of cells to elevated temperature. Concordant with this inhibition, multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions occur on specific eukaryotic initiation factors that are required for protein synthesis. Most notably, phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2 alpha) on serine residue 51 occurs. To identify the importance of phosphorylation in control of protein synthesis, we have evaluated the effects of expression of a mutant eIF-2 alpha which is resistant to phosphorylation. Expression of a serine to alanine mutant at residue 51 of eIF-2 alpha partially protected cells from the inhibition of protein synthesis in response to heat treatment. The overexpressed serine to alanine 51 mutant subunit was incorporated into the eIF-2 heterotrimer and was resistant to phosphorylation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that heat shock inhibition of translation is mediated in part through phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. Expression of the wild type or mutant eIF-2 alpha did not affect cell survival or induction of hsp70 mRNA upon heat shock, indicating that although eIF-2 alpha is a heat shock-induced protein, its increased synthesis during heat shock does not alter the heat-shock response."
https://openalex.org/W1544298021,"We have developed an antibody-based DNA binding assay to study the effects of the absence or presence of an estrogen receptor agonist and two antagonists on the thermodynamic binding parameters for estrogen receptor binding to a consensus estrogen response element in vitro. We first demonstrate that antibodies raised against a region of the estrogen receptor directly adjacent to the DNA-binding domain do not interfere with the receptor's ability to preferentially bind to the vitellogenin estrogen response element in plasmid DNA. Exploiting this property to develop a quantitative DNA binding assay, we demonstrate that estrogen is not required for high affinity binding of the receptor for an oligonucleotide containing this element, nor do antiestrogens alter this interaction. In addition, we find that 1 mol of estrogen receptor is complexed with high affinity to 1 mol of vitellogenin estrogen response element, instead of two estrogen receptors/response element as would be predicted if estrogen receptor homodimer formation was required for high affinity DNA binding. Our data best fit a model in which the active estrogen receptor form is a monomer or heterodimer, but not a homodimer, and the regulatory role of estrogen on the estrogen receptor is the induction of protein-protein, but not protein-DNA, interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1602325575,"Intracellular Ca2+ sequestration and Ca2+ release was analyzed in intact rod outer segments (ROS) purified from bovine retinas. Ca2+ influx in Ca(2+)-depleted and fully bleached ROS was mediated exclusively by the Na-Ca+K exchanger and was measured both as a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ with fluo 3 and as a total transmembrane Ca2+ flux with 45Ca. Ca2+ fluxes across the ROS plasma membrane were not completely reversible, in small part due to inactivation of the Ca2+ extrusion mode of the Na-Ca+K exchanger but mostly due to sequestration of cytosolic Ca2+ into the intradiskal space. Ca2+ release from the intradiskal space into the cytosol could be induced by low concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 which gave rise to increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ by several hundred nanomolar (low A23187 concentrations did not affect the Ca2+ permeability of the ROS plasma membrane). We have used intracellular Ca2+ release induced by A23187 to examine inactivation of the rapid Ca2+ efflux mode mediated by the plasma membrane Na-Ca+K exchanger. Inactivation of Na-Ca+K exchange appeared to be dependent on intradiskal Ca2+ as it was abolished by selective Ca2+ permeabilization of the disk membrane by A23187. We discuss possible physiological roles for Ca2+ sequestration and release from ROS disks."
https://openalex.org/W1544794592,"In the present study we investigated the subcellular localization of squalene synthase (farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21). Squalene synthase catalyzes the formation of squalene from trans-farnesyl diphosphate in two distinct steps and is the first committed enzyme for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Recently, a truncated form of the enzyme from rat hepatocytes was purified, and monospecific antibodies for squalene synthase were produced. This enabled the subcellular localization of squalene synthase by three different methods: (i) analytical subcellular fractionation and measurements of enzyme activities; (ii) immunodeterminations of squalene synthase in the isolated subcellular fractions with a monospecific antibody; and (iii) immunoelectron microscopy. All three methods gave consistent results. The data clearly illustrate that squalene synthase enzymatic activity and squalene synthase are exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. In rat hepatic peroxisomes we were not able to detect any squalene synthase. In addition, we also demonstrated that squalene synthase in the microsomal fraction is dramatically regulated by a number of hypolipidemic drugs and dietary treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1490166156,"Suramin inhibits the biological activity of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) through a direct action on the ligand rather than on its receptors (Grazioli, L., Alzani, R., Ciomei, M., Mariani, M., Restivo, A., Cozzi, E., and Marcucci, F. (1992) Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 14, 637-642). In order to clarify the mechanism whereby suramin leads to inhibition of TNF, we investigated the possibility that suramin might modify the quaternary structure of TNF which is biologically active as a trimer. For this purpose we used a new assay (double streptavidin sandwich assay) designed for the rapid detection of oligomer-monomer conversion of proteins. Taking advantage of this assay we observed, upon incubation with suramin, dissociation of TNF. Suramin-induced dissociation of TNF was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography. Under conditions of partial dissociation, two molecular species were separated. One of higher molecular weight, corresponding to trimeric TNF, was biologically active, whereas the other, corresponding to monomeric TNF, was inactive. These results are at variance with others recently reported, where suramin has been shown to induce microaggregation of several polypeptides (Middaugh, C. R., Mach, H., Burke, C. J., Volkin, D. B., Dabora, J. M., Tsai, P. K., Bruner, M. W., Ryan, J. A., and Marfia, K. E. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9016-9024). This suggests that suramin inhibits the bioactivity of different protein molecules through opposite effects on their quaternary structure. The present results are, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a drug inhibiting a target molecule through dissociation of its quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1502392336,"The large molecular size of N-glycosylated lysozyme with a polymannose chain was predominantly expressed in the yeast carrying the lysozyme expression plasmid in 9-fold greater secretion compared with the wild type. Complementary DNA encoding hen egg white lysozyme was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to obtain the Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence that is the signal for asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation. At positions 49, 67, 70, and 103, the signal for N-linked glycosylation was created. Only the mutant lysozyme whose glycine 49 was substituted with asparagine was expressed in the two types of glycosylated forms, a small oligomannose chain (Man18GlcNAc2)-linked form and a large polymannose chain (Man310GlcNAc2)-linked form, whereas other mutants were not glycosylated. The secreted amount of polymannosyl lysozyme was much higher than that of the oligomannosyl lysozyme. Both types of glycosylated lysozymes were susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase cleavage of their carbohydrate chains. The average molecular masses of oligomannosyl and polymannosyl lysozymes were 18 and 71 kDa, respectively. The length of the polymannose chain was found to be 200-350 residues/molecule of lysozyme according to the estimation of the molecular mass distribution by low angle laser light scattering measurements. The protein conformation estimated by CD analysis was completely conserved in these glycosylated lysozymes. The enzymatic activities of oligomannosyl and polymannosyl lysozymes were 100 and 91%, respectively, of wild-type protein when glycol chitin was used as a substrate. In addition, the polymannosyl lysozyme revealed remarkable heat stability in that no coagulation was observed under conditions in which the wild-type lysozyme coagulated. Thus, this novel glycoprotein can be used as a reporter in studies of the processing and sorting of glycoproteins and as a model of the expression of foreign genes in yeast for the construction of stable enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1592461846,"The AMT1 metalloregulatory trans-acting factor from Candida glabrata was found to functionally mimic the ACE1 metalloregulatory trans-acting factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the copper-induced expression of the chromosomal S. cerevisiae metallothionein gene. Plasmid constructs with promoters of various metal-inducible genes fused to the bacterial beta-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene were used in S. cerevisiae to evaluate the roles of ACE1 and AMT1 in mediating metal-stimulated expression. Promoters from the S. cerevisiae CUP1 gene and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and from the C. glabrata MT genes MTI, MTIIa, and MTIIb were used. The ACE1 factor was effective in the metalloregulation of the two S. cerevisiae promoters, CUP1 and SOD1, but of only one C. glabrata promoter, MTI. AMT1 was found to be effective in the metalloregulation of all three C. glabrata MT promoters and the two S. cerevisiae promoters tested. The regulation mediated by both ACE1 and AMT1 was copper-dependent and copper-specific. Episomally expressed SWI5, a distinct trans-acting factor of S. cerevisiae, enhanced only the basal expression from promoters. The SWI5 enhancement was not metal dependent. In conclusion, AMT1 and ACE1 are functionally homologous in metal-specific regulation, AMT1 appears to be more promiscuous than ACE1 in this function."
https://openalex.org/W1522465380,"The effect of zinc ions (Zn(II)) on the activation of factor XII in the absence of a procoagulant surface was investigated by initial velocity kinetic studies at I = 0.15, pH 7.4, and 25 degrees C. Zinc ions at concentrations greater than 160 microM potentiated 99-fold the kcat/KM for the activation of factor XII by kallikrein and, at an optimum concentration of 110 microM, accelerated 140-fold the apparent kcat/KM for factor XII autoactivation. High molecular weight kininogen had no effect on either metal-potentiated reaction. Analysis of the factor XII concentration dependence of initial activation rates revealed that Zn(II), at levels that saturate the effect, accelerates kallikrein activation of factor XII by lowering KM (from 52 to 7.3 microM) and raising kcat (from 2.6 to 31 min-1). For the autocatalytic activation reaction of factor XII in the presence of optimal Zn(II), apparent KM and kcat values of 2.4 microM and 0.041 min-1, respectively, were determined, but these parameters were not resolvable in the absence of the metal ion. Zinc ions minimally affected kallikrein enzymatic activity and inhibited factor XIIa enzymatic activity with KI values of 20-40 microM, suggesting that the rate-enhancing effects of the metal ion are due to interactions with the substrate (factor XII) rather than with the enzyme. The Zn(II) inhibition of factor XIIa enzymatic activity accounted for a decreased Zn(II) enhancement of factor XII autoactivation at high metal ion concentrations (> 110 microM). The Zn(II) concentration dependence of the acceleration of factor XII activation reactions were sigmoid and characterized by Hill coefficients of 3.3-4.3, suggesting that cooperative binding of at least four zinc ions to factor XII was responsible for the Zn(II) potentiating effect. The Zn(II) enhancement of the rates of factor XII activation decreased both above and below pH 7.4 with midpoint pH values of 6.5-7.0 and 8.0, consistent with histidine and possibly water ligands mediating Zn(II) binding to the protein. Despite an apparent weaker binding of Zn(II) to factor XII at pH 6.5, indistinguishable maximum accelerating effects of the metal ion were observed at saturation at this pH, indicating that the increased positive charge of factor XII resulting from protonation at the lower pH did not mimic the effect of Zn(II) binding. These results imply that zinc ions induce a conformational change in factor XII that makes it a better substrate for its enzyme activators."
https://openalex.org/W1555306412,"The possibility that sphingosine or a related metabolite could mediate inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (1,4,5-IP3)-independent Ca2+ release in pancreatic acinar cells was investigated. In intact rat pancreatic acini superfused at 37 degrees C, sphingosine (10-100 microM) evoked, after a delay of several minutes, an increase in the cytosolic [Ca2+]i which was oscillatory below concentrations of 50 microM. At room temperature no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed. The increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by sphingosine was not inhibited by U73122, and thus was unlikely to be due to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis. Furthermore, no PI hydrolysis or 1,4,5-IP3 production was detected on incubation with sphingosine. As metabolism of sphingosine could explain the temperature-dependent action, the effects of sphingosine and related sphingoid bases were tested in permeabilized cells. After a delay of 30 s at 37 degrees C, sphingosine evoked a slow increase in [Ca2+] into the medium. In contrast, addition of sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) resulted in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]. This response was mimicked by 1,4,5-IP3 but not by addition of sphingosine phosphate (1-10 microM), ceramide (30 microM), or sphingomyelin (50 micrograms/ml). SPC appeared to induce release of Ca2+ from the same store as 1,4,5-IP3, as SPC failed to evoke any further increase in Ca2+ from cells previously depleted by addition of a maximal concentration of 2,4,5-IP3 or thapsigargin. 1,4,5-IP3 but not SPC-induced Ca2+ release was blocked by heparin, indicating that SPC-induced Ca2+ release was not mediated through the IP3 receptor-channel complex. This study demonstrates that SPC, a sphingosine metabolite, could be responsible for IP3-independent Ca2+ oscillations previously seen in pancreatic acinar cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593758392,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to introduce specific amino acid changes into the photosystem I reaction center in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Plasmids containing mutated copies of the chloroplast psaB gene, encoding a polypeptide of the photosystem I reaction center heterodimer, were introduced into the chloroplast genome by particle bombardment. Successful transformants were selected by two procedures. The first involved complementation of a nonphotosynthetic mutant of Chlamydomonas, CC-2341 (ac-u-g-2.3), which has a frameshift mutation in the psaB gene, and selection of photosynthetic transformants on minimal medium. The second procedure utilized a co-transformation procedure with a plasmid containing a rRNA gene that confers spectinomycin resistance. Homologous replacement of the psaB gene was confirmed by screening for a unique restriction enzyme site within the transforming psaB sequences. These procedures have been used to specifically mutate a highly conserved proline-cysteine motif suggested to be important in coordinating the [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur center Fx. Our results show that the cysteine is essential for assembly of the photosystem I reaction center although the adjacent proline fulfills no identifiable function. The approach described in this paper will be of value to future studies of the structure, function, and assembly of photosystem I."
https://openalex.org/W1513749471,"To determine the role of Zn(II)-factor XII interactions in the rate-enhancing effect of Zn(II) on factor XII activation demonstrated in the preceding paper, equilibrium binding of zinc ions to factor XII, and the spectroscopic changes accompanying this binding were investigated. Equilibrium dialysis provided direct evidence for the binding of Zn(II) to factor XII. The binding data were consistent with 7.8 +/- 0.3 zinc ions binding with an indistinguishable Kd of 91 +/- 6 microM. Binding of Zn(II) was accompanied by a 10% quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence and a 2-nm red shift of the wavelength of maximum emission. These spectroscopic changes were specific for factor XII and were not observed with factor XIIa. The Zn(II) concentration dependence of factor XII fluorescence quenching was sigmoid and paralleled the Zn(II)-accelerating effect of factor XII activation by kallikrein and factor XIIa, indicating that the spectral change was reporting Zn(II)-factor XII interactions responsible for the enhanced activation rate. The apparent cooperativity of Zn(II) effects on factor XII fluorescence quenching and activation kinetics, and the apparent noncooperativity in Zn(II) binding to factor XII measured by equilibrium dialysis could be explained by a two-state model in which Zn(II) binding is linked to a conformational change in the protein. The Zn(II)-induced quenching of factor XII fluorescence exhibited a pH dependence consistent with the involvement of histidine residues in the binding of Zn(II). Dynamic quenching of factor XII protein fluorescence by iodide or acrylamide, in the absence and presence of Zn(II), revealed heterogeneity in the environment of the 13 tryptophan residues of factor XII that was markedly reduced by metal ion binding. Together, these results indicate that cooperative interactions of Zn(II) with factor XII induce structural changes in the zymogen that facilitate its proteolytic cleavage and activation."
https://openalex.org/W1625528736,"The transferrin receptor is a cell surface protein and is responsible for the uptake of iron into many eukaryotic cells. In its mature form, the receptor possesses three asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. The effect of asparagine-linked glycosylation on the processing and cell surface localization of the human transferrin receptor is examined here by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the extracellular consensus sequences (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) for asparagine-linked glycosylation was mutated individually and in all possible combinations. The constructs were transfected stably into NIH-3T3 cells and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking endogenous transferrin receptors. Of the seven possible combinations of glycosylation sites, single mutations eliminating glycosylation at either Asn251 or Asn317 do not affect the processing and surface localization of the receptor. Eliminating both of these sites together has a small effect on the behavior of the receptor. However, mutation of the C-terminal glycosylation site (Asn727) has the most profound negative effect on the appearance of the receptor at the cell surface. The mutants lacking glycosylation at Asn727 appear to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as an increased association with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is observed. Addition of a new glycosylation site in the C-terminal region of the unglycosylated mutated transferrin receptor restores the cell surface localization and the transferrin binding of the transferrin receptor, indicating that glycosylation in this region is critical for the correct transport of this receptor to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1485637500,"The detergent extract of rabbit liver microsomes contains an endopeptidase (MEP) with substrate specificity for peptides containing Arg residues at the P1 and P4 positions in the cleavage site (Kawabata, S., and Davie, E. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10331-10336). These sequences occur in many proproteins such as the vitamin K-dependent proproteins and prohormones. A cDNA coding for MEP has been obtained from three overlapping clones isolated from two rabbit liver lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. The longest open reading frame of the 3507-base pair cDNA codes for a protein of 704 amino acids, of which 406 residues were confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis. MEP contains a putative active site of -His-Glu-X-X-His-, which is typical of mammalian zinc metallopeptidases. Based on a hydropathy plot, MEP is a hydrophilic protein with no transmembrane domain and no NH2-terminal signal sequence. Amino acid sequence analysis identified Asn at the three potential N-glycosylation sites in the enzyme, indicating that MEP contains no N-linked sugar. MEP is homologous with rat testes metalloendopeptidase 24.15 (60% identity), rat mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (24% identity), Escherichia coli dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (25% identity), and the open reading frame YCL57w present in yeast chromosome III (35% identity)."
https://openalex.org/W1531787215,"Histidine-containing protein, HPr, of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system has an active site His-15 that is phosphorylated to form N delta 1-P-histidine. The nearby conserved residue, Arg-17, has been replaced by: lysine, histidine, glutamate, glycine, serine, and cysteine. All mutations resulted in impairment of the phosphoacceptor function of HPr with enzyme I: kcat/Km values between 6% (Ser-17) and 0.1% (Glu-17), relative to wild type. Several sugar-specific enzymes II had different responses. Both the Vmax and Km of enzyme IIN-acetylglucosamine were altered, while for enzyme IImannose only Km was affected, except for R17E. For both enzymes, kcat/Km values were between 0.5 and 3%, with R17E being 10-fold lower. Except for R17E, minimal effects were observed for enzyme IImannitol. These results suggest that there are different rate-limiting steps in the enzymes II. Phosphohydrolysis properties and the pKa values for His-15 and phosphorylated His-15 determined by NMR for both wild type and mutant HPrs suggest that Arg-17 is partly responsible for the instability of P-His-15 and the depressed pKa values in wild type HPr. Other feature(s) of the tertiary structure influence the protonation of His-15 and the phosphohydrolysis properties of phosphorylated His-15."
https://openalex.org/W1505333926,"We have found that cerulenin, an antibiotic that inhibits de novo fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acylation of proteins, strongly inhibited the cytotoxicity of ricin, modeccin, Pseudomonas toxin, and diphtheria toxin in a brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant mutant of Vero cells (BER-40). The protective effect of cerulenin against ricin was also observed in two other BFA-resistant cell lines, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and PtK1 cells. In contrast to BER-40 cells, no significant effect of cerulenin was observed in Vero cells. Cerulenin did not affect the binding of ricin to the cell-surface receptors, but reduced significantly the internalization of ricin in BER-40 cells; no effect of cerulenin on the binding or internalization of ricin was observed in Vero, PtK1, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Endocytic uptake of fluid-phase markers such as horseradish peroxidase and lucifer yellow was inhibited by cerulenin in BER-40 cells, but the endocytosis of transferrin via the coated pit/coated vesicle pathway was slightly increased. Cerulenin inhibited the degradation and excretion of ricin in BER-40 cells, and this effect of cerulenin was not observed in Vero cells. Furthermore, cerulenin inhibited the bulk protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with BER-40 cells being more susceptible than Vero cells. These results suggest that in addition to its effect on endocytosis, cerulenin interferes with the intracellular trafficking or processing of toxin molecules, and the vesicle transport system in BER-40 cells appears to be cerulenin-sensitive. Since addition of fatty acids and cholesterol did not reverse the effects of cerulenin, the protective effect of cerulenin against protein toxins is not due to an inhibition of de novo fatty acids and cholesterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1547430213,"In vitro incubation of immunoprecipitated immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) complexes with calcium and [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the phosphorylation of BiP on a threonine residue. This autophosphorylation activity did not occur in the presence of magnesium but had the same pH optimum as reported for its magnesium-dependent ATPase activity. This suggested the possibility that both activities could occur through ATP hydrolysis at the same site. In support of this, mutation of either Thr-37 or Thr-229 to a glycine eliminated both autophosphorylation and ATPase activities, and mutation of either residue to a serine significantly reduced both activities. Glutamic acid 175 in HSC71 has been hypothesized to flank the divalent cation complexed with ATP. Mutation of the analogous glutamic acid, Glu-201, in BiP abolished ATPase activity but still supported some autophosphorylation. The in vitro phosphorylation site was mapped to Thr-229 by mutational analysis. This threonine has been hypothesized to interact with the gamma-phosphate of ATP through a polarized water molecule and would be in a position to act as a phosphate acceptor in the ATP hydrolysis reaction. These data imply that both ATPase and autophosphorylation result from ATP hydrolysis at the same site and that the cation associated with BiP determines which activity is observed. Comparison of partial protease digestion or cyanogen bromide cleavage products of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated BiP demonstrated that Thr-229 is not a detectable site of phosphorylation in cells. Therefore, whatever functional role phosphorylation may have in vivo, it cannot be attributed to autophosphorylation of Thr-229."

Sequence analysis revealed that a consensus initiator sequence is located in this area which lacks a TATA motif. The untranslated first exon contains an alternative splice donor site, confirming the existence of two cDNA species with the potential to encode proteins differing at their NH2 termini. In vitro expression and translocation experiments demonstrate that both of the alternatively spliced variants of Mac-2 encode proteins which lack a functional signal peptide. Subcellular fractionation studies indicate that most of the Mac-2 protein is present in the cytosol. These results support the view that Mac-2 is exported from the cell by an unusual mechanism which does not depend on the presence of a signal peptide."

The PCR products were then cloned and individual clones were sequenced. PCR products were also analyzed by restriction endonuclease analysis for the IFN-alpha 2 and IFN-alpha A genes by use of a HinfI site which is eliminated by the substitution of an A for a G in IFN-alpha A. The IFN-alpha A gene which was cloned from the myeloblastoid cell line KG-1 was not observed in any of the 201 clones sequenced from normal individuals or in the Namalwa cell line. It was detected in KG-1 cell genomic DNA where it represented 49% of the clones sequenced. Similarly the IFN-alpha 2(Arg) gene was not detected in normal individuals or in the KG-1 cell line but only in the lymphoblastoid cell line from which it was cloned. In Namalwa cells the IFN-alpha 2(Arg) sequence represented 35% of the clones sequenced while the IFN-alpha 2 sequence comprised 59%.

The deletion of the COOH-terminal 171 (mutant CarB'2373) or 385 (mutant CarB2177) residues of the large subunit results in more asymmetric transitions at a temperature 7 degrees C lower than for the wild type. The allosteric effectors IMP, UMP, and ornithine induce small reversible transitions at low temperature in the endotherm for the wild-type enzyme, but not for CarB'2373, as expected if the effectors bind in the 171-residue, COOH-terminal region. In contrast, two ligands that bind outside the deleted region, Ap5A (a ligand of both ATP sites) and glycine (an analog of glutamine) decrease and increase, respectively, the stability of the two mutants and of the wild type. The stabilization by glycine requires that the subunits are associated. The results support the implication of the 20-kDa COOH-terminal domain of the large subunit in the allosteric modulation by all the effectors and are consistent with the folding of the large subunit as a pseudohomodimer of its two homologous halves."
https://openalex.org/W1511366025,"A tightly membrane-associated form of spectrin (TMA-spectrin) was labeled when human red blood cells were incubated with [3H]palmitic acid. About 90% of spectrin was not fatty acid-acylated and was extracted from membranes by low salt buffers. The 3H-palmitoylated TMA-spectrin, however, resisted low and even high salt extraction and remained associated with inside-out vesicles that were generated in the process of spectrin-actin extraction from membranes. TMA-spectrin was preferentially extracted from KCl-stripped vesicles by 5 M urea at low ionic strength. TMA-spectrin was purified by gel filtration and by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of urea and a non-ionic detergent. Purified TMA-spectrin was 3H-palmitoylated exclusively in the beta subunit to 0.28 mol/mol after a 12-h incubation of red cells. The labeled palmitate may be bound as an ester or thioester, since hydroxylamine (1 M, pH 7.5) released the label completely. Peptide maps of 3H-palmitoylated TMA-spectrin showed three or two labeled peptides from the beta subunit, when generated by V8 protease and trypsin, respectively. Two types of antibodies to spectrin reacted with purified TMA-spectrin, and TMA-spectrin contained the same antigenic peptides as low salt-extractable spectrin. Rabbit anti-ankyrin antibodies did not bind to TMA-spectrin. The substoichiometric incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into TMA-spectrin could result from the slow turnover of endogenously bound fatty acids. Generation of the tightly membrane-associated and 3H-palmitoylated subpopulation of spectrin cannot be due to entrapment of an unmodified residual fraction of spectrin in right-side-out vesicles. Instead, the data suggest the existence of a subpopulation of spectrin molecules that undergo a covalent fatty acid modification and thereby alter their binding properties. This may offer a new, metabolically dependent mechanism for dynamic interactions between spectrin and the membrane lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1496748505,"A new class of compounds designed to inhibit membrane-associated glycosyltransferases were synthesized and their biological activities were characterized in liver microsomes and human lymphoma cell lines.

One inhibitor, termed PP36 (5'-[[N-(2-decanoylamino-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropyloxycarbonyl )-glycyl[amino]-5'-deoxyuridine) competitively inhibited the enzyme glucosyl phosphoryldolichol synthase (Glc-P-Dol synthase) in rat liver microsomes. In rat and human liver microsomes incubated with PP36 and photolabeled with [beta-32P]5-azido-UDP-Glc, Glc-P-Dol synthase was the only protein observed to have decreased photoincorporation.

Activities of glycosyltransferases involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis were little affected by these compounds. Analysis of the effects of PP36, PP37, and PP55 on the incorporation of [3H] leucine and [14C]galactose into glycoprotein and glycolipid fractions from two human cell lines indicated the following: PP36 reduced incorporation into both fractions, PP37 was ineffective, and PP55 only decreased incorporation into glycolipids."

In the presence of Mg2+ ions, such Ca2+ transfer does not occur. The effects of Mg2+ ions are also studied by observing 113Cd NMR in the presence of M13, the 26-residue peptide of the CaM-binding region of myosin light chain kinase. The 113Cd NMR results show that Mg2+ ions prevent to form the active complex. Mg2+ plays an important role as an inactivating factor to CaM."
https://openalex.org/W1564861076,"ISGF3 is a major protein factor which mediates the transcriptional activation of interferon-inducible genes. ISGF3 is composed of two subunits, ISGF3 gamma and ISGF3 alpha, which are stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), respectively. In this paper, the effect of pretreatment of IFN-gamma on the response of K562 cells to IFN-alpha, termed gamma-priming, is examined. Using techniques of gene transfection and mobility shift assay, we studied the gamma-priming effects on the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of (i) the protein product of a luciferase reporter gene driven by an IFN-inducible promoter and (ii) the binding of ISGF3 to the interferon-stimulated response element. We found that exposure of cells to IFN-gamma prior to IFN-alpha greatly increased both the levels and the rate of ISGF3 binding activity during the early phase of IFN-alpha treatment and caused the amount of ISGF3 bound to the interferon-stimulated response element to decrease more rapidly with time during the later phase. Such effects were reflected also on the kinetics of expression of the interferon-inducible luciferase gene induced by IFN-alpha. In order to understand the basis of these gamma-priming effects, we use an in vitro reconstitution method to examine the kinetics of the subcomponents of ISGF3 in response to different IFN treatments in K562 cells. It was found that gamma-priming not only increased the levels of ISGF3 gamma, but it also stimulated both the rates of rise and fall of the activated alpha-component of ISGF3. A molecular model is proposed to explain these findings."

In the presence of 0.1 mM ATP, the linear velocities of rS1 and PT were essentially identical. ATP increased the kcat of PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gt without altering the Kmapp for either Gt or NAD. Further, in the presence of ATP, PT exhibited similar kinetic constants under conditions of variable Gt and variable NAD as rS1 in catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of Gt. The S1 subunit of PT was cleaved by chymotrypsin to a single immunoreactive peptide in the absence of ATP, while three immunoreactive peptides were generated in the presence of ATP. The S1 subunit of PT was not cleaved by trypsin in the absence of ATP, at the concentrations of trypsin used, while two immunoreactive peptides were produced in the presence of ATP. The immunoreactive peptides produced either by chymotrypsin or trypsin cleavage of the S1 subunit of PT in the presence of ATP were indistinguishable from those produced by cleavage of rS1 with the same protease. Chymotryptic and tryptic cleavage of rS1 was not altered by ATP. When PT was incubated with ATP prior to Bio-Gel P-100 gel filtration, approximately 8% of the S1 subunit dissociated from the B oligomer, as determined by ADP-ribosyltransferase assays of the column eluant. This increased to 20% when ATP was included in the column buffer. The presence of dithiothreitol and NAD in addition to ATP did not affect the amount of dissociated S1 subunit. Our data further indicated that activation of PT by ATP was a reversible process. Together, these data showed that ATP quantitatively converted the S1 subunit of PT to a form which was kinetically and conformationally identical with rS1, while only a fraction of the S1 subunit was dissociated from the B oligomer. These results indicate that both S1 subunit which is bound to the B oligomer as well as dissociated S1 subunit are capable of catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of Gt."
https://openalex.org/W1566036803,"The activity of CF1-ATPase was inhibited by vanadate in an allosteric manner with respect to CaATP as substrate. The cooperative interaction was enhanced by preincubation of the enzyme in the presence of ADP and Ca2+ ions and of free divalent metal ions during assay of the activity. The strongest cooperative interaction with a Hill coefficient of 5.3 +/- 0.1 was found when the reaction was stopped after 30 s, before steady state was reached. Under these conditions, the concentration of an exchangeable ADP, tightly bound to one of the active sites on the enzyme, was shown to be the highest. A Ki of 12.4 +/- 1.2 microM for vanadate inhibition was determined under these conditions. Direct measurements with the aid of 51V NMR indicated that vanadate binds to CF1 in the presence of Ca2+ and ADP in a positive cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient of 2.3 +/- 0.2 and an average Kd of 0.3 +/- 0.04 nM. It was suggested that a formation of pentacovalent vanadyl-ADP at the active site caused the inhibition. Vanadyl-ADP was suggested to be a strong inhibitor, being an analogue of a pentacovalent phosphoryl-ADP, which is proposed to be the transition state intermediate of CF1."
