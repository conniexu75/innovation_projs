https://openalex.org/W1983763042,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was purified from media conditioned by bovine pituitary folliculostellate cells (FC). VEGF is a heparin-binding growth factor specific for vascular endothelial cells that is able to induce angiogenesis in vivo. Complementary DNA clones for bovine and human VEGF were isolated from cDNA libraries prepared from FC and HL60 leukemia cells, respectively. These cDNAs encode hydrophilic proteins with sequences related to those of the A and B chains of platelet-derived growth factor. DNA sequencing suggests the existence of several molecular species of VEGF. VEGFs are secreted proteins, in contrast to other endothelial cell mitogens such as acidic or basic fibroblast growth factors and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor. Human 293 cells transfected with an expression vector containing a bovine or human VEGF cDNA insert secrete an endothelial cell mitogen that behaves like native VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2043863730,"Vascular permeability factor (VPF) is a 40-kilodalton disulfide-linked dimeric glycoprotein that is active in increasing blood vessel permeability, endothelial cell growth, and angiogenesis. These properties suggest that the expression of VPF by tumor cells could contribute to the increased neovascularization and vessel permeability that are associated with tumor vasculature. The cDNA sequence of VPF from human U937 cells was shown to code for a 189-amino acid polypeptide that is similar in structure to the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) and other PDGF-B-related proteins. The overall identity with PDGF-B is 18%. However, all eight of the cysteines in PDGF-B were found to be conserved in human VPF, an indication that the folding of the two proteins is probably similar. Clusters of basic amino acids in the COOH-terminal halves of human VPF and PDGF-B are also prevalent. Thus, VPF appears to be related to the PDGF/v-sis family of proteins."

The 63.4-kilodalton monomeric enzyme consists of four domains arranged to give an elongated molecule with an axial ratio greater than 3 to 1. Its interactions with the tRNA extend from the anticodon to the acceptor stem along the entire inside of the L of the tRNA. The complexed tRNA retains the overall conformation of the yeast phenylalanine tRNA (tRNA(Phe] with two major differences: the 3' acceptor strand of tRNA(Gln) makes a hairpin turn toward the inside of the L, with the disruption of the final base pair of the acceptor stem, and the anticodon loop adopts a conformation not seen in any of the previously determined tRNA structures. Specific recognition elements identified so far include (i) enzyme contacts with the 2-amino groups of guanine via the tRNA minor groove in the acceptor stem at G2 and G3; (ii) interactions between the enzyme and the anticodon nucleotides; and (iii) the ability of the nucleotides G73 and U1.A72 of the cognate tRNA to assume a conformation stabilized by the protein at a lower free energy cost than noncognate sequences. The central domain of this synthetase binds ATP, glutamine, and the acceptor end of the tRNA as well as making specific interactions with the acceptor stem.2+t is"

Expression of the complementary DNA produces cyclic GMP-gated channel activity in Xenopus oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1598968710,"Recent studies from this laboratory have identified novel cytoskeletal proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick fibroblasts (Glenney, J. R., Jr., and Zokas, L. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 2401-2408). In the present report, the phosphorylation of these proteins was examined in cells expressing the nonmyristylated mutants of src that are not transformed. A good correlation was found between transformation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 22-kDa protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 22-kDa protein was reduced more than 95% in cells expressing the nonmyristylated mutants of src. Size fractionation revealed that the 22-kDa phosphoprotein in transformed chick fibroblasts is found in a Mr 150,000 complex. Monoclonal antibodies were used to screen various chicken tissues where the 22-kDa protein was found at high levels in muscle and lung with low levels in epithelial cells and brain. The 22-kDa protein becomes an excellent candidate for a mediator of transformation by the tyrosine kinase class of oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W1549736588,"Abstract We recently identified a novel protein tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates truncated pp60c-src (Mr = 53,000) at a tyrosine residue(s) distinct from its autophosphorylation site. In this study, we examined whether this enzyme phosphorylates intact pp60c-src (Mr = 60,000) and determined its phosphorylation site. Non-neuronal and neuronal forms of intact pp60c-src were separately purified from the membrane fraction of neonatal rat brain by sequential column chromatographies. The novel kinase phosphorylated tyrosine residues of both forms of intact pp60c-src. The phosphorylation occurred in parallel with autophosphorylation of pp60c-src, and in both forms the final stoichiometry estimated was quite similar to that of autophosphorylation (about 5%). The enzyme also phosphorylated pp60c-src in which the kinase activity had been destroyed by an ATP analogue, p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine. The phosphorylation site of the non-neuronal form was analyzed by sequential peptide mapping with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. Tryptic digestion of the phosphorylated pp60c-src yielded a unique phosphopeptide that cross-reacted with an antibody specific for the carboxyl-terminal sequence of chicken pp60c-src. Digestion of the phosphopeptide with chymotrypsin yielded a product that comigrated with a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 15 residues of chicken pp60c-src. These results clearly indicate that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of rat pp60c-src is identical to that of chicken pp60c-src, and a tyrosine residue corresponding to chicken Tyr527 is the phosphorylation site. This phosphorylation resulted in a decrease in the enolase phosphorylating activity of pp60c-src. Kinetic experiments indicated that this decrease in activity was due to a decrease in the Vmax value of pp60c-src. These findings support our previous proposal that the novel tyrosine kinase acts as a specific regulator of pp60c-src in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584929737,"A slowly inactivating inward calcium current was identified in the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8 using a combination of ion flux and electrophysiological techniques. Voltage dependence, dihydropyridine sensitivity, divalent cation selectivity, and single channel properties identified this current as a high threshold, L-type calcium current. Ion flux experiments using 45Ca2+ confirmed that calcium uptake through these channel represents a major pathway for calcium entry into osteosarcoma cells. In resting cells, i.e. at negative membrane potentials, stimulation of both calcium current and rapid 45Ca2+ influx could be elicited by concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 between 0.1 and 3 nM. At these concentrations, 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 shifted the threshold for activation of inward calcium current to more negative potentials. At higher concentrations (5-10 nM), inhibitory effects became predominant. These opposing effects are functionally similar to those of the dihydropyridine BAY K 8644. Other vitamin D3 metabolites (25-(OH)-D3 and 24,25-(OH)2-D3) exhibited less potent stimulatory effects and greater inhibition of calcium current than 1,25-(OH)2-D3. These results suggest that (i) vitamin D3 acts as a potent modulator of calcium channel function in osteosarcoma cells, and (ii) intracellular Ca2+-dependent signaling processes may be affected acutely by physiological concentrations of vitamin D3 metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W1491793883,"Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) has the property of inducing hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to its own effects. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in man and experimental animals. The cellular changes that contribute to LPS tolerance are not understood. One mechanism of tolerance could involve a diminished response to LPS by key effector cells such as macrophages. Here we describe experiments designed to determine the mechanism whereby LPS produces a hyporesponsive state to its own effects. Because of the importance of the monokine known as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in mediating many of the diverse effects of LPS, we have studied induction of TNF-α at the mRNA and activity level in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7. Hyporesponsiveness can be induced by exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to low doses of LPS for more than 6 h prior to challenge with a second, normally stimulatory dose of LPS. This hyporesponsiveness is characterized by a diminished ability of LPS to increase steady state levels of TNF-α mRNA, is not due to an increased rate of TNF-α mRNA degradation, and is specific for LPS since LPS-pretreated and control cells produce similar amounts of TNF-α in response to challenge with heat-killed Staphylococcal aureus. The presence of indomethacin during the primary and/or challenge LPS treatment has no effect on the induction of acquired hyporesponsiveness. Thus, cyclooxygenase products are probably not involved in the development of LPS-induced hyporesponsiveness. These studies provide the basis for a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms that contribute to LPS tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1509862280,"In rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cells, which express osteoblastic features in culture, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) reduces the level of alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin mRNA and increases osteopontin mRNA, independent of growth stimulation. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) effects are dose dependent (EC50 about 6 pM) and are detected 24 h after addition of the growth factor. bFGF also reduces parathyroid hormone-stimulatable adenylate cyclase and alkaline phosphatase activity in these cells. Concomitant treatment with pertussis toxin (20 ng/ml) opposes the FGF effects. Although cyclic AMP elevating agents mimic pertussis toxin action on some parameters, they produce opposite effects on others, indicating that antagonism between pertussis toxin and bFGF is not mediated by cyclic AMP. bFGF caused a small reduction in steady state NAD-dependent ADP-ribosylation and had no detectable effects on the steady-state levels of the Gi alpha (alpha subunit of the inhibitory G protein) 1, 2, and 3, visualized with specific antibodies in these cells. Although the site of interaction of pertussis toxin and FGF remains to be determined, the findings presented here suggest separate control of growth and differentiation by bFGF and show that pertussis toxin treatment can modulate differentiation in these cells, presumably via Gi proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2144991441,"Protein L, a cell wall molecule of the bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus with affinity for immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains, was isolated after solubilization of the bacterial cell walls with mutanolysin or from the culture medium by a single affinity chromatography step on human IgG-Sepharose. A major protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 95,000 was obtained from both sources. The protein from the growth medium was size heterogeneous. From 1 ml of packed bacteria was prepared 0.92 mg of the mutanolysin-solubilized protein L (73% yield), whereas 4.1 mg of spontaneously released protein L (49% yield) was purified from the corresponding culture medium. The Mr of protein L was estimated to 76,000 by gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine HCl. Using this Mr value, the Stokes radius and the frictional ratio of protein L were determined to 4.74 nm and 1.70, respectively, suggesting an elongated fibrous molecule. No disulfide bond or subunit structure could be shown. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the whole protein and two internal non-IgG-binding tryptic fragments were determined and found to be unique. One of the tryptic fragments showed homology (40% identical residues) to a sequence within the cell wall-binding region of protein G, the Fc-binding protein of group C and G streptococci. The binding specificity of protein L was directed to the light chains of immunoglobulins; the affinity constant for polyacrylamide-coupled kappa-chains was 1.5 x 10(9) M-1 and for IgG, IgA, and IgM around 1 x 10(10) M-1. Maximal binding was achieved between pH 7 and 10. The binding to lambda-chains was too weak for determination of the affinity constant. 125I-Protein L was also shown to bind to mouse immunoglobulins. It could be used for detection of antigen-bound polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in Western blots. This shows that the protein L/light chain reaction was not obstructed by occupation of the antigen-binding site. Finally, protein L and kappa-chains of human Ig formed precipitates upon double immunodiffusion analysis, an indication of at least two binding sites on protein L."
https://openalex.org/W2052195409,"Analysis of crosslinked complexes of M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA subunit of ribonuclease P from Escherichia coli, and transfer RNA precursor substrates has led to the identification of regions in the enzyme and in the substrate that are in close physical proximity to each other. The nucleotide in M1 RNA, residue C92, which participates in a crosslink with the substrate was deleted and the resulting mutant M1 RNA was shown to cleave substrates lacking the 3' terminal CCAUCA sequence at sites several nucleotides away from the normal site of cleavage. The presence or absence of the 3' terminal CCAUCA sequence in transfer RNA precursor substrates markedly affects the way in which these substrates interact with the catalytic RNA in the enzyme-substrate complex. The contacts between wild-type M1 RNA and its substrate are in a region that resembles part of the transfer RNA ""E"" (exit) site in 23S ribosomal RNA. These data demonstrate that in RNA's with very different cellular functions, there are domains with similar structural and functional properties and that there is a nucleotide in M1 RNA that affects the site of cleavage by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1606639029,"The expression of two genes encoding facilitated glucose transporter proteins was studied during the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 fibroblastic cell line into adipocytes. The mRNA encoding the widely expressed HepG2/brain glucose transporter (GTI) is detectable in fibroblasts and its abundance remains unchanged during differentiation. On the other hand, the mRNA encoding a glucose transporter protein (GTIII) localized exclusively to muscle and adipose tissue is undetectable in fibroblasts but present in adipocytes. GTIII mRNA is first expressed three days after differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells has begun. Similarly, it is not until 3 days following the initiation of differentiation that GTIII protein can be detected, as assayed either by Western immunoblot or indirect immunofluorescence. The latter technique localizes GTIII predominantly to the perinuclear region of the adipocyte. The appearance of GTIII in developing fat cells correlates temporally with the acquisition of an increased stimulation of hexose uptake by maximal concentrations of insulin. These data support the concept that the marked increase in hexose transport in adipocytes in response to insulin is dependent on the expression in these cells of a specific, hormone-regulatable transport protein."
https://openalex.org/W1524608424,"Human apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 is composed of 4536 amino acids. It is thought that the binding of apoB to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor involves an interaction between basic amino acids of the ligand and acidic residues of the receptor. Three alternative models have been proposed to describe this interaction: 1) a single region of apoB is involved in receptor binding; 2) groups of basic amino acids from throughout the apoB primary structure act in concert in apoB receptor binding; and 3) apoB contains multiple independent binding regions. We have found that monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) specific for a region that spans a thrombin cleavage site at apoB residue 3249 (T2/T3 junction) totally blocked LDL binding to the LDL receptor. Mabs specific for epitopes outside this region had either no or partial ability to block LDL binding. In order to define the region of apoB directly involved in the interaction with the LDL receptor we have tested 22 different Mabs for their ability to bind to LDL already fixed to the receptor. A Mab specific for an epitope situated between residues 2835 and 2922 could bind to its epitope on LDL fixed to its receptor whereas a second epitope between residues 2980 and 3084 is inaccessible on receptor-bound LDL. A series of epitopes near residue 3500 of apoB is totally inaccessible, and another situated between residues 4027 and 4081 is poorly accessible on receptor-bound LDL. In contrast, an epitope that is situated between residues 4154 and 4189 is fully exposed. Mabs specific for epitopes upstream and downstream of the region 3000-4000 can bind to receptor-bound LDL with a stoichiometry close to unity. Our results strongly suggest that the unique region of apoB directly involved in the LDL-receptor interaction is that of the T2/T3 junction."
https://openalex.org/W1541007660,"Transepithelial fluid secretion has been postulated to account for the accumulation of fluid within hereditary and acquired renal cysts, but no such mechanism has been demonstrated in human kidney epithelium. It is shown here that transepithelial fluid secretion was stimulated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), forskolin, 8-Br-cyclic AMP, and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine in polarized monolayers of established renal cell lines (MDCK and rat glomerular epithelial cells) and in monolayer cultures derived from the cyst walls of human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and from epithelial cells of normal human renal cortex. Treatment with cyclic AMP agonists caused the same cells, when dispersed within a gel matrix of type I collagen (Vitrogen), to proliferate and form spherical fluid-filled monolayered cysts. Our findings suggest that increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels may have a critical role in the formation and expansion of hereditary and acquired renal cysts."

https://openalex.org/W1556303422,"The mechanism by which cAMP modulates the activity of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) was studied. Elevation of cAMP inhibited both basal and norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in C6Bu1 cells which contain at least three PLC isozymes, PLC-beta, PLC-gamma, and PLC-delta. Treatment of C6Bu1 cells with cAMP-elevating agents (cholera toxin, isobutylmethylxanthine, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP) increased serine phosphate in PLC-gamma, but the phosphate contents in PLC-beta and PLC-delta were not changed. In addition, cAMP-dependent protein kinase selectively phosphorylated purified PLC-gamma among the three isozymes and added a single phosphate at serine. The serine phosphorylation, nevertheless, did not affect the activity of PLC-gamma in vitro. We propose, therefore, that the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma by cAMP-dependent protein kinase alters its interaction with putative modulatory proteins and leads to its inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1587369507,"The serum vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), a member of a multigene family that includes α-fetoprotein (αFP) and albumin (ALB), is expressed at high levels in the adult liver. Although several studies have demonstrated the presence of DBP on the cell surface of immunocytes and cytotrophoblasts, evidence of extra-hepatic DBP synthesis remains inconclusive. Using Northern blot analysis of RNA from multiple rat tissues, the DBP transcripts were present in the expected high levels in the adult liver. In addition, DBP mRNA was found in the adult kidney, testis, abdominal fat, and 18-day fetal yolk sac. The concentrations of DBP mRNA in these tissues is 100-1000-fold less than in the liver. Polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR) of DBP, αFP, and ALB cDNAs, reverse transcribed from a wide variety of rat tissue RNA samples, was performed to examine their respective tissue-specific patterns of gene transcripts. The tissues in which DBP gene transcripts were noted by Northern analysis were paralleled at 20 cycles of PCR with liver ≫ kidney, yolk sac, testis, and abdominal fat. Similarly at 20 cycles, αFP-amplified fragments were detected in the yolk sac ≫ brain, testes, uterus, liver, and placenta; and ALB-amplified fragments in liver ≫ testis, uterus, placenta, and yolk sac. Unexpectedly, at 32 cycles of PCR, DBP, αFP, and ALB mRNAs could be detected at very low levels in all tissues examined. To examine the nature of the DBP mRNA from these nonhepatic sources, a Sprague-Dawley kidney cDNA library was screened, and a single cDNA recombinant was identified. This clone contained a full length DBP cDNA with 14 nucleotide and 3 predicted amino acid differences from the Fischer liver DBP cDNA reported previously. We conclude that the kidney and liver DBP mRNAs are transcription products of the same DBP locus and that DBP, αFP, and ALB genes display different spectra of tissue distribution. The unexpected finding that all three spliced RNA transcripts could be detected in at least trace quantities in all tissues studied suggests a leaky level of transcription by this multigene family or their transcription at low levels by an unidentified stromal cell common to all organs studied."
https://openalex.org/W1985077359,"The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is induced by a defective retrovirus. To study the role of virus replication in this disease, helper-free stocks of defective Duplan virus were produced. These stocks were highly pathogenic in absence of detectable replicating murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) other than xenotropic MuLV. They induced expansion of the infected cell population (over 1000-fold), and this cell expansion was oligoclonal in origin and, most likely, arose through cell division. These results suggest that this defective virus is oncogenic, inducing a primary neoplasia associated with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a paraneoplastic syndrome. These data emphasize the need to determine whether virus replication is necessary for the progression of other immunodeficiency diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and whether these diseases also represent paraneoplastic syndromes."

The epitope recognized by the sporozoite-specific human T cell clones mapped to the 5′ repeat region of the CS protein and was contained in the NANPNVDPNANP sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1494926748,"Charybdotoxin (ChTX), a peptidyl inhibitor of the high conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (PK,Ca), has been radiolabeled to high specific activity with 125I, and resulting derivatives have been well separated. The monoiodotyrosine adduct blocks PK,Ca in vascular smooth muscle with slightly reduced potency compared with the native peptide under defined experimental conditions. [125I]ChTX, representing this derivative, binds specifically and reversibly to a single class of sites in sarcolemmal membrane vesicles prepared from bovine aortic smooth muscle. These sites display a Kd of 100 pM for the iodinated toxin, as determined by either equilibrium or kinetic binding analyses. Binding site density is about 500 fmol/mg of protein in isolated membranes. The addition of low digitonin concentrations to disrupt the vesicle permeability barrier increases the maximum receptor concentration to 1.5 pmol/mg of protein, correlating with the observations that ChTX binds only at the external pore of PK,Ca and that the membrane preparation is of mixed polarity. Competition studies with ChTX yield a Ki of about 20 pM for native toxin. Binding of [125I]ChTX is modulated by ionic strength as well as by metal ions that are known to interact with PK,Ca. Moreover, tetraethylammonium ion, which blocks PK,Ca with moderately high affinity when applied at the external membrane surface, inhibits [125I]ChTX binding in an apparently competitive fashion with a Ki similar to that found for channel inhibition. In marked contrast, agents that do not inhibit PK,Ca in smooth muscle (e.g. tetrabutylammonium ion, other toxins homologous with ChTX, and pharmacological agents that modulate the activity of dissimilar ion channels) have no effect on [125I]ChTX binding in this tissue. Taken together, these results suggest that the binding sites for ChTX which are present in vascular smooth muscle are directly associated with PK,Ca, thus identifying [125I]ChTX as a useful probe for elucidating the biochemical properties of these channels."

https://openalex.org/W92955020,Depolarization of plasma membrane potential has a potent inhibitory effect on divalent cation influx catalyzed by the carboxylic ionophores ionomycin and A23187. This effect is observed in different cell models and does not depend on either inhibition of Ca2+-activated cation channels or activation of Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms as suggested previously. A dependence of divalent cation influx on the magnitude of membrane potential is observed also in artificial liposomes. The inhibition of ionophore-dependent divalent cation transport by membrane potential depolarization can be modified varying the ionophore concentration and the external pH. These findings suggest that both neutral and positively charged ionophore-cation complexes can cross the plasma membrane and that their contribution to the overall transport process can be varied according to the experimental conditions.
https://openalex.org/W99748170,"We have studied the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins in NIH 3T3 cells expressing high numbers of human insulin receptors (HIR 3.5 cells) using the technique of giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In serum-deprived cells, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of more than 25 proteins; all but two of these were also phosphorylated in response to 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, which also stimulated the phosphorylation of additional proteins thought to be direct substrates for protein kinase C. In cells pretreated insulin specifically stimulated the phosphorylation insulin specifically stimulated the phosphorylation of at least 26 predominantly cytosolic proteins, only one of which was observed in insulin-treated cells not exposed to phenylarsine oxide. Serum was without effect in cells pretreated with phenylarsine oxide. In phenylarsine oxide-pretreated cells, phosphoamino acid analysis of 10 of the most highly labeled insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins showed that all 10 were labeled predominantly or exclusively on tyrosine residues. The phosphorylation of several of these could be stimulated in vitro by the addition of insulin to a detergent extract of cells in the presence of Mn2+ and ATP. In general, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylations observed in the presence of phenylarsine oxide were more rapid than those observed in its absence. Finally, a variety of other growth factors and mitogens did not stimulate any of the insulin-stimulated phosphorylations in the presence of phenylarsine oxide. Thus, the use of this inhibitor apparently unmasked a number of novel insulin-specific protein phosphorylations that were ordinarily undetectable. We suggest that at least some of these proteins may be direct substrates for the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase and may play significant roles in insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1591005472,"The Salmonella typhimurium his leader region contains a well documented transcription attenuator. We report here the results of in vitro transcription studies that characterized a transcription pause site in the his leader region. The pause occurred after synthesis of the first his leader secondary structure (A:B) and immediately preceding addition of G103 to the nascent transcript. RNA polymerase pausing at this site would allow a ribosome synthesizing the his leader peptide to release the paused polymerase and synchronize transcription and translation of the his leader region. The half-life of transcription complexes paused in the his leader was enhanced by NusA, but not guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate. Nuclease digestion and RNA modeling studies were consistent with a compact three-dimensional structure for the his pause RNA. The half-life of the his leader paused transcription complex was decreased greatly on altered templates in which the C71-G93 base pair was disrupted but was unchanged when the C65-G100 base pair was disrupted. This result is consistent with a model for the structure of paused transcription complexes in which a portion of the RNA:DNA elongation heteroduplex is retained."
https://openalex.org/W1496623280,"Reactive disulfide reagents (RDSs) with a biotin moiety have been synthesized and found to cause Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. The RDSs oxidize SH sites on SR proteins via a thiol-disulfide exchange, with the formation of mixed disulfide bonds between SR proteins and biotin. Biotinylated RDSs identified a 106-kDa protein which was purified by biotin-avidin chromatography. Disulfide reducing agents, like dithiothreitol, reverse the effect of RDSs and thus promoted active re-uptake of Ca2+ and dissociated biotin from the labeled protein indicating that biotin was covalently linked to the 106-kDa protein via a disulfide bond. Several lines of evidence indicate that this protein is not Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase and is not a proteolytic fragment or a subunit of the 400-kDa Ca2+-ryanodine receptor complex (RRC). Monoclonal antibodies against the ATPase did not cross-react with the 106-kDa protein, and polyclonal antibodies against the 106-kDa did not cross-react with either the ATPase or the 400-kDa RRC. RDSs did not label the 400-kDa RRC with biotin. Linear sucrose gradients used to purify the RRC show that the 106-kDa protein migrated throughout 5-20% linear sucrose gradients, including the high sucrose density protein fractions containing 400-kDa RRC. Protease inhibitors diisopropylfluorophosphate used to prevent proteolysis of 400-kDa proteins did not alter the migration of 106-kDa in sucrose gradients nor the patterns of biotin labeling of the 106-kDa protein. Incorporation of highly purified 106-kDa protein (free of RRC) in planar bilayers revealed cationic channels with large Na+ (gNa+ = 375 +/- 15 pS) and Ca2+ (gCa2+ = 107.7 +/- 12 pS) conductances which were activated by micromolar [Ca2+]free or millimolar [ATP] and blocked by micromolar ruthenium red or millimolar [Mg2+]. Thus, the SR contains a sulfhydryl-activated 106-kDa Ca2+ channel with apparently similar characteristics to the 400-kDa feet proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2112361382,"In order to investigate the lectin-binding properties of the photoreceptor cGMP-gated channel, solubilized and purified channel protein was incubated with immobilized lectins followed by reconstitution of unbound proteins. Of the lectins tested, only concanavalin A (ConA) was able to specifically sediment channel activity. A 240-kDa protein, which copurifies with the 63-kDa channel protein but does not bind ConA, was also found to be sedimented by the ConA-affinity matrix, thereby implicating that it is associated with the channel complex. Treatment of the purified channel protein with the enzyme glycopeptidase F in the presence of the denaturing detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in a rapid reduction of the apparent molecular mass by 1.90 kDa, and the abolition of ConA-binding. No intermediate molecular weight species were observed, suggesting that the channel protein is N-glycosylated at one site only. Under nondenaturing conditions, the kinetics of deglycosylation were distinctly two-phased: 50-60% deglycosylation was achieved rapidly; however, prolonged incubation was required to arrive at complete deglycosylation. Reconstitution experiments showed that deglycosylation had no significant effect on the kinetics of channel protein activation by cGMP."

Excess unlabeled galanin completely inhibited the labeling of the band while other regulatory peptides had no effect. Labeling of the Mr 57,000 complex was abolished by galanin concentration from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M (IC50 = 5 X 10(-9) M). Initial incubation with 125I-galanin in the presence of increasing concentrations of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) also inhibited the labeling of the Mr 57,000 complex. Moreover, pretreatment of membranes with pertussis toxin before formation of the covalent galanin-receptor complex, dramatically reduced the labeling of the Mr 57,000 species. Covalent Mr 57,000 galanin-receptor complexes solubilized by Triton X-100 bound specifically to wheat germ agglutinin-concanavalin A-, and soybean-coupled Sepharose, supporting the glycoproteic nature of the galanin receptor. Assuming one molecule of 125I-galanin (Mr 3,000) was bound per molecule of protein, these results suggest that the pancreatic galanin receptor is a glycoprotein with a Mr of 54,000 bearing the recognition site for the ligand and which is coupled with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1614984317,"Abstract Plasmids that encode a bioactive amino-terminal fragment of the heat-stable inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKI(1-31), were employed to characterize the role of this protein kinase in the control of transcriptional activity mediated by three DNA regulatory elements in the JEG-3 human placental cell line. The 5'-flanking sequence of the human collagenase gene contains the heptameric sequence, 5'-TGAGTCA-3', previously identified as a response element. Reporter genes containing either the intact 1.2-kilobase 5'-flanking sequence from the human collagenase gene or just the 7-base pair (bp) response element, when coupled to an enhancerless promoter, each exhibit both cAMP and phorbol ester-stimulated expression in JEG-3 cells. Cotransfection of either construct with plasmids encoding PKI(1-31) inhibits cAMP-stimulated but not basal- or phorbol ester-stimulated expression. Pretreatment of cells with phorbol ester for 1 or 2 days abrogates completely the response to rechallenge with phorbol ester but does not alter the basal expression of either construct; cAMP-stimulated expression, while modestly inhibited, remains vigorous. The 5'-flanking sequence of the human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha subunit (HCG alpha) gene has two copies of the sequence, 5'-TGACGTCA-3', contained in directly adjacent identical 18-bp segments, previously identified as a cAMP-response element. Reporter genes containing either the intact 1.5 kilobase of 5'-flanking sequence from the HCG alpha gene, or just the 36-bp tandem repeat cAMP response element, when coupled to an enhancerless promoter, both exhibit a vigorous cAMP stimulation of expression but no response to phorbol ester in JEG-3 cells. Cotransfection with plasmids encoding PKI(1-31) inhibits both basal and cAMP-stimulated expression in a parallel fashion. The 5'-flanking sequence of the human enkephalin gene mediates cAMP-stimulated expression of reporter genes in both JEG-3 and CV-1 cells. Plasmids encoding PKI(1-31) inhibit the expression that is stimulated by the addition of cAMP analogs in both cell lines; basal expression, however, is inhibited by PKI(1-31) only in the JEG-3 cell line and not in the CV-1 cells. These observations indicate that, in JEG-3 cells, PKI(1-31) is a specific inhibitor of kinase A-mediated gene transcription, but it does not modify kinase C-directed transcription.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1541614753,"Incubation of a membrane fraction from Mycobacterium smegmatis cells with GDP-mannose and free mannose at pH 7 in presence of Mg2+ ions resulted in the formation of a series of alpha 1----6-linked mannooligosaccharides with up to 12 mannoses. The membrane fraction also catalyzed incorporation of mannose from GDP-mannose into a lipid-soluble product with the properties of a mannosyl phospholipid. A similar product was formed by the incubation of the membrane protein with decaprenol phosphate and GDP-mannose, and it was characterized as beta-mannosylphosphoryldecaprenol. A pulse-chase experiment suggested that the mannosyl phospholipid was an intermediate in alpha 1----6-linked mannooligosaccharide synthesis, and the isolated beta-mannosylphosphoryldecaprenol was shown to function as a direct mannosyl donor on incubation with mannose, methyl alpha-D-mannoside, or alpha 1----6-linked mannooligosaccharides as acceptors. The Km values for mannose, methylmannoside, and alpha 1----6-linked mannobiose were 30-90 mM, whereas for alpha 1----6-linked mannotriose, mannotetraose, and mannopentaose the Km dropped to 2 mM. A weak enzymic activity was detected at pH 6 in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions that catalyzed addition of mannose in alpha 1----2 linkage to the longer alpha 1----6-mannooligosaccharides in a reaction that was specific for GDP-mannose as the donor. The membrane preparation also contained an endo-alpha 1----6-mannanase activity that degraded products longer than mannotriose by cleavage of trisaccharide units from the nonreducing end of the alpha 1----6-mannooligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1555842933,"Incubation of human serum or high density lipoprotein (HDL) at 37 degrees C in the presence of Fe2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, or Mn2+ results in the increased immunoreactivity (up to 12-, 40-, and 80-fold, respectively) of specific apoA-I epitopes identified as 3D4 and 6B8, while Mg2+, Ca2+, or Cu2+ have minimal or nonsignificant effects. The effect of Mn2+ on the 3D4 epitope requires a specific association with lipids since it can be observed with HDL but not with apoHDL, even in the presence of other lipoproteins. The increase in immunoreactivity noted with Fe2+/Fe3+ or Mn2+ can be blocked with either EDTA or antioxidants (GSH and ascorbic acid), suggesting that it takes place during a peroxidative reaction of the lipids. The peroxidation of lipids which accompanies the increase in immunoreactivity does cross-link apoA-I both with itself and with apoA-II but does not cleave the molecule. The apoA-I-containing lipoproteins which float between 1.18 and 1.22 g/ml and have a pre B-electrophoretic migration are characterized by a very low immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody 3D4 but are 10-fold or more responsive to Mn2+ treatment than other lipoprotein subfractions, thus demonstrating heterogeneity under oxidative conditions. Proteoliposomes containing apoA-I, cholesterol, and dilinoleyl-lecithin are sensitive to Mn2+ treatment, but not those made with dioleyl- or dimyristoyl-lecithins. However, the increase in 3D4 immunoreactivity is weak and transient and is followed by the disappearance of the epitope caused by cross-linking. We conclude that lipid peroxidation can specifically cross-link apoA-I and change its conformation and antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1494486600,"Abstract We have determined the effect of beta-naphthoflavone and the azo dye, sudan III, on the level of quinone reductase mRNA in a responsive rat hepatoma cell line. Our data indicate that both of these planar aromatic compounds produce a 4-5-fold elevation in quinone reductase mRNA. The induction of quinone reductase mRNA can be blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting a requirement for ongoing protein synthesis in the induction process. We have determined the exon structure of the quinone reductase structural gene. The gene is separated into six exons by five introns. A TATA box is located 29 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. A CCAAT sequence is found at position -129, and an inverted GC box is located at position -78. Quinone reductase promoter-chlor-amphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes containing different lengths of the 5'-flanking region were transfected into rat and human hepatoma cells. Treatment of the transfected cells with beta-naphthoflavone or sudan III resulted in a 4-5-fold elevation in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. These data suggest the presence of a cis-acting regulatory element(s) in the 5'-flanking region of the quinone reductase structural gene which regulates inducible expression."
https://openalex.org/W1489748911,"The interaction of the cationic carbocyanine dye Stains-all (1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethyl-naphthol[1,2-d]thiazolin-2-ylidene)-2- methylpropenyl]naphthol[1,2-d]thiazolium bromide) with the eye lens proteins crystallins has been studied. α- and γ-crystallins do not bind the dye, while β- and δ-crystallins do, consistent with the fact that the latter two proteins bind the calcium ion. β-Crystallin resembles parvalbumin in that it induces only the J-band of the bound dye. δ-crystallin, on the other hand, induces only the γ-band. Analysis of the metachromasia induced in the dye by these and other proteins suggests that Stains-all is responsive to the conformational status of the region to which it binds in a protein. The J-band of the dye is activated when it binds to a globular domain, and the γ-band is activated when it binds to a helical stretch of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2096500351,"Abstract Giardia lamblia is dependent on the salvage of preformed purines and pyrimidines, including deoxythymidine. Dependence on deoxynucleoside salvage is extremely unusual among eucaryotic cells (Moore, E. C., and Hurlbert, R. B. (1985) Pharmacol & Ther. 27, 167-196). The present study investigates the possibility that giardia lacks ribonucleotide reductase and depends entirely on deoxynucleoside salvage. A ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea, at concentrations up to 2 mM had no effect on the growth of giardia. This is 15-20 times the ED50 of hydroxyurea for the protozoans Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma gambiense, and Leishmania donovani. A lysate of giardia had no detectable ribonucleotide reductase. Although radiolabeled adenine, adenosine, guanine, and guanosine were readily incorporated into RNA by cultured cells, no adenine or adenosine and only trace amounts of guanine and guanosine were detectable in DNA. This is in contrast to deoxynucleosides, where 58% of deoxyadenosine and 10% of deoxyguanosine incorporated into nucleic acid were found in DNA. Phosphorylation of both deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine was catalyzed by a cell lysate of giardia when nucleoside kinase co-substrates were included in the assay but not when phosphotransferase co-substrates were present. The absence of detectable ribonucleotide reductase, the failure to incorporate purine nucleobases and nucleosides into DNA to any significant extent, the ready incorporation of deoxynucleosides into DNA, and the demonstration of a purine deoxynucleoside kinase suggest that giardia are dependent on the salvage of exogenous deoxynucleosides."
https://openalex.org/W1843054328,"The molecular oxygen adduct of Co(II)-bleomycin is stable for long periods when bound to salmon sperm DNA at large ratios of polymer to drug. According to ESR studies of orientation of the paramagnetic complex associated with DNA fibers, the oxygen-oxygen bond is restricted to a plane perpendicular to the fiber axis. Thus, one can define three g values for the adduct 2.104, 2.016, and 2.000, one parallel to the fiber axis and two orthogonal to it. There is no change in orientation over the range of 77 K to ambient temperature. Furthermore, there is no difference in results at a series of relative humidities ranging from less than 76% where bulk DNA alone assumes an A conformation to 95% where it is primarily B DNA. A structural model is presented for the geometry of the metal binding domain of O2-Co-bleomycin in relationship to the fiber axis of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1667877556,"Human monoclonal IgM having an antibody activity directed to myelin-associated glycoprotein have distinctive features. Amino-terminal sequence of light and heavy chains from 6 IgM kappa that we have previously studied indicated that heavy chains belong to the VHIII subgroup, whereas light chains belong to 3 different subgroups of variability (V kappa I 2, V kappa II 1, and V kappa IV 3). We report here the complete sequence of the variable domain of 3 L chains: 2 V kappa IV and 1 V kappa II subgroups. Strikingly an unusually high degree of mutations clustered in the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) 1 and CDR 3 was found and the variable regions were joined to three different JK segments. Amino acid substitutions did not yield similar sequence in the CDRs suggesting that the kappa chains had no predominant role in the unique binding activity of these IgM or alternatively they are directed against different epitopes. Data are consistent with the previously reported lack of easily demonstrated public idiotopes common to anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein IgM. The pathogenesis of these IgM autoantibodies is most likely different from that of previously studied monoclonal rheumatoid factors or cold agglutinins where a genetic restriction of L or H chains or both has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W1558805556,"Abstract Inhibitors of the regulatory step in the cell cycle of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are known by indirect studies to perturb RNA metabolism. We have investigated these effects further and show here by a pulse-labeling and quantitative hybridization procedure that pre-rRNA transcription was substantially decreased by five inhibitors of start but was transiently stimulated by the mating pheromone alpha-factor. Thus in contrast to the effects of the other start inhibitors, the inhibition of start by alpha-factor is unrelated to this aspect of biosynthetic activity. Mating factor treatment also stimulated the synthesis rate of poly(A)+ RNA. The start inhibitors o-phenanthroline and L-ethionine inhibited pre-rRNA transcription with little effect on poly(A)+ RNA synthesis rates. Northern analysis showed that all inhibitors of start also inhibited pre-rRNA transcript cleavage, a process that has been dissociated from the inhibition of start. Most inhibitors also affected ATP pool size. One inhibitor, o-phenanthroline, markedly induced the general control response."
https://openalex.org/W1857758366,"Abstract The induction of rat alpha 2u-globulin by glucocorticoids is a secondary response to the hormone, that is protein synthesis is absolutely required for induction. Using the DNase I protection assay, we have identified three proteins present in rat liver nuclei that bind in or near the regulatory region of a cloned alpha 2u-globulin gene. One protein which we term alpha 2u-globulin nuclear factor 1 (alpha 2uNF1), binds to precisely the sequence we have previously shown to be required for hormonal induction. Genes containing linker-scanning mutations in this region show diminished binding to this nuclear factor and display greatly reduced or abolished glucocorticoid response. alpha 2uNF1 was detected in nuclei from several sources, and its level is apparently unaffected by glucocorticoids. Its recognition sequence is unlike those of previously reported transcription factors. We detect two other proteins, alpha 2uNF2 and alpha 2uNF3, that bind near the alpha 2u-globulin regulatory region. A mutant alpha 2u-globulin promoter which does not bind alpha 2uNF2 shows increased inducibility by glucocorticoids in transfected mouse L-cells. The binding of alpha 2uNF3 is not required for alpha 2u-globulin induction by the hormone."
