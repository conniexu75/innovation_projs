https://openalex.org/W2164646340,"High pressure liquid chromatographic systems capable of resolving at least 28 known and potential metabolites of 17 beta-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one (testosterone) and 4-androstene-3,17-dione (androstenedione) were used to quantitatively assess the metabolism of the two steroids in monooxygenase systems reconstituted with five purified rat liver cytochrome P-450 isozymes. Cytochromes P-450a, -b, -c, -d, and -e catalyzed the oxidation of testosterone at overall rates of 21, 27, 2, 0.7, and 3 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450, respectively; while the corresponding rates for total androstenedione metabolism were 12, 62, 1.5, 0.3, and 5. Cytochrome P-450a catalyzed the oxidation of testosterone and androstenedione almost exclusively to their respective 7 alpha-hydroxy metabolites. Cytochrome P-450b catalyzed the oxidation of testosterone to androstenedione and 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxytestosterone in approximately equal molar ratios. However, this same hemoprotein exhibited a marked stereoselectivity in the metabolism of androstenedione since the molar ratio of 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was greater than 1:10. Cytochrome P-450e catalyzed the oxidation of both steroids to the same products as cytochrome P-450b, but at approximately 10% of the rate. Cytochromes P-450c and P-450d catalyzed the oxidation of testosterone and androstenedione regio- and stereospecifically to their respective 6 beta-hydroxy metabolites. These results indicate that certain cytochrome P-450 isozymes show marked positional specificity in the metabolism of both testosterone and androstenedione, and that the rate as well as stereoselectivity of the oxidative reactions can be markedly dependent on subtle differences in the structure of the steroid substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1569852946,"Glycolipids in a cultured human teratocarcinoma cell line (2102Ep) were investigated. The major glycolipids in these cells are globoseries glycolipids having the following structures: (formula; see text) Synthesis of these structures by serial addition of galactose, fucose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid to globoside (Gb4) in this teratocarcinoma is obvious, although further elongation of Gb4 in human cells and tissues has not been previously found with the exception of the presence of a small quantity of Forssman glycolipid in some tissues in the human population (Fs+ group) and in some human cancers. The latter four glycolipids (b-e), with the common internal structure R leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal alpha 1 leads to 4R', were all reactive to a monoclonal antibody directed to the 4- to 8-cell stage of murine embryos, known as the stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3 (Shevinsky, L. H., Knowles, B. B., Damjanov, I., and Solter, D. (1982) Cell 30, 697-705]; structure (c) showed the strongest reactivity. These findings, together with the demonstration of the glycolipid nature of SSEA-1 antigen (Kannagi, R., Nudelman, E., Levery, S. B., and Hakomori, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14865-14874), indicate that cell surface glycolipids play significant roles as differentiation antigens during the course of embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1551929711,"32P-labeled cDNA probes were used to study levels of genomic DNA and regulation of mRNA for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in UT-1 cells, a clone of compactin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells that have a 100-1000-fold increase in the amount of reductase protein. Similar measurements were made for the 53-kDa protein, a cytosolic protein of unknown function that is also expressed at high levels in UT-1 cells. The number of copies of the gene for reductase was increased by 15-fold in UT-1 cells as compared to the parental Chinese hamster ovary cells, as judged from Southern gel analysis of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA. In contrast, there was no detectable increase in the number of gene copies for the 53-kDa protein. The amount of cytoplasmic mRNA for both proteins was markedly elevated in UT-1 cells, as determined by filter hybridization studies using 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The amount of mRNA for both reductase and the 53-kDa protein declined in parallel after addition of low density lipoprotein, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or mevalonate to the culture medium. The decline in reductase mRNA was associated with a marked decrease in the rate of [3H]uridine incorporation into hybridizable cytoplasmic mRNA. When UT-1 cells were grown for 3-4 months in the absence of compactin, the level of reductase mRNA and enzymatic activity decreased markedly, but the number of copies of the reductase gene did not decline. When the compactin-withdrawn cells were rechallenged with compactin, high levels of reductase mRNA and enzymatic activity promptly returned. We conclude that the gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, but not for the 53-kDa protein, has been stably amplified in UT-1 cells. Despite this differential gene amplification, the levels of cytoplasmic mRNA for both gene products are markedly elevated, and both are reduced in parallel by either sterols (low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol) or mevalonate, the product of the reductase-catalyzed reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2010300299,"Infants acquire whatever language is spoken in the environment into which they are born. The mental capability of the newborn child is not biased in any way towards the acquisition of one human language rather than another. Because psychologists who attempt to model the process of language comprehension are interested in the structure of the human mind, rather than in the properties of individual languages, strategies which they incorporate in their models are presumed to be universal, not language-specific. In other words, strategies of comprehension are presumed to be characteristic of the human language processing system, rather than, say, the French, English, or Igbo language processing systems. We report here, however, on a comprehension strategy which appears to be used by native speakers of French but not by native speakers of English."
https://openalex.org/W1603127702,"The taurocholate transport system in normal and transformed hepatocytes has been characterized using transport kinetics and photoaffinity labeling procedures. A photoreactive diazirine derivative of taurocholate, (7,7-azo-3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oyl)-2-amino [ 1,2-3H ]ethanesulfonic acid (7-ADTC), which has been shown to be a substrate for the bile acid carrier system, was photolyzed in the presence of intact hepatocytes, hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, and plasma membranes derived from the hepatocyte sinusoidal surface. Irradiation of membranes in the presence of 7-ADTC resulted in the incorporation of the photoprobe into two proteins with Mr = 68,000 and 54,000. The specificity of labeling was confirmed by the significant inhibition of labeling observed when photolysis was carried out in the presence of taurocholate. The 68,000-Da protein was easily extracted with water and was shown to exhibit electrophoretic properties identical with rat serum albumin. The 54,000-Da protein required Triton X-100 for solubilization, indicating a strong association with the plasma membrane. Labeling of intact hepatocytes also resulted in specific labeling of the 54,000-Da protein. In contrast to hepatocytes, HTC cells derived from Morris hepatoma 7288C as well as H4-II-E cells derived from Reuber hepatoma H-35 exhibited a total loss of mediated bile acid uptake. Photolysis of 7-ADTC in the presence of HTC cells did not result in the labeling of any proteins, a result consistent with the loss of transport activity, and further supporting the specificity of the labeling reaction. The anion transport inhibitor N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethyl-[ 35S ]sulfonate, which has been shown to be a substrate for the bile acid carrier system also labeled the 54,000-Da plasma membrane protein when photolyzed in the presence of intact hepatocytes. These results suggest that the 54,000-Da protein is a component of the hepatocyte bile acid transport system and that the activity of this system is greatly reduced in several hepatoma cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W1503127945,"Some regulatory aspects of neutral amino acid transport were investigated in isolated brain microvessels, an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. Preloading of the microvessels with glutamine stimulated the subsequent uptake of other neutral amino acids by way of the Na+-independent L system, but had no effect on the uptake of either basic or acidic amino acids. Moreover, this stimulation was abolished when the loading step was carried out in the absence of Na+ ions or in the presence of a high concentration of alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid, indicating that the microvessels were able to concentrate glutamine via the A system of amino acid transport. Since the presence of the A system of neutral amino acid transport has not been detected in studies of blood-brain transport performed in vivo, the A system is probably associated with the antiluminal side of brain microvessels. Our results indicate, therefore, that the concentrative Na+-dependent A system and the exchanging Na+-independent L system can cooperate in the uptake of the large neutral hydrophobic amino acids. Such a cooperation may be relevant in the pathogenesis of some neurological disturbances such as hepatic encephalopathy, in which brain glutamine concentration is unusually high."
https://openalex.org/W1515005580,"The overall isotopic fractionation factor observed for denitrification of NO-2 by resting cultures and cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas stutzeri varied widely with the concentration of NO-2 and reductant. The observed isotope effect (beta obs) increased linearly with velocity when the concentration of nitrite was varied and decreased with velocity when reductant concentration was varied. At any given ratio of velocity to maximum velocity, beta obs was approximately the same in intact cells and cell free extracts. These results indicate the following: (a) neither uptake (whole cells) nor enzyme-substrate association (cell-free extracts) is the sole cause of saturation of the overall rate as [NO-2] is increased; (b) a reductive step lies beyond the initial step and at or before the first unidirectional step; and (c) in intact cells, uptake of NO-2 by the cell and egress of NO-2 from it are very rapid compared to reduction at all concentrations of NO-2. A corollary of the last conclusion is that variation of beta obs in intact cells is due entirely to variation in the relative rates of intracellular steps of the denitrification process. The linear relation between beta obs and velocity imposes constraints on any proposed mechanism of denitrification."
https://openalex.org/W1480389324,"Previous studies have indicated that the asymmetric form of acetylcholinesterase is localized in the basement membrane zone of the neuromuscular junction. We find that the collagenous subunit of the enzyme is required for interactions with basement membrane components. Acetylcholinesterase (the A12 form) binds best to the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan and type V collagen, to a lesser extent to laminin, fibronectin, and type I collagen, but not to type IV collagen. In addition, the purified A12 enzyme as prepared from electric eel is associated with a heparan sulfate-like component which appears to be responsible for the aggregation of the enzyme at low ionic strength. We observed that the purified form of the enzyme reacted with antibodies to type V collagen, and to a lesser extent with anti-type I collagen antibody, but not with anti-type IV collagen antibody. These data suggest that the collagenous subunit of the enzyme may have some similarity to type V collagen and that the interaction of the collagenous subunit with a heparan sulfate proteoglycan may be involved in its binding to basement membrane in the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W1604225108,"Calf thyroid slices incubated with [U-14C]glucose synthesized protein-bound Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, Glc2-Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man8GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2. Although label in the glucose residues of the last three compounds could be detected within 5 min of incubation, appearance of radioactivity in the mannose residues of the alpha-mannosidase-resistant cores of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 took more than 30 and 60 min, respectively, to appear after label was detected in the same mannose residues of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. The glucose residues were removed upon chasing the slices with unlabeled glucose. The last compound to disappear was Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Calf thyroid microsomes incubated with UDP-[U-14C]Glc synthesized the five protein-bound oligosaccharides mentioned above. Although addition to GDP-Man to the incubation mixtures greatly diminished the formation of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 bound either to dolichol-P-P or to protein, labeling of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man8GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 was not affected. Addition of kojibiose prevented deglucosylation of protein-bound Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 without affecting the formation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 and only partially diminishing that of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. These results indicate that Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 were formed by glucosylation of the unglucosylated species and not be demannosylation of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and that probably part of the latter compound was formed in the same way."
https://openalex.org/W1622955452,"Anti-La antibodies are frequently found in patients with autoimmune diseases; the antigen was reported to be a 50,000-Da protein (Rinke, J., and Steitz, J. A. (1982) Cell 29, 149-159). Because this protein was associated with many nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts, it was suggested to be an RNA polymerase III transcription factor. The present study was designed to analyze 4.5 I ribonucleoprotein, an RNA polymerase III transcript which contains the La antigen. It was found that the 3'-end 20-30-nucleotide portion was the most protected portion of 4.5 I RNA when 4.5 I ribonucleoprotein was digested with T1 RNase. When U2 RNA (an RNA polymerase II transcript) and 4.5 I RNA were incubated with the S-100 fraction of Novikoff hepatoma cells, the 4.5 I RNA bound La antigen but the U2 RNA did not. When partial and complete T1 RNase digestion fragments of 4.5 I RNA were incubated with the S-100 fraction, the 3'-end fragments bound preferentially to the La antigen. However, the fragments of 4.5 I RNA bound less efficiently to La antigen than whole 4.5 I RNA. These results indicate that the 3'-end of 4.5 I RNA is the La antigen binding site in this molecule and suggest that the overall conformation of RNA aids in the binding of La antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1596109065,"Since insects are cholesterol auxotrophs, we analyzed the apparent paradox presented by an established cell line (Kc cells) from Drosophila embryos which grew in media which contained less than 0.05 micrograms/ml of sterols. Fresh Drosophila embryos contained 3.7 micrograms of 3 beta-hydroxysterols/mg of protein; however, Kc cells had maximally 0.50 micrograms of 3 beta-hydroxysterols/mg of protein. Kc cells, grown in media which contained cholesterol, showed the presence of sterol in their plasma and intracellular membranes. Kc cells did not synthesize sterols or any apparent replacement lipophilic molecule. However, two major compounds which comigrated with ubiquinone and dolichol were synthesized from radioactive mevalonate and acetate. Cholesterol incorporation into Kc cell membranes did not significantly alter total phospholipid head or acyl group composition. Similar observations were obtained with Schneider's Drosophila cell line I and a mosquito (Aedes albopictus) cell line. Our results (a) challenged current concepts that sterols or related replacement isopentenoid molecules were required for eukaryotic membrane structure, (b) demonstrated that marked alterations in eukaryotic membrane sterol composition was insufficient to change total phospholipid head and/or acyl group composition, and (c) set the stage for the use of a eukaryotic cell to examine the regulation of 3-hydroxy,3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity independent of a requirement for sterol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W124439162,"Undegraded mucus glycoprotein has been isolated in highly purified form from gastric secretion of cystic fibrosis patients. The purification procedure involved gel filtrations on Bio-Gel P-100 and Bio-Gel A-50 and lipid extractions with five mixtures of the organic solvents. The final preparation represented pure glycoprotein as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and lipid analysis. Treatment of the pure and delipidated glycoprotein with methanolic KOH or hydroxylamine resulted in liberation of ester-bound fatty acids. Of the total released fatty acids, 95% were represented by hexadecanoate (36.5%), octadecanoate (48.7%), and octadecenoate (8.6%). The quantitative analysis established that, on the average, 12.2 nmol of fatty acids/mg of glycoprotein were released. The studies on cystic fibrotic glycoprotein susceptibility to proteolytic digestion indicated that fraction of glycoprotein which was resistant to pronase digestion contained on the average 33.1 nmol of fatty acids/mg of glycoprotein. After removal of the fatty acid residues from pronase-resistant glycoprotein, by treatment with hydroxylamine, the glycoprotein became susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Thus, in cystic fibrosis, the covalently bound fatty acids interfere with proteolytic degradation of mucus glycoprotein. Perhaps this is the major defect of cystic fibrosis glycoproteins and the cause of the obstruction of secretory glands and the accumulation of poorly soluble secretions."
https://openalex.org/W1544176955,"Microtubule protein isolated from nucleated chicken erythrocytes was examined with respect to composition and assembly properties to determine its significance in a microtubule bundle called the marginal band. 1) The protein contains greater than 95% tubulin with small amounts of tau polypeptides and no high molecular weight polypeptides. 2) Microtubule assembly in vitro at 37 degrees C is characterized by low levels of nucleation, despite an abundance of ring oligomers at 5 degrees C, as indicated by long lag times, slow assembly rates, and microtubules that are twice as long as brain microtubules assembled under the same conditions. 3) By radioimmunoassay and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analysis we determined that 0.6% of erythrocyte protein is tubulin of which three-quarters is in a nonextractable form and is associated with the microtubule bundle and the cell cortex. From these values the in vivo concentrations of total tubulin and tubulin dimer subunits are 2.4 and 0.7 mg/ml, respectively. The value of 0.7 mg/ml is close to the range of values of 0.1-0.6 mg/ml for the critical concentration of erythrocyte microtubule protein in vitro, suggesting that the assembly properties of tubulin in vitro and in vivo are similar."

https://openalex.org/W1590568879,"The interaction of Acanthamoeba actin and Acanthamoeba profilin was evaluated as a function of ionic conditions. In the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl, profilin decreased the concentration of F-actin at steady state, and inhibited the rates of filament elongation and spontaneous nucleation and polymerization. All of the experimental data were quantitatively accounted for on the basis of a 1:1 complex between profilin and monomeric actin with a Kr between 4 and 9 microM, the same value obtained previously in the absence of MgCl2. Therefore, the Mg2+ concentration did not affect the KD of the profilin-actin complex in these experiments. On the other hand, profilin did greatly amplify the decrease in concentration of F-actin at steady state caused by lowering the Mg2+ concentration. This results from the effect of Mg2+ on the critical concentration of the actin monomer with which the profilin-actin complex is in equilibrium. When the Mg2+ concentration is lowered, the critical concentration of actin monomer increases so that more profilin-actin complex is formed. Thus, appreciably more F-actin depolymerizes than in the absence of profilin. In this way, profilin could function intracellularly to convert small changes in critical concentration into large changes in the concentration of F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1588704345,"We have characterized the mechanism of action of a wheat germ RNA ligase which has been partially purified on the basis of its ability to participate in in vitro splicing of yeast tRNA precursors (Gegenheimer, P., Gabius, H-J., Peebles, C.L., and Abelson, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8365-8373). The preparation catalyzes the ligation of oligoribonucleotide substrates forming a 2'-phosphomonoester, 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage. The 5' terminus of an RNA substrate can have either a 5'-hydroxyl or a 5'-phosphate. The 5'-phosphate, which for a 5'-hydroxyl substrate can be introduced by a polynucleotide kinase activity in the preparation, is incorporated into the ligated junction. The 3' terminus can have either a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or a 2'-phosphate. 2',3'-Cyclic phosphates can be converted into 2'-phosphates by a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, 3'-phosphodiesterase activity in the preparation. The 2'-phosphate of the ligated product is derived from the phosphate at the 3' terminus of the substrate. Ligation proceeds with the adenylylation of the 5'-phosphorylated terminus to form an intermediate with a 5',5'-phosphoanhydride bond."
https://openalex.org/W1486313261,"The transbilayer mobility of phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecules in the membrane of homozygous reversible sickle cells (RSCs) was studied using a PC-specific exchange protein from beef liver. In deoxygenated RSCs, all of the PC present in the membrane of the intact cell is rapidly available for exchange, mediated by this protein. Since a substantial amount of the PC is present in the inner membrane leaflet of these cells, this observation implies that the PC molecules in their membranes do experience rapid transbilayer movements. To determine the actual rate of transbilayer movement of the PC, radioactive PC was introduced into the outer monolayer of oxygenated RSCs using the PC-specific exchange protein. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C under oxy- and deoxygenating conditions to enable the PC to equilibrate within the bilayer. At various time intervals, samples were taken and treated with phospholipase A2, which selectively degrades the PC in the outer monolayer. Analysis of the specific radioactivities of the lyso-PC thus produced, as well as of the residual PC, enabled us to follow the fate of the radioactive PC previously introduced into the outer membrane layer. The half-time value for transbilayer equilibration of the PC in deoxygenated RSCs was determined to be 3.5 h, which is about four times lower than that for oxygenated RSCs. This increased transbilayer mobility of PC, observed in deoxygenated RSCs, is immediately restored to the normal low rate upon reoxygenation of the cells, indicating a complete reversibility of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1541443607,"The conversion of glucose to lactate via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway yields a maximum of 2 mol of ATP per mol of glucose degraded with lesser amounts of ATP obtained if metabolic intermediates are removed for biosynthesis or if substrate cycling occurs during carbohydrate degradation. Bull sperm are an ideal test system for a quantitative estimate of ATP yield because they contain enzymes necessary for potential substrate cycling and do not carry out significant biosynthesis. Experiments utilized specifically labeled glucose and fructose to test for substrate cycling between glucose in equilibrium glucose-6-PO4, fructose in equilibrium fructose-6-PO4, and fructose-6-PO4 in equilibrium bisphosphate. Flux through the pathway (low = less than or equal to 0.05; moderate = 0.1; high = greater than 0.5 mol of carbohydrate consumed per h/10(8) cells) was altered by changing incubation temperature and/or by adding metabolic effectors. The data (in situ rates of kinases and phosphatases and metabolite crossover plots) obtained under these conditions were used to establish if the generally accepted regulatory enzymes (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase) approach the overall flux through the glycolytic pathway, i.e. that of a classical kinetically limiting rate-determining step. In summary: (a) At low flux, the rates of phosphorylation greatly exceeded overall flux. This resulted in extensive substrate cycling at all points and a net ATP yield of less than or equal to 0 mol/mol of glucose initially phosphorylated. (b) At moderate flux, rate of hexokinase approached that of overall flux through the glycolytic pathway but excessive phosphofructokinase activity led to substrate cycling between fructose-6-PO4 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and resulted in a low net ATP yield (0-0.6 mol/mol of glucose). (c) At high flux, rates of phosphofructokinase and hexokinase approached that of the overall flux. Minimal substrate cycling occurred between fructose-6-PO4 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and the net ATP yield approached 1.8 mol/mol of glucose. These experiments established that the theoretical stoichiometric ATP yield of the pathway was rarely achieved during these incubations because of extensive substrate cycling. Indeed, for cauda epididymal bull sperm isolated and incubated in vitro, the glycolytic pathway serves to generate lactate, an intermediate product that is further metabolized in the mitochondria to yield the ATP that is associated with degradation of exogenous carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1572050650,"The metabolism of endogenous sphingomyelin labeled with 32P or [methyl-3H]choline and of exogenous [choline-methyl-3H], [32P]-, or [N-acyl-1-14C]sphingomyelin was studied in normal and Niemann-Pick Type A (NP-A) cultured fibroblasts. Despite a greater than 96% decrease in lysosomal sphingomyelinase activity in the NP-A cells, they were able to degrade endogenously produced [32P]- or [methyl-3H]sphingomyelin at normal or near normal rates. Exogenous [methyl-3H]-, [methyl-3H, 32P]-, and [methyl-3H, N-acyl-1-14C] sphingomyelin was taken up intact by normal and NP-A cells, with NP-A cells accumulating 4-8 times more lipid. By 20 h, 50% of the control cell-associated 3H and 32P was recovered in lecithin, and the ratio of activities (3H/32P) indicated most of the phosphorylcholine derived from sphingomyelin had been transferred intact. By comparison in NP-A cells, after a 40-h incubation only 20% of the labeled phosphorylcholine derived from sphingomyelin was recovered in lecithin. With both cell lines, 20 to 50 times more sphingomyelin was hydrolyzed than was taken up by the cells; the reaction products in the medium were ceramide and a mixture of water-soluble compounds such as phosphorylcholine and choline. These results indicate that there are at least two metabolic pathways for sphingomyelin modification in cultured fibroblasts in addition to degradation by the lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase. One route is hydrolysis by a cellular sphingomyelinase. The second is the hydrolysis and/or transfer of phosphorylcholine from sphingomyelin and results in the synthesis of lecithin."
https://openalex.org/W1595802823,"The formation and autoxidative decomposition of the oxygenated forms of two isozymes of rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 were studied: 5,6-benzoflavone- or isosafrole-inducible P-450LM4, isolated in the high spin state, and P-450LM3b, isolated in the low spin state. When an anaerobic solution of photochemically reduced isozyme 4 was mixed with aerobic buffer in a stopped flow spectrophotometer, the dioxygen complex with absorption maxima at 555 and 418 nm was rapidly formed. The monophasic reaction had a pseudo-first order rate constant of about 58 s-1. Autoxidation of the complex, which was complete in about 20 s, exhibited biphasic first order kinetics at 580 nm with rate constants of about 0.92 and 0.22 s-1. The results obtained with isozyme 3b were similar, except that the decomposition of the ferrous oxy intermediate appeared to be triphasic. Superoxide could not be detected as a product of the autoxidative decomposition of the oxy form of P-450 isozyme 4. Hydrogen peroxide was produced in about 70% yield when oxygen was in excess, whereas in a titration in which small increments of oxygen were added to an excess of the ferrous cytochrome the reduction apparently led to the formation of water. The biphasic kinetics of some of the reactions involving purified mammalian cytochrome P-450 has in some instances been attributed to the formation of aggregates by these hydrophobic proteins. This was ruled out as an explanation of the kinetics observed for the autoxidative decay of ferrous dioxygen P-450LM4, since two phases were also observed with a preparation converted from the usual aggregated state to the monomeric state by exposure to a zwitterionic detergent."
https://openalex.org/W1538904445,"A cytosolic protein carboxyl methyltransferase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:protein O-methyltransferase, E.C. 2.1.1.24) purified from human erythrocytes catalyzes the methylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins in vitro using S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine as the methyl group donor. The principal methyl-accepting proteins have been identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis at pH 2.4 and fluorography as the anion transport protein (band 3), ankyrin (band 2.1), and integral membrane proteins with molecular weights of 45,000, 28,000, and 21,000. Many of the methylation sites associated with intrinsic membrane proteins may reside in their extracellular portions, since these same proteins are methylated when intact cells are used as the substrate. The maximal number of methyl groups transferred in these experiments is approximately 30 pmol/mg of membrane protein, a value which represents less than one methyl group/50 polypeptide chains of any methyl-accepting species. The number of methylation sites associated with the membranes is increased, but not to stoichiometric levels, by prior demethylation of the membranes. The additional sites are associated primarily with bands 2.1 and 4.1, the principal methyl acceptors in vivo, suggesting that most methylation sites are fully modified in vivo. Extracellular methylation sites are not increased by demethylation of membranes. The aspartic acid beta-methyl ester which can be isolated from carboxypeptidase Y digests of [3H]methylated membranes is in the unusual D-stereoconfiguration. Similar results have been obtained with [3H]methylated membranes isolated from intact cells (McFadden, P.N., and Clarke, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2460-2464). It is proposed that the methyltransferase recognizes D-aspartyl residues in proteins and is involved with the metabolism of damaged proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1601232054,"Transfer RNA half-molecules are intermediates in the splicing of tRNA precursors containing intervening sequences. We have utilized yeast tRNA half-molecules to identify and partially purify an ATP-dependent RNA ligase activity from extracts of wheat germ. This activity can complement a yeast tRNA endonuclease in vitro to efficiently splice 10 different yeast tRNA precursors. The products of in vitro splicing are a covalently joined tRNA and a circular intervening sequence RNA. The internucleotide bond formed at the splice junction is a 2'-phosphomonoester, 3',5'-phosphodiester structure. The 2'-phosphate originates from the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate at the 3' terminus of the 5' half-tRNA. The phosphodiester phosphate is derived from the gamma-phosphate of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1572010500,"In an effort to characterize the hepatocyte bile acid transport system, a photoreactive derivative of taurocholate, (7,7-azo-3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (7-ADTC) has been synthesized and its transport properties compared to those of the natural substrate. Both the bile acid and its synthetic analog were shown to be transported against an electrochemical gradient as well as a chemical gradient. Transport as a function of concentration and the presence of sodium indicated that both substrates were taken up by a sodium-dependent and a sodium-independent route. Taurocholate had Km values of 26 and 57 microM and Vmax values of 0.77 and 0.15 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. In comparison, 7-ADTC had very similar kinetic properties with Km values of 25 and 31 microM and Vmax values of 1.14 and 0.27 nmol/mg of protein/min. Each compound was shown to inhibit competitively the transport of the other, suggesting that these substrates utilized a common membrane carrier. The transport properties of the photoreactive anion transport inhibitor, N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethylsulfonate (NAP-taurine) were also characterized in the hepatocyte system. Transport occurred via a sodium-dependent and a sodium-independent route with Km values of 210 and 555 microM and Vmax values of 0.57 and 1.62 nmol/mg of protein/min. As in the case of 7-ADTC, NAP-taurine and taurocholate were also shown to be mutual competitive inhibitors. In the absence of light, 7-ADTC was a reversible inhibitor of taurocholate uptake. Upon irradiation, irreversible photoinactivation of the taurocholate uptake system was observed. These results indicate that 7-ADTC and NAP-taurine can be utilized as photoaffinity probes for the identification of the bile acid carrier protein(s) in hepatocyte plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1481279942,"When 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone was incubated with adrenocortical mitochondria fortified by adding exogenously adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin in the presence of an NADPH-generating system, the steroid was converted to two products which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The retention time of one product was identical with that of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, an expected product of 11 beta-hydroxylation, whereas the retention time of the other was not coincident with those of any other corticosteroids examined. Production of the unidentified substance was also shown when 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone was incubated with purified cytochrome P-45011 beta and its electron transport system. The ratio of the two products was always constant, even when various incubation conditions were employed with regard to reaction time, the substrate concentration, and the cytochrome concentration. Structural determination of the unidentified product was conducted by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectrometry. The results of these analyses indicated that the substance was 18,19-dihydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone, a hitherto unreported corticosteroid."
https://openalex.org/W1557241217,"We used an established Drosophila cell line (Kc cells), which neither synthesized nor required cholesterol for growth, to determine if sterol and nonsterol modulators of vertebrate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity were also active in this biological system. Drosophila HMG-CoA reductase was membrane-bound and required NADPH for catalysis. In contrast to the vertebrate enzyme, Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity was not modulated by cholesterol (10 micrograms/ml), human low density lipoprotein (83 micrograms of cholesterol/ml), or oxygenated sterols (5-10 micrograms/ml). However, mevalonate caused a rapid strong suppression of Kc HMG-CoA reductase activity; 18 microM R-mevalonate produced 50% suppression of the enzyme within 24 h. Compactin, a competitive inhibitor, decreased HMG-CoA reductase activity in Drosophila embryo cell-free extracts with an apparent Ki of 1.0 nM. Kc cells, grown in the presence of compactin, had a HMG-CoA reductase specific activity 5- to 10-fold higher than untreated cells. Mevalonate blocked this increase. We have concluded that HMG-CoA reductase activity in Kc cells is (a) not responsive to feedback inhibition by sterols, and (b) is controlled by a fundamental sterol-independent regulatory process. The signal for modulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity may be mevalonate and/or its magnitude conversion to a nonsterol isopentenoid precursor and/or end product. These observations may have broader validity, not only for other insect cells, but for eukaryotic cells in general."

https://openalex.org/W117527444,"Glyoxalase I catalyzes the formation of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione via the hemimercaptal adduct of methylglyoxal and glutathione. This enzymatic reaction, which has been considered virtually irreversible, was found to be reversible under such conditions that glutathione liberated from the thiolester was trapped. The reverse reaction could be monitored spectrophotometrically by use of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate). In addition to 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), 2,2'-dithiobispyridine and cystamine were used to promote the reverse reaction. S-D-Lactoylglutathione did not hydrolyze in the presence of glyoxalase I under the conditions investigated, as shown by its stability in the absence of thioltrapping agents. Proof of the reversal of the reaction was obtained by demonstrating the formation of stoichiometric amounts of methylglyoxal and glutathione from S-D-lactoylglutathione. Catalysis of the reverse reaction was dependent upon the presence of a bivalent metal ion in the active site of the enzyme. Apoenzyme, obtained by removal of the essential Zn2+ from the active site, did not catalyze the reverse reaction, but catalytic activity was restored by addition of Zn2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+. The reverse reaction was also catalyzed by glyoxalase I from yeast. Linear competitive inhibition (Ki = 0.64 mM) was obtained with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), which necessitated correction of the apparent kinetic parameters of the reverse reaction. The corrected values for the reverse reaction catalyzed by glyoxalase I from human erythrocytes with S-D-lactoylglutathione as substrate were kcat = 3.6 s-1 and Km = 1.9 mM. Combination of these values with the corresponding parameters for the forward reaction allowed calculation, through the Haldane relation, of the equilibrium constant, Keq = 1.1 X 10(4), for the isomerization between the hemimercaptal of methylglyoxal and glutathione and S-D-lactoylglutathione. The strong reversible competitive inhibitor of the forward reaction, S-p-bromobenzylglutathione, also inhibited the reverse reaction competitively (Ki = 0.38 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1487909158,"Proteoglycans are considered to be important for the mechanical properties of articular cartilage and growth plate and for the regulation of calcification of growth plate. We have used ultracentrifugation, gel chromatography, and electron microscopy to characterize and compare proteoglycans isolated from rabbit articular cartilage, uncalcified growth plate, and calcified cartilage. We found that proteoglycans from articular cartilage were more resistant to extraction than were proteoglycans from uncalcified growth plate and calcified cartilage. Long term neutral decalcification of calcified cartilage resulted in degraded proteoglycans. The chondroitin sulfate chains from all three tissues had similar size distribution. Gel chromatography and electron microscopy of proteoglycan monomers suggested that those from uncalcified growth plate were largest, those from articular cartilage intermediate, and those from calcified cartilage smallest. Proteoglycan aggregates from articular cartilage were longer than those from uncalcified growth plate. Both biochemical and quantitative electron microscopic data suggested the existence in mineralizing cartilage of at least two different sized populations of proteoglycan aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W170113564,"Concanavalin A has been reductively methylated using [13C]formaldehyde and NaCNBH3 and examined by 13C NMR. The chemical modification does not alter the metal ion or saccharide binding properties of the protein nor the associating of dimers to form tetramers above pH 6. Eleven of the 12 N epsilon,N-dimethyllysines appear as a broad unresolved group of resonances at pH 5.6, while one N epsilon,N-dimethyllysine (tentatively assigned to Lys 101) gives rise to two resolved methyl resonances as a result of forming a salt bridge with Asp 203 (Reeke, G. N., Jr., Becker, J. W., and Edelman, G. M. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1525-1547). The NH2-terminal N alpha,N-dimethylalanine appears as a unique resonance and titrates with a pKa of 7.9. The chemical shift degeneracy of the N epsilon,N-dimethyllysine is lifted when Co2+ is bound in the S1 site of the protein. These resonances sharpen and shift downfield differentially with increasing pH until eight of 12 N epsilon,N-dimethyllysine resonances are resolved at pH 10. A comparison of the expected Co2+-induced shift at each lysine based upon their crystal coordinates and previous Co2+-histidine shift data (Carver, J. P., Barber, B. H., and Fuhr, B. J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 3141-3146) with those observed in the N epsilon,N-dimethyllysine resonances has allowed a tentative assignment of several resonances to a specific lysine in the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1513586445,"The effect of acidic phospholipids on the A and B multiple forms of membrane-bound mitochondrial monoamine oxidase has been investigated by incubating liposomes with isolated rat liver mitochondrial outer membrane preparations at lipid:protein ratios of 0.01 to 1. A strong inhibition of monoamine oxidase B was observed with phosphatidylserine and a moderate activation of monoamine oxidase A with phosphatidylinositol, while cardiolipin had no significant effect on either form. The specificity of phosphatidylserine inhibition for monoamine oxidase B was also confirmed in mitochondrial outer membrane isolated from tissues containing exclusively the A or B form of the enzyme (human placenta and bovine liver). Levels of incorporation were comparable for all the phospholipids and tissues studied and could not account for the different effects observed. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase B was found to be similar in an intact mitochondria preparation to that observed in the isolated outer membrane. A recent report of activation of both monoamine oxidase forms in delipidated whole mitochondria by the acidic phospholipids was re-examined and found to involve release of monoamine oxidase from the mitochondria. The details of the effects of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol on membrane-bound monoamine oxidase are consistent with the concept of the multiple forms as two distinct peptides, and suggest a second possible mode of in vivo regulation of substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1546120922,"When the mycelial to yeast transition of the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is induced by a temperature shift from 25 to 37 degrees C, the activities of the cytochrome system and the alternate oxidase decrease in parallel over the first 24 to 40 h (stage 1 of the transition). The decrease in activity of the cytochrome system is correlated with extensive decreases in the amounts of cytochromes b, c, and aa3, assayed spectrophotometrically. After 40 h, the cells enter a dormant phase (stage 2 of the transition) and cysteine or other sulfhydryl-containing compounds are required to reactivate mitochondrial respiration. This reactivation is due to the establishment of pathways which bypass blocked segments of the electron transport system. The shunt pathways operate normally in mycelia grown at 25 degrees C, but are shut down during the transition, possibly because of depletion of intracellular cysteine. The longstanding observation that cysteine is required to progress beyond the initial stages of the morphological transition may be due, at least in part, to the reactivation of these shunt pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1607811887,"We studied the in vitro synthesis of relaxin--an ovarian protein hormone related to the insulin subset of growth factors. RNA isolated from corpora lutea of pregnant sows directed the synthesis of a Mr = 23,000 protein in an ascites tumor cell-free system. This protein contained all of the cysteine-bearing tryptic peptides of relaxin as determined by precise co-migration of tryptic fragments of relaxin precursor generated in vitro and those of highly purified relaxin isolated from sow ovary. Based upon these data, it is likely that the primary translation product of porcine relaxin shares structural homology with preproinsulin. The Mr = 23,000 precursor to relaxin is converted to a Mr = 20,000 prohormone in the presence of ascites microsomal membranes. This conversion and the membrane translocation phenomenon which accompanies it can be inhibited in vitro by the use of beta-hydroxyleucine, an amino acid analog. Use of amino acid analogs may represent a technique to allow study of the conversion of relaxin precursors to relaxin in the luteal cell."
https://openalex.org/W1530516571,"The structural basis of the interaction of melittin with amphipathic molecular assemblies, i.e. membranes, was investigated by studying the binding of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) to melittin by ultraviolet and fluorescence spectroscopy. Monomeric melittin did not significantly bind TNS as judged by UV and fluorescent spectroscopy. Tetrameric melittin bound two TNS molecules per protomer with dissociation constants (Kd) of 4.2 X 10(-6) M. TNS binding to tetrameric melittin led to an increase in fluorescence quantum yield of 180-fold over the value for TNS alone in aqueous buffer (phi H2O = 0.004). Five independent experimental findings suggest that the arginine residues of melittin provide one portion of the TNS binding site (presumably by formation of an especially stable ringed-structure salt bridge between the tetrahedral sulfonyl anion of TNS and the argininyl residues of melittin): 1) the Kd for binding is independent of pH from 6.0 to 10.8, the range in which the alpha-aminoglycine and epsilon-aminolysines titrate; 2) TNS binding fails to perturb the kinetics of the reaction of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonate with Lys-21 or Lys-23; 3) 1,7,21,23-acetyl-melittin, in which the NH2 terminus and all lysines are acetylated, binds TNS with a Kd similar to that for normal melittin; 4) guanidination of the NH2-terminal glycines and lysines of melittin (forming N-guanidoglycine and homoargininyl residues, respectively) increases the number of TNS molecules bound per protomer to approximately 5; 5) conversion of Arg-22 and Arg-24 to the anionic N7, N8-(2,3-dihydro(7,7-dimethyl))bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane - 1 - methanesulfonylborate complex abolishes TNS binding, as judged by fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1601463975,"A 4-methylene-L-glutamine amidohydrolase has been partially purified from leaf extracts of 2-week germinated peanuts (Arachis hypogaea). Purification steps include DEAE-Sephacel and gel filtration chromatography as well as chromatofocusing; amidohydrolase purified 300- to 400-fold is obtained. The enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 45,000 as determined by gel filtration chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a broad activity optimum between pH 8.0 and 9.0, and is highly specific toward 4-methylene-L-glutamine. Of a number of amides tested as substrate, only L-glutamine serves 20% as effectively as the methylene-substituted analog. Multiple bands of activity, seen when enzyme samples are electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels, are not completely resolved but appear to be very similar in molecular weight, pK values, and subcellular localization. Activity is not affected either by added thiols, metal ions, sulfhydryl-reacting reagents, or metal-ion chelators; it is inhibited by borate ions but stimulated by sodium dodecyl sulfate. This amidohydrolase activity is absent in imbibed seeds, but on germination increases rapidly in the cotyledons and leaves for 3 weeks followed by a gradual decline as the plant matures. Activity is almost completely (95%) localized in the leaves and cotyledons. Differential centrifugation studies indicate that the enzyme is found solely in the soluble fraction of peanut leaves."
