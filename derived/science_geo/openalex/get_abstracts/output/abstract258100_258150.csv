Two papers in this issue show that even brief reactivation of the endogenous p53 genes in established tumours can cause cancer regression in some animal models. In some tumours, p53 reactivation causes cellular senescence associated with an innate immune response that contributes to tumour clearance. These experiments used gene manipulation to alter p53 levels, but they lend further support to the idea that p53-boosting drugs could be a useful form of cancer treatment. One of two papers showing that reactivation of the endogenous p53 tumour suppressor genes in established tumours causes cancer regression. In some tumours, p53 reactivation causes cellular senescence associated with an innate immune response that contributes to tumour clearance. Although cancer arises from a combination of mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, the extent to which tumour suppressor gene loss is required for maintaining established tumours is poorly understood. p53 is an important tumour suppressor that acts to restrict proliferation in response to DNA damage or deregulation of mitogenic oncogenes, by leading to the induction of various cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis or cellular senescence1,2. Consequently, p53 mutations increase cell proliferation and survival, and in some settings promote genomic instability and resistance to certain chemotherapies3. To determine the consequences of reactivating the p53 pathway in tumours, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to conditionally regulate endogenous p53 expression in a mosaic mouse model of liver carcinoma4,5. We show that even brief reactivation of endogenous p53 in p53-deficient tumours can produce complete tumour regressions. The primary response to p53 was not apoptosis, but instead involved the induction of a cellular senescence program that was associated with differentiation and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. This program, although producing only cell cycle arrest in vitro, also triggered an innate immune response that targeted the tumour cells in vivo, thereby contributing to tumour clearance. Our study indicates that p53 loss can be required for the maintenance of aggressive carcinomas, and illustrates how the cellular senescence program can act together with the innate immune system to potently limit tumour growth."

https://openalex.org/W2045907249,"To understand the role of FoxO family members in hematopoiesis, we conditionally deleted FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 in the adult hematopoietic system. FoxO-deficient mice exhibited myeloid lineage expansion, lymphoid developmental abnormalities, and a marked decrease of the lineage-negative Sca-1+, c-Kit+ (LSK) compartment that contains the short- and long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations. FoxO-deficient bone marrow had defective long-term repopulating activity that correlated with increased cell cycling and apoptosis of HSC. Notably, there was a marked context-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FoxO-deficient HSC compared with wild-type HSC that correlated with changes in expression of genes that regulate ROS. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the antioxidative agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine resulted in reversion of the FoxO-deficient HSC phenotype. Thus, FoxO proteins play essential roles in the response to physiologic oxidative stress and thereby mediate quiescence and enhanced survival in the HSC compartment, a function that is required for its long-term regenerative potential."

https://openalex.org/W2124261225,"Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling appears to be an obligate event in the development of cancer. The highly related members of the mammalian FoxO transcription factor family, FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, represent one of several effector arms of PI3K-AKT signaling, prompting genetic analysis of the role of FoxOs in the neoplastic phenotypes linked to PI3K-AKT activation. While germline or somatic deletion of up to five FoxO alleles produced remarkably modest neoplastic phenotypes, broad somatic deletion of all FoxOs engendered a progressive cancer-prone condition characterized by thymic lymphomas and hemangiomas, demonstrating that the mammalian FoxOs are indeed bona fide tumor suppressors. Transcriptome and promoter analyses of differentially affected endothelium identified direct FoxO targets and revealed that FoxO regulation of these targets in vivo is highly context-specific, even in the same cell type. Functional studies validated Sprouty2 and PBX1, among others, as FoxO-regulated mediators of endothelial cell morphogenesis and vascular homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1972204116,"Formation of the apical surface and lumen is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, step in epithelial organ development. We show that PTEN localizes to the apical plasma membrane during epithelial morphogenesis to mediate the enrichment of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at this domain during cyst development in three-dimensional culture. Ectopic PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the basolateral surface causes apical proteins to relocalize to the basolateral surface. Annexin 2 (Anx2) binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 and is recruited to the apical surface. Anx2 binds Cdc42, recruiting it to the apical surface. Cdc42 recruits aPKC to the apical surface. Loss of function of PTEN, Anx2, Cdc42, or aPKC prevents normal development of the apical surface and lumen. We conclude that the mechanism of PTEN, PtdIns(4,5)P2, Anx2, Cdc42, and aPKC controls apical plasma membrane and lumen formation."

This complex is regulated by the 4E-BPs, which compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E and which have tumor-suppressor activity. To pharmacologically mimic 4E-BP function we developed a high-throughput screening assay for identifying small-molecule inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. The most potent compound identified, 4EGI-1, binds eIF4E, disrupts eIF4E/eIF4G association, and inhibits cap-dependent translation but not initiation factor-independent translation. While 4EGI-1 displaces eIF4G from eIF4E, it effectively enhances 4E-BP1 association both in vitro and in cells. 4EGI-1 inhibits cellular expression of oncogenic proteins encoded by weak mRNAs, exhibits activity against multiple cancer cell lines, and appears to have a preferential effect on transformed versus nontransformed cells. The identification of this compound provides a new tool for studying translational control and establishes a possible new strategy for cancer therapy.

The identification of this compound provides a new tool for studying translational control and establishes a possible new strategy for cancer therapy. The regulation of gene expression at the level of translation initiation is critical for proper control of cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In eukaryotes a set of initiation factors (eIFs) are required to dissociate the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, to recruit the mRNA and initiator tRNA to the 40S subunit, and to promote joining of the 60S subunit so that elongation can commence (Dever, 2002Dever T.E. Gene-specific regulation by general translation factors.Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, Hershey and Merrick, 2000Hershey J.W.B.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The major rate-limiting step in initiation is thought to be localization of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5′ end of the mRNA. This process requires the stepwise assembly of a large multiprotein complex centered on the trimer eIF4F. eIF4F is composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and the multidomain adaptor protein eIF4G (Gingras et al., 1999Gingras A.C.

The mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E in post-transcriptional gene expression.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cap-bound eIF4F recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit through the eIF3/eIF4G interaction, which initiates scanning to the initiation codon, where the 40S subunit joins with the 60S subunit. This process is facilitated by eIF4A, with the requirement for its helicase activity directly proportional to the amount of secondary structure in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that must be melted for scanning to occur (Svitkin et al., 2001Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. The requirement for eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (elF4A) in translation is in direct proportion to the degree of mRNA 5′ secondary structure.RNA. 2001; 7: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). All eIF4G proteins bind eIF4E through a motif of sequence Y(X)4LΦ, where X is variable and Φ is hydrophobic (Altmann et al., 1997Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif forms a helical peptide structure that binds to a conserved surface of hydrophobic residues on the dorsal side of eIF4E (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C.

In Saccharomyces cerivisiae this motif is part of a larger folded domain that forms an extended binding interface with eIF4E (Gross et al., 2003Gross J.D. Moerke N.J. von der Haar T. Lugovskoy A.A. Sachs A.B. McCarthy J.E. Wagner G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21297-21304Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether a larger interface exists in higher eukaryotes. Although the Y(X)4LΦ motif may not be sufficient for full affinity binding of mammalian eIF4G to eIF4E, the fact that mutations in this sequence can abrogate binding indicates that it is necessary for this protein-protein interaction (Mader et al., 1995Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. The translation initiation factor eIF-4E binds to a common motif shared by the translation factor eIF-4 gamma and the translational repressors 4E-binding proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular mRNAs differ greatly in the amount of eIF4F they require for efficient translation and in the composition of their 5′ UTRs. The majority of growth- and proliferation-related proteins are encoded by “weak” mRNAs containing long, highly structured 5′ UTRs that have lower translational efficiency than “strong” mRNAs, which contain relatively short and unstructured 5′ UTRs (Lodish, 1976Lodish H.F.

The implications of structured 5′ untranslated regions on translation and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Translation of weak mRNAs is highly eIF4F dependent and is preferentially enhanced when the eIF4F complex level is increased by eIF4E overexpression (Koromilas et al., 1992Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. mRNAs containing extensive secondary structure in their 5′ non-coding region translate efficiently in cells overexpressing initiation factor eIF-4E.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The amount of eIF4F in the cell is normally controlled by a class of small proteins termed 4E-BPs (Pause et al., 1994Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

Insulin-dependent stimulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of a regulator of 5′-cap function.Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) that sequester eIF4E from eIF4G (Haghighat et al., 1995Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N.

Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). These proteins contain the Y(X)4LΦ sequence found in eIF4G, and, using this motif, they can bind with high affinity to the same surface of eIF4E (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes is regulated by a molecular mimic of eIF4G.Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The activity of 4E-BPs is regulated by hierarchical phosphorylation at a set of conserved serine and threonine residues: hyperphosphorylated forms bind much more weakly than hypophosphorylated forms, and they are released from eIF4E (Gingras et al., 2001Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Hierarchical phosphorylation of the translation inhibitor 4E–BP1.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The kinase mTOR is the major upstream regulator of 4E-BPs: stimuli such as nutrients and growth factors induce 4E-BP phosphorylation and increased cellular eIF4F through signaling pathways that activate mTOR (Averous and Proud, 2006Averous J.

Misregulation of cap-dependent translation plays an important role in human disease. A number of genetic disorders characterized by aberrant cell growth, such as hypertrophic cardiopathy and tuberous sclerosis, are caused by mutations that disregulate the mTOR pathway (Inoki et al., 2005Inoki K.

Abnormal amounts of cellular eIF4F caused by elevated levels of initiation factors or misregulation of 4E-BP phosphorylation can play a key role in tumorigenesis (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004Bjornsti M.A. Houghton P.J.

Malignant transformation by overproduction of translation initiation factor eIF4G.Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5041-5044PubMed Google Scholar) can induce malignant transformation in mammalian cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of 4E-BPs can partially revert eIF4E-transformed cells to a nonmalignant phenotype (Rousseau et al., 1996Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. The eIF4E-binding proteins 1 and 2 are negative regulators of cell growth.Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar) and induce apoptosis in cells transformed by other oncogenes such as Ras (Avdulov et al., 2004Avdulov S. Li S. Michalek V. Burrichter D. Peterson M. Perlman D.M. Manivel J.C. Sonenberg N. Yee D.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2853-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Peptides containing the Y(X)4LΦ motif also can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells (Herbert et al., 2000Herbert T.P. Fahraeus R.

Biol. 2000; 10: 793-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In transgenic mouse models, eIF4E overexpression promotes tumorigenesis (Ruggero et al., 2004Ruggero D. Montanaro L. Ma L. Xu W. Londei P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. The translation factor eIF-4E promotes tumor formation and cooperates with c-Myc in lymphomagenesis.Nat.

Survival signalling by Akt and eIF4E in oncogenesis and cancer therapy.Nature. 2004; 428: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), while 4E-BP1 expression suppresses it (Polunovsky et al., 2000Polunovsky V.A. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Tan A. Rubins J.B. Manivel J.C. Bitterman P.B. Translational control of the antiapoptotic function of Ras.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24776-24780Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that, in humans, a variety of tumor types exhibit elevated levels of eIF4E (Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Does the ribosome translate cancer?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Thus, the eIF4F complex is considered to be an important target for cancer therapy. RNA that is antisense to eIF4E has been shown to suppress the oncogenic properties of a head and neck carcinoma cell line (DeFatta et al., 2000DeFatta R.J. Nathan C.A. De Benedetti A. Antisense RNA to eIF4E suppresses oncogenic properties of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line.Laryngoscope. 2000; 110: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, several analogs of rapamycin, a drug that decreases eIF4F levels by inhibiting mTOR-dependent 4E-BP phosphorylation, have antitumor activity and are being evaluated as cancer drugs in clinical trials (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004Bjornsti M.A. Houghton P.J.

Chemical genetics is a powerful tool for the study of cellular processes. High-throughput screens of compound libraries have been successfully used to identify new small-molecule modulators of translation initiation (Bordeleau et al., 2005Bordeleau M.E. Matthews J. Wojnar J.M. Lindqvist L. Novac O. Jankowsky E. Sonenberg N. Northcote P. Teesdale-Spittle P. Pelletier J.

Guenier A.S. Pelletier J. Inhibitors of protein synthesis identified by a high throughput multiplexed translation screen.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 902-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An increasingly important strategy in chemical genetics is the identification of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions (Arkin and Wells, 2004Arkin M.R. Wells J.A. Small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions: progressing towards the dream.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Such inhibitors potentially offer a highly selective way to modulate the function of protein complexes and in many cases have therapeutic potential. Extended protein-protein interfaces typically contain “hot spots,” which are compact regions of conserved residues that are critical for binding affinity and that are attractive targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. In the eIF4E/eIF4G interface the group of conserved eIF4E surface residues that contact the Y(X)4LΦ peptide constitute such a site. We reasoned that small molecules that compete with this peptide for binding to eIF4E would inhibit the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. In order to identify compounds that disrupt the interaction between eIF4E and the Y(X)4LΦ motif of eIF4G, we have developed a high-throughput fluorescence polarization (FP)-binding assay. A peptide containing the sequence KYTYDELFQLK was synthesized and tagged with fluorescein. Titration of this peptide with eIF4E causes the FP and the fluorescence anisotropy (FA) to increase almost 3-fold, and fitting the data into previously described equations (Roehrl et al., 2004Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Wagner G. A general framework for development and data analysis of competitive high-throughput screens for small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions by fluorescence polarization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16056-16066Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) yields a peptide KD of 3 μM (Figure 1A). As a positive control to validate the assay, the addition of an unlabeled competitor eIF4GII peptide (with the sequence KKQYDREFLLDFQFMPA) was shown to cause the FP to return to the level of free labeled peptide (Figure 1B). Fitting of this data for the unlabeled peptide yields an estimated KD of 200 nM. This is close to the previously reported value of 150 nM, which was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes is regulated by a molecular mimic of eIF4G.Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus, the principle of the screen is to identify the compounds that displace the labeled peptide from eIF4E by detecting the resulting decrease in FP. For the initial screen we used the 16,000 compound Chembridge DiverSet E library, from which a compound that we have termed 4EGI-1 (for eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitor) was identified (Figure 1D). Analysis of the labeled peptide displacement caused by this compound as measured by FA (which is directly related to FP) shows the compound is a competitive inhibitor of eIF4G peptide binding (Figure 1C). In order to examine the specificity of 4EGI-1 we have synthesized two analogs, 4EGI-1A and 4EGI-N (Figure 1D). While 4EGI-N does not displace the labeled peptide, 4EGI-1A has activity similar to that of 4EGI-1 (Figure 1C). Fitting these data to a three-component (eIF4E, peptide, inhibitor) competition equilibrium yields, for eIF4E binding of 4EGI-1 and 4EGI-1A, KD estimates of 25 μM ± 11 μM and 16 μM ± 6 μM, respectively. These values provide rough estimates (as the errors indicate) of the upper bound of the binding affinity for eIF4E. The fact that 4EGI-1 and 4EGI-1A exist in two interconverting isomeric forms in aqueous solution (see below) significantly complicates fitting the multiple binding equilibria involved and does not allow a more accurate determination of the KDs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the interaction of 4EGI-1 with eIF4E. In order to confirm the direct binding of 4EGI-1 to eIF4E, we titrated this molecule with perdeuterated protein and monitored the 1H-NMR spectrum of the compound. Titration of 4EGI-1 causes significant line broadening of resonances in the spectrum of the compound, which indicates binding to eIF4E (Figures 2A and S3). On the other hand, a similar titration with the inactive analog compound 4EGI-N shows little effect, which provides evidence that the binding of 4EGI-1 is not due to nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the protein (Figure 2C). Examination of the 1H-NMR spectrum of 4EGI-1 in aqueous solution shows that it can interconvert between the two isomers and that one of the isomers is preferentially bound by eIF4E. This does not allow a straightforward determination of a KD (see above). Replacement of one nitrogen with a carbon (4EGI-N) eliminates this isomerization but also renders the compound inactive. We next wished to determine by chemical shift mapping the location of 4EGI-1 interaction. Although chemical shift assignments have been reported for a complex of murine eIF4E with an eIF4G peptide (Miura et al., 2003Miura T. Shiratori Y. Shimma N. Backbone resonance assignment of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in complex with 7-methylguanosine diphosphate (m7GDP) and a 17-amino acid peptide derived from human eIF4GII.J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we needed to determine assignments for the free protein. Since mammalian eIF4E behaves poorly in solution, it was necessary to develop a more soluble form of the protein. To accomplish this, an N-terminal fusion of eIF4E to the 56 residue GB1 domain of protein G was constructed. This fusion domain has been shown to act as a solubility enhancement tag (SET) for heterologous proteins (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. A solubility-enhancement tag (SET) for NMR studies of poorly behaving proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The GB1-eIF4E fusion has greatly enhanced solubility relative to that of native eIF4E. The presence of the GB1 domain does not affect the structure of eIF4E (Figure S1), and the fusion protein has the same binding affinity for the eIF4G peptide in the FP assay. Using this construct we obtained backbone chemical shift assignments for mammalian eIF4E. We proceeded to titrate GB1-eIF4E with 4EGI-1 and to measure the effect on the 15N-HSQC spectrum (Figure S2). While no effect on the GB1 resonances is observed, a set of the eIF4E peaks is attentuated due to line broadening. This indicates specific binding of the compound to eIF4E with intermediate exchange kinetics, which are typical of relatively tight ligand-protein interactions. Mapping the locations of the surface-exposed residues that are the most attenuated in intensity onto the structure of eIF4E (Figure 2B) shows that they cluster around the site of eIF4G peptide binding (Figure 2D). After extensive dialysis of fully titrated GB-eIF4E to remove any bound compound this line broadening disappears, which indicates that the binding of 4EGI-1 to eIF4E is reversible (data not shown). We proceeded to characterize this compound in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which is a well-established in vitro model system for studies of eukaryotic translation. To determine if 4EGI-1 can disrupt the eIF4F complex, the compound was incubated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the state of association of eIF4E with eIF4G and 4E-BP1 was determined by pull-down on m7GTP Sepharose resin (Figure 3A). This demonstrated that full-length eIF4G is displaced from eIF4E by 4EGI-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly this compound does not inhibit binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E and instead causes a significant apparent increase in the amount of this protein that is bound. The increase in the level of eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1 is approximately 2- to 4-fold, as estimated by western blotting with purified 4E-BP1 as a concentration standard (data not shown). We speculate that this effect is likely due to the existence on eIF4E of a larger 4E-BP1 footprint that partially overlaps with that of eIF4G. A number of previous studies have provided strong evidence that this is the case. NMR chemical shift mapping of yeast eIF4E titrated with 4E-BP1 shows that there is a binding surface that is larger than just the area of residues that interact with the consensus peptide (Matsuo et al., 1997Matsuo H. Li H. McGuire A.M. Fletcher C.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Wagner G. Structure of translation factor eIF4E bound to m7GDP and interaction with 4E-binding protein.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that full-length 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E with significantly higher affinity than the consensus peptide alone (Tomoo et al., 2006Tomoo K. Abiko F. Miyagawa H. Kitamura K. Ishida T. Effect of N-terminal region of eIF4E and Ser65-phosphorylation of 4E–BP1 on interaction between eIF4E and 4E–BP1 fragment peptide.J Biochem (Tokyo). 2006; 140: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To confirm that 4EGI-1 does not inhibit binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, we carried out a pull-down assay using purified eIF4E (without the GB1 tag) and 4E-BP1. Concentrations of 4EGI-1 that would be expected to bind a significant proportion of the available eIF4E do not cause any apparent decrease in 4E-BP1 binding (Figure 3B). Our data and the aforementioned studies support a model in which 4EGI-1 displaces eIF4G from eIF4E and clears the docking site for 4E-BP1, thus effectively increasing the amount of the protein bound to available eIF4E (Figure S4). We then examined the effect of eIF4F complex disruption on translation in reticulocyte lysate using a dicistronic mRNA construct that encodes two luciferases (Figure 3C). The Renilla luciferase is translated in a cap-dependent fashion, while translation of firefly luciferase is driven by the cricket paralysis virus IRES, which is independent of initation factors (Pestova and Hellen, 2003Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Translation elongation after assembly of ribosomes on the Cricket paralysis virus internal ribosomal entry site without initiation factors or initiator tRNA.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cap-dependent translation is inhibited by 4EGI-1 (Figure 3D), while initiation factor-independent translation is not inhibited and instead is enhanced (presumably due to increased availability of ribosomes as cap-dependent translation is shut down; Figure 3E). The inactive analog 4EGI-N has no significant effect on cap-dependent or IRES-driven translation, while the active analog 4EGI-1A has an effect similar to that of 4EGI-1 (Figure 3F). Next we examined the effect of 4EGI-1 on translation of the HCV and EMCV IRESs, both of which utilize translation-initiation factors. In rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 4EGI-1 can inhibit translation from the EMCV IRES at higher concentrations than needed to inhibit cap-dependent translation (Figure S5). One explanation for this could be that the efficiency of translation from the EMCV IRES is affected by the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G. Although this IRES does not directly require eIF4E, it does require eIF4G, and conformational changes in eIF4G caused by eIF4E binding may affect the efficiency of initiation from this IRES, at least in vitro. It is also possible that the compound has some “off-target” effects at the concentrations used in this study and inhibits the function of an additional factor or factors involved in EMCV IRES-driven translation. The HCV IRES is also inhibited by 4EGI-1 at a higher concentration than that needed to inhibit cap-dependent translation (Figure S5), which also could be due to “off–target” effects. In order to determine if 4EGI-1 can disrupt the eIF4F complex in cells as well as in extracts we examined the effect of this compound on Jurkat leukemia T cells. Similar to the effect in vitro, compound treatment causes eIF4G to be displaced from eIF4E, while binding of 4E-BP1 is increased (Figure 4A). The total cellular levels of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 do not change significantly under these conditions, and there does not appear to be proteolytic cleavage of these proteins (Figure 4B). A possible alternative explanation for this result is that 4EGI-1 disrupts the pathways controlling phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. To test this possibility, we examined the cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 relative to total 4E-BP1 and found that they are not affected by the compound treatment (Figure 4B). This leads us to conclude that the displacement of eIF4G is due to binding of 4EGI-1 to eIF4E. Both in vitro and in cells, the estimated IC50 for displacement of eIF4G from eIF4E is similar to that for inhibition of cap-dependent translation (Table S1). The in vitro IC50 values for displacement of full-length eIF4G and for inhibition of cap-dependent translation are lower than that in the FP assay. This is presumably due to the lower level of eIF4E. We proceeded to examine the effect of 4EGI-1 on protein expression, hypothesizing that this compound would downregulate proteins encoded by weak mRNAs while having little effect on those encoded by strong mRNAs. In extracts of Jurkat cells treated with 4EGI-1, examination of protein levels by western blotting showed that the level of β-actin (which has a short, unstructured 5′ UTR) is unaffected, while expression of c-myc and Bcl-xL (both of which have long, highly structured 5′ UTRs) is signficantly decreased (Figure 4C). β-actin is a classic housekeeping protein and is encoded by a strong mRNA, while c-Myc and Bcl-xL are both oncogenic proteins encoded by weak mRNAs. To rule out the possibility of downregulated transcription or nucleocytosolic transport, cytosolic mRNA was prepared from treated cells, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the effect of compound treatment on the levels of c-myc and Bcl-xL mRNAs. No significant change in mRNA level with increasing compound concentration was observed (Figure 4D). Since regulation of cap-dependent translation plays an important role in cell survival, we wished to examine whether 4EGI-1 can induce apoptosis. Incubation of Jurkat cells with the compound induces cell death after 24 hr, as determined by measurement of the intracellular ATP level using a luminescent assay (Figure 5A). To find out if this cytotoxic activity is due to induction of apoptosis, we determined the ability of 4EGI-1 treatment to cause DNA fragmentation. Compound treatment causes a significant increase in subG1 DNA content in treated cells (Figure 5B); this is suppressed by cotreatment with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK. In addition, the nuclei of treated cells have a fragmented morphology that is characteristic of apoptosis (Figure 5C). The demonstration that 4EGI-1 has proapoptotic activity in Jurkat cells suggested that this compound may exhibit activity against other cancer cell lines. The effect of this compound was tested using the NCI-SRB assay on A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 5D). This demonstrated that 4EGI-1 potently inhibits cell growth with an IC50 of approximately 6 μM. Because translation of weak mRNAs is highly sensitive to the level of eIF4F in the cell, it is likely that even small decreases in the level of this complex can cause a disproportionate biological effect in cells. This would explain why the observed IC50 values for apoptosis of Jurkat cells and the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation are lower than both the estimated affinity of 4EGI-1 for eIF4E and the IC50 for displacement of eIF4G from eIF4E (Table S1). One prediction that we made was that 4EGI-1 will have a stronger effect on transformed cells than on nontransformed cells due to the greater sensitivity of the former to inhibition of cap-dependent translation. To determine if this compound has a preferential effect on isogenic-transformed versus -nontransformed cells, we tested its effect on the growth of the Ph+ cell line, which is transformed by the bcr-abl oncogene. For comparison purposes we used Ph− cells, which are from an isogenic cell line that is not transformed. Testing the effect of the compound on cell growth showed that 4EGI-1, with an IC50 for Ph+ cells more than 2-fold lower than for Ph− cells (Figure 5E), has a significantly more potent effect on transformed cells. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to inhibit the protein-protein interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G using small molecules, and establish a methodology that can readily be used to identify new classes of such inhibitors through the screening of compound libraries. Major goals for future studies include a more detailed characterization of the mechanism of 4EGI class compounds in mammalian cells and a determination of how specific these compounds are for inhibition of eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and for cap-dependent translation. This will be facilitated by synthesis of a larger set of analogs of 4EGI-1 for use in structure-activity studies. In addition, experimental modulation of eIF4E, eIF4G, and/or 4E-BP levels in cells treated with these compounds will aid in evaluating their specificity."

Our genetic evidence confirms that p100 is required and sufficient as a fourth IkappaB protein for noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling downstream of NIK and IKK1. We develop a mathematical model of the four-IkappaB-containing NF-kappaB signaling module to account for NF-kappaB/RelA:p50 activation in response to inflammatory and developmental stimuli and find signaling crosstalk between them that determines gene-expression programs. Further combined computational and experimental studies reveal that mutant cells with altered balances between canonical and noncanonical IkappaB proteins may exhibit inappropriate inflammatory gene expression in response to developmental signals. Our results have important implications for physiological and pathological scenarios in which inflammatory and developmental signals converge."

We recently demonstrated a novel Lyn- and Bcr-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 that contributes to p27 proteolysis (Grimmler et al., 2007Grimmler M. Wang Y. Mund T. Cilensek Z. Keidel E.-M. Waddell M.B. Jäkel H. Kullmann M. Kriwacki R.W. Hengst L.

Up to 60% of human breast cancers express the ER, and in these, estrogen is mitogenic. Estrogen-stimulated breast cancer proliferation requires a rapid loss of p27 through proteolysis (Cariou et al., 2000Cariou S. Donovan J.C. Flanagan W.M. Milic A. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Down-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 or p27Kip1 abrogates antiestrogen-mediated cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9042-9046Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Given the oncogenic role of Src in breast cancer and its rapid activation by RTKs and estrogen:ER, we investigated whether Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 may contribute to p27 proteolysis in breast cancer cell proliferation. Here we present evidence that cSrc phosphorylates p27 on tyrosine 74 (Y74) and tyrosine 88 (Y88). p27 phosphorylation by Src reduced the cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibitory action of p27 in vitro. Src induction increased pT187p27 and reduced the t1/2 of p27. cSrc activation was correlated with low nuclear p27 in primary human breast cancers. Mitogen stimulation of quiescent cells rapidly activated cSrc, and p27 binding to cSrc preceded loss of cyclin E-Cdk2 from p27 in late G1. These data support a model in which cSrc-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 reduces its inhibitory action on cyclin E-Cdk2, facilitating subsequent p27 proteolysis. Estrogen stimulates quiescent ER-positive breast cancer cells to rapidly degrade p27 and enter cell cycle (Cariou et al., 2000Cariou S. Donovan J.C. Flanagan W.M. Milic A. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Down-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 or p27Kip1 abrogates antiestrogen-mediated cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9042-9046Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Estrogen-bound ER stimulates rapid, transient cSrc activation (Migliaccio et al., 1996Migliaccio A. DiDomenico M. Castona C. DeFalco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2076-2081Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To investigate if cSrc contributes to estrogen-mediated p27 proteolysis, we assayed if Src could phosphorylate p27. Purified recombinant activated Src phosphorylated recombinant His-p27, and this was inhibited by the Src inhibitor, PP1 (Figure 1A). Recombinant WT Src could also phosphorylate p27 (data not shown). To assay the relative contributions of three tyrosines, Y74, Y88, and Y89, to Src phosphorylation of p27, single, double, and triple p27 mutations were generated converting tyrosines to phenylalanine. Mutant p27 and p27WT were compared as substrates in Src kinase assays. Src autophosphorylation indicates equal Src input (Figure 1B). Radioactivity in p27 was quantitated by phosphoimager (Figure 1C). Src-mediated p27 phosphorylation was reduced by 36% and 33% in p27Y74F and p27Y88F, respectively, compared to p27WT, while that of p27Y89F was only reduced by 12% (Figure 1C). Loss of Y74 and Y88 (p27Y74FY88F) reduced p27 phosphorylation by Src by 78%. Thus, these two sites appear to be preferentially phosphorylated by Src in vitro (Figure 1C). Loss of potential to phosphorylate Y89 also reduced phosphorylation of Y74FY89F and Y88FY89F. Not all Src family kinases are expressed in mammary cells. Quantitative real-time PCR of Src, Yes, Fyn, and Lyn in three breast cancer lines, MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-361, showed that Yes expression was higher or comparable to that of cSrc. Fyn and Lyn mRNA were detectable but several logs lower in magnitude (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). As for Src, Yes kinase assays showed that phosphorylation of p27 by Yes was reduced by mutational loss of Y74 and Y88 phosphorylation, while Y89F only modestly attenuated phosphorylation by Yes (Figures 1D and 1E). The crystal structure of p27-cyclin A-Cdk2 shows that Y74, Y88, and Y89 of p27 interact with Cdk2 and not with N-terminal truncated cyclin A. Y88 is buried in the catalytic cleft of Cdk2, but Y74 and, to a lesser extent, Y89 also form contacts with Cdk2 (Russo et al., 1996Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex.Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Since Y88 impedes ATP binding to Cdk2, structural data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 would impair its inhibition of cyclin-bound Cdk2. To test this, increasing amounts of mock or Src-phosphorylated His-p27 were incubated with recombinant cyclin E-Cdk2, and Cdk2 activity was assayed. Src was inactivated by boiling the Src-p27 reactions, and mock-treated His-p27 was also boiled prior to addition to cyclin E-Cdk2 reactions. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p27 (pY-p27) inhibited cyclin E-Cdk2 less efficiently than mock-phosphorylated p27 (Figure 2A). To assay whether the impaired inhibitory function of pY-p27 correlated with decreased association with cyclin E-Cdk2, p27 was reacted in vitro with either active recombinant Src or Src that had been heat inactivated prior to reaction with p27 (dead Src) or was subjected to a mock Src reaction. Only active Src treated p27 reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (αpY-4G10, Figure 2B). Because the in vitro Src kinase reaction was not complete, pY-p27 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with αpY-4G10. Equal amounts of mock or Src-treated p27 were incubated with recombinant cyclin E and Cdk2. Mock-treated and dead-Src-treated p27 immunoprecipitates bound equal amounts of cyclin E and Cdk2, while pY-p27 precipitates bound less cyclin E and Cdk2 (Figure 2C). Less Src-phosphorylated pY-p27 was detected in Cdk2 and cyclin E immunoprecipitates compared to mock or untreated p27 (Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, the reduced cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibitory function of Src-phosphorylated p27 versus unphosphorylated p27 may result in part from its reduced steady-state binding to this cyclin-Cdk2 target. We and others recently identified tyrosine-phosphorylated p27 in leukemic cells (Kardinal et al., 2006Kardinal C. Dangers M. Kardinal A. Koch A. Brandt D.T. Tamura T. Welte K.

Bcr-Abl and Lyn kinases phosphorylated p27 predominantly at Y88 in vitro, and in K562 cells, Y88 was the major tyrosine phosphorylated site in p27 (Grimmler et al., 2007Grimmler M. Wang Y. Mund T.

Because in vitro kinase assays showed that p27Y74F had reduced phosphorylation by Src, polyclonal antibody specific to Y74-phosphorylated p27 (p27pY74) was generated. αp27pY74 antibody recognized Src-phosphorylated His-p27WT but not His-p27Y74F (Figure 3A, left), while αpY-4G10 reacted with both p27WT and p27Y74F after Src kinase reactions in vitro (Figure 3A, left). To detect intracellular Y74 phosphorylation of p27, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with constitutively active Src or empty vector and YFPp27. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p27 was detectable with αpY-4G10 in p27 immunoprecipitates from Src-transfected but not from mock-transfected cells (Figure 3A, middle). Similarly, p27pY74 was detected with αp27pY74 antibody only after cSrc transfection (Figure 3A, right). Endogenous cellular p27pY74 was also detected with this antibody in the absence of exogenous Src (see Figure 5E). To test the preference of Src for the different p27 tyrosines in cells, activated Src and YFPp27WT, p27Y74F, p27Y88F, or p27Y89F were transfected into MCF-7. All p27 vectors were equally and stably overexpressed (Figure 3B). p27 precipitates were immunoblotted and reacted with αpY-4G10, αp27pY74, or antibody to total p27. Reactivity of p27WT with αpY-4G10 and with αp27pY74 following Src cotransfection was attenuated by the Src inhibitor, PP1 (Figure 3B). Transfected p27Y74F and p27Y88F immunoprecipitates were less reactive than YFPp27WT with αpY-4G10, while αpY-4G10 reactivity of p27Y89F was not detectably reduced (Figure 3B). Y74 phosphorylation was detected in p27Y88F, p27Y89F, and p27WT, but reactivity of αp27pY74 with p27Y74F showed no increase above nonspecific baseline (Figure 3B). Thus, Y74 and Y88 appear to be the dominant cSrc phosphorylation sites in vivo. Loss of Y89 phosphorylation may attenuate Y74 phosphorylation in vivo and lead to a compensatory increase in Y88 phosphorylation. The effect of Src overexpression on p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes was tested. Src transfection with or without PP1 treatment did not affect levels of cellular cyclin E and Cdk2 or overexpressed YFPp27 (Figure 3C). YFPp27WT immunoprecipitates contained less bound cyclin E and Cdk2 following Src transfection, and this was abrogated by PP1 (Figure 3D). Similarly, Src transfection modestly reduced p27 in Cdk2 precipitates, while Cdk2-bound cyclin E was unaffected (Figure 3E). Since experiments above involved overexpressed p27, which could overwhelm cellular p27 proteolysis, effects of Src on cellular p27 were assayed. cSrc siRNA or Src inhibition for 48 hr each increased cellular p27 (Figures 4A and 4B). Src is activated in MDA-MB-361 line due to Her2/ErbB2 activation (Belsches-Jablonski et al., 2001Belsches-Jablonski A.P. Biscardi J.S. Peavy D.R. Tice D.A. Romney D.A. Parsons S.J. Src family kinases and HER2 interactions in human breast cancer cell growth and survival.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). p27 half-life was assayed by cycloheximide chase in asynchronous MDA-MB-361 and in cells treated with the Src family kinase inhibitor, AZD0530, for 6 hr. Src inhibition increased the p27 t1/2 from 4.0 to 9.7 hr (Figure 4C). To test further the effect of Src on p27 stability, inducible Src-expressing lines were generated. Cells were serum and estrogen deprived, and Src was induced or not with ponasterone A (PA) prior to readdition of estrogen. Estrogen stimulation alone, in the absence of added growth factors, had little effect on p27 levels over 6 hr; however, Src induction together with estrogen led to more rapid loss of p27 in two different Src-inducible MCF-7 clones (shown for MCF-pINDSrc2, Figure 4D). Src induction reduced the p27 t1/2 at 6 hr after estrogen addition to 5.8 hr compared to the p27 t1/2 of 9.8 hr in controls treated with estrogen alone (Figure 4E). T187 phosphorylation of p27 was more readily detected when starved cells were treated with estrogen plus Src compared to estrogen alone (Figure 4F). These findings support a model in which Src promotes p27 degradation by decreasing the inhibitory action of p27 on cyclin E-Cdk2, facilitating cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 phosphorylation and SCFSKP2-mediated p27 proteolysis. p27-bound cSrc was detected in three breast cancer lines, MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-361. Cells with higher cSrc activity had reduced p27 levels but higher p27-bound cSrc (Figure 5A). In contrast to normal mammary epithelial cells in which p27 shows nuclear localization (Catzavelos et al., 1997Catzavelos C. Bhattacharya N. Ung Y.C. Wilson J.A. Roncari L. Sandhu C. Shaw P. Yeger H. Morava-Protzner I. Kapusta L. et al.Decreased levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 protein: prognostic implications in primary breast cancer.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), T-47D and MDA-MB-361 have both nuclear and some cytoplasmic p27. p27-Src complexes were detected in nuclear fractions. Nuclear cSrc-p27 complexes were only minimally detectable in cells deprived of estrogen and growth factors in 0.1% cFBS for 48 hr (E−) but were readily detected in asynchronous cells in complete medium (E+) (data shown for T-47D, Figure 5B). To confirm the nuclear localization of p27-Src complexes, p27S10A or p27WT was transfected into MCF-7 with or without transfection of Src. p27S10A is localized to the nucleus due to reduced nuclear export (Connor et al., 2003Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. CRM1/Ran-mediated nuclear export of p27(Kip1) involves a nuclear export signal and links p27 export and proteolysis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). p27-bound Src was equally detected in p27S10A and p27WT complexes (Figure S2). Quiescent estradiol-depleted MCF-7 cells enter S phase within 12 hr of estrogen and insulin addition (Figure 5C) (Cariou et al., 2000Cariou S. Donovan J.C. Flanagan W.M. Milic A. Bhattacharya N.

Rapid Src activation correlated with increased Src-p27 coprecipitation and preceded the reduction of total p27 and"
https://openalex.org/W2032178667,"Helium-3 is a fermion, a particle, like protons, electrons and neutrons, obeying statistical rules requiring that not more than one in a set of identical particles may occupy a particular quantum state. Fermions avoid one another (a phenomenon called anti-bunching). Helium-4, though, is a boson. Bosons, like photons, pions and alpha particles, stick together and obey statistical rules that allow any number of identical particles to occupy a quantum state. Evidence for both types of quantum statistical behaviour has been observed separately, but until now no single experiment has compared the two directly. By exploiting the physical similarities of the two heliums, a team from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Laboratoire Charles Fabry in Paris has succeeded in demonstrating bunching and anti-bunching behaviour of atoms in a single experiment. This is a spectacular demonstration of the role of quantum statistical effects, and could also lead to some exotic new areas of physics with cold atoms. A stream of bosons tends to bunch together, whereas fermions avoid each other. Although evidence for each type of behaviour has been observed in various settings, no single experiment has been able to directly compare the two types of quantum statistics until now, where this paper reveals the contrasting behaviour of 3He (a fermion) and 4He (a boson) in the same apparatus. Fifty years ago, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) discovered photon bunching in light emitted by a chaotic source1, highlighting the importance of two-photon correlations2 and stimulating the development of modern quantum optics3. The quantum interpretation of bunching relies on the constructive interference between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterization of the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms4,5,6. By contrast, fermions should reveal an antibunching effect (a tendency to avoid each other). Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle interference, and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an experimental comparison of the fermionic and bosonic HBT effects in the same apparatus, using two different isotopes of helium: 3He (a fermion) and 4He (a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are negligible; therefore, the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviour that we observe can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species. Our results show how atom–atom correlation measurements can be used to reveal details in the spatial density7,8 or momentum correlations9 in an atomic ensemble. They also enable the direct observation of phase effects linked to the quantum statistics of a many-body system, which may facilitate the study of more exotic situations10."
https://openalex.org/W2091932807,"Spin electronics (spintronics) exploits the magnetic nature of electrons, and this principle is commercially applied in, for example, the spin valves of disk-drive read heads. There is currently widespread interest in developing new types of spintronic devices based on industrially relevant semiconductors, in which a spin-polarized current flows through a lateral channel between a spin-polarized source and drain. However, the transformation of spin information into large electrical signals is limited by spin relaxation, so that the magnetoresistive signals are below 1% (ref. 2). Here we report large magnetoresistance effects (61% at 5 K), which correspond to large output signals (65 mV), in devices where the non-magnetic channel is a multiwall carbon nanotube that spans a 1.5 microm gap between epitaxial electrodes of the highly spin polarized manganite La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3. This spintronic system combines a number of favourable properties that enable this performance; the long spin lifetime in nanotubes due to the small spin-orbit coupling of carbon; the high Fermi velocity in nanotubes that limits the carrier dwell time; the high spin polarization in the manganite electrodes, which remains high right up to the manganite-nanotube interface; and the resistance of the interfacial barrier for spin injection. We support these conclusions regarding the interface using density functional theory calculations. The success of our experiments with such chemically and geometrically different materials should inspire new avenues in materials selection for future spintronics applications."
https://openalex.org/W2008789097,"p27Kip1 controls cell proliferation by binding to and regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we show that Cdk inhibition and p27 stability are regulated through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. A conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of p27 can be phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn and the oncogene product BCR-ABL. Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent p27 binding to cyclin A/Cdk2. Instead, it causes phosphorylated Y88 and the entire inhibitory 3(10)-helix of p27 to be ejected from the Cdk2 active site, thus restoring partial Cdk activity. Importantly, this allows Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently phosphorylated on threonine 187 by Cdk2 which in turn promotes its SCF-Skp2-dependent degradation. This direct link between transforming tyrosine kinases and p27 may provide an explanation for Cdk kinase activities observed in p27 complexes and for premature p27 elimination in cells that have been transformed by activated tyrosine kinases."

Han J. The p38 signal transduction pathway: activation and function.Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK, or MK5) is one member of the p38 downstream Ser/Thr protein kinase family (New et al., 1998New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J.

However, PRAK−/− mice display normal LPS-induced cytokine production and endotoxic shock (Shi et al., 2003Shi Y. Kotlyarov A. Laabeta K. Gruber A.D. Butt E. Marcus K. Meyer H.E. Friedrich A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7732-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that PRAK may not be essential for inflammation and stress responses. The physiological role and downstream target of PRAK thus remain undefined. Senescence is a stable proliferative arrest associated with the exhaustion of replicative potential as a result of telomere erosion during cell divisions (Shay and Wright, 2005Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Senescence and immortalization: role of telomeres and telomerase.Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Telomere length-independent senescence can be induced prematurely by activated oncogenes such as ras (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). As a result, cellular transformation by ras requires cooperation from “immortalizing” oncogenes that overcome the senescence response (Land et al., 1983Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Tumorigenic conversion of primary embryo fibroblasts requires at least two cooperating oncogenes.Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). These observations imply that, like apoptosis, premature senescence induced by ras or other oncogenes serves as an antitumorigenic defense mechanism. Several recent studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence indeed occurs and provides an initial barrier to tumorigenesis in vivo (Collado et al., 2005Collado M. Gil J. Efeyan A. Guerra C.

Despite recent demonstrations of the in vivo significance of oncogene-induced senescence, little is known about the molecular machineries mediating the senescence response. Studies have indicated that the ability of ras to induce senescence depends on the Raf-MEK-ERK MAPK pathway (Lin et al., 1998Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. Van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W.

Transcriptional activation of p19ARF by DMP1 (Sreeramaneni et al., 2005Sreeramaneni R. Chaudhry A. McMahon M. Sherr C.J. Inoue K. Ras-Raf-Arf signaling critically depends on the Dmp1 transcription factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) also contributes to ras-induced senescence. Recently, we and others have shown that ras-induced senescence requires activation of p38 (Wang et al., 2002Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Sequential activation of the MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and MKK3/6-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediates oncogenic ras-induced premature senescence.Mol. Cell.

Constitutive p38HOG mitogen-activated protein kinase activation induces permanent cell cycle arrest and senescence.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5076-5082PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how activated p38 transduces the senescence signals. More importantly, the role of the p38 pathway in senescence and tumor suppression in vivo remains elusive. In this study, we uncover a novel function of PRAK in tumor suppression and ras-induced senescence. PRAK deficiency leads to increased skin carcinogenesis in mice and renders primary cells more susceptible to oncogenic transformation. The tumor-suppressing effect of PRAK is likely due to its ability to mediate ras-induced senescence, by modulating p53 activity through direct phosphorylation. Our studies define a signaling cascade that plays an essential role in ras-induced senescence and tumor suppression. We generated a line of PRAK knockout mice (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), which were viable and fertile and showed no apparent health problems. Although PRAK is activated by p38 in response to stresses (New et al., 1998New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. PRAK, a novel protein kinase regulated by the p38 MAP kinase.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the PRAK−/− mice responded normally to endotoxin shock and showed unaltered cytokine production in response to LPS (unpublished data), suggesting that PRAK may not be essential for inflammatory responses. In search of phenotypes of PRAK−/− mice, we assessed the susceptibility of PRAK+/+, PRAK+/−, and PRAK−/− mice to skin carcinogenesis induced by a well-characterized mutagen, dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA). DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis is divided into three stages: initiation (induction of stable oncogenic mutations, such as ras activation, by DMBA), promotion (proliferation of genetically altered cells), and progression (conversion of papillomas to invasive carcinomas) (DiGiovanni, 1992DiGiovanni J. Multistage carcinogenesis in mouse skin.Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 63-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In the presence of a tumor promoter such as TPA (two-stage protocol), DMBA induces efficient skin tumor formation, while without TPA (one-stage protocol), DMBA-induced tumor formation is poor in most strains. The PRAK-deficient mice were initially analyzed using the one-stage protocol, which has been successfully used to demonstrate the tumor-suppressing function of several senescence-related genes such as the INK4a locus (Serrano et al., 1996Serrano M. Lee H. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A. Role of the INK4a locus in tumor suppression and cell mortality.Cell. 1996; 85: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), p19ARF (Kamijo et al., 1999Kamijo T. Bodner S. van de Kamp E. Randle D.H. Sherr C.J. Tumor spectrum in ARF-deficient mice.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2217-2222PubMed Google Scholar), and DMP1 (Inoue et al., 2001Inoue K. Zindy F. Randle D.H. Rehg J.E. Sherr C.J. Dmp1 is haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression and modifies the frequencies of Arf and p53 mutations in Myc-induced lymphomas.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2934-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Newborn PRAK+/+, PRAK+/−, and PRAK−/− littermates from heterozygous crosses were treated with a single dose of DMBA and monitored for a year (Figure 1A). DMBA alone induced tumor formation poorly in wild-type mice. Only 1 of 12 DMBA-treated PRAK+/+ mice developed a skin papilloma. In contrast, 8 of 13 (62%) DMBA-treated PRAK−/− mice displayed health problems, out of which 7 developed skin papillomas and 1 died of unidentified causes (Figure 1A). DMBA also induced papillomas in 12 of 30 (40%) PRAK+/− mice within the same period. In the untreated control groups, all 9 PRAK+/+, 25 PRAK+/−, and 10 PRAK−/− animals remained healthy and tumor-free for at least 2 years (data not shown). Therefore, PRAK deficiency greatly enhances DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis and allows efficient tumor induction in the absence of any tumor promoter, suggesting that PRAK loss can functionally replace a tumor promoter. Supporting this notion, PRAK deficiency had no effect on the incidence or latency of skin tumors induced by the two-stage protocol (Figure S2A). In the presence of the tumor promoter TPA, DMBA induced skin papillomas in 6 of 7 wild-type mice and 14 of 16 PRAK-deficient (PRAK+/− and PRAK−/−) mice, with an average latency of 70–100 days. Taken together, our results suggest that PRAK may act in a pathway that suppresses the tumor promotion stage during DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis. The tumor-suppressing activity of PRAK is likely to be specific for ras because PRAK deficiency also enhanced lymphomagenesis in Eμ-N-rasG12D transgenic mice (Figure 1B). Tumor-free survival was significantly reduced in Eμ-N-ras/PRAK+/− mice from Eμ-N-ras/PRAK+/+ × PRAK+/− crosses as compared to their Eμ-N-ras/PRAK+/+ littermates. A similar trend of enhanced lymphoma formation was also observed in a limited number of Eμ-N-ras/PRAK−/− mice from Eμ-N-ras/PRAK+/− × Eμ-N-ras/PRAK+/− crosses. Since both PRAK+/− and PRAK−/− mice were highly susceptible to skin carcinogenesis induced by DMBA alone (Figure 1A), we investigated whether the wild-type PRAK allele was lost in PRAK+/− papillomas. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PRAK+/− tumors and their surrounding normal skin tissues had comparable levels of PRAK (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that PRAK expression is retained in PRAK+/− tumors. Thus, PRAK is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Over 90% of DMBA-induced skin tumors contain activated Ha-ras (Quintanilla et al., 1986Quintanilla M. Brown K. Ramsden M. Balmain A. Carcinogen-specific mutation and amplification of Ha-ras during mouse skin carcinogenesis.Nature. 1986; 322: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Thus, our observation that PRAK deficiency promotes DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis raises the possibility that PRAK is essential for an in vivo tumor-suppressing mechanism against activated ras. Since oncogene-induced senescence is a barrier to tumorigenesis in vivo and p38 plays a major role in ras-induced senescence (Wang et al., 2002Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Sequential activation of the MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and MKK3/6-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediates oncogenic ras-induced premature senescence.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we investigated whether enhanced skin carcinogenesis resulted from a defect in senescence induction in PRAK-deficient mice. The skin tumors induced by DMBA or DMBA+TPA in all the animals were superficial papillomas consisting of an inner connective tissue vascular core, a stratified squamous epithelium with basal cells, and an outer surface of keratin (Figure 1E and Figure S2B; H/E). Only one of the DMBA-induced PRAK+/− papillomas progressed to a malignant carcinoma, 5 months after initial detection. While the tumors induced by DMBA in PRAK−/− and PRAK+/− mice grew slowly but progressively and usually reached a size of more than 10 mm in diameter within 2–3 months of initial detection, the DMBA-induced tumor from the wild-type mouse seemed to be dormant and remained at about 2–3 mm in diameter after 2 months (data not shown). Compared to the wild-type tumors, DMBA-induced PRAK-deficient papillomas also had more complicated structures, with much thicker and more folded layers of squamous epithelium (Figure 1E). We analyzed senescence and proliferative markers in tumors removed from animals treated with DMBA alone. The PRAK+/+ papilloma contained large areas of cells positive for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) marker in squamous epithelium, whereas SA-β-gal was undetectable in PRAK+/− and PRAK−/− tumors (Figure 1E and Figures S3A and S3B). The absence of SA-β-gal in PRAK-deficient tumors was not a result of a general defect in this enzyme due to PRAK deletion, as it was readily detectable in normal skin from adult mice of all three genotypes, including skin adjacent to the PRAK-deficient papillomas (Figure S3C). Other senescence markers, including those identified in a recent study (Collado et al., 2005Collado M. Gil J. Efeyan A. Guerra C. Schuhmacher A.J. Barradas M. Benguria A. Zaballos A. Flores J.M. Barbacid M. et al.Tumour biology: senescence in premalignant tumours.Nature. 2005; 436: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), were further examined. In western blot analysis, expression of p16INK4A, DcR2, and Dec1 was increased in the PRAK+/+ papilloma in comparison to in adjacent normal skin, while these increases were abolished in PRAK+/− (Figure S4) and PRAK−/− (data not shown) tumors. The absence of induction of the senescence markers was confirmed in both PRAK+/− and PRAK−/− tumors by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1E). The majority of the cells in the squamous epithelium of the PRAK+/+ tumor, including undifferentiated and differentiated basal cells, were negative for the proliferation marker Ki-67 but positive for p16INK4A and DcR2, indicating that these cells were growth arrested and senescent. In contrast, most cells in the basal layers of PRAK+/− and PRAK−/− papillomas were positive for Ki-67 but negative for DcR2 and p16INK4A, and only the denucleated, highly differentiated cells immediately adjacent to keratin contained high DcR2 and p16 levels. Therefore, senescence induction is compromised in PRAK-deficient tumors. Taken together, our results suggest that DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis is initially restricted by senescence in wild-type mice, which prevents papilloma formation and/or keeps the tumors in dormancy upon their formation. PRAK deletion compromises senescence induction, leading to increased incidence and more efficient formation of DMBA-induced tumors. The senescence markers were also analyzed in the DMBA+TPA-induced tumors. While the DMBA+TPA-induced PRAK-deficient tumors had no detectable SA-β-gal and were essentially negative for DcR2 and p16INK4A in the underdifferentiated layers of the squamous epithelium, the wild-type tumors contained patches of cells weakly positive for DcR2 and p16INK4A and a few small SA-β-gal-positive areas (Figure S2B). However, both wild-type and PRAK-deficient tumors contained substantial amounts of Ki-67-positive cells in the squamous epithelium (Figure S2B) and seemed to grow slowly but steadily. Thus, at least a substantial portion of the wild-type tumor is proliferative and might have bypassed senescence in the presence of the tumor promoter TPA. It is unclear how TPA allows proliferation of cells containing activated ras in wild-type tumors and whether TPA truly disrupts senescence in these cells. TPA did not prevent ras-induced senescence in primary fibroblasts (data not shown). Nevertheless, the reduced levels of the senescence markers in the DMBA+TPA-induced wild-type tumors as compared to the DMBA-induced wild-type tumors (Figure 1E and Figure S2B) are consistent with a role of PRAK-mediated senescence in suppressing the tumor promotion stage during skin carcinogenesis. To further establish the essential role of PRAK in ras-induced senescence responses, we examined the role of PRAK in ras-induced senescence in primary cells. PRAK+/+ primary mouse skin fibroblasts (MSFs) became growth arrested (Figure 2A) and accumulated SA-β-gal (Figure 2C) upon transduction of an activated ras allele, Ha-RasV12 (Figure 2B), indicating that ras triggered premature senescence. By contrast, Ha-RasV12-induced proliferative arrest or the SA-β-gal marker was abolished in PRAK−/− cells and partially blocked in PRAK+/− cells (Figures 2A and 2C). Therefore, the deletion of PRAK compromised the senescence response in primary MSFs. Similarly, PRAK deletion abolished ras-induced senescence in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 2D and Figure S5A). Supporting the disruption of ras-induced senescence in PRAK-deficient cells, the induction of the senescence markers DcR2, Dec1, p16INK4A, and p19ARF by ras was either modestly or greatly reduced in PRAK+/− and PRAK−/− MEFs when compared to wild-type cells (Figure S5C). The disruption of ras-induced senescence was a specific result of the loss of PRAK because wild-type PRAK, but not its kinase-dead mutant (KM) (Lys51 to Met), restored the senescence response when reintroduced into the PRAK−/− MEFs (Figure 2D). These findings demonstrate that PRAK is essential for the ras-induced senescence response in primary mouse fibroblasts. The requirement of PRAK in ras-induced senescence was further investigated in primary human fibroblasts. Two PRAK shRNAs, shPK-1 and -2, reduced PRAK expression (Figure 3A) and ras-induced PRAK kinase activity when stably transduced into BJ human fibroblasts (Figure 3B). These two PRAK shRNAs prevented Ha-RasV12-induced proliferative arrest (Figure 3C) and accumulation of SA-β-gal (Figure 3D and Figure S5A). The same results were obtained in BJ cells at a much earlier passage (PD15, passage 6) or when a scrambled shPK-1 sequence was used as control (Figure S6). Thus, PRAK is essential for ras to induce premature senescence in primary human fibroblasts. The induction of a recently identified senescence marker, p15INK4B, by ras was also abolished in BJ cells with PRAK knockdown (Figure S5D). To rule out a possible off-target effect of PRAK shRNAs on senescence, murine PRAK (mPRAK) that could not be silenced by shPK-1 and shPK-2 (Figure 3E) was transduced into BJ cells to rescue PRAK expression. mPRAK restored ras-induced senescence in BJ cells expressing PRAK shRNA, but not in cells with p53 knockdown (Figures 3C and 3D). These results indicate that the bypass of ras-induced senescence in BJ cells is due to specific silencing of PRAK. In contrast to p53 shRNA, PRAK shRNA did not prevent G1 arrest induced by γ-irradiation or UV light (Figure S7A), suggesting that PRAK is selectively required for ras-induced senescence, but not for DNA-damage-induced responses. We further tested whether disrupting the senescence response by PRAK deficiency would permit transformation by ras alone in the absence of immortalizing oncogenes. Similar to p53−/− primary MSFs, primary PRAK−/− MSFs and MEFs were not tumorigenic by themselves but were readily transformed into tumorigenic cells by Ha-RasV12 alone, which formed robust colonies without anchorage and produced subcutaneous tumors with high frequency when injected into nude mice (Figure 4A). PRAK+/− cells were also transformed, although less efficiently, by Ha-RasV12 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that eliminating PRAK renders primary murine fibroblasts susceptible to oncogenic transformation by ras. BJ primary human fibroblasts can be fully transformed by a combination of E1A, MDM2, and Ha-RasV12 (Seger et al., 2002Seger Y.R. Garcia-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Transformation of normal human cells in the absence of telomerase activation.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B). We tested whether PRAK knockdown could replace any of the oncogenes in this cellular transformation model. PRAK shRNA alone or in combination with Ha-RasV12 or Ha-RasV12 and MDM2 did not cause transformation. Interestingly, BJ cells transduced with E1A, PRAK shRNA, and Ha-RasV12 formed soft-agar colonies and generated subcutaneous tumors as efficiently as the BJ/E1A/MDM2/Ha-RasV12 cells (Figures 4B and 4C). As noticed by others (Seger et al., 2002Seger Y.R. Garcia-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Transformation of normal human cells in the absence of telomerase activation.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), BJ cells expressing E1A and Ha-RasV12 formed a modest amount of small colonies on soft agar, but they were not fully transformed because they did not develop tumors in nude mice (Figures 4B and 4C). Therefore, PRAK knockdown functionally replaced MDM2 and cooperated with E1A and Ha-RasV12 to transform normal human fibroblasts. We determined whether the PRAK kinase activity was induced in senescent cells using HSP27 as a substrate. PRAK protein was immunoprecipitated from either wild-type BJ cells or BJ cells undergoing premature senescence induced by either Ha-RasV12 or constitutively active MKK3 or MKK6. PRAK from senescent cells displayed an increased kinase activity in comparison to that from wild-type BJ cells (Figure 5A). ras-induced PRAK activation was also detected in primary MEFs (Figure 5B). ras- and MKK3/6E-induced PRAK kinase activity was greatly reduced in both BJ and MEF cells by a specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (Figures 5A and 5B). This, combined with our previous finding that p38 is activated during senescence (Wang et al., 2002Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Sequential activation of the MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and MKK3/6-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediates oncogenic ras-induced premature senescence.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), indicates that PRAK is activated by p38 during ras-induced senescence. Furthermore, PRAK and p38 immunoprecipitated from the DMBA-induced papilloma in the wild-type mouse also showed increased kinase activity toward their substrates, HSP27 and ATF2 respectively, in comparison to the proteins isolated from normal skin in the same mouse (Figure 5C). Since this tumor displayed senescence features (Figure 1E and Figure S4), our results confirm that PRAK and p38 are activated in senescent cells in vivo, and they are consistent with the essential role of these kinases in establishing the senescence response in DMBA-induced tumors. Since ectopically expressed HA-PRAK is activated in BJ cells by Ha-RasV12 and MKK3E in a manner similar to endogenous PRAK (Figure S8), overexpression of PRAK should enhance PRAK-mediated signaling. Therefore, we investigated the consequences of PRAK overexpression on senescence. Overexpression of wild-type PRAK caused a slight reduction in cell proliferation rate without a detectable increase in the SA-β-gal marker (Figures 5D and 5E). Thus, PRAK alone was not sufficient to induce premature senescence, possibly due to the lack of upstream signals that activate PRAK. Indeed, Ha-RasV12 induced more robust senescence phenotypes in conjunction with overexpressed PRAK than by itself. When compared with Ha-RasV12 alone, coexpression of Ha-RasV12 with PRAK resulted in stronger growth inhibition (Figure 5D) and twice as many SA-β-gal-positive cells on day 7 after ras transduction (Figure 5E). PRAK also enhanced cell enlargement, another characteristic of senescence (Figure S9A). By contrast, no difference was observed in the percentage of apoptotic cells between these two populations (Figure S9B), indicating that the stronger growth inhibition in PRAK/Ha-RasV12 cells resulted from enhanced senescence but not increased apoptosis. The effect of PRAK on senescence requires its activation and its kinase activity since the activation-site mutant (T182A) and the kinase-dead mutant (KM) of PRAK (New et al., 1998New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. PRAK, a novel protein kinase regulated by the p38 MAP kinase.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) failed to enhance ras-induced senescence (Figures 5D and 5E and Figure S9A), even though their levels of expression were comparable to wild-type PRAK (Figure 5F). These results demonstrate that PRAK is a rate-limiting factor during senescence in BJ cells and that an increase in PRAK expression levels sensitizes cells to ras-induced senescence. ras-induced senescence is mediated by sequential activation of the ERK and p38 pathways (Wang et al., 2002Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Sequential activation of the MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and MKK3/6-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediates oncogenic ras-induced premature senescence.Mol. Cell.

In an attempt to determine the signaling step on which PRAK acts, we found that PRAK knockdown in BJ cells did not alter activation of ERK or p38 by ras (Figure 6A) but prevented the silencing of the E2F targets PCNA, MCM3, and cyclin A (Figure 6B). This indicates that PRAK functions between p38 and E2F during senescence. The ability of PRAK shRNA to replace MDM2, a negative p53 regulator, in transforming BJ cells (Figure 4B) raises the possibility that PRAK may media"

The subsequent sorting of short MTs into networks like the mitotic spindle requires molecular motors that laterally slide overlapping MTs and bundling proteins that statically connect MTs. How bundling proteins interfere with MT sliding is unclear. In bipolar MT bundles in fission yeast, we found that the bundler ase1p localized all along the length of antiparallel MTs, whereas the motor klp2p (kinesin-14) accumulated only at MT plus ends. Consequently, sliding forces could only overcome resistant bundling forces for short, newly nucleated MTs, which were transported to their correct position within bundles.

The bundling of MTs is a crucial step in the formation of MT arrays in interphase and mitotic cells. Lateral contacts between MTs are seen in diverse structures like the spindle midzone, axons, developing muscle cells, cilia, and epithelial cells. The polarity of MT contacts is directly related to the function of MT networks in regulating cell polarity: bundles of parallel MTs in axons provide a directional cue for vesicle transport (Heidemann et al., 1981Heidemann S. Landers J. Hamborg M. Polarity orientation of axonal microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and antiparallel MT contacts in the spindle-midzone are essential to the bipolarity of the mitotic spindle (Sharp et al., 2000Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Microtubule motors in mitosis.Nature. 2000; 407: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In general, processes that regulate the polarity of MTs are not well understood. Centrosomes play a role by grouping MT minus ends together such that neighboring MTs in their asters are parallel. Yet in many systems MTs are nucleated from randomly dispersed nucleation sites and can still form polarized arrays (Janson et al., 2005Janson M.E. Setty T.G. Paoletti A. Tran P.T.

Components of mitotic extracts, for example, organize MTs into bipolar arrays in the complete absence of centrosomes (Heald et al., 1996Heald R. Tournebize R. Blank T. Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.

Self-organization of microtubules into bipolar spindles around artificial chromosomes in Xenopus egg extracts.Nature. 1996; 382: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). MT bundling proteins presumably contribute to polarity establishment by selectively bundling parallel or antiparallel MTs. However, the existence of such selectivity was hitherto not demonstrated for static crosslinking proteins like NuMA or the spindle-midzone-protein PRC1. Instead, work has focused on molecular motors that exert directed forces to dynamically sort MTs into polarized MT arrays. Motors have multiple MT binding sites or form oligomeric complexes to crosslink and transport MTs along MTs (Sharp et al., 2000Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Microtubule motors in mitosis.Nature. 2000; 407: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The kinesin motor MKLP1 (kinesin-6) was shown to interact selectively with antiparallel MTs in the spindle midzone during mitosis (Nislow et al., 1992Nislow C. Lombillo V.A. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R. A plus-end-directed motor enzyme that moves antiparallel microtubules in vitro localizes to the interzone of mitotic spindles.Nature. 1992; 359: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), while CHO2 (kinesin-14) can induce the formation of parallel MT bundles (Sharp et al., 1997Sharp D. Kuriyama R. Essner R. Baas P. Expression of a minus-end-directed motor protein induces Sf9 cells to form axon-like processes with uniform microtubule polarity orientation.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2373-2380PubMed Google Scholar). In the midzone of spindles, plus-end-directed motors like Eg5 (kinesin-5) and MKLP1 are believed to slide plus ends of antiparallel overlapping MTs toward each other, while minus-end-directed motors (kinesin-14) were proposed to generate balancing opposite forces to establish stable MT contacts. Computer simulations, however, showed that such a scheme may work only if motor domains are able to halt at MT ends, which is in effect a mixed activity of static MT bundling and active sliding (Nedelec, 2002Nedelec F. Computer simulations reveal motor properties generating stable antiparallel microtubule interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A combination of static MT-end crosslinkers and molecular motors was furthermore proposed to be required for stably focusing MT minus ends into asters in the absence of centrosomes (Chakravarty et al., 2004Chakravarty A. Howard L. Compton D.A. A mechanistic model for the organization of microtubule asters by motor and non-motor proteins in a mammalian mitotic extract.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2116-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Combining static crosslinking activity with motors thus seems to increase the ability of dynamic systems to generate stable MT contacts with the correct polarity. How bundling and sliding activity are tuned to one another such that networks neither become too rigid nor too dynamic is unknown. Adding motor proteins to statically bundled MT networks can cause separation of MTs (Maresca et al., 2005Maresca T.J. Niederstrasser H. Weis K. Heald R. Xnf7 contributes to spindle integrity through its microtubule-bundling activity.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1755-1761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), so regulatory mechanisms are needed to establish lasting MT connections. Clearly, a good understanding of these processes requires detailed knowledge of the MT binding properties of bundlers and motors with emphasis on MT-end binding and crosslinking polarity preference. Both motor and bundling proteins are required for the construction of three to four bipolar MT bundles along the long axis of rod-shaped fission yeast cells—Schizosaccharomyces pombe—in interphase (Brunner and Nurse, 2000Brunner D.

Like the spindle midzone, these bundles contain antiparallel contacts between MTs. MTs within each bundle are oriented such that their plus ends typically grow at 2 to 3 μm/min toward the nearest cell tip, whereas their nongrowing minus ends are bundled by ase1p (the yeast homolog of PRC1) to form a bundle-midzone of crosslinked antiparallel MTs in the central cell region (Loiodice et al., 2005Loiodice I. Staub J. Setty T.G. Nguyen N.P.T. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Ase1p organizes antiparallel microtubule arrays during interphase and mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

The roles of fission yeast Ase1 in mitotic cell division, meiotic nuclear oscillation, and cytokinesis checkpoint signaling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1378-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). During mitosis, ase1p bundles antiparallel MT plus ends in the spindle midzone. So, although the orientation of MTs is reversed compared to interphase bundles, the same protein is involved in the regulation of bipolarity (Loiodice et al., 2005Loiodice I. Staub J. Setty T.G. Nguyen N.P.T. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Ase1p organizes antiparallel microtubule arrays during interphase and mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1756-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was shown that interphase bundles are dynamic structures from which individual MTs are removed by disassembly, while new MTs are added by nucleation from γ-tubulin complexes along the length of preexisting MTs (Carazo-Salas et al., 2005Carazo-Salas R.E.

Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Efficient formation of bipolar microtubule bundles requires microtubule-bound γ-tubulin complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A minus-end-directed kinesin-14, klp2p, transports new MTs toward the bundle midzone, but how their minus ends subsequently become stably embedded in the bundle midzone is not understood. Deletion of ase1 inhibits the bundling of MTs into a bundle midzone (Loiodice et al., 2005Loiodice I. Staub J. Setty T.G. Nguyen N.P.T. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Ase1p organizes antiparallel microtubule arrays during interphase and mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

The roles of fission yeast Ase1 in mitotic cell division, meiotic nuclear oscillation, and cytokinesis checkpoint signaling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1378-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) whereas deletion of klp2 inhibits MT sliding (Carazo-Salas et al., 2005Carazo-Salas R.E. Antony C. Nurse P. The kinesin Klp2 mediates polarization of interphase microtubules in fission yeast.Science. 2005; 309: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ase1p and klp2p are therefore the dominant, and possibly the only, bundler and motor involved in MT organization, making S. pombe a suitable model system to study the effect of bundling proteins on MT sliding. Here, we demonstrate that the MT bundling properties of ase1p and klp2p suffice to sort dispersedly nucleated MTs into bipolar MT arrays. We show that ase1p contributes to bipolarity by selectively crosslinking antiparallel MTs. Newly nucleated MTs are therefore oriented antiparallel to preexisting MTs and are transported toward the bundle midzone by klp2p-mediated sliding. Sliding and bundling forces are regulated such that only short, newly nucleated, MTs are transported. As part of this regulation, ase1p accumulated all along the length of bundled MTs, whereas klp2p gathered at MT plus ends in a length-independent manner. We argue that similar length-dependent and -independent forces more generally regulate MT overlap. Thus, our analysis identifies MT end binding and polarity specificity as key elements to the organization of MT arrays. The movement and dynamics of individual MTs within bundles can be visualized using kymographs (Sagolla et al., 2003Sagolla M.J. Uzawa S. Cande W.Z. Individual microtubule dynamics contribute to the function of mitotic and cytoplasmic arrays in fission yeast.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4891-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The kymographs shown in this article display the intensity of fluorescently tagged tubulin along straight or slightly bend MT bundles as a one-dimensional horizontal array of pixels with corresponding intensity variations. Repeating this procedure for each frame of a time-lapsed movie generates a two-dimensional image with time along the vertical dimension. Figure 1B shows a kymograph of a wild-type cell expressing small amounts of GFP-tubulin (atb2) in addition to endogenous tubulin expression. Typical MTs that grew from and subsequently shortened back to the cell center form triangles of increased intensity (Figure 1B, an example is colored red). Shortening continued until the MTs were completely disassembled. Appearing speckles (Figure 1B, yellow circle), points of increased and decreased intensity along MTs caused by the nonuniform incorporation of GFP-tubulin, form vertical lines in kymographs (Waterman-Storer et al., 1998Waterman-Storer C.M. Desai A. Bulinski J.C. Salmon E.D. Fluorescent speckle microscopy, a method to visualize the dynamics of protein assemblies in living cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1227-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that often allowed for the identification of the three sides of the triangle: nondynamic minus end (Figure 1B, label 6), growing plus end (Figure 1B, label 1), and shortening plus end (Figure 1B, label 2). A kymograph of a complete bundle can be viewed as a superposition of several MT triangles that gives rise to areas with increased intensity. Most MT overlap was seen in the bundle midzone between antiparallel MT minus ends (Figure 1B, label 3), but additional overlap zones were occasionally created by two parallel MTs emanating from the bundle midzone (Figure 1B, label 5). Furthermore, new MTs were nucleated (Figure 1B, label 4) and transported along existing MTs toward the bundle midzone. One example is highlighted in green (Figure 1B), for which sliding can be observed relative to a static speckle on the underlying MT (Figure 1B, yellow dots). Nucleated MTs are oriented antiparallel with respect to the underlying MTs, such that once their plus ends cross the bundle midzone, they eventually grow with the correct polarity toward the closest cell end (Janson et al., 2005Janson M.E. Setty T.G. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Efficient formation of bipolar microtubule bundles requires microtubule-bound γ-tubulin complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to the sliding of new MTs, overlapping MT minus ends within the bundle midzone did not slide relative to each other (Figure 1B, label 3), raising the question of how sliding is regulated. To directly observe the formation of a stable bundle midzone by just two MTs, we looked for rare events in which one MT was nucleated along a single MT. In Figure 1C, nucleation takes place 4.0 μm away from an existing minus end. The sliding of the novel minus end gradually slowed as the new MT elongated and completely stalled after sliding a total length of 1.2 μm. Meanwhile, its plus end continued growing and eventually extended beyond the minus end of the underlying MT (Figure 1C, yellow circle). The resultant bundle midzone was 2.8 μm long. Figure 1D (white circle) shows a second example for which nucleation occurs only 1.2 μm away from the existing minus end, and movement stops after 0.4 μm of sliding. The resultant bundle midzone of only 0.8 μm shows that midzone length varies significantly with the location of MT nucleation. To understand the forces involved in the generation of a bundle midzone, we investigated the distribution of motor proteins along MTs by constructing two-color kymographs of simultaneously imaged klp2-GFP and mRFP-tubulin (Figures 2A and S1A; Movies S3 and S5). Interestingly, klp2-GFP tracked plus ends of growing MTs and was notably absent from MT minus ends. Sliding forces between overlapping MTs are therefore generated solely at MT plus ends, explaining the abrupt stop and constant overlap of the nucleated MT in Figure 1D once its plus end passed the underlying MT. Within mature bundles with more than two MTs, we furthermore noticed that no MT minus ends were pushed out of the bundle midzone by parallel MT sliding, suggesting that—in contrast to antiparallel sliding of new MTs—klp2p is unable to bundle and slide parallel MTs (see schematic in Figure 2A). In support of this we noticed that (1) parallel MTs can splay apart within bundles (Figure 2B and Movie S4) and (2) the plus ends of parallel-growing MTs in kymographs did not slide relative to each other (Figures 2A and S1A). The MT binding properties of klp2p are thus tailored to arrange MT minus ends stably into a small bundle midzone. The splaying of parallel MTs near cell ends (Figure 2B) suggests that MT bundling is restricted to the bundle midzone. To investigate localized bundling by ase1p, we constructed kymographs of ase1-GFP and mRFP-tubulin. Ase1-GFP indeed localized to the bundle midzone but also all along the length of MTs that were nucleated along preexisting MTs (Figure 2C and Movie S6). Both of these regions contain antiparallel MT contacts, suggesting that (1) ase1p localizes primarily to antiparallel MTs and (2) MTs within the bundle midzone are held together by antiparallel contacts. To test whether this polarity preference is an intrinsic property of ase1p, we added bacterially expressed GST-ase1p to dynamic MTs grown from purified tubulin. Encounters between growing MT ends and existing MTs resulted in either crossing or bundling, depending on the interaction angle and polarity (Figures 3A and 3B; Movies S8 and S9). For angles smaller than 15 degrees, the bundling of antiparallel MTs was 9.4 times more likely than the bundling of parallel MTs, and bundling probabilities decreased for higher interaction angles. MTs in this assay bound to the coverslip due to surface binding of GST-ase1p. Consequently, MTs had to bend locally under considerable angles in order to bundle with existing MTs (Movie S8). The required bundling forces can thus be exerted by GST-ase1p along antiparallel MTs but less so along parallel MTs. The bundling of MTs by ase1p homologs requires the formation of protein oligomers to bring together two or more MT binding domains; homologs in budding yeast (Schuyler et al., 2003Schuyler S.C. Liu J.Y. Pellman D. The molecular function of Ase1p: evidence for a MAP-dependent midzone-specific spindle matrix.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and plants (Smertenko et al., 2004Smertenko A.P. Chang H.Y. Wagner V. Kaloriti D. Fenyk S. Sonobe S. Lloyd C. Hauser M.T. Hussey P.J.

Kleman J.P. Jiang W. Schoehn G. Hunter T. Margolis R.L. PRC1 is a microtubule binding and bundling protein essential to maintain the mitotic spindle midzone.J.

Spatiotemporal control of spindle midzone formation by PRC1 in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6196-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dimer formation by the N terminus of ase1p (Figure 3C) and immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged ase1p and GFP-tagged ase1p (Figure 3D) showed that fission yeast ase1p oligomerizes. Preferential antiparallel bundling may therefore be enforced by a rigid antiparallel positioning of MT binding domains within ase1p oligomers. Interestingly, the N terminus of ase1p has a predicted spectrin domain (InterPro database) that was required for oligomerization (Figures S3 and 3D). Spectrin repeats form antiparallel dimers in muscle α-actinin, which bundles antiparallel actin filaments in muscle Z disks (Djinovic-Carugo et al., 1999Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Structure of the alpha-actinin rod: Molecular basis for crosslinking of actin filaments.Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The structural basis of MT and actin bundling may therefore be in part conserved. How do motor and bundling proteins like klp2p and ase1p target specific locations within MT networks? Similarly to kinesin-14 motors in other systems (Goshima et al., 2005Goshima G. Nedelec F. Vale R.D. Mechanisms for focusing mitotic spindle poles by minus end-directed motor proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, Sproul et al., 2005Sproul L.R. Anderson D.J. Mackey A.T. Saunders W.S. Gilbert S.P. Cik1 targets the minus-end kinesin depolymerase Kar3 to microtubule plus ends.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1420-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), klp2p may be recruited to MT plus ends by specialized plus-end-tracking proteins like EB1 or Cik1. Bundling proteins may depend on motor proteins for their localization; NuMA and PRC1 were proposed to associate with oppositely directed motors (dynein [Merdes et al., 1996Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. A complex of NuMA and cytoplasmic dynein is essential for mitotic spindle assembly.Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar] and Kif4 [Zhu and Jiang, 2005Zhu C.J. Jiang W. Cell cycle-dependent translocation of PRC1 on the spindle by Kif4 is essential for midzone formation and cytokinesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar]) for transport along MTs toward the spindle poles and the spindle midzone, respectively. Could a minus-end-directed motor transport ase1p along MTs toward antiparallel MTs in the bundle-midzone? The only minus-end-directed motor shown to affect bundle organization is, however, klp2p (Carazo-Salas et al., 2005Carazo-Salas R.E. Antony C. Nurse P. The kinesin Klp2 mediates polarization of interphase microtubules in fission yeast.Science. 2005; 309: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and ase1-GFP remains associated with antiparallel MTs in klp2Δ cells (Figure 2D and Movie S7). To investigate whether ase1p localizes autonomously to antiparallel MTs, we bundled polarity-marked stabilized MTs with bacterially expressed His-ase1-GFP. MTs were bound to the coverslip of a flowcell, and bundles with various amounts of MTs could be observed (Figure 3E). The majority of MTs in bundles of two MTs were antiparallel (66% ± 6%, ±SD, ntotal = 61), but the orientational preference was smaller than observed previously (Figure 3B). In the current assay, weak nonspecific interactions between ase1p and MTs may have bundled parallel MTs in solution because no large forces were required to bend MTs. The average fluorescence intensity of His-ase1-GFP along parallel MTs was 35% ± 8% (±SEM; n = 16) of that along antiparallel MTs (n = 28) (Figure 3F). Furthermore, targeting to single MT regions (n = 44) in bundles was very dim and often undetectable (3.4% ± 1.5%, ±SEM, of average intensity along antiparallel MTs), indicating a large affinity of ase1p for overlapped MTs and in particular for antiparallel overlapping MTs. A similar enrichment at bundled regions was observed with GST-tagged ase1-GFP, indicating that this property is independent of the protein tags used (data not shown). To compare these results with ase1p localization in vivo, we quantified the intensity of ase1-GFP along two parallel or two antiparallel MTs using kymographs of cells that coexpress mRFP-tubulin (Figure 2C). In vivo, the intensity of ase1-GFP along two parallel MTs, as judged from two-color kymographs, was on average 9% ± 1% (±SEM; n = 16) of that along two antiparallel MTs in the same bundle (Figure 3F), and ase1p-GFP targeting to single MTs could not be detected. The larger in vivo orientational preference may yield a strong bias toward the formation of antiparallel MT arrays in living cells. This would explain observations in MT nucleation deficient mto2Δ cells, in which only interactions between antiparallel treadmilling MTs generate bundling (Janson et al., 2005Janson M.E. Setty T.G. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Efficient formation of bipolar microtubule bundles requires microtubule-bound γ-tubulin complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Part of the observed differences between in vivo and in vitro measurements may be related to differences in ase1p-GFP concentration. In support of this, we note that specific targeting was inhibited in vitro by further increasing the ase1p-GFP concentration, which yielded significant localization of ase1p-GFP to single MTs (up to 40% of targeting to overlapped regions; data not shown). Similarly, overexpression of ase1p-GFP in fission yeast yielded localization to single MTs in vivo (data not shown). Furthermore, we note that specific interactions of ase1p with antiparallel MTs, and possible nonspecific interactions with parallel MTs will depend to varying degrees on ionic strength. Nonspecific interactions are likely screened in the cell, increasing the importance of specific interactions. We reasoned that the multiple MT binding domains within ase1p-oligomers may be oriented such that, due to steric effects, simultaneous binding of all domains to the same MT is prevented, whereas binding to two antiparallel MTs is allowed (Figure 4A). Interactions with overlapped MTs may therefore generate strong multiple bonds that compete ase1p away from single MTs. To find support for this localization mechanism, we expressed a monomeric ase1p mutant in ase1Δ cells. GFP-ΔNase1p (ase1p without the putative spectrin domain) could not recover the unbundled-MT phenotype of ase1Δ cells (Loiodice et al., 2005Loiodice I. Staub J. Setty T.G. Nguyen N.P.T. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Ase1p organizes antiparallel microtubule arrays during interphase and mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1756-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and localized dimly along the full length of MTs (Figure 4B and Movie S10). Localization and MT bundling are thus directly dependent on ase1p oligomerization, which itself may be regulated by phosphorylation like recently demonstrated for PRC1 (Zhu et al., 2006Zhu C. Lau E. Schwarzenbacher R. Bossy-Wetzel E. Jiang W. Spatiotemporal control of spindle midzone formation by PRC1 in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6196-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the dynamics of binding between ase1p oligomers and MTs is consistent with the proposed localization mechanism, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (FRAP) on GFP-ΔNase1p along single MTs (one MT binding domain per ase1p monomer) and GFP-ase1p along bundled MTs (multiple MT binding domains per ase1p oligomer). GFP-ΔNase1p expressed in ase1Δ cells recovered quickly with a time constant of 0.55 ± 0.05 s (n = 9; ±SEM; Figure 4C and Movie S11). For GFP-ase1p expressed in ase1Δ/mto2Δ cells, we measured a significantly longer time constant of 17.0 ± 1.5 s (n = 5; Figure 4C and Movie S12). The relatively long bundled regions in mto2Δ cells allowed for partial bleaching of ase1p stretches (Janson et al., 2005Janson M.E. Setty T.G. Paoletti A. Tran P.T. Efficient formation of bipolar microtubule bundles requires microtubule-bound γ-tubulin complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which helped to distinguish between GFP-ase1p recovery and the generation of new bundled regions. An intensity-based analysis of the fractional coverage of MTs by GFP-ΔNase1p and GFP-ase1p allowed for an estimation of molecular rate constants from the measured time constants (Figure S2). Approximately one out of six available binding sites along MTs were occupied by GFP-ΔNase1p, implying that the molecular off-rate of GFP-ΔNase1p was significantly higher than 1/0.55 s = 1.8 s−1, whereas the off-rate of GFP-ase1p at regions of overlap was close to 1/17.0 s = 0.059 s−1. Brief interactions involving a single MT binding domain may therefore allow ase1p to quickly “scan” MTs for overlapped regions and subsequently bind tightly. Are sliding forces generated at MT plus ends by klp2p and ase1p-dependent bundling forces sufficient to organize MT bundles? Two observations, imp"

https://openalex.org/W2129622728,"Background Hox genes were critical to many morphological innovations of bilaterian animals. However, early Hox evolution remains obscure. Phylogenetic, developmental, and genomic analyses on the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis challenge recent claims that the Hox code is a bilaterian invention and that no “true” Hox genes exist in the phylum Cnidaria. Methodology/Principal Findings Phylogenetic analyses of 18 Hox-related genes from Nematostella identify putative Hox1, Hox2, and Hox9+ genes. Statistical comparisons among competing hypotheses bolster these findings, including an explicit consideration of the gene losses implied by alternate topologies. In situ hybridization studies of 20 Hox-related genes reveal that multiple Hox genes are expressed in distinct regions along the primary body axis, supporting the existence of a pre-bilaterian Hox code. Additionally, several Hox genes are expressed in nested domains along the secondary body axis, suggesting a role in “dorsoventral” patterning. Conclusions/Significance A cluster of anterior and posterior Hox genes, as well as ParaHox cluster of genes evolved prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split. There is evidence to suggest that these clusters were formed from a series of tandem gene duplication events and played a role in patterning both the primary and secondary body axes in a bilaterally symmetrical common ancestor. Cnidarians and bilaterians shared a common ancestor some 570 to 700 million years ago, and as such, are derived from a common body plan. Our work reveals several conserved genetic components that are found in both of these diverse lineages. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that a set of developmental rules established in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians is still at work today."

https://openalex.org/W2143938161,"Retinal guanylate cyclases 1 and 2 (GC1 and GC2) are responsible for synthesis of cyclic GMP in rods and cones, but their individual contributions to phototransduction are unknown. We report here that the deletion of both GC1 and GC2 rendered rod and cone photoreceptors nonfunctional and unstable. In the rod outer segments of GC double knock-out mice, guanylate cyclase-activating proteins 1 and 2, and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase were undetectable, although rhodopsin and transducin α-subunit were mostly unaffected. Outer segment membranes of GC1–/– and GC double knock-out cones were destabilized and devoid of cone transducin (α- and γ-subunits), cone phosphodiesterase, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1, whereas cone pigments were present at reduced levels. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated normal RNA transcript levels for the down-regulated proteins, indicating that down-regulation is posttranslational. We interpret these results to demonstrate an intrinsic requirement of GCs for stability and/or transport of a set of membrane-associated phototransduction proteins. Retinal guanylate cyclases 1 and 2 (GC1 and GC2) are responsible for synthesis of cyclic GMP in rods and cones, but their individual contributions to phototransduction are unknown. We report here that the deletion of both GC1 and GC2 rendered rod and cone photoreceptors nonfunctional and unstable. In the rod outer segments of GC double knock-out mice, guanylate cyclase-activating proteins 1 and 2, and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase were undetectable, although rhodopsin and transducin α-subunit were mostly unaffected. Outer segment membranes of GC1–/– and GC double knock-out cones were destabilized and devoid of cone transducin (α- and γ-subunits), cone phosphodiesterase, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1, whereas cone pigments were present at reduced levels. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated normal RNA transcript levels for the down-regulated proteins, indicating that down-regulation is posttranslational. We interpret these results to demonstrate an intrinsic requirement of GCs for stability and/or transport of a set of membrane-associated phototransduction proteins.

Hear. Res. 1999; 127: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas GC2 is found only in the retina. The activities of these enzymes are Ca2+-sensitive, a sensitivity that is mediated by guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). GCAPs are Ca2+-binding proteins with three high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (EF hands) (6Palczewski K. Polans A.S. Baehr W. Ames J.B. Biol. Essays. 2000; 22: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. Methods. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Koch K.W. Adv. Exp. Med.

In light, the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) in rods and cones leads to the hydrolysis of cGMP and the closure of cGMP-gated (CNG) cation channels (for a review, see Ref. 9Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5138-5152Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Channel closure causes the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration to decline. The resulting dissociation of Ca2+ from the GCAPs increases the activity of the GCs and therefore the cGMP level, completing the negative feedback loop (10Burns M.E. Mendez A. Chen J. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, GCs are not only important for maintaining the basal cGMP level in darkness but are also critical for expediting the recovery of photoreceptors following light stimulation. Of the two GCAPs present in mouse retina, GCAP1 stimulates GC1 more efficiently than GC2 (11Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Li N. Pettenati M. Rao N. Bronson D. Wechter R. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6526-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Deletion of both GCAP genes delays recovery of the dark current due to loss of Ca2+-dependent GC activation (12Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I. Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition to particulate GCs, a role in photoreceptor physiology was envisioned for soluble GCs, but no genetic or functional evidence is available for a role in modulation of cGMP in photoreceptors (13Noll G.N. Billek M. Pietruck C. Schmidt K.F. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1407-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Cao L. Blute T.A. Eldred W.D. Vis.

In humans, null mutations in the GC1 gene (GUCY2D, on chromosome 17) are known to cause Leber congenital amaurosis type 1 (LCA1), an autosomal recessive, early onset rod/cone dystrophy (15Tucker C.L. Ramamurthy V. Pina A.L. Loyer M. Dharmaraj S. Li Y. Maumenee I.H. Hurley J.B. Koenekoop R.K. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hanein S. Perrault I. Gerber S. Tanguy G. Barbet F.

A naturally occurring retinal degeneration in chicken (rd or GUCY1*B chicken), caused also by a null mutation in the GC1 gene (17Semple-Rowland S.L. Lee N.R. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), mimics the human LCA phenotype. In mice, however, a null mutation in the GC1 gene produces a cone dystrophy; the GC1–/– rods remain viable and responsive to light (18Yang R.B. Robinson S.W. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Birch D.G. Garbers D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Coleman J.E. Zhang Y. Brown G.A. Semple-Rowland S.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3397-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). No human retinal disease has yet been linked to a defect in the GC2 gene (GUCY2F, on the X chromosome). Here, the functional role of GC2 was examined by deleting the mouse GC2 gene. Our results show that electroretinographic (ERG) responses are largely normal in GC2–/– retina. In contrast, the ERG responses of GC1/GC2 double knock-out (GCdko) mice are absent, suggesting that no GC other than GC1 and GC2 is involved in rod or cone phototransduction. Histology of GCdko retinas revealed that outer segments form but degenerate in a manner similar to that observed in the rd (GUCY1*B) chicken (17Semple-Rowland S.L. Lee N.R. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and in human LCA1 patients (20Rozet J.M. Perrault I. Gerber S. Hanein S. Barbet F. Ducroq D. Souied E. Munnich A. Kaplan J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1190-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analyses detailed abnormal outer segment morphologies. Down-regulation of PDE6 and GCAPs in GCdko rods as well as down-regulation of cone phototransduction components in GC1–/– cones suggest that GCs serve enzymatic, stabilizing, and structural/transport roles in photoreceptors. Construction of Targeting Vector and Generation of GC2 Knock-out Mice—To delete the GC2 gene, a 16-kb mouse genomic DNA fragment containing exon 1 was cloned from a mouse 129Sv/Ev λ genomic library. An 8.5-kb XbaI fragment was subcloned to produce the targeting vector. One side of the neo gene cassette was inserted 5 bp upstream of the ATG start codon in exon 2. The replaced sequence starts with 5′-AGGCTATGTTCCTCGGACCCTGGCCTTTTTCTCGCC. The other side of the neo gene cassette was inserted 290 bp downstream of the ATG start codon inside exon 2, and that replaced sequence reads 5′-ATTCGAAGGAGTAACTCCTGTCAAATGTCTTGTCCCGG. In this strategy, the neo cassette replaced part of the coding region of exon 2. Ten micrograms of the targeting vector were linearized by NotI and then transfected by electroporation of iTL1 ES cells (129Sv/Ev) embryonic stem cells. After selection in G418, surviving colonies were expanded; PCR analysis was performed using primer pair Gctoda6 and PLA2 to identify recombinant clones. Primer Gctoda6 is located 165 bp downstream of the XbaI site, on the short arm side, with a sequence of 5′-GTTCTGAGCTACAGATCCTACAGTG. Primer PLA2 is located in the 5′-promoter region of the neo gene cassette and has a sequence of 5′-GTTCTTCGGACGCCTCGTCAACAC. The positive clones gave rise to a 1.5-kb PCR fragment. Correctly targeted ES cell lines were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Chimeric mice were generated and gave germ line transmission of the GC2 knock-out to progeny. Primer pair Gctoda6 and Gctowt1 was used to identify the WT allele by its 1.3-kb amplified product. Primer Gctowt1 is located 280 bp downstream of the ATG start codon inside exon 1, inside the neo cassette replaced area, with a sequence of 5′-CAAGACATTTGACAGGAGTTACTC. Alternatively, primer Gctowt1 can be exchanged for primer Gctowt2, which is located 6 bp upstream of primer Gctowt1, with a sequence of 5′-CTGCTTTAGCAATTGAGCGAATCAG. Amplification yields a 1.3-kb fragment. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s (35 cycles). In difficult amplifications, 10% Me2SO or Q solution from Qiagen was used. GC1–/– and Double Knock-out Mice—Procedures for the animal experiments described here were IACUC-approved by the University of Utah and Case Western Reserve University and conformed to recommendations of the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Animals were maintained in complete darkness, or cyclic light (12 h light/12 h dark or 14 h light/10 h dark) conditions, and physiological experiments were performed under dim red illumination using a Kodak number 1 Safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). GC1 knock-out mice were rederived from GC1 knock-outs (19Coleman J.E. Zhang Y. Brown G.A. Semple-Rowland S.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3397-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using mice originally produced by Dr. David Garbers (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX) (18Yang R.B. Robinson S.W. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Birch D.G. Garbers D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GC single and double knock-outs were typed for the presence of GC1 and GC2 knock-out alleles and absence of WT alleles. Primers used for GC1 genotyping were as follows: Gc1F4 (forward primer in intron 4), 5′-TCCTATCCACGACAGGACCAAGACTGT; Gc1R4 (reverse primer in intron 5), 5′-GAGAGCAGAAGGGTAGCATTAGCTCAG; NeoF4 (forward primer in neo cassette), 5′-ACCGCTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGGCTA. Both pairs of primers were used in a one-tube PCR amplification to yield the fragments shown in Fig. 1D. GC2–/– mice were genotyped using forward primer Pla2 and reverse primer Gc2mt-R2 (5′-GTGCCTACAGGACTCTTGATGTCATTC). WT mice were genotyped with primers Gctowt1 and Gctoda6.

Real Time RT-PCR—Semiquantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using total RNA of WT and GCdko retinas. The following primers were used: rod PDE6α subunit forward, 5′-TGATGAGTACGAAGCCAAGATGAAGGC; rod PDE6α subunit reverse, 5′-TCAGCTACTGGATGCAACAGGACTTAG; rod Tα subunit forward, 5′-ACGCTGTCACCGACATTATCATCAAGG; rod Tα subunit reverse, 5′-AGCAGCTTGTGGAAAGGACGGTATTTG; cone Tα subunit forward, 5′-ATGACCTGTGCTACAGACACACAGAAC; cone Tα subunit reverse, 5′-GCATGAAGCCTCAGATTCTAAGCTTGC; GCAP1 forward, 5′-AGTTGCGCTGGTATTTCAAGCTCTACG; GCAP1 reverse, 5′-AAACACGGTATCTGTGAATTCCTCGGC; GCAP2 forward, 5′-TATGTAGAGAGCATGTTCCGAGCCTTC; GCAP2 reverse, 5′-ATGCAGCCATTTCGGTCCTTGTCATAG; Gapdh forward, 5′-accccttcattgacctcaactacatgg; Gapdh reverse, 5′-atttgatgttagtggggtctcgctccT. All primer pairs were designed to give an amplicon size of ∼150 bp. Total RNAs were extracted from 1-month-old mouse retina by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase digestion. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with both WT and GCdko RNA samples (25 ng) using the QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Standard curves for each primer set were obtained with 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 ng of the WT RNA sample (Fig. S3). Results were normalized to Gapdh signals for each sample. Standards for Gapdh and all other primer sets showed similar slopes, indicating equivalent amplification kinetics (Fig. S3). Confocal Immunolocalization—Eyes were harvested at mid-morning under ambient illumination (200–800 lux) without dark or light adaptation. Left eyes of age-matched mice were immersion-fixed for 2 h using freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and cryoprotected. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (21Bhosale P. Larson A.J. Frederick J.M. Southwick K. Thulin C.D. Bernstein P.S. J. Biol.

Affinity-purified primary antibodies (15–25 μl) were applied to each group of four sections in a humidified, rotating chamber overnight at 4 °C. Propidium iodide (Invitrogen Molecular Probes™; 1:3,000 dilution) was added to the solution containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The sections were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted Laser Scan confocal microscope with a ×40, 1.3 numerical aperture oil objective lens and optical slit setting of <0.9 μm.

Immunoblotting—Retinas from both eyes of the mouse were sonicated in 100 μl of lysis buffer (26Howes K.A. Bronson J.D. Dang Y.L. Li N. Zhang K. Ruiz C.C. Helekar B.S. Lee M. Subbaraya I. Kolb H. Chen J. Baehr W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 867-875PubMed Google Scholar). Each sample (15 μg of protein) was separated on a 10–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The signal was visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). ERGs—The recording procedure was performed as described (27Haeseleer F. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Possin D.E.

ERGs were recorded with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system UTAS E-3000 (LKC Technologies, Inc.). The light intensity was calibrated by the manufacturer and computer-controlled. Flash stimuli had a range of intensities (–3.7-2.8 log cd·s·m–2), and white light flash duration was adjusted according to intensity (from 20 μs to 1 ms). Leading edges of the ERG responses were fitted with a model of rod photoreceptor activation (29Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The double-flash recording followed a previously published protocol (30Liang Y.

The normalized amplitude of the probe flash a-wave versus the time between two flashes was plotted and fit by the linear regression algorithm in the SigmaPlot program (version 9.0). Dark-adapted ERG recordings after intense constant illumination were performed and evaluated as described (28Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W.

Single Cell Recordings—Single cell recordings were performed as described previously (32Luo D.G. Yau K.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An individual rod outer segment was drawn into a snug-fitting glass suction electrode containing 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.02 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glucose. Membrane current was monitored with a current-to-voltage amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, CA). All signals were low pass-filtered at 20 Hz (8-pole Bessel) and sampled at 500 Hz. The light stimulus consisted of brief flashes (10 ms) of unpolarized 500-nm (10-nm bandwidth) light with intervals of 8 s. Histology—Right eyes of 1–2-month-old WT, GC1–/–, GC2–/–, and GCdko mice were prepared for light microscope plastic sections and electron microscope thin sections as described (33Frederick J.M. Krasnoperova N.V. Hoffmann K. Church-Kopish J. Ruether K. Howes K.A. Lem J. Baehr W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 826-833PubMed Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, the eyecups were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 1 h, dehydrated through an ascending series of graded ethanols, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections 0.5–1 μm thick and passing through the optic nerve were imaged using a Leica DM-R microscope with Prior stage, using Syncroscan RT software from Syncroscopy. Scaling for measurement was 182 nm/pixel and 5.5 pixels/micrometer at ×40 magnification. Generation of GC2–/– and GC1/GC2 Double Knock-out (GCdko) Mice—The GC1 (Gucy2e, on mouse chromosome 11) and the GC2 (Gucy2f, on the X chromosome) genes are closely related in structure (Fig. 1, A and B) (34Yang R.B. Fulle H.J. Garbers D.L. Genomics. 1996; 31: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GC1 knock-out construct (18Yang R.B. Robinson S.W. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Birch D.G. Garbers D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) replaced a portion of exon 5 encoding the transmembrane domain by a neo cassette, thereby deleting the entire intracellular region of GC1. We prepared a GC2 knock-out mouse by replacing a portion of exon 2 containing the translation start codon and the peptide leader sequence with a neo cassette (Fig. 1, B and C). Several generations of these mice were established on the C57BL/6J background and were cross-bred with GC1–/– mice to generate GCdko mice. The GCdko mice were fertile and developed normally, thereby excluding a vital role for GC1 or GC2 during embryogenesis. The genotypes of single and double knock-out mice were confirmed by PCR amplification using GC1- and GC2-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1D). Immunoblots of GC1–/– and GC2–/– retinal lysates probed with monoclonal anti-GC1 and polyclonal anti-GC2 antibodies confirmed that GC1 and GC2 were not expressed (Fig. 1E). Further, immunoblots with anti-GC1 and anti-GC2 antibodies showed that the GC1 expression level is maintained in GC2–/– retina and that the GC2 expression level is also maintained in GC1–/– retina (Fig. 1F). GCdko Rod and Cone Photoreceptors Are Physiologically “Silent”—To test for photoreceptor function in WT and single and double knock-out retinas, we performed full-field ERGs (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Consistent with a previous report (18Yang R.B. Robinson S.W. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Birch D.G. Garbers D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes recorded from 4–6-week-old GC1–/– mice were significantly reduced compared with WT responses (Fig. 2, A and B). However, scotopic ERG responses were absent in GCdko mice at all light intensities tested. These results suggest that the rod responses recorded from GC1–/– retinas reflect GC2 activity. Scotopic ERG responses recorded from GC2–/– mice closely resembled those of WT mice, implying that GC1 alone is able to support rod function under these conditions. The a-wave amplitude and sensitivity of the scotopic GC2–/– mouse photoresponse were similar to WT at low intensities (Fig. 2B; Table 1); however, at high intensities, GC2–/– a-wave amplitudes were slightly reduced compared with WT (Fig. 2B). Photopic ERG responses recorded in the presence of background light were absent in GC1–/– and GCdko mice, whereas GC2–/– a- and b-waves were nearly identical to WT (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are consistent with GC1 regulating cGMP synthesis in cones and with both GC1 and GC2 regulating cGMP synthesis in rods. Given these observations, the possibility that other cyclases participate in rod or cone phototransduction can be excluded.TABLE 1ERG data (a-wave amplitudes, sensitivity, and recovery) for WT, GC1-/-, and GC2-/- miceWTGC1-/-GC2-/-Maximum a-wave amplitude (μV)964.6 ± 48.4239.3 ± 50.5ap < 0.0001.874.8 ± 23.9Sensitivity (log scotopic-cd-1 m2 s-3)6.2 ± 0.36.4 ± 1.24.4 ± 0.4bp < 0.05.Time between flashes for 50% a-wave amplitude recovery (ms)893.3 ± 47.8895.4 ± 112.21,018.1 ± 63.1a p < 0.0001.b p < 0.05.

In this method, short test flashes followed by varying interstimulus intervals, and a probe flash were used to test for a-wave recovery (36Pepperberg D.R. Birch D.G. Hood D.C. Vis. Neurosci. 1997; 14: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Lyubarsky A.L. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 563-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, GCdko photoreceptors were unresponsive (Fig. 3A). Recoveries of a-waves measured from GC1–/– mice and GC2–/– mice were normalized to the amplitudes of corresponding WT a-wave responses. Rates of dark current recovery in GC1–/– and GC2–/– mice after the test flash were not significantly different from WT mice (GC1–/–, 895.4 ± 112.2 ms; GC2–/–, 1018.1 ± 63.1 ms; WT, 893.3 ± 47.8 ms) (Table 1). Intense Bleach Delays Recovery of GC1–/– and GC2–/– a-wave Amplitudes—In a second approach, dark adaptation rates were determined by exposing animals to a high intensity bleaching light (500 cd·s·m–2) for 3 min and then recording a-wave responses elicited by probe flashes delivered intermittently over the course of a 60-min dark adaptation period (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, 70% of rhodopsin was bleached (28Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18822-18832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ratios of the a-wave responses obtained during the recovery phase following the bleach for WT, GC1–/–, GC2–/–, and GCdko mice were plotted as a function of time in darkness. In WT mice, a-wave amplitudes recovered about 70% after 1 h of dark adaptation. The recovery of a-wave amplitudes was significantly delayed in GC1–/– and GC2–/– mice (p < 0.001) compared with WT. Following 1 h of dark adaptation, the amplitudes of the a-waves recorded from GC2–/– and GC1–/– mice had recovered to about 30 and 50%, respectively, of their dark-adapted values. These results suggest that GC1 and GC2 contribute distinctly to the recovery of photoreceptors from exposure to intense bleaching light. Rod Photoreceptor Single Cell Recordings—The mean dark currents of GC1–/– and GC2–/– rod photoreceptors were not significantly different from the WT currents (12 ± 1.2 pA for WT, 12.7 ± 1.3 pA for GC1–/–, and 13.8 ± 1.3 pA for GC2–/–) (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, GCdko rods showed no detectable light-sensitive current (Fig. 4D). That cyclic nucleotidegated (CNG) channels are present at similar densities in the rod outer segments (ROS) of WT and GC single knock-out rods argues that [cGMP]i levels in darkness are similar for WT, GC1–/–, and GC2–/– rods, whereas effectively no cGMP is present in GCdko rods. It therefore follows that the basal activity of either GC1 or GC2 is sufficient to maintain dark current in rods. Compensatory up-regulation of the other GC when one is missing may account for this observation; however, immunoblot results suggest normal GC2 levels in GC1–/– mice (Fig. 1F) (18Yang R.B. Robinson S.W. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Birch D.G. Garbers D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the light response, the kinetics was broadly similar for all three genotypes (Fig. 4, A–C). Sensitivity of GC2–/– rods was quite similar to that of WT rods (half-saturating flash intensity of 52.8 ± 4.9 versus 48.6 ± 6.3 photons μm–2), but the sensitivity of GC1–/– rods (half-saturating flash intensity of 13.6 ± 2.5 photons μm–2) was about 3.5-fold higher than WT (Fig. 4E) (see also Ref. 18Yang R.B.

https://openalex.org/W2076450052,"Gradients of axon guidance molecules instruct the formation of continuous neural maps, such as the retinotopic map in the vertebrate visual system. Here we show that molecular gradients can also instruct the formation of a discrete neural map. In the fly olfactory system, axons of 50 classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and dendrites of 50 classes of projection neurons (PNs) form one-to-one connections at discrete units called glomeruli. We provide expression, loss- and gain-of-function data to demonstrate that the levels of transmembrane Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a), acting cell-autonomously as a receptor or part of a receptor complex, direct the dendritic targeting of PNs along the dorsolateral to ventromedial axis of the antennal lobe. Sema-1a also regulates PN axon targeting in higher olfactory centers. Thus, graded expression of Sema-1a contributes to connection specificity from ORNs to PNs and then to higher brain centers, ensuring proper representation of olfactory information in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1978933411,"Background Translating mRNA sequences into functional proteins is a fundamental process necessary for the viability of organisms throughout all kingdoms of life. The ribosome carries out this process with a delicate balance between speed and accuracy. This work investigates how ribosome structure and function are affected by rRNA base modification. The prevailing view is that rRNA base modifications serve to fine tune ribosome structure and function. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis, yeast strains deficient in rRNA modifications in the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center were monitored for changes in and translational fidelity. These studies revealed allele-specific sensitivity to translational inhibitors, changes in reading frame maintenance, nonsense suppression and aa-tRNA selection. Ribosomes isolated from two mutants with the most pronounced phenotypic changes had increased affinities for aa-tRNA, and surprisingly, increased rates of peptidyltransfer as monitored by the puromycin assay. rRNA chemical analyses of one of these mutants identified structural changes in five specific bases associated with the ribosomal A-site. Conclusions/Significance Together, the data suggest that modification of these bases fine tune the structure of the A-site region of the large subunit so as to assure correct positioning of critical rRNA bases involved in aa-tRNA accommodation into the PTC, of the eEF-1A•aa-tRNA•GTP ternary complex with the GTPase associated center, and of the aa-tRNA in the A-site. These findings represent a direct demonstration in support of the prevailing hypothesis that rRNA modifications serve to optimize rRNA structure for production of accurate and efficient ribosomes."

Helicobacter pylori is a serious human pathogen that causes gastritis and both peptic and duodenal ulcers (1Graham D.Y. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1991; 6: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Peterson W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The pathogen is associated with an increased risk for development of both gastric adenocarcinoma (3Parsonnet J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and mucosa-associated lymphoma (4Nakamura S. Yao T. Aoyagi K. Iida M. Fujishima M. Tsuneyoshi M. Cancer. 1997; 79: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). H. pylori is highly adapted to colonize in human gastric mucosa, where it may remain for decades or even a lifetime. The specific infection in the stomach is caused by the attachment of adhesion proteins, such as BabA and SabA, to specific glycoconjugates on the gastric epithelial cell surface (5Ilver D. Arnqvist A. Ogren J. Frick I.M. Kersulyte D. Incecik E.T. Berg D.E. Covacci A. Engstrand L. Boren T. Science. 1998; 279: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 6Mahdavi J. Sonden B.

Although H. pylori elicits local as well as systemic antibody response (7Rathbone B.J. Wyatt J.I. Worsley B.W. Shires S.E. Trejdosiewicz L.K. Heatley R.V. Losowsky M.S. Gut. 1986; 27: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), location at such a specific niche permits it to escape elimination by the host immune response.

Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to the minor type I Lewis a and Lewis b (9Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H. Rasko D.A. Taylor D.E. Zheng P.Y. Appelmelk B.J. Wirth H.P. Yang M. Blaser M.J. Hynes S.O. Moran A.P. Perry M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11533-11543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). H. pylori fucosyltransferases (FucTs) are responsible for the last steps in the biosynthesis of Lewis antigens. The molecular mimicry of host cell surface antigens has been suggested to mask the pathogen from host immune surveillance and thus plays an important role in colonization and long term infection in the stomach (10Lozniewski A. Haristoy X. Rasko D.A. Hatier R. Plenat F. Taylor D.E. Angioi-Duprez K. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H. pylori continuously alters the expression of Lewis antigens, a process known as phase variation, to generate several LPS variants in one bacterial population and to display structural heterogeneity. The dynamic variation in cell surface antigens is thus a survival advantage for the bacteria and an essential feature to interact with host cells (11Hallet B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 570-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In H. pylori genomes, there exist two homologous α1,3/4-FucT genes, futA and futB, and one gene futC for α1,2-FucT (12Wang G. Rasko D.A. Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These three fut genes do not always encode functional proteins. For instance, futA, but not futB, encodes an active α1,3/4-FucT in H. pylori strains NCTC11639 and UA948 (13Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The futC gene in strain NCTC11639 is functional (12Wang G. Rasko D.A. Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but not functional in strain UA948 (14Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The on/off status of fut genes and the various levels of FucT activities present in different H. pylori strains determine the Lewis antigen expression patterns of H. pylori LPS. FutA and FutB contain a variable number of DD(or N)LRV(or I)NY tandem repeats in the C terminus. FucTs are inverting glycosyltransferases (GTs), i.e. the enzymes catalyze the fucosyl transfer from the donor GDP-β-l-fucose to form an α-glycosidic linkage. On the basis of the CAZy classification, FucTs are categorized into family GT10. Furthermore, FucTs also fall into three sub-families, namely α1,2-, α1,3/4-, and α1,6-FucTs, according to the position of the glycosidic bond each enzyme forms. H. pylori α1,3/4-FucTs are composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain, 2–10 heptad repeats, and a C-terminal tail rich in both basic and hydrophobic residues. The heptad repeats, previously proposed to form a leucine zipper, are essential for homodimerization (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The positively charged yet hydrophobic tail is required for association with the cell membrane. In contrast, mammalian α1,3/4FucTs have the typical structure of type II transmembrane proteins, consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a stem region followed by a large C-terminal catalytic domain. The primary sequences of H. pylori and mammalian α1,3/4-FucTs have homology mainly on the nucleotide binding site. For instance, comparison of the H. pylori FucT (NCTC11639) polypeptide sequence with mammalian FucTs, including human FucT III to VII, bovine FucTIII, and mouse FucT IV, reveals sequence similarity (40–45% identity) within a stretch of 69 amino acid residues (corresponding to Leu-229 to Leu-297 in H. pylori α1,3-FucT). Therefore, the overall sequence difference makes the H. pylori enzyme an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Despite the biological importance of human and H. pylori FucTs, further understanding is impeded by the lack of an x-ray structure. Recently we and others demonstrated that systematic deletion of the C terminus of H. pylori α1,3-FucT greatly improved the marginal solubility of the full-length protein (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Ma B. Audette G.F. Lin S. Palcic M.M. Hazes B. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6385-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Up to 80 residues, including the tail containing hydrophobic and positively charged residues (sequence 434–478) and five of the ten heptad repeats (sequence 399–433), can be removed without significant change in structure and catalysis. Several biophysical studies indicate that half of the heptad repeats are essential for the secondary and native quaternary structures (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We herein present for the first time x-ray crystallographic structures of FucT. The results may suggest a reaction mechanism of FucT and provide a basis for both LPS variation and the design of inhibitors. Protein Expression and Purification of the Truncated, Selenomethionine-labeled, and Mutant FucTs—The α1,3-FucT from H. pylori strain NCTC11639 was prepared according to the published procedure (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein crystallization was successful with deletion of C-terminal 115 residues. Approximately 160 mg was obtained for crystallization studies, with a purity of >95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. The C-terminal truncated enzyme has only four methionine residues, and their full substitutions with selenomethionine were not sufficient for phase angle calculations. We thus mutated Leu-202, which is located in the middle of a long α-helix based on the secondary structure prediction, to methionine to increase the anomalous difference. The selenomethionine-labeled L202M FucT was produced in Escherichia coli by using a non-auxotrophic protocol and purified in a similar manner. The molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The enzyme activity was measured based on the formation of GDP that was coupled with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay to monitor the consumption of NADH with a fluorescence excitation at 340 nm and emission at 460 nm (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Purified enzyme was concentrated to 18–20 mg/ml and crystallized at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Orthorhombic crystals for FucT, selenomethionine-labeled, and mutant enzymes were grown by using equal volumes of the protein solution and the reservoir that contained 4–5% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2–0.4 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 5.5). The substrate-bound FucT complexes were obtained by soaking the apo crystals prior to data collection with a 2–10 mm solution in the crystallization buffer as detailed in Table 1. Before data collection, all crystals were briefly soaked in a crystallization buffer containing 25–30% (v/v) ethylene glycol and were flash frozen in a gaseous stream of liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were processed and scaled by using HKL/HKL2000 packages (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Statistics are shown in Table 1. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with unit cell dimensions a = 104 Å, b = 136 Å, and c = 96 Å, in which an asymmetric unit comprises three FucT molecules.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for the FucT crystals Numbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Different trials with various parameters in RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C.

Statistics for the multiple anomalous dispersion phasing are shown in supplemental Table S1. Because there are three FucT molecules in an asymmetric unit, the completeness of the protein model was improved by cross-referencing of the auto-built polypeptide fragments. The electron densities were also sufficiently clear to allow manual fitting of most missing residues. Using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), a protomer containing residues 1–348 was thus constructed and placed in all three positions. The model yielded an initial R-value of 0.45 at 2.5-Å resolution. Further refinement employed the native data set and the program CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With strong non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, the model gave R and Rfree of 0.30 and 0.32 at 1.9-Å resolution. The electron density map revealed some regions with significant deviations among the three monomers (A, B, and C), which were then excluded from the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in subsequent refinement. Helix α4 did not have strong densities in monomer A and was not seen in monomer B. Water molecules and sulfate ions were included at later stages. The FucT crystals in complex with GDP and GDP-fucose were isomorphous to the apo crystal. Direct use of a previous mid-stage model in rigid-body refinement yielded R values of 0.274 and 0.276, respectively, for the FucT·GDP and FucT·GDP-fucose crystals. The initial difference Fourier maps clearly indicated that the pyrophosphate group of GDP replaced the bound sulfate ion in the active site. The sugar moiety of the bound GDP-fucose was visible in all three monomers, although the densities were weaker for monomer A. The FucT·GDP-fucose crystal also allowed slight extension of the C termini, but the amino acids beyond 352 were still invisible. Synthesis of Enzyme Inhibitors—Preparation of compounds 1 and 2 (see Fig. 5C) followed the procedure reported by Wong and his coworkers (24Lee L.V. Mitchell M.L. Huang S.J. Fokin V.V. Sharpless K.B. Wong C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9588-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Compounds 1 and 2 were individually coupled with 80 different acids (supplemental Fig. S1) to generate the amide derivatives in microplates in the presence of (1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (1 eq) and diisopropyl ethylamine (2 eq) in dimethylformimide. Without purification, the mixtures were subjected to the enzyme activity assay. Compound 3 was synthesized by 1,3-dipolar cyclization (known as “click chemistry”) of propargyl-GDP (the alkyne) and 5-azidopentanoic acid (biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)amide (the azide) in the presence of CuSO4 and copper wire at room temperature. The solvent mixture was composed of H2O, EtOH, and t-BuOH (3:2:5) (25Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). After purification, the resulting product produced 1H and 13C NMR spectra that are consistent with the reported data. These prepared compounds were studied for inhibition in accordance with the aforementioned procedure (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Structure of FucT and Its Complexes with GDP/GDP-Fucose— FucT crystallization was only successful upon deletion of the C-terminal 115 residues; this truncated form retained 20% of the native enzyme activity (15Lin S.-W. Yuan T.-M. Li J.-R. Lin C.-H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The refined FucT structures all contain three protein monomers (denoted A, B, and C) in the asymmetric unit cell, starting at Met-1 and terminating at residues 348–352. Each monomer is composed of two similar domains, both having parallel α/β topology of the Rossmann folds (Fig. 1A). The N- and the C-terminal domains encompass residues 20–150 and 160–320, respectively. The first helix α1 (residues 2–13) interacts with the C-terminal domain, whereas the last helix α12 (residues 328–340) interacts with the N-terminal domain. Refinement statistics for the crystals of FucT and two complexes (one with GDP and the other with GDP-fucose) are shown in Table 1. In the apo FucT crystal, there are three bound sulfate ions, two of which are at identical sites in monomers B and C, and adjacent to the side chain of Arg-195, an essential residue for enzymatic activity (see below). The third sulfate is bound to a distal loop of monomer C. Despite sulfate ions existing in the mother liquor, when the apo crystals were soaked with GDP, the sulfate was readily replaced by GDP. The crystalline FucT retained enzymatic activity to hydrolyze the donor substrate, GDP-fucose in the absence of acceptor. Soaking the FucT crystal with GDP-fucose left only the product GDP in the active site, unless the soaking time was kept to a minimum. Interactions between the enzyme and the diphosphate are more precisely defined in the GDP-fucose complex of FucT (Fig. 1B) than those for the enzyme and sulfate ion. Both side chains of Arg-195 and Lys-250 provide the neutralizing charges. Among the 18 well defined direct hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with GDP-fucose (Table 2), there are seven H-bonds between FucT and the nucleoside moiety of GDP, whereas the fucosyl group forms five specific H-bonds with the enzyme. Thus, FucT recognizes its substrate GDP-fucose with very high specificity. GDP alone is bound to the enzyme with a similar repertoire involving 12 direct H-bonds (Table 2), and the diphosphate group is rotated outward (Fig. 1C). In the FucT·GDP-fucose complex structure, one of the two H-bonds of Arg-195 is formed with the α-phosphate and another with the β-phosphate (Fig. 1B). In contrast, both H-bonds from Arg-195 are redirected to the β-phosphate in the FucT·GDP complex. Thus, after the fucose transfer, an additional positive charge is arranged to neutralize the leaving group.TABLE 2H-bonds between GDP/GDP-fucose and FucT residuesFucT residuesH-bond distance ofGDPGDP-fucoseÅVal-222-OBase N1 (2.6)Base N1 (2.7)Lys-223-OBase N2 (3.0)Base N2 (3.2)Ser-188-OγBase N7 (2.8)Base N7 (2.8)Val-186-ORibose O2′ (2.8)Ribose O2′ (2.8)Lys-225-NζRibose O3′ (3.1)Ribose O2′ (2.7)Lys-225-NζRibose O3′ (2.9)Glu-249-Oϵ2Ribose O3′ (2.8)Ribose O3′ (2.9)Ser-188-Nα-Phosphate O2A (2.7)α-Phosphate O1A (2.9)Asn-189-Nα-Phosphate O2A (2.8)α-Phosphate O1A (3.0)Arg-195-NH1β-Phosphate O3B (2.7)α-Phosphate O2A (3.2)Asn-189-Nδ2β-Phosphate O1B (2.7)Lys-250-Nζβ-Phosphate O2B (2.6)β-Phosphate O2B (3.1)Arg-195-NH2β-Phosphate O3B (2.7)β-Phosphate O3B (2.6)Asn-240-Nδ2β-Phosphate O1B (2.6)Fucose O2 (2.4)Tyr-246-OHFucose O2 (2.8)Gly-94-OFucose O3 (2.5)Tyr-246-OHFucose O3 (2.5)Glu-249-Oϵ1Fucose O4 (2.7) Open table in a new tab Comparison with Other FucTs— The GDP-fucose binding sites of H. pylori and human α1,3-FucTs have comparatively higher sequence similarity than other regions (Fig. 1D). This region, including the invariant residues Asn-240, Tyr-246, Glu-249, and Lys-250, provides a molecular basis accounting for the same donor-substrate specificity. These residues were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis to assess their roles in enzyme function (see below). DALI searches (25Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) for structural neighbors of FucT provided many Rossmann-fold proteins, including a number of different glycosyltransferases. The conserved N-terminal α-β-α motif in most glycosyltransferases is observed in both domains of FucT but with little sequence similarity. FucT belongs to the glycosyltransferases-B family in which each protein contains N- and C-terminal domains binding to the acceptor and donor substrates, respectively. To date, there are nine GT families with glycosyltransferases-B folds whose structures are reported (26Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem.

The N- and C-terminal domains of FucT can be better superimposed with BGT (PDB code: 1NZD), MurG (PDB code: 1NLM), and GtfD (also called TDP-vancosaminyltransferase; PDB code: 1RRV), as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2. The central β-sheets match quite well in both domains, whereas the α-helices and peripheral loops show more variations. Each of the two domains has to be superimposed individually because of the different dispositions by 29–38° rotation. The rotations are not about a uniform axis, yet the overall conformation of FucT is apparently more open than all other models.TABLE 3Deviations between FucT and other GT-B models BGT stands for phage β-glucosyltransferase, MurG denotes E. coli N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and GtfD represents TDP-vancosaminyltransferase.Model (PDB code)N-terminal domainC-terminal domainDomain rotation angleNo. CαsIdentical residuesr.m.s.d.No. CαsIdentical residuesr.m.s.d.ÅÅ°BGT (1NZD)52101.8130172.036MurG (1NLM)5051.98242.129GtfD (1RRV)4722.18651.938 Open table in a new tab In general, the C-terminal domains are more conserved than the N-terminal domains (Table 3 and Fig. 2). In particular, the C-terminal domains of FucT and BGT have 130 matched pairs of Cα atoms, including 17 identical residues. There are also 10 identities in the N-terminal domain. These correspond to <10% of the entire sequence. The other two models of MurG and GtfD have more variations. Catalytic Mechanism—BGT, being a member of the glycosyltransferases-B family, uses Asp-100 as the general base. Interestingly, this residue is equivalent to Glu-95 of FucT. Glu-95 is located in the N-terminal domain that presumably associates with the acceptor substrate. The side chain of Glu-95 is positioned immediately adjacent to the anomeric carbon of fucose in the GDP-fucose complex (Fig. 3), which supports its suggested role as a general base in catalysis. A model of the acceptor N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) can be constructed based on the locations of the catalytic base and the donor substrate, as well as the shape and orientation of the active site cleft. The shape of LacNAc is complementary to the cleft (Fig. 3A). The 3-OH of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is close to the anomeric carbon of the fucose residue, as well as the carboxylate of Glu-95 (Fig. 3B). The methyl group of the N-acetyl group, trans to the C2 of GlcNAc, also makes hydrophobic contact with the side chain of Leu-124. On the distal side, other OH groups may form additional H-bonds with the side chains of the first α-β-α motif of the N-terminal domain, such as Trp-33, Trp-34, and Glu-41 (Fig. 3B). The structures of the substrate- and product-bound forms of FucT allow us to suggest a catalytic mechanism that is similar to that of human FucT (38Murray B.W. Wittmann V. Burkart M.D. Hung S.C. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). LacNAc is bound to the pocket in the N-terminal domain, which has a highly negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 3A) that reduces the pKa of the C3-OH group of GlcNAc to favor nucleophilic attack. Upon deprotonation of the C3-OH group by Glu-95 (Fig. 4A), the acceptor nucleophile can attack the anomeric position of GDP-fucose to form a new glycosidic bond with an inverted configuration (Fig. 4A). The side product GDP dissociates at the same time. Because the anomeric carbon is located between the acceptor nucleophile, the C3-OH of GlcNAc, and the leaving group GDP (Fig. 4B), the geometry is consistent with the in-line displacement mechanism (39Pedersen L.C. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21869-21873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it is intriguing that two neighboring regions of opposite charges are also observed. The positively charged pocket, in close association with GDP-fucose, facilitates glycosidic bond cleavage by neutralizing the negative charges on GDP. Lys-250 and Arg-195 are the two critical residues (Fig. 4B). A major conformational change of the Arg-195-containing helix α7 is induced by the binding of GDP or GDP-fucose (Fig. 5A).

Although the role of NO has been well studied in inflammatory cells, much less is known about the regulation of NO production in epithelial cells. We demonstrated that in intestinal epithelial cells the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), the critical enzyme in the synthesis of NO, is synergistically stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon γ (IFNγ) or by the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFNγ at the transcriptional level. Expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to LPS/IFNγ were significantly increased upon induction of oncogenic K-Ras, underlying frequently elevated expression of iNOS in colon cancer. Silencing of STAT1, a major transcription factor involved in signaling by IFNγ, or pharmacological inhibition of JAKs, kinases that phosphorylate STATs, prevented the induction of iNOS and the production of NO in response to stimulation of cells with LPS/IFNγ or TNF/IFNγ, underscoring the importance of the intact JAK/STAT signaling in the regulation of iNOS expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and a dietary chemopreventive agent, decreased NO production in macrophages and in intestinal myofibroblasts, consistent with its anti-inflammatory activity. In contrast, in intestinal epithelial cells, butyrate significantly enhanced the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to treatment with LPS/IFNγ. Despite the fact that, like butyrate, three structurally unrelated inhibitors of HDAC activity, trichostatin A, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, and apicidin, induced acetylation of H3 and H4 in epithelial cells, they failed to increase the production of NO, demonstrating that butyrate regulates NO production in epithelial cells in an HDAC-independent manner. The ability of butyrate to regulate the production of NO in a variety of cell types is likely to underlie its potent chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activity.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical with important functions in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation and cancer.

Although neuronal and endothelial NOS are constitutively expressed, the expression of iNOS is regulated at the transcriptional level by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IFNγ, and IL-1 or by hypoxia and LPS (1Lowenstein C.J.

Tumor-associated fibroblasts and inflammatory cells appear to be the predominant, but not the exclusive, source of NO. The expression of iNOS correlates inversely with tumor grade in brain (3Cobbs C.S. Brenman J.E. Aldape K.D. Bredt D.S. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 727-730PubMed Google Scholar) and breast tumors (4Loibl S. Buck A. Strank C. von Minckwitz G. Roller M. Sinn H.P. Schini-Kerth V. Solbach C. Strebhardt K.

Likewise, there are conflicting reports regarding the relationship between iNOS expression and tumor progression in colon cancer. In humans, the expression of iNOS is reportedly reduced in the earliest neoplastic lesions in the colon, the aberrant crypt foci (6Hao X.P. Pretlow T.G. Rao J.S. Pretlow T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 419-422PubMed Google Scholar), but iNOS has also been shown to be overexpressed in the azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (7Rao C.V. Kawamori T. Hamid R. Reddy B.S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some reports have suggested that in colon cancer the expression of iNOS correlates with VEGF expression and microvascular density, whereas other publications have disputed that finding (8Cianchi F.

Jang D.D. Yang K.H. Hahm K.B. Kim D.Y. Gut. 2004; 53: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and pharmacological inhibition of iNOS suppresses both chemically induced carcinogenesis (12Rao C.V. Indranie C. Simi B. Manning P.T. Connor J.R. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis initiated by the Apc mutation (13Ahn B. Ohshima H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8357-8360PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a pro-tumorigenic activity of iNOS and NO. However, in the Apc min mouse model, iNOS deficiency has been reported either to promote or to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis (13Ahn B. Ohshima H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8357-8360PubMed Google Scholar, 14Scott D.J. Hull M.A. Cartwright E.J. Lam W.K. Tisbury A. Poulsom R. Markham A.F. Bonifer C. Coletta P.L. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 889-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of iNOS and NO in tumor initiation and/or tumor progression appears to be complex and may depend on the cell type. For example, overexpression of iNOS in tumor cells and in stromal cells had an opposite effect on the development of metastasis in a murine breast cancer model (15Gauthier N. Lohm S. Touzery C. Chantome A. Perette B. Reveneau S. Brunotte F. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. Jeannin J.F. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the role of NO in tumor promotion is dependent on p53. Nitric oxide has been shown to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells with wild type p53 but to promote the growth of colon cancer cells with mutant p53 through VEGF activation (16Ambs S. Merriam W.G. Ogunfusika M.O. Bennett W.P. Ishibe N. Hussain S.P. Tzeng E.E. Geller D.A. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).The biological activity of NO also depends on its local concentration and on the duration of the exposure of cells to NO. For example, high concentrations of NO (typically produced by iNOS) have been shown to induce apoptosis, whereas low concentrations of NO (produced by endothelial or neuronal NOS) can actually protect cells from apoptosis. However, it appears that exposure to moderate to high concentrations of NO promotes neoplastic transformation both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of iNOS in a human colon cancer cell line enhances VEGF expression and tumor progression (16Ambs S. Merriam W.G. Ogunfusika M.O. Bennett W.P. Ishibe N. Hussain S.P. Tzeng E.E. Geller D.A. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of iNOS in a glioma cell line reduces tumor growth (17Yamaguchi S. Bell H.S. Shinoda J. Holmes M.C. Wharton S.B. Whittle I.R. Br. J. Neurosurg. 2002; 16: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NO has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis not only though its ability to increase proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (18Kawasaki K. Smith Jr., R.S. Hsieh C.M. Sun J. Chao J. Liao J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5726-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) but also through direct activation of HIF1α, an important positive regulator of VEGF expression (19Sandau K.B. Zhou J. Kietzmann T. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39805-39811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, although modulation of NO signaling has been suggested as a novel approach for the treatment of tumors, a better understanding of the role of nitric oxide in tumor biology is required in order to design suitable therapeutic strategies.In this study we have shown that treatment of intestinal epithelial cells with IFNγ and LPS, or with the combination of TNF and IFNγ, activates the expression of iNOS at the transcriptional level through a JAK/STAT1-dependent pathway. We show that butyrate (a dietary chemopreventive agent), but not other inhibitors of HDAC activity, promotes iNOS expression and NO production in intestinal epithelial cells, identifying a biological activity of butyrate that appears to be independent of its ability to inhibit HDAC activity. In contrast, and consistent with their anti-inflammatory activity, all HDACi inhibited NO production in macrophages and in intestinal myofibroblasts. HDACi are drugs with potent chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity. They inhibit tumor development through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death and differentiation (20Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Their ability to modulate NO signaling in both tumor cells and stromal cells is likely to play a significant role in their anti-inflammatory activity and may therefore contribute to their ability to halt tumor progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Cytokine Treatment—Rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), transfected with an inducible K-RasVal-12 cDNA (IEC-iK-Ras), were a generous gift from Dr. Raymond DuBois (21Sheng H.

The membranes were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was used for the visualization of immune complexes. Antibodies specific for iNOS, STAT1, acetyl H3, and acetyl H4 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).Analysis of NO—NO production was measured by the Griess assay (23Vecchini F. Pringault E. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Hausel P. Felley-Bosco E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell supernatants (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of Griess reagent (Sigma). After 10 min, product formation was determined colorimetrically at 540 nm. The experiments were done in triplicates, repeated at least three times, and the results of a representative experiment are shown.Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assay—A reporter plasmid for the rat iNOS promoter region, containing 2158 bp, was kindly provided by Dr. Mami Takahashi (24Takahashi M. Mutoh M. Shoji Y. Kamanaka Y. Naka M. Maruyama T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7667-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 12-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pTK-Renilla (dual luciferase reporter assay system, Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were either left untreated or treated with IFNγ/LPS or TNF/IFNγ in the absence or presence of IPTG (5 mm). Basal activity and IFNγ/LPS-inducible transcriptional activity were determined 48 h after transfection (24 h after treatment). Results are expressed as the relative promoter activity, calculated from the ratio between luciferase and Renilla (LUC/REN) activity. In cotransfection experiments, the iNOS promoter construct was transfected together with nontargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNA directed against the coding region of STAT1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Cells were transfected with 50 nm STAT1 siRNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen).RESULTSLPS and IFNγ Synergistically Activate the Expression of iNOS—Although stromal cells are the predominant source of NO, epithelial cells have also been shown to express iNOS and to produce NO in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 (24Takahashi M. Mutoh M. Shoji Y. Kamanaka Y. Naka M. Maruyama T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7667-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study we examined whether another proinflammatory cytokine, IFNγ, is also able to stimulate the expression of iNOS in intestinal epithelial cells and whether it cooperates with LPS, a product of the bacterial cell wall. We performed experiments in rat IECs with IPTG-inducible expression of mutant K-Ras, the IEC-iK-Ras cells (21Sheng H. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675PubMed Google Scholar). We first treated cells with IFNγ alone, LPS alone, or a combination of both agents, which has been shown to be a potent inducer of iNOS expression in macrophages. Unlike in macrophages, neither IFNγ alone nor LPS alone was able to induce the expression of iNOS; however, when intestinal cells were co-treated with both agents, the expression level of iNOS rose significantly (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the level of NO significantly increased only in cells treated with both IFNγ and LPS (Fig. 1B). The induction of NO appeared in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as shown in supplemental Fig. 1, A and B. Type I IFN (IFNβ) failed to synergize with LPS in induction of NO (supplemental Fig. 1C).The Role of Oncogenic Ras in the Expression of iNOS—Constitutive signaling by Ras has been suggested to induce a proinflammatory environment through activation of proteins such as IL-8 and COX-2 (21Sheng H. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sparmann A. Bar-Sagi D. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 735-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Sparmann A. Bar-Sagi D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). To determine whether in intestinal epithelial cells constitutive signaling by oncogenic Ras also affects the production of NO, another proinflammatory mediator, we induced Ras signaling in IEC-iK-Ras cells with 5 mm IPTG for 24 h before treating the cells with IFNγ/LPS. As in the absence of oncogenic Ras, IFNγ or LPS alone failed to induce the expression of iNOS. However, the levels of iNOS produced in response to treatment with LPS/IFNγ in cells with oncogenic Ras were significantly higher than in the absence of Ras signaling (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the expression of iNOS, the levels of NO in supernatants were elevated only in response to the combined treatment of cells with both IFNγ and LPS, and the activation of mutant Ras increased the levels of nitric oxide greatly (Fig. 1B). IFNγ was also able to synergize with TNF in the induction of iNOS (not shown) and in the production of NO (Fig. 1C). In agreement with data shown in Fig. 1A, cells expressing activated Ras produced considerably more NO in response to treatment with TNF/IFNγ (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with findings that the levels of iNOS expression and NO production are elevated during inflammation and frequently increased in transformed cells.Next we determined whether IFNγ and LPS regulate the expression of iNOS at the level of transcription. IEC-iK-Ras cells were transfected with the rat iNOS promoter construct (24Takahashi M. Mutoh M. Shoji Y. Kamanaka Y. Naka M. Maruyama T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7667-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and were treated with IFNγ or LPS individually or with a combination of both. As shown in Fig. 1D (left panel), neither IFNγ nor LPS alone was able to stimulate the activity of the iNOS promoter; however, treatment of cells with LPS/IFNγ increased iNOS promoter activity, demonstrating that LPS/IFNγ synergize at the level of transcription. In addition, induction of the activated Ras by IPTG increased transcriptional activity of the iNOS promoter (Fig. 1D, right panel), demonstrating that Ras signaling augments the expression of iNOS in response to IFNγ/LPS treatment at the level of transcription.JAK/STAT1 Signaling Is Required for iNOS Expression and NO Production—Despite the fact that STAT1 is a major transcription factor in signaling by IFNγ, we and others have shown that IFNγ can signal through both STAT1-dependent and -independent pathways (27Klampfer L.

To determine whether the activity of JAKs, kinases that phosphorylate STAT1, is required for the induction of iNOS and NO expression in response to IFN/LPS, we pretreated cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of JAK activity (JAK inhibitor 1, Calbiochem) for 2 h before stimulation with IFN/LPS. As shown in Fig. 2, inhibition of JAKs completely prevented the induction of iNOS in response to IFN/LPS (Fig. 2A) and consistently inhibited the production of NO (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2JAK activity is required for the induction of iNOS. A, the expression of iNOS was determined in control cells (lanes 1) and in cells treated with LPS/IFNγ alone (lanes 2) or in the presence of JAK inhibitor 1 (lanes 3).

CTRL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether STAT1 is required for the induction of iNOS in response to IFN/LPS treatment, we silenced STAT1 expression through siRNA, using oligonucleotides that specifically target rat STAT1. As shown in Fig. 3A, we successfully silenced STAT1 expression. Consistent with our published data (27Klampfer L. Huang J. Swaby L.A. Augenlicht L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30358-30368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), STAT1 deficiency hampered the expression of IRF1 upon stimulation of cells with IFNγ/LPS. Similarly, STAT1 deficiency strongly interfered with the induction of iNOS in response to IFN/LPS treatment, demonstrating that STAT1 mediates the synergism between LPS and IFNγ (Fig. 3A). However, our data also revealed that the expression of STAT1 is not sufficient for the induction of iNOS, as the treatment of cells with IFNγ alone, which resulted in a robust expression of STAT1, failed to induce iNOS expression (Fig. 3A). Consistent with impaired iNOS expression in STAT1-deficient cells, these cells also produced significantly lower amounts of NO in response to treatment with IFN/LPS or TNF/IFN (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3STAT1 is required for the induction of iNOS and for NO production in response to LPS/IFN or TNF/IFN. A, IECs were transfected with nontargeting siRNA or with STAT1 siRNA and treated with LPS, IFNγ, or a combination of both for 24 h as indicated. The levels of STAT1, iNOS, and IRF1 were determined by immunoblotting. NSB, nonspecific band. B, the amount of NO produced in response to LPS/IFNγ or TNF/IFNγ was determined in cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (NSP) or siRNA specific for STAT1 as indicated. C, IECs were transfected with the rat iNOS promoter in the presence of nontargeting siRNA (nonspecific (NSP)) or STAT1 siRNA. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with LPS/IFNγ or TNF/IFNγ for 24 h. CTRL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To establish whether STAT1 is required for transcriptional induction of iNOS by LPS/IFN or TNF/IFN, we transfected cells with the iNOS promoter in the presence of nontargeting siRNA or siRNA specific for STAT1. At 24 h after transfection, cells were either left untreated or were treated for 24 h with LPS/IFN or TNF/IFNγ. As shown in Fig. 3C, silencing of STAT1 did not interfere with the basal activity of iNOS, but it markedly lowered the inducibility of the iNOS promoter in response to treatment with LPS/IFNγ or TNF/IFNγ. These data demonstrate that STAT1 is required for the transcriptional induction of iNOS in response to IFN/LPS and TNF/LPS. Together, these data establish the requirement for the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway for the expression of iNOS and for the production of NO in intestinal epithelial cells.Butyrate, but Not Other HDAC Inhibitors, Enhances NO Production in Intestinal Epithelial Cells—We have recently shown that IFNγ regulates the expression of a subset of its target genes in an HDAC-dependent manner (27Klampfer L. Huang J. Swaby L.A. Augenlicht L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30358-30368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to IFN/LPS are regulated by inhibitors of HDAC activity, which act as important anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic compounds. Cells were treated with LPS/IFNγ in the absence or presence of four structurally unrelated HDACi: butyrate, SAHA, TSA, and apicidin. As shown in Fig. 4A, butyrate, but not the other HDAC inhibitors, significantly enhanced the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to IFN/LPS. We repeated the experiments four times and obtained similar results. Butyrate, but not SAHA, TSA, or apicidin, also increased the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in the presence of mutant Ras (Fig. 4B). Consistently, butyrate, but not other HDAC inhibitors, increased the production of NO also in response to treatment of epithelial cells with TNF/IFNγ (data not shown).FIGURE 4Butyrate, but not other HDAC inhibitors, enhances iNOS expression and NO production in intestinal cells. Cells were left untreated (ctrl) or were treated with IFNγ/LPS alone or in the presence of 3 mm butyrate (Bu), SAHA (0.5 or 3 μm), TSA (0.1 or 1 μm), or apicidin (0.2 or 1 μm) in the absence (A) or presence (B) of IPTG for 24 h. The amount of NO (upper panels) and the expression of iNOS (lower panels) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Butyrate displays anti-inflammatory properties, and therefore its ability to increase the production of NO was a surprising result. We expanded our experiments and examined the regulation of NO production by HDAC inhibitors in two stromal cell types, macrophages and intestinal myofibroblasts. In contrast to intestinal epithelial cells, all HDACi decreased the production of NO in macrophages (Fig. 5A) and intestinal myofibroblasts (Fig. 5B) in response to treatment with IFNγ/LPS or IFNγ/TNF, consistent with their anti-inflammatory activity.FIGURE 5HDAC inhibitors interfere with NO production in macrophages (A) and intestinal myofibroblasts (B), but not in intestinal epithelial cells (C), and induce acetylation of histones H3 and H4 (D). A–C, treatments were as indicated, and NO was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, the amount of acetylated (ac) H3 and acetylated H4 was determined by immunoblotting using antibodies specifically recognizing acetylated histones H3 or H4.β-Actin was used to control for equal loading (ctrl).

We treated cells with IFNγ/LPS in the absence or presence of butyrate, SAHA, TSA, or apicidin. Consistent with data shown in Fig. 4, only butyrate was able to promote the production of NO in response to IFN/LPS (Fig. 5C). However, all HDAC inhibitors potently induced acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 5D), excluding the possibility that the un"
https://openalex.org/W2003992789,"The small GTPase Rac and the second messenger cGMP (guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) are critical regulators of diverse cell functions. When activated by extracellular signals via membrane signaling receptors, Rac executes its functions through engaging downstream effectors such as p21-activated kinase (PAK), a serine/threonine protein kinase. However, the molecular mechanism by which membrane signaling receptors regulate cGMP levels is not known. Here we have uncovered a signaling pathway linking Rac to the increase of cellular cGMP. We show that Rac uses PAK to directly activate transmembrane guanylyl cyclases (GCs), leading to increased cellular cGMP levels. This Rac/PAK/GC/cGMP pathway is involved in platelet-derived growth factor-induced fibroblast cell migration and lamellipodium formation. Our findings connect two important regulators of cellular physiological functions and provide a general mechanism for diverse receptors to modulate physiological responses through elevating cellular cGMP levels."

Earlier studies of this relationship demonstrated that oxidatively damaged synthetic lipid membranes promoted amyloidogenesis. The studies reported herein specify that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is produced in both synthetic lipids and human brain lipid extracts by oxidative lipid damage and that it can account for accelerated amyloidogenesis. Aβ promotes the copper-mediated generation of HNE from polyunsaturated lipids, and in turn, HNE covalently modifies the histidine side chains of Aβ. HNE-modified Aβ have an increased affinity for lipid membranes and an increased tendency to aggregate into amyloid fibrils. Thus, the prooxidant activity of Aβ leads to its own covalent modification and to accelerated amyloidogenesis.

This suggests that not only does Aβ promote lipid oxidation but that there may also be a mechanistic link between the lipid oxidation products formed during oxidative stress and Aβ misfolding (21Bieschke J.

Conversely, several lines of evidence suggest that Aβ contribute to oxidative stress. For example, the overexpression of Aβ in transgenic mice, in Caenorhabditis elegans, and in cell culture results in an increase in biomarkers of oxidative stress and in HNE production (28Wu Y. Luo Y.

In further investigations of the phenomena described below, we have verified that Aβ promote oxidative damage in human brain lipids, identified HNE as an oxidation product that by itself mimics the effect of oxidatively damaged membranes on the misfolding and aggregation of Aβ, identified the nature of the chemical reaction between HNE and Aβ, and demonstrated that HNE modification of Aβ promotes misfolding, aggregation, and membrane association. Most significantly, we have demonstrated that Aβ are covalently modified by the HNE that they help produce. This represents a positive feedforward mechanism involving oxidative damage and aggregation, in which Aβ promotes oxidative damage, and the products of oxidative damage promote fibril formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Synthetic 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC) in chloroform and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DMPC) powder were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). SAPC was packaged as 10-mg aliquots in sealed glass ampoules, under argon, stored at –80 °C, and lyophilized overnight prior to use. Excision grade trypsin and the endoproteinase Asp-N were obtained from Calbiochem. The trypsin stock concentration was 1 μg/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.5, and the Asp-N stock was 0.04 μg/μl in H2O. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and deuterated HNE (d3-HNE) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI.). 3,5-Di-tert-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), O-2,3,4,5,6-(pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide were obtained from Sigma. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) (>99% pure) were also obtained from Sigma. Water was purified through an Elix and MilliQ A10 synthesis water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). When needed, Cu(II) was added as CuSO4. Although several experiments were nominally free of Cu(II) ions, no special procedures were employed to remove trace amounts of Cu(II) except where noted.Lyophilized Aβ-(1–40) (Aβ40) and Aβ-(1–42) (Aβ42), both at >95% purity, were obtained from rPeptide (Athens, GA). Aβ-(1–11), Aβ-(10–20), and Aβ-(22–35) were obtained from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Aβ-(16–20) (KLVFF) (40Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) was obtained from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA). Before use, proteins were stored desiccated at –20 °C. Stock solutions at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were prepared by dissolving Aβ40 and Aβ42 in hexafluoroisopropanol, dissolving Aβ-(1–11), Aβ-(10–20), and Aβ-(16–20) in H2O, and dissolving Aβ-(22–35) in 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Hexafluoroisopropanol in the Aβ40 and Aβ42 stocks was evaporated immediately prior to use, and the proteins were redissolved in aqueous buffer at concentrations of 1–5 μm. Aβ-(1–28), Aβ-(1–11), Aβ-(10–20), and Aβ-(22–35) stocks were diluted into aqueous buffer at concentrations of 1–5 μm.Extraction of Brain Lipids—Frozen samples of normal human brain tissue from the temporal cortex were obtained from the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research Brain Bank, at the University of Pennsylvania. Lipids were extracted from ∼4-mg specimens using a modified Folch method, described below (41Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. 3rd Ed. Oily Press Lipid Library, Bridgewater, UK2003: 96-102Google Scholar). To minimize lipid oxidation during the extraction process, samples and aqueous solvents were purged with argon. The tissue was homogenized with an ultrasonic tip dismembranator in 10 ml/g methanol two times for 10 s on ice. 20 ml/g of chloroform was added, and the tissue was further sonicated two times for 10 s at room temperature. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was removed and kept. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml/g of chloroform:methanol (2:1), sonicated two times for 10 s on ice, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged as before. This supernatant was added to that of the first extract. The combined supernatants were sequentially washed with 0.88% potassium chloride and then methanol:saline (1:1) to remove non-lipid contaminants such as salts, amino acids, sugars, and urea. Following low speed centrifugation after the final wash, the lower organic layer was removed, lyophilized, and extruded into lipid vesicles as described below.Lipid Vesicle Preparation, Oxidation, and Analysis—SAPC, DMPC, and brain lipid extract vesicle suspensions were prepared by extrusion as described previously (32Murray I.V.J. Sindoni M.E. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to use, aliquots were mixed with 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the oxidation was initiated by the addition of ascorbate and Cu(II). Final concentrations in these suspensions were 10 μm SAPC and 25 μm DMPC or 10 μm brain lipid and 1 μm DMPC in a final volume of 400 μl. Where Aβ42 was used, it was premixed with Cu(II) and incubated for 30 min prior to the addition of other reactants as described previously (32Murray I.V.J. Sindoni M.E. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of SAPC content relative to a DMPC internal standard was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as described previously (32Murray I.V.J. Sindoni M.E. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).HNE Assay—HNE concentrations were determined by following HNE derivatization, organic extraction, and gas chromatography mass/spectrometry (GC/MS) similar to the method described previously (43Meagher E.A. Barry O.P. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The samples (400 μl) were analyzed 120 min after initiating oxidation. At this point 10 μm DTPA was added to stop the oxidation, 620 nm d3-HNE was added as an internal standard, and the HNE within the mixture was derivatized with 16 mm PFBHA for 1 h at room temperature. At this point, samples were extracted with 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1). Following low speed centrifugation, the lower organic layer was removed, passed through a 0.45-μm perfluorocarbon filter, and dried under nitrogen. The dried material was dissolved in 10 μl of pyridine and further derivatized by adding 10 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. After 10 min, the samples were dried, dissolved in 100 μl of dodecane, and assayed with the GC/MS in negative ion electron capture ionization mode using ammonia as the collision gas. A temperature program increasing at a rate of 30 °C/min from 190 to 250 °C was used to separate the derivatized d3-HNE and HNE on a DB 35-MS capillary GC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm coating). The ions monitored were m/z 286.3 for d3-HNE and m/z 283.3 for HNE. Peak areas quantified and expressed as 283.3:286.3 ratios.Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Aβ-HNE Adducts—Aβ40, Aβ42, or a mixture of Aβ-(1–11), Aβ-(10–20), and Aβ-(22–35) (5 μm each) were incubated with 3.8 mm HNE in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1–3 h at 37 °C. Prior to the addition of HNE, 2.5 mm DMPC lipid vesicles and 50 μm of the Aβ aggregation inhibitor Aβ-(16–20) were added to reduce aggregation of HNE-modified Aβ. The reaction of Aβ with HNE was terminated by addition of an equal volume of trifluoroacetic acid, and the samples were lyophilized. For samples subjected to Asp-N digestion, the reaction between HNE and Aβ was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution, pH 8.5. The reaction of any excess HNE with ammonium ions allowed for subsequent digestion of the Aβ-HNE adducts with Asp-N. 30 μl of the HNE/Aβ reaction mixture (∼1 μg of Aβ) was quenched with 30 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. 1 μl of Asp-N (0.04 μg) was added to 60 μl of this mixture (∼1 μg of Aβ) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The enzyme was inactivated by adding 60 μl of trifluoroacetic acid, and the sample was lyophilized. For MALDI-mass spectrometry, the Aβ-HNE adducts or Aβ-HNE adduct digests were dissolved in either 30 μl of a CHCA solution (5 mg of CHCA in 1 ml of 50% ACN with 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid) or sinapinic acid solution (10 mg sinapinic acid in 30% ACN with 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid). MALDI analysis was performed on TOF, Q-TOF, and TOF-Q-TOF instruments (Voyager DE, QStar, and model 4700 mass spectrometers, respectively; Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA).Immunoblot Analysis of Aβ and Aβ-HNE Adducts—Murine anti-His-HNE monoclonal antibody (HNEJ-2) was obtained from Genox Corp. (Baltimore, MD) (44Toyokuni S. Miyake N. Hiai H. Hagiwara M. Kawakishi S. Osawa T. Uchida K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 6E10 antibodies with specificity for Aβ residues 4–9 and 4G8 antibodies with specificity for residues 18–22 were obtained from Senetek (Maryland Heights, MO) by a kind gift from Domenico Pratico. Donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (SC2314) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Slot blots were used to detect the modification of Aβ by endogenous HNE generated during lipid oxidation. 200 μl of the Aβ oxidation reaction solution containing 4.5 μg of protein was mixed with 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. Samples were adsorbed onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes by slot blot microfiltration (Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus), and the wells were washed twice with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Membranes were blocked with a 5% solution of powdered fat-free milk (BLOTTO in TTBS; BioRad). The slot blot membranes were incubated overnight with 15 μg/ml of the antibody to HNE-modified histidine (HNE-J) at 4 °C. Following washes in TTBS and incubation of the membranes with secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h, the blot was incubated with Renaissance Luminol reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) was exposed to blots of synthetic lipids for 10 s and to blots of brain-derived lipids for 10 min. Quantification of the slot blot was performed by digitally scanning the X-Omat film and measuring film background and slot blot image densities with ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences).Western blots were used to detect Aβ and modification of Aβ with excesses of synthetic HNE. Both synthetic Aβ and HNE-modified Aβ were electrophoresed on a Tris-Tricine 10–20% polyacrylamide gel (72 ng of protein per well) and were transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were removed and washed with Tween in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS, 0.1% Tween 20 in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Aβ epitope retrieval was performed by boiling the unblocked membrane in PBS for 5 min. The membranes were immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with the HNEJ-2 antibody and Aβ antibodies (4G8, 1:200 and 6E10, 1:500). They were then washed, incubated with Luminol reagents, and exposed in the same manner as the slot blots.Congo Red (CR) Binding Assay—Aβ40 (10 μm) or Aβ42 (2 μm) was incubated at a 1:1 mole ratio with DMPC vesicles containing 3 mol % HNE in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at room temperature with continuous gentle agitation. The HNE concentrations were therefore 0.3 and 0.06 μm for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively. At intervals, aliquots of Aβ40 (112 μl) and Aβ42 (98 μl) were added to 28 or 42 μl, respectively, of 10 μm CR in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Fibril formation was assayed by measuring the ratio of sample absorption at 541 and 403 nm, which are the wavelengths of maximum difference and of an isosbestic point for fibril-bound CR and unbound CR, respectively.Infrared Spectroscopy—Polarized attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared (PATIR-FTIR) spectra were collected in rapid-scanning mode as 1024 co-added interferograms using a Bio-Rad FTS-60A spectrometer, a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector, an aluminum wire grid polarizer, a resolution of 2 cm–1, scanning speed of 20 kHz, triangular apodization, and one level of zero filling. Supported lipid monolayers, composed of either DMPC or brain lipid extract, were prepared in a Langmuir trough by applying ∼5 nmol of DMPC in a mixture of hexane:ethanol (9:1 by volume) to the surface of a subphase buffer. An enclosure around the Langmuir trough is filled with argon to avoid spontaneous air oxidation of lipids at the air-water interface, and all studies were performed at ∼21 °C. The subphase buffer contained 30 mm HEPES buffer in D2O at pD 7.4. When indicated, an aliquot of HNE in ethanol was lyophilized, resuspended in subphase buffer, and injected into the subphase before forming the monolayer. For DMPC membranes, 5 μl of 28 mm HNE stock was injected into 6 ml of subphase to yield an HNE concentration of 23 μm in the subphase. For brain lipid extracts, 10 μl of a 32 mm HNE stock solution was injected into a 2.5-ml subphase volume to yield an HNE concentration of 128 μm in the subphase.The monolayer was compressed to a surface pressure of 20 dynes/cm and applied onto a silane-treated germanium internal reflection crystal as described previously (45Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At this point, 5 μl of 28 mm HNE stock in ethanol was lyophilized, resuspended in the subphase buffer, and injected into the subphase. After collecting a base-line spectrum, 500 ng of samples of Aβ40 or Aβ42 in 30 mm NaDPO4 buffer, pD 11.9, were injected into the continuously stirred subphase to yield a protein concentration of 300 nm in experiments with DMPC and 230 nm in experiments with brain lipid extracts. Sample spectra were collected over 90 and 125 min, as indicated. A flat base-line correction was performed on sample spectra assuming zero absorbance at 1800 cm–1, but no water vapor subtraction or smoothing manipulations were performed. The spectra were fitted using IRfit, a procedure that fits a limited set of component bands simultaneously to several spectra with a minimum number of adjustable parameters (46Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, one simultaneous fit was performed on 12 spectra from three independent experiments. Only the spectra region between 1700 and 1600 cm–1 was fitted.RESULTSAβ42 and Brain Lipid Oxidation—The ability of Aβ42 to promote the oxidation of SAPC in human brain lipid extracts was measured using an MRM-LC/MS/MS assay as described previously (32Murray I.V.J. Sindoni M.E. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This assay is superior to many other assays of oxidative damage in that it yields precise and unambiguous quantitative information about oxidative loss of a specific substrate. Two adaptations of the conditions described previously for synthetic lipids were necessary for the application of this assay to human brain lipid extracts. First, brain vesicle suspensions with phosphate concentrations of 10 μm contained virtually no DMPC by MRM-LC/MS/MS. Therefore, 1 μm DMPC was added to all brain lipid vesicles as an internal standard. The SAPC concentration in these extracts was 0.34 ± 0.1 μm. Second, 1.5 mm MgSO4 was added to minimize sequestration of Cu(II) by anionic lipids.Ascorbate (50 μm) and Cu(II) (0.5 μm) reduced SAPC to 79 ± 19% of original levels after 120 min (Fig. 1). The addition of 5 μm Aβ42 decreased it to 38 ± 16% of its original level over the same time interval. These results are consistent with previously reported results from synthetic SAPC and DMPC vesicles, although the variability of the data was considerably larger in these human lipid extracts (32Murray I.V.J. Sindoni M.E. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 only represent four of the five extracts that were examined. Lipids from brain specimen 3 (Table 1) had only about half of the SAPC content as the other samples, and it was completely resistant to oxidation with or without Aβ42 present. Therefore, this sample was excluded from our analysis.TABLE 1Characteristics of frozen human brain tissues from which brain lipid vesicles were preparedCase no.DatePMIAge at death1200387321996992319936744199047251989232 Op"
https://openalex.org/W2065173488,"In addition to an anticoagulant activity, activated protein C (APC) also exhibits anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties may contribute to the beneficial effect of APC in treating severe sepsis patients. A higher incidence of bleeding because of its anticoagulant function has been found to be a major drawback of APC as an effective anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, we have prepared a protein C variant in which an engineered disulfide bond between two β-sheets stabilized the functionally critical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding 70-80 loop of the molecule. The 70-80 loop of this mutant no longer bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the activation of the mutant by thrombin was enhanced 60-80-fold independently of thrombomodulin. The anticoagulant activity of the activated protein C mutant was nearly eliminated as determined by a plasma-based clotting assay. However, the endothelial protein C receptor- and protease-activated receptor-1-dependent protective signaling properties of the mutant were minimally altered as determined by staurosporine-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, thrombin-induced endothelial cell permeability, and tumor necrosis-α-mediated neutrophil adhesion and migration assays. These results suggest that the mutant lost its ability to interact with the procoagulant cofactors but not with the protective signaling molecules; thus this mutant provides an important tool for <i>in vivo</i> studies to examine the role of anticoagulant <i>versus</i> anti-inflammatory function of activated protein C."

MK2a contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the p38 docking domain, whereas MK2b is a truncated variant of MK2 that lacks the NLS and p38 docking domain (13Zu Y.L. Wu F. Gilchrist A.

P38α forms a complex with MK2a even when the signaling pathway is not activated (16Lukas S.M. Kroe R.R. Wildeson J. Peet G.W. Frego L. Davidson W. Ingraham R.H. Pargellis C.A. Labadia M.E.

Upon activation of the p38α signaling cascade, p38α and MK2a phosphorylate their nuclear substrates before translocating to the cytoplasm. P38α does not have a nuclear export signal (NES) and cannot leave the nucleus by itself but rather needs to be associated with MK2a. The NES of MK2a facilitates the transfer of both kinases from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but only after MK2 has been phosphorylated by p38α (17Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). P38α phosphorylates MK2 at four sites, Thr25, Thr222, Ser272, and Thr334. The phosphorylation of Thr334 has been demonstrated to be critical for the nuclear export of the p38α-MK2 complex, whereas the kinase activity of MK2 is not (18Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr334 is believed to induce a conformational change in the complex prior to interaction with the leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export receptor (19Neininger A. Thielemann H. Gaestel M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this report, we present a structural analysis of the p38α-MK2 heterodimer. Crystal structures were determined for both the full-length p38α-MK2 heterodimer and the p38α-MK2 peptide (residues 370–400) complex. The structures reveal that the heterodimer conformation buries the substrate binding grooves of both p38α and MK2a, thus preventing both kinases from phosphorylating their respective substrates. The structure suggests that substrate phosphorylation is dependent on the phosphorylation states of both kinases and the heterodimer conformation. Protein Purification and Generation of Protein-Protein Complex—Human p38α was expressed and purified as described (20Wilson K.P. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Griffith J.P. Chen W. McCaffrey P.G. Chambers S.P. Su M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27696-27700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Full-length MK2 was expressed and purified according to the protocol used for N-terminal-truncated MK2 (residues 46–400) (21Meng W. Swenson L.L. Fitzgibbon M.J. Hayakawa K. Ter Haar E. Behrens A.E. Fulghum J.R. Lippke J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37401-37405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). P38α-MK2 heterodimer samples were prepared by incubating the purified proteins in equimolar concentrations (25 μm each) for 1 h on ice. The p38α-MK2 complex was separated from the monomers by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography using a linear NaCl gradient (100–500 mm), and the fractions containing the p38α-MK2 heterodimer were pooled. Finally, the buffer was exchanged into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and the protein sample was concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization set-ups. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown with the hanging drop method over a reservoir containing 3.75% polyethylene glycol 2000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Prior to the crystallization set up, 1-s-nonyl-1-β-d-thioglucoside (1× critical micelle concentration) and heptanetriol (1.5%) were added to the protein sample. The crystallization drop was prepared by mixing the reservoir solution with the protein solution in a 1:1 ratio. Crystals grew overnight and were typically harvested after 72 h. The crystals were transferred for 1 min to a solution consisting of reservoir solution and 30% glycerol before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection at beamline 5.0.2 and the Advanced Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, yielded a data set to 4.0 Å resolution. The crystals of full-length p38α-MK2 heterodimer belonged to spacegroup P41 with unit cell dimensions of 103.09 Å, 103.09 Å, 231.42 Å, 90.0°, 90.0°, 90.0°. Crystals of p38α-MK2 peptide (residues 370–400) were grown with the hanging drop method over a reservoir containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 250 mm sodium formate. The crystallization drop was prepared by mixing the protein solution with the reservoir solution in a 1:1 ratio. The crystals grew in a matter of hours and were harvested after 24 h. The crystals were transferred for 1 min to a solution consisting of reservoir solution and 30% glycerol before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data collected at beamline 5.0.2 of Advanced Light Source diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution. The crystals of the p38α-MK2 peptide complex belonged to spacegroup P31 with unit cell dimensions of 81.55 Å, 81.55 Å, 121.36 Å, 90.0°, 90.0°, 120.0°. The data sets were indexed and scaled with D*trek. The structure was determined by molecular replacement (MOLREP) (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using a peptide-bound monomer of p38α (1LEZ) (23Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) as the starting model. The asymmetric unit contained two p38α peptide complexes. The crystal structure was refined with multiple rounds of rebuilding and refinement using the refinement program (Auto)BUSTER (24Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The final model contained p38α residues 4–173 and 184–353 and MK2a peptide residues 370–393. The R and Rfree of the p38α-MK2 peptide complex were 0.23 and 0.26, respectively. p38α-MK2 peptide complex and the MK2 monomer (1KWP) were subsequently used to solve the structure of the full-length p38α-MK2 heterodimer. This structure was refined using only the rigid body protocol of BUSTER, and rebuilding was limited to cleaning up the Ramachandran plot and building of the MK2 activation loop. Phosphorylation of the p38α-MK2 Complex and Western Blot Analysis—Phosphorylation of the p38α-MK2 complex in the absence or presence of the p38α inhibitor SB203580 was performed by mixing the p38α-MK2 complex and MKK6-DD in a 100:1 molar ratio. The phosphorylation was carried out in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The complex was preincubated with inhibitor for 30 min on ice prior to phosphorylation. The reaction was started by addition of 2.5 mm ATP, and aliquots were taken at 0-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-min time intervals and quenched with SDS sample buffer. Western blots were performed using phospho-p38 MAP kinase and phospho-MK2 primary antibodies (1:5000 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) (1:10,000 dilution). Blots were scanned with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System at 700-nm wavelength, and the integrated intensities were analyzed to determine the time course of phosphorylation. General Description of the Structure—P38α and MK2 are both serine/threonine protein kinases. The structures of both P38α and MK2 have been determined previously as monomers (20Wilson K.P. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Griffith J.P. Chen W. McCaffrey P.G. Chambers S.P. Su M.S. J. Biol.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both structures have typical kinase folds with a small N-terminal domain dominated by β-strands, a larger C-terminal domain consisting of α-helices, and an ATP-binding site wedged between the two domains. The ATP-binding site is formed by the flexible glycine-rich loop, the hinge that connects the small N-terminal domain with the large α-helical domain, and the catalytic loop. The kinase domains of p38α and MK2 also have a substrate binding groove. This groove is at the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains and binds the part of the substrate protein that contains the phosphorylation site. Both p38α and MK2 have additional unique features. P38α has an extra docking groove for activating kinases, substrate kinases, and inactivating phosphatases. The docking groove contains the previously identified glutamate-aspartate (ED) and common docking (CD) regions and is conserved among other MAP kinases such as ERK1/2 and JNK, but not in other kinases. The kinase domain of MK2a is preceded by a proline-rich sequence (residues 1–44) that is not present in the published crystal structures (26Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Beyond the kinase domain it has a C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 338–400) that consists of helices αJ and αK and a long loop. The C-terminal regulatory domain contains an NES and the bipartite NLS (17Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The αK-helix occupied the MK2a substrate binding groove in an autoinhibitory conformation in one of the crystal structures of the monomer (21Meng W. Swenson L.L. Fitzgibbon M.J. Hayakawa K. Ter Haar E. Behrens A.E. Fulghum J.R. Lippke J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37401-37405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of a p38α-MK2 heterodimer that contains full-length p38α and MK2a, and we have also determined a complementary structure of p38a complexed with only the docking peptide (residues 370–400) of MK2. The p38α and MK2a molecules that make up the heterodimer are positioned “face to face” so that the ATP-binding sites of both kinases are at the heterodimer interface (Fig. 1). The C-terminal segment of MK2 (residues 368–400), which follows the αK-helix, wraps around p38α and inserts into the docking groove. Residues 382–390, including the C-terminal part of the NLS, fold into an α-helix (αL), which occupies the CD region of the p38α docking groove (Fig. 1). The αK-helix (residues 344–367) of the C-terminal regulatory domain is sandwiched between the p38α and MK2a kinase domains. It occupies the MK2a substrate binding groove, as it does in the crystals of the MK2a kinase domain alone (21Meng W. Swenson L.L. Fitzgibbon M.J. Hayakawa K. Ter Haar E. Behrens A.E. Fulghum J.R. Lippke J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37401-37405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of the αK-helix (Fig. 1, A and C) that contains the NES of MK2a (residues 356–365) is buried between the two kinase domains in close proximity to the p38α ATP-binding site. The MK2a activation loop (residues 207–233) also adapts to binding with p38α. In the monomer crystal forms, the activation loop is disordered (not shown), whereas in the p38α-MK2 heterodimer the complete MK2a activation loop backbone can be traced through the electron density map, as it is stabilized by interactions with the α-helical domain of p38α (supplemental Fig. S1). The phosphorylation site in the MK2a activation loop (Thr222) does not make contact with p38α. The C-terminal regulatory domain and the activation loop of MK2a form most of the contacts between p38α and MK2a in the heterodimer (Fig. 2). The C-terminal regulatory domain contacts both the N-terminal β-strand and the α-helical domains of p38α. The C-terminal end of the αK-helix (residue Glu354) touches the tip of the glycine-rich loop (Ala34) and the β1L0-β2L0 loop, but only Glu354 (MK2a) and Ala34 (p38α) are less than 4 Å apart. The C-terminal loop of the C-terminal regulatory domain occupies the docking groove of p38α and is responsible for the high affinity interaction between p38a and MK2a (16Lukas S.M. Kroe R.R. Wildeson J. Peet G.W. Frego L. Davidson W. Ingraham R.H. Pargellis C.A. Labadia M.E. Werneburg B.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9950-9960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This interaction will be discussed in more detail below. The activation loop of MK2a makes contacts with p38α in the heterodimer and a neighboring MK2a molecule. The conformation of the C-terminal portion of the activation loop (residues 232–237) is stabilized by the loop between the αD- and αE-helices in p38α, but only the backbone density is visible in the electrodensity map. There is an additional contact between the MK2a loop of αH and αI and the p38α loop between αF and αG. The solvent-accessible surface area buried in the heterodimer is 1373 Å2 for MK2a and 1477 Å2 for p38α (Fig. 2). The p38α activation loop contains two phosphorylation sites (Thr180 and Tyr182) that when modified stabilize its activated conformation and open the substrate binding groove. In the heterodimer described here, p38α is not phosphorylated and the p38α activation loop is largely disordered. Residues 174–184 were omitted from the model due to lack of electron density. This disordered region was in close proximity to a disordered loop region from MK2a (residues 265–283). The MK2a residues 264–281 are included in a published, mercury-derivatized crystal structure (1KWP) (21Meng W. Swenson L.L. Fitzgibbon M.J. Hayakawa K. Ter Haar E. Behrens A.E. Fulghum J.R. Lippke J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37401-37405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but their positions are not compatible with the p38α-MK2 heterodimer conformation. The P38α Docking Groove—P38α and the other MAP kinases have a docking groove for binding with their activating kinases, inactivating phosphatases, and substrates (23Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The docking groove is not to be confused with the substrate binding groove at which the phosphorylation reaction takes place. The groove was first identified by mutational studies as two separate regions (Fig. 3), the CD region and the ED region (27Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The CD region is part of a shallow groove formed by the acidic residues Asp313, Asp316, Glu81, and the aromatic residues Phe129 and Tyr311. The latter is part of a deeper groove formed by residues 159–163 (159-VNEDCE-163) at one side and residues Gln120, His126, and Phe129 at the opposite side. The C-terminal end of the regulatory domain of MK2a (residues 369–384) binds in the docking groove of p38α and makes key interactions with the ED and CD regions (Fig. 4). These interactions are a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts. Earlier studies identified the MAP kinase binding motif as rich in positively charged residues, and because the ED and CD regions of p38α are mainly negatively charged, it was assumed that these motifs contact each other. Our structure shows that this is indeed the case. The docking groove interactions are consistent with the binding studies of Lukas et al. (16Lukas S.M. Kroe R.R. Wildeson J. Peet G.W. Frego L. Davidson W. Ingraham R.H. Pargellis C.A. Labadia M.E. Werneburg B.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9950-9960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using surface plasmon resonance, stopped flow fluorescence, and isothermal titration calorimetry, they observed that the docking groove interactions contribute most to the formation of the heterodimer. They also noticed that the binding of the MK2a to p38α depends on the ionic strength of the buffer, consistent with the many electrostatic interactions between p38α and MK2a that we see in the heterodimer. The sequence of the MAP kinase binding motif is well conserved among proteins that bind p38α, ERK, or JNK. The main difference is the location of the motif with respect to the catalytic domain. In activating kinases and inactivating phosphatases, the sequences of the MAP kinase binding motif come before the catalytic domains, whereas for the substrate kinases such as MK2a the binding motif comes after the kinase domain. Two crystal structures of p38α in complex with short peptides have been determined previously. One peptide is derived from the p38α activator MKK3b, and the second peptide is from the transcription activator MEF2c (23Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These short peptides also bind in the p38α docking groove, but the major difference with the p38α-MK2 complex is the reversed direction of the peptide backbones (Fig. 4). The peptides employed in these studies have very little sequence homology with each other or with MK2a, but the interactions between the peptide side chains and p38α at the ED domain are conserved despite the reversed direction of the peptide backbone. The residue pattern is similar but reversed: hydrophobic, polar, hydrophobic, polar. For instance, at the position of MK2a residue Ile370, both peptides also have an isoleucine with the side chains pointing in the same direction. Lys371 overlaps with an arginine of the MKK3b peptide and both side chains extend into the solvent, away from p38α. The peptides also have a hydrophobic residue at the position of Ile372 that is buried by the loop of p38α consisting of residues 158–363, and a polar residue that contacts Asp161. Constitutively Active MKK6-DD Phosphorylates the p38a-MK2 Heterodimer—The ATP-binding sites and substrate binding grooves of p38α and MK2a are at the interface of the heterodimer, making them inaccessible to substrates. Thus, the conformation of the heterodimer seen here does not represent a p38α phosphorylation complex but rather a conformation for which the catalytic activity of p38α and MK2a are each sequestered from potential substrates. It probably represents the unactivated complex and reflects the state of both kinases when the cell does not need their phosphorylation capacity, i.e. when the cell does not receive any stress signals. As soon as stress signals do arrive at the cell, however, we expect the p38α-MK2 heterodimer to alter such that both kinases are accessible to their substrates. The p38α-MK2 heterodimer is a stable, high affinity complex with a Kd of 6 nm (16Lukas S.M. Kroe R.R. Wildeson J. Peet G.W. Frego L. Davidson W. Ingraham R.H. Pargellis C.A. Labadia M.E. Werneburg B.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9950-9960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When the p38 signaling pathway is activated due to cell stress, the activating kinases MKK6 or MKK3 phosphorylate p38α. If the p38α-MK2 heterodimer is the preferred conformation for both kinases, then p38α and MK2a should still readily be phosphorylated when activated MKK6 is added to the complex. According to what is known about the p38α signaling pathway, activated MKK6 will phosphorylate and activate p38α and p38α will subsequently phosphorylate MK2a. MKK6-DD is a constitutively activated form of MKK6 in which the two aspartates mimic the phosphorylated residues (Ser207 and Thr211) (37Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and is a very efficient activator of p38α. When a small amount of MKK6-DD (1:100 molar ratio) was added to the p38α-MK2 complex, both p38α and MK2a became phosphorylated over time (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of p38α was followed by Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated Thr180 and phosphorylated Tyr182. Phosphorylation of MK2a was followed with two commercially available antibodies that detect phosphorylated Thr222 and phosphorylated Thr334. The Western blots showed that when MKK6-DD was added to the p38α-MK2 heterodimer the level of phosphorylated p38α increased steadily during the 60-min time course (Fig. 5A). At the starting point, t = 0, no detectible levels of phosphorylated p38α were visible, but within 5 min a clear band of phosphorylated p38α became apparent and the levels increased until the end of the time course. The MK2a of the heterodimer also became phosphorylated in at least two sites (Fig. 5B). MK2a has four phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylated MK2a migrates with a slightly lower mobility than unphosphorylated MK2a. At t = 0, a small amount of Thr334-phosphorylated MK2a was visible but migrated with higher mobility, suggesting that the protein was not fully phosphorylated. Indeed, Thr222 was not phosphorylated at t = 0. The levels of phosphorylated Thr334 in MK2a increased more than 80-fold, whereas the levels of phosphorylated Thr222 increased >20-fold during the course of the experiment. In summary, addition of constitutively activated MKK6 leads to phosphorylation at both p38α and MK2a in the p38α-MK2 heterodimer, and we conclude that both kinases can readily become activated when activated MKK6 is present. The signaling pathway of p38α and MK2a has been studied extensively, and it is commonly acknowledged that MKK6 phosphorylates p38α and p38α phosphorylates MK2a. Because we have shown that adding MKK6-DD to the p38α-MK2 heterodimer leads to the phosphorylation of p38α and MK2a, we wanted to determine whether the phosphorylation was sequential, i.e. whether MKK6-DD phosphorylated p38α and p38α in turn phosphorylated MK2a. SB203580 is a potent and selective inhibitor of p38α that has been used frequently to study the p38α signaling pathway (38Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3155) Google Scholar, 39Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 40Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). When SB203580 was added to the p38α-MK2 heterodimer 30 min in advance of the addition of MKK6-DD, phosphorylation of MK2a was inhibited (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation of Thr334 did not exceed the t = 0 levels in the first 20 min of the experiment, and after 60 min the levels of Thr334-phosphorylated MK2a were less than a quarter of that observed in the absence of inhibitor. The amount of phosphorylated Thr222 was also reduced in the presence of SB203580. On the other hand, the activity of MKK6-DD was not affected by the addition of SB203580, as the levels of phosphorylated p38α did not change (data not shown); however, MKK6DD does not readily phosphorylate MK2 (Fig. 5C). Thus, when MKK6-DD is added to the p38α-MK2 heterodimer in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, the hierarchy in the signaling cascade is maintained without the help of scaffolding proteins. We have determined the crystal structure of the p38α-MK2 complex. This is the first structure of two full-length kinases associated together in a complex. Because the resolution of the full-length p38α-MK2 complex was only 4 Å, we also determined the structure of the p38α-MK2 peptide complex, and together with the previously reported structures of the MK2a monomer we could visualize the docking groove interactions between p38α and MK2a. We believe that the crystal structure represents the conformation of p38α and MK2a as it is present in the nucleus when the cell is devoid of stress. Although MK2a is a phosphorylation substrate of p38α, the conformation of the heterodimer does not represent the phosphorylation reaction but rather prevents both p38α and MK2a from phosphorylating their substrates in the absence of stress signals. Tight regulation of the p38α signal transduction pathways is important for the proper functioning of a cell, as activation of this pathway increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and induces cell cycle arrest. There is evidence that the conformations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated heterodimers differ. The Kd of the unphosphorylated p38α-MK2 heterodimer is 6 nm, whereas the Kd of the phosphorylated heterodimer is 10 times weaker (16Lukas S.M. Kroe R.R. Wildeson J. Peet G.W. Frego L. Davidson W. Ingraham R.H. Pargellis C.A. Labadia M.E. Werneburg B.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9950-9960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A conformational change has also been observed in MK2a with fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis and is triggered by the phosphorylation of Thr334 (MK2a) (19Neininger A. Thielemann H. Gaestel M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The conformational change likely makes the NES accessible, thus allowing the p38α-MK2a heterodimer to be transported to the cytoplasm. The heterodimer structure presented here is not the translocation complex in which the two kinases migrate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The MK2a NES is buried between the two kinase domains of the heterodimer and not accessible to carrier proteins. The NLS is part of the p38α binding motif and is anchored in the CD domain of the docking groove and therefore not accessible to facilitate transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Cell stress activates the p38α-MK2 signaling pathway, which must have major consequences for the heterodimer. Both kinases will be phosphorylated, p38α first by MKK3 or MKK6 and MK2a by p38α. Both kinases will in turn phosphorylate transcription factors in the nucleus, move to the cytoplasm, and phosphorylate other substrates. Eventually the kinases will be dephosphorylated by a MAP kinase phosphatase. We have shown here that MK2a binds p38α in the docking groove. All other proteins that interact with p38α also bind in this groove (27Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 30Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Tanoue T.

These proteins can be p38α substrates such as MEF2c, PRAK, and MK2a, p38α activators MKK3 and MKK6, or they can be the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP7 that inactivates p38α. These substrates compete for the same binding site in p38α and consequently determine the stress response and subcellular location of p38α (Fig. 4). We have also shown that constitutively active MKK6 can phosphorylate the p38α in the heterodimer and that p38α in turn phosphorylates MK2a. We propose the following model (Fig. 6) for events that take place when the p38α signaling pathway is activated and reaches the nucleus. In the nucleus of a normal cell, p38α and MK2a are in the heterodimeric state described here (Fig. 6A). Activated MKK3/6 displaces MK2a from p38α to phosphorylate and activate p38α (Fig. 6B). Activated p38α now has three options depending on the protein it will bind next. (i) It can bind one of its nuclear substrates such as transcription factor MEF2c (Fig. 6C) and activate gene expression in response to cell stress. The binding reaction is a typical catalytic reaction in which the kinase has much lower affinity for the product than for the substrate. Once phosphorylated, the transcription factor is released and p38α can bind a different protein. (ii) p38α encounters a MAP kinase phosphatase (Fig. 6E). This will result in dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38α. The inactivated p38α can again form a heterodimer with MK2a and this heterodimer will remain in the nucleus (Fig. 6G). (iii) Activated p38α binds and activates MK2a at its phosphorylation sites, including Thr334 (Fig. 6D). MK2a will undergo a conformational change and expose its nuclear export signal. The activated heterodimer of p38α and MK2a will then exit the nucleus and phosphorylate substrates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6F). Most of the p38α and MK2a will eventually return to the nucleus. It is not clear whether they return as a heterodimer or as separate monomers but overexpressed p38α is mostly found in the nucleus (17Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that p38α can reach the nucleus without the aid of MK2a. The bipartite NLS of MK2a is also the p38α docking motif, suggesting that binding by p38α prevents the binding of importin-α and therefore translocation to the nucleus. As a monomer, the MK2a NLS is completely exposed and importin-α could bind MK2a and transport it together with importin-β to the nucleus. The p38α signaling pathway is a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapy. Inhibition of the p38α signaling pathway reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and p38 inhibitors have shown beneficial effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7Force T. Kuida K. Namchuk M. Parang K. Kyriakis J.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1196-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study we have provided evidence that p38α forms a stable heterodimer with MK2a that is likely the preferred conformation of both kinases in the nucleus of a cell that is not receiving stress signals. The crystal structures suggest aspects of the p38α signaling pathway that could be helpful for developing novel anti-inflammatory therapies.

SRG3, a murine homologue of yeast SWI3, Drosophila MOIRA, and human BAF155, is a core component of the murine SWI/SNF complex required for the regulation of transcriptional processes associated with development, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. Here we report that SRG3 interacts directly with other components of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex such as SNF5, BRG1, and BAF60a. The SWIRM domain and the SANT domain were required for SRG3-SNF5 and SRG3-BRG1 interactions, respectively. In addition, SRG3 stabilized SNF5, BRG1, and BAF60a by attenuating their proteasomal degradation, suggesting its general role in the stabilization of the SWI/SNF complex. Such a stabilization effect of SRG3 was not only observed in the in vitro cell system, but also in cells isolated from SRG3 transgenic mice or knock-out mice haploinsufficient for the Srg3 gene.

Taken together, these results suggest the critical role of SRG3 in the post-transcriptional stabilization of the major components of the SWI/SNF complex. The mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are evolutionarily conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mobilize nucleosomes and remodel chromatin structure (1Muchardt C.

These complexes play important roles in transcriptional regulation, thereby controlling diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and tumorigenesis (3Roberts C.W.

The mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are multisubunit complexes that consist of invariant core components and variable components (7Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The subunit diversity of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes suggests that different complexes might have tissue-specific roles during development (8Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R.

The core components of the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are BRG1 or hBRM, SNF5/INI1/BAF47, BAF155/SRG3, and BAF170 (9Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). BRG1 and BRM are DNA-dependent ATPase homologous to yeast SWI2/SNF2. Biochemical experiments have shown that although BRG1 or BRM alone can remodel nucleosomal arrays, the addition of other core components (BAF155, BAF170, and SNF5) to BRG1 stimulates the remodeling activity of BRG1 at a rate that is comparable with the entire complex in vitro (10Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Human SNF5 was initially identified by the yeast two-hybrid system through its interaction with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase (11Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It was shown that human SNF5 interacts with c-Myc, thereby enhancing c-Myc-mediated transactivation by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to the E-box (12Cheng S.W. Davies K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J. Yu J. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human SNF5 is known as a tumor suppressor in atypical teratoid and malignant rhabdoid tumors and the majority of these tumors have deletion or point mutations in SNF5 leading to disruption of normal function of SNF5 (13Biegel J.A.

Srg3 (Swi3-related gene), a murine homologue of yeast Swi3, Drosophila Moira, and human Baf155, was initially isolated as a gene highly expressed in the thymus but at a low level in the peripheral lymphoid organ (15Jeon S.H.

We found that the expression level of SRG3 is down-regulated after positive selection of developing thymocytes and this is critical in determining glucocorticoid sensitivity in T cells (15Jeon S.H.

Furthermore, T cell receptor and Notch1 signaling inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of developing thymocytes by down-regulating the SRG3 expression (20Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H.

Whereas the function of BRG1 and SNF5 as a component of the SWI/SNF complex has been revealed (10Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Cheng S.W. Davies K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J. Yu J. Kalpana G.V. Nat.

Nature. 1999; 399: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), the function of SRG3 as a component of the SWI/SNF complex has not yet known. SRG3 contains several highly conserved domains such as the SANT (SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR, and TFIIIB) domain, the SWIRM (SWI3, RSC8, and MOIRA) domain, and the leucine-zipper motif. It was reported that the SANT domain of MOIRA is important to the interaction with BRM (23Crosby M.A. Miller C. Alon T. Watson K.L. Verrijzer C.P. Goldman-Levi R. Zak N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the leucine-zipper motif of BAF155 is required for interaction with BAF57 (24Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The direct interactions between SRG3 homologues and other components of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported. In yeast, SWI3 interacts directly with SWI2/SNF2 and SNF11 (25Treich I. Cairns B.R. de los Santos T. Brewster E. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between components of the RSC complex, a SWI/SNF-related complex, have also been reported. RSC8, STH1, and RSC6 components of the RSC complex are homologues of SRG3, BRG1, and BAF60a, respectively (26Mohrmann L. Verrijzer C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). RSC8 interacts directly with STH1 and RSC6 and can self-associate to form a dimer through the leucine-zipper motif (27Treich I. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Treich I. Ho L. Carlson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These characteristics in the structure of the SRG3 protein and protein-protein interactions between SRG3 homologues and other components suggest a possibility that SRG3 may interact directly with other components of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The free subunits of the multisubunit complex tend to be degraded by protein quality control systems to ensure proper stoichiometry if they are not assembled into complex (29Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the stability of components of the SWI/SNF complex is mutually dependent. The stability of SWI3 is decreased in the absence of SWI1 and SWI2 (30Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and BAF155 stabilizes the BAF57 protein (24Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the protein-protein interactions among the components of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex and control of the stability of the complex are poorly understood. Here we describe the critical role of SRG3 in protein stability, overall stoichiometry, and subcellular localization of the SWI/SNF complex. Reagents, Antibodies, and Plasmids—Cycloheximide (Sigma) and MG132 (Calbiochem) were purchased commercially. Antibodies to the Myc epitope (9E10) and HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; TBP, TATA-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NLC, normal littermate control; NLS, nuclear localization signal; AB, activation domain; BD, binding domain; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. epitope (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies to the FLAG epitope (M2 or polyclonal) and β-actin (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to BAF60a, BAF47, and TBP (TATA-binding protein) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences, and Santa Cruz, respectively. Antisera against SRG3 and BRG1 were raised from rabbits in our laboratory. For construction of plasmids used in yeast two-hybrid assay, baits were cloned in-frame into the pGBKT7 vector and preys were cloned in-frame into the pACT2 vector (Clontech). The cDNA fragments encoding amino acid 183-541 of wild-type SRG3 or the SWIRM domain mutants of SRG3 were inserted in-frame into the pGEX-4T-2 vector for the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The mouse cDNAs for mouse Srg3, Brg1, or Snf5 were subcloned into pCAGGSBS using EcoRI for the expression of Myc epitope- or FLAG epitope-tagged proteins. pCAGGSBS expression vector was constructed by inserting the 2.3-kb fragment of the pCAGGS vector containing the cytomegalovirus immediateearly enhancer linked to the chicken β-actin promoter and rabbit β-globin poly(A) into the SalI and PstI sites of the pBluescript vector. All cDNAs and mutants of Srg3 were generated by PCR amplification with proper primers. The PCR products were verified by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast transformation was performed using the lithium acetate method. Yeast strain AH109 (genotype: MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, MEL1, GAL2UASGAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) was co-transformed with plasmids encoding GAL4BD and GAL4AD fusion proteins and the interactions of these recombinant proteins were tested by evaluating the ability of co-transformants to grow on SD-agar plates without Leu, Trp, His, and Ade. The interactions between SRG3 mutants and SNF5 were confirmed by β-galactosidase assay as described previously (31Song M.S. Chang J.S. Song S.J. Yang T.H. Lee H. Lim D.S. J. Biol.

In Vitro Binding Assay—All recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified as previously described (15Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the in vitro binding assay, cells were lysed with buffer X (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche). Extracts were incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) preincubated with purified GST fusion proteins. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed with buffer X and the eluted proteins were used for immunoblot analysis and Coomassie Blue stain. Mice, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 and Srg3 heterozygote (+/-) knock-out mice were previously described (17Kim J.K. Huh S.O. Choi H. Lee K.S. Shin D. Lee C.

Mice were bred and maintained under pathogen-free conditions, and experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (WelGENE). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (WelGENE). Typical transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions and cells were incubated for 48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in buffer X and immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies as previously described (19Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H.

For immunoblot analysis, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels (7.5 or 10%) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Densitometric band intensity was determined using Gel-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics). RNA Interference in Mammalian Cells—siRNAs with the following sense and antisense sequences were used: Brg1, 5′-CCGUCAAGGUGAAGAUCAATT-3′ (sense), 5′-UUGAUCUUCACCUUGACGGTT-3′ (antisense); Srg3, 5′-CAUCCUGGUUUGAUUAUAATT-3′ (sense), 5′-UUAUAAUCAAACCAGGAUGTT-3′ (antisense); GFP, 5′-GUUCAGCGUGUCCGGCGAGTT-3′ (sense), 5′-CUCGCCGGACACGCUGAACTT-3′ (antisense). All siRNAs were purchased from Samchully Pharm. NIH3T3 cells were plated in a 60-mm dish, 2 × 105 cells per well, 18-24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 200 μm siRNAs by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (20Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21903-21915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with specific murine Brg1, Srg3, and Snf5 probes. The 1-kb Brg1 probe or the 1.2-kb Snf5 probe was generated by random priming using the EcoRI fragment of the FLAG-BRG1 or FLAG-SNF5 expression vectors, respectively, and the specific probe for Srg3 was generated as described previously (20Ko M.

Immunofluorescence Analysis—COS-1 cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 2% normal donkey serum for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated at room temperature with primary and secondary antibodies for 3 and 1 h, respectively. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Myc (1:200), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:200), TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescent images were obtained by confocal microscopy (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). SRG3 Interacts Directly with Major Components of the SWI/SNF Complex—To study the role of SRG3 in the protein-protein interactions among the components of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, we analyzed the direct interactions between SRG3 and other major components of the SWI/SNF complex by yeast two-hybrid assay. Plasmid encoding SRG3 protein fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD) was co-transformed into yeast with plasmid encoding SNF5, BRG1, or BAF60a fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD). The interactions of these recombinant proteins were tested by evaluating the ability of co-transformants to grow on SD agar plates without Leu, Trp, His, and Ade. As shown in Table 1, SRG3 interacted directly with SNF5, BRG1, and BAF60a. BAF155 was also shown to interact with BAF57 and BAF60a by in vitro binding assays (24Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Hsiao P.W. Fryer C.J. Trotter K.W. Wang W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell.

The co-immunoprecipitations between SRG3 and other components (SNF5, BAF60a, and BAF57) of the SWI/SNF complex are also carried out to result in the same conclusions (Fig. 5H). All of these results suggest that SRG3 may function as a scaffold protein that interacts directly with other major components including SNF5, BRG1, BAF60a, and BAF57.TABLE 1Interactions between SRG3 and other major components of the SWI/SNF complexGAL4BD fusionsGAL4AD fusionsInteractiona+, interacting protein; −, non-interacting protein.GAL4BDGAL4AD−GAL4BD-SRG3GAL4AD−GAL4BD-SRG3GAL4AD-SNF5+GAL4BD-SRG3GAL4AD-BRG1+GAL4BD-SRG3GAL4AD-BAF60a+a +, interacting protein; −, non-interacting protein. Open table in a new tab Next, we identified the domain requirements for the SRG3-SNF5, SRG3-BRG1, and SRG3-BAF60a interactions. A series of deletion mutants of SRG3 were generated and analyzed by a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1). The N-terminal region of SRG3 (SRG3-N) spanning amino acid residues 1-710 bound to SNF5, but not the C-terminal region of SRG3 (SRG3-C) spanning amino acid residues 543-1100 (Fig. 1A). The minimal region required for SNF5 binding was deduced as amino acid residues 437-536, where amino acid residues 531-536 were especially critical. Intriguingly, this region contains the SWIRM domain (amino acid residues 446-534), which is required for binding to other proteins (33Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 34Da G. Lenkart J. Zhao K. Shiekhattar R. Cairns B.R. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2057-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among the fragments tested, the shortest SNF5-binding region of SRG3 (SRG3-(400-594)) includes the entire SWIRM domain and the deletion of this domain disrupted the interaction with SNF5. Likewise, deletion of the SWIRM domain significantly reduced SRG3-BAF60a interaction, although deletion of the upstream region of the SWIRM domain was also required for complete disruption of this interaction (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the SWIRM domain is important for SRG3-SNF5 and SRG3-BAF60a interactions, and the upstream region of the SWIRM domain may also function as BAF60a-binding region. The domain requirements for the SRG3-BRG1 interaction were also analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, SRG3-N and SRG3-C, which have an intact SANT domain interacted with BRG1, but the deletion of this domain disrupted SRG3-BRG1 interaction. The shortest BRG1-binding region of SRG3 (SRG3-(613-661)) also includes the entire SANT domain. These results show that the SANT domain is necessary and sufficient for SRG3-BRG1 interaction. Taken together, SRG3 has specific domains that are important for direct interactions between SRG3 and major components of the SWI/SNF complex, which enables SRG3 to function as a scaffold protein of the SWI/SNF complex (Fig. 1D). The Amino Acid Residues Leu-531 and Asn-533 on the SWIRM Domain Are Important for the SRG3-SNF5 Interaction—We further examined which residues of the SWIRM domain are crucial for the SRG3-SNF5 interaction. Because differential binding properties were observed between SRG3-(1-536) and SRG3-(1-530), and amino acid residues 531-536 of SRG3 are highly conserved in the SWIRM domains of SRG3 homologues (35Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Genome Biol. 2002; 3RESEARCH0039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a deletion mutant of SRG3 at positions 531-536 and substitution mutants were constructed and interactions of these SRG3 mutants analyzed with SNF5 (Fig. 2A). A deletion mutant of SRG3 (SRG3-N-(Δ531-536)) did not interact with SNF5, showing that the region of amino acid residues 531-536 is necessary for the SRG3-SNF5 interaction. Substitution of Val-532 with alanine (V532A) had little effect on SRG3-SNF5 interaction, but mutations on Leu-531 (L531A) or Asn-533 (N533A) significantly reduced this interaction. Moreover, double substitutions on Leu-531 and Asn-533 (L531A/N533A) completely disrupted SRG3-SNF5 interaction. Such results were reconfirmed by the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 2C). The amino acid residue 183-541 region of wild-type SRG3 or SWIRM domain mutant SRG3 was fused to GST (Fig. 2B). FLAG-SNF5 protein was expressed in COS-1 cells and examined for interaction with GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 2C, the SNF5 protein could bind to wild-type SRG3 (GST-SRG3), but not to the deletion mutant (GST-Δ531-536) nor the double point mutant (GST-L531A/N533A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SRG3 interacts directly with SNF5 through the SWIRM domain and amino acid residues 531-536 (especially Leu-531 and Asn-533) are important for this interaction. SRG3 Regulates the Protein Levels of Major Components of the SWI/SNF Complex—SRG3 interacts directly with SNF5, BRG1, and BAF60a, thus, there is a possibility that SRG3 regulates their protein stability. To test this possibility, we analyzed the effect of SRG3 expression on the protein level of SNF5, BRG1, and BAF60a. First, we co-transfected a fixed amount of FLAG-SNF5 expression vector with increasing amounts of Myc-SRG3 expression vector and determined the protein level of SNF5 by immunoblot analysis. We found that the protein level of SNF5 is up-regulated by SRG3 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that SNF5 expression is dependent on the expression level of SRG3 (Fig. 3A). The mRNA level of Snf5 was not significantly changed in each transfection, as shown by Northern blot analysis that it is likely that the SRG3 effect on the protein level of SNF5 does not occur at the transcriptional level. Similar results were obtained with BRG1 and BAF60a, showing that the protein levels of BRG1 and BAF60a were also augmented by SRG3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). These results imply that SRG3 regulates the protein levels of major components of the SWI/SNF complex. Next, Myc-SRG3 or its Myc-tagged deletion mutants (Myc-SRG3-N, Myc-SRG3-C) were overexpressed with FLAG-SNF5 in COS-1 cells and the protein level of SNF5 determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3D, wild-type SRG3 and the N-terminal region of SRG3 were able to up-regulate the SNF5 protein level, but the C-terminal region of SRG3 could not. The protein level of SNF5 observed in Myc-SRG3-C was similar to the level of SNF5 alone (data not shown). The expression level of each SRG3 protein was similar and the mRNA level of Snf5 showed no difference (Fig. 3D, lower panel). To test whether wild-type SRG3 and the N-terminal region of SRG3 interact with SNF5 in vivo, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3E, wild-type SRG3 and the N-terminal region of SRG3 were co-immunoprecipitated with SNF5, but the C-terminal region of SRG3 was not. These results suggest that the SRG3-SNF5 interaction contributes to the up-regulated protein level of SNF5. We further investigate whether the protein level of SNF5 is dependent on direct interaction with SRG3 through the SWIRM domain. Strong expression of the SNF5 protein was observed only with co-expression of wild-type SRG3, which is capable of directly binding to SNF5 (Fig. 3F). In contrast, low expressions of SNF5 protein were yielded upon the co-expression of the SWIRM domain mutants of SRG3 (Δ531-536, L531A/N533A) that do not bind to SNF5. Again, such differences in the expressions of the SNF5 protein occurred at the post-transcriptional level. These results suggest that SRG3 regulates the protein level of SNF5 by direct interaction through the SWIRM domain. SRG3 Stabilizes Major Components of the SWI/SNF Complex by Attenuating Their Proteasomal Degradation—Because the mRNA levels of Snf5 and Brg1 were not affected by the expression of SRG3, it is unlikely that SRG3 controls the transcription of Snf5 or Brg1 from their expression vector. To investigate the role of SRG3 on the degradation of major components of the SWI/SNF complex, we examined the degradation kinetics of exogenous SNF5 protein in the absence of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 4A). COS-1 cells transfected with the FLAG-SNF5 expression vector were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. The relative protein level of SNF5 present at each time point was determined by immunoblot analysis. Rapid degradation of the SNF5 protein was observed upon treatment with cycloheximide. Thus, we examined whether the degradation of the SNF5 protein is proteasome-mediated. COS-1 cells transfected with the FLAG-SNF5 expression vector were treated with cycloheximide plus MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor, for the same time point as described above, and the relative protein level of SNF5 present at each time point was determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, degradation of exogenous SNF5 protein was inhibited by treatment with MG132. Similar results were obtained with BRG1 and BAF60a, although relatively slow degradation of the BRG1 protein was observed upon treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that degradation of major components of the SWI/SNF complex is mediated by the proteasome pathway. The proteasome-mediated degradation of SNF5 was also observed in the absence of cycloheximide. Inhibition of the proteasome pathway by MG132 leads to a rapid increase of the SNF5 protein, showing again that degradation of the SNF5 protein is mediated by the proteasome pathway (Fig. 4D). Proteins that are degraded by the proteasome are first marked by polyubiquitination to specific lysine residues (36Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar, 37Goldberg A.L. Science. 1995; 268: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To assess whether SNF5 undergoes covalent ubiquitination, COS-1 cells co-transfected with FLAG-SNF5 and HA-tagged ubi"
https://openalex.org/W1968604533,"Catecholamine stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors (βAR) in adipocytes activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase to promote liberation of fatty acids as a fuel source. The adipocyte β3AR also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1 and -2 through direct recruitment and activation of Src kinase. This pathway together with cAMP-dependent protein kinase contributes to maximal β3AR-stimulated lipolysis. In a search for other molecules that might associate with β3AR upon agonist stimulation, we identified vimentin using a proteomics approach. Immunoprecipitation of β3AR from adipocytes in the absence or presence of the β3AR agonist CL316,243, followed by Western blotting for vimentin confirmed this specific interaction. Since vimentin has also been identified on lipid droplets, the functional consequences of blocking the expression or structural integrity of vimentin intermediate filaments on β3AR regulation of ERK activation and lipolysis was assessed. Following disruption of intermediate filaments with β,β′-iminodipropionitrile, as confirmed by confocal microscopy, β3AR-stimulated ERK activation was blocked, and lipolysis was reduced by more than 40%. Independently, depletion of vimentin by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) completely inhibited β3AR-mediated ERK activation and significantly reduced lipolysis. By contrast, disruption of actin-containing microfilaments by cytochalasin D or microtubules by nocodazole had no effect on either lipolysis or ERK activation. These results indicate that vimentin plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathway from β3AR to the activation ERK and its contribution to lipolysis.

Of the three βAR subtypes, β1AR is found predominantly in heart and brain (1Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar); β2AR is widely expressed (2Dixon R.A. Kobilka B.K. Strader D.J. Benovic J.L. Dohlman H.G. Frielle T. Bolanowski M.A. Bennett C.D. Rands E. Diehl R.E. Mum-ford R.A. Slater E.E. Sigal I.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Strader C.D. Nature. 1986; 321: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar); β3AR is mainly found in adipose tissue (3Emorine L.J. Marullo S. Briend-Sutren M.M. Patey G. Tate K. Delavier-Klutchko C. Strosberg A.D. Science. 1989; 245: 1118-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). All three βAR subtypes, which are expressed together in adipocytes, couple to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs (4Kobilka B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), leading in turn to elevations in intracellular cAMP and activation of PKA. However, there is evidence that these receptors can also couple to Gi (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 6Martin N.P.

In the case of β1AR and β2AR, coupling to Gi is dependent on the initial coupling to Gs, PKA activation, and receptor phosphorylation (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 6Martin N.P. Whalen E.J. Zamah M.A. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1397-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For β3AR, it is unique in that it can couple interchangeably to both Gs and Gi without a requirement for receptor phosphorylation (7Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W.

Several Gi-coupled receptors stimulate ERK activation by utilizing Src kinase recruitment to multiprotein complexes that include the receptor. β3AR activates ERK by a mechanism that depends on a series of proline-rich motifs in its third intracellular domain and carboxyl terminus that are conserved among the mammalian homologues (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is through these regions that the Src kinase is recruited to the β3AR. This interaction triggers Src catalytic activity, which together are necessary steps in ERK activation (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M.

One of the functional consequences of this β3AR to ERK cascade in adipocytes is lipolysis (10Greenberg A.S. Shen W.J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S.C. Roth R.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), wherein ERK functions together with PKA to produce maximal lipolytic capacity (11Robidoux J. Kumar N.

In an effort to further understand this mechanism of β3AR signal transduction, we have extended our previous findings to search for other protein molecules in addition to Src that interact with β3AR. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), we have identified vimentin as one such molecule that associates with β3AR upon agonist stimulation. Vimentin-type intermediate filaments (IFs), characteristic of many vertebrate cells of mesenchymal origin, have been shown to undergo reorganization during the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (12Franke W.W. Hergt M. Grund C. Cell. 1987; 49: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). During this reorganization, vimentin filaments surround the nascent lipid droplet, forming a cage-like structure around them. Similar structures of vimentin filaments also have been reported in cholesterol loaded macrophages (13McGookey D.J. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions (14Amanuma K. Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Ohkuma S. Takano T. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1986; 410: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that disruption of vimentin IFs during adipose differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells inhibits lipid droplet accumulation (15Lieber J.G. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3047-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that recruitment of vimentin IFs to the β3AR depends on the proline motifs in the β3AR and Src kinase activity. We show that acutely disrupting vimentin IFs filaments in differentiated adipocytes resulted in greater than 40% reduction in lipolysis stimulated by the selective β3AR agonist CL316,243 (CL). Activation of ERK MAP kinase by CL was also blocked by disruption of vimentin IFs. These results indicate that in mature differentiated adipocytes vimentin and its filament assembly plays a significant role in the signal transduction pathway from β3AR to ERK activation and lipolysis.

Image acquisition was performed on a Typhoon 9410 variable-mode imager. Lipolysis—Differentiated T1/2 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were gently washed with PBS and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA at 37 °C for 3 h before being replaced with fresh buffer containing 1% IDPN, nocodazole, or cytochalasin D for 1 h.

Isoelectric focusing was carried out using the ZOOM IPGRunner system (Invitrogen) and the Bio-Rad 3,000-V power supply (Bio-Rad) using the following voltage step protocol: 200 V for 25 min, 450 V for 20 min, 750 V for 20 min, and 2,000 V for 90 min. For the second dimension, focused immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) in the presence of NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) for 15 min and further incubated in LDS sample buffer in the presence of 125 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min. The strips were placed on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels. The gels were stained for protein using SYPRO Ruby staining. Proteomic analysis was performed at the Michael Hooker University of North Carolina/Duke Proteomics Center by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) method according to their standard methods (16Parker C. Warren M. Loiselle D. Dicheva N. Scarlett C. Borchers C. Patterson C. Cyr D. Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol. 301. Humana Press, Patterson, NJ2005: 117-151Google Scholar). Inhibition of Vimentin Expression by shRNA—The shRNA-containing virus was generated by the BLOCK-iT lentiviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the short hairpin DNA oligonucleotides (vimentin oligonucleotide 1, CACCGCCAAGATCTGCTCAATGTTCGAAAACATTGAGCAGATCTTGG; vimentin oligonucleotide 2, AAAACCAAGATCTGCTCAATGTTTTCGAACATTGAGCAGATCTTGGC; scramble oligonucleotide 1, CACCGTCCCACATTGATACTGTACGAATACAGTATCAATGTGGGAC; scramble oligonucleotide 2, AAAAGTCCCACATTGATACTGTATTCGTACAGTATC) were synthesized and subcloned into a pENTR/U6 vector to yield pENTR/U6-vimentin. The lentiviral vector, pLenti6-si-vim, was generated by left-right recombination between the pENTR/U6 entry construct and pLenti6/BLOCK-iT-DEST. These cloned constructs were cotransfected with virus packaging vectors into HEK 293FT cells to produce virus. Two days later, supernatants of cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 5 h at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in PBS. The differentiated T1/2 cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 280. Cells were used after 48 h to measure vimentin expression, ERK activation, and lipolysis as described above. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Differentiated T1/2 cells were replated on Lab-Tek chamber slides coated with poly-l-lysine and allowed to attach and recover for overnight. Cells were incubated for 1 h with the indicated cytoskeletal disrupting agent. The coverslips were then rinsed with cytoskeletal buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose) at room temperature and simultaneously fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold methanol (-20 °C) for 10 min. Cells were rinsed again with cytoskeletal buffer, then placed in blocking solution (1% BSA and 2% fetal bovine serum in Tris-buffered saline, TBS), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with antibodies as indicated. The cells were washed with TBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed three times in PBS and mounted in an anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were observed, and images were acquired with an LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63× oil immersion lens. Two independent experiments were performed, and 10 or more fields per sample were analyzed in each experiment. Association of Vimentin with β3-Adrenergic Receptor—We previously reported that in response to agonist, β3AR in adipocytes recruits Src to a series of intracellular proline-rich motifs in the receptor, which leads to activation of ERK1/2 (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One of the functional consequences of this β3AR-dependent Src activation of ERK1/2 is augmentation of lipolysis (11Robidoux J. Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since there are multiple proline motifs in the intracellular domains, which appear to cooperate with one another to activate ERK1/2, we set out to determine whether other molecules are brought to this complex. Differentiated T1/2 adipocytes were transfected with HA-tagged β3AR and treated with the selective β3AR agonist CL. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, samples were separated on two-dimensional gel and were silver-stained. There were two categories of spots that were of interest. In the first, four spots (one major and three minor) significantly increased in the intensity in response to CL. In the second group, two minor spots appeared only upon CL stimulation. The major spot, which had increased by 2.5-fold with CL stimulation, was identified as vimentin by ESI-MS/MS. The minor spots had too little mass to be identified at this time; however, vimentin was pursued further as it also has been shown to be present on lipid droplets (17Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Since the ability of β3AR to recruit Src and activate ERK is dependent on its proline-rich motifs, we wanted to test whether vimentin is also part of this structural complex. Cells were transfected or not with HA-tagged wild type β3AR or a mutant β3AR in which the C-terminal PXXP sequences had been mutated (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations with anti-HA antibody were performed using whole cell lysates. The samples were separated on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-vimentin antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 1, by virtue of its abundance some vimentin was recovered even from mock-transfected “control” cells. Therefore, all results were corrected for this background level. Even though we routinely observed 35-40% transfection efficiency (determined by green fluorescent protein-expressing vector) there was a 23.7 ± 6.1 (n = 4)-fold increase in the association of vimentin with the HA-tagged wild type β3AR in response to CL treatment (Fig. 1A). However, there was no such association of vimentin with the COOH-terminal PXXP mutated β3AR. Nor was there any increase in cells expressing HA-tagged β2AR in response to the selective β2AR agonist salbutamol. As shown in Fig. 1B, pretreatment of the cells with a selective inhibitor of Src kinase (PP2) before addition of CL blocked the recruitment of vimentin to the wild type β3AR. These results are consistent with our earlier observation that Src is recruited to the β3AR in its catalytically active form (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and supports a role for Src activation in the association of vimentin with β3AR. Role of Vimentin Filament Assembly in Lipolysis—Vimentin has been identified as one of many molecules associated with lipid droplets in adipocytes (17Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We have also shown recently that the β3AR-Src-ERK1/2 activation process contributes to a significant fraction of lipolysis (11Robidoux J. Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured lipolysis following stimulation with CL in cells treated or not with IDPN, which selectively disrupts vimentin intermediate filaments (18Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CL-stimulated lipolysis was reduced by more than 40% in T1/2 cell treated with IDPN as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A), while there were no significant differences in basal levels of lipolysis. Moreover, disruption of vimentin filament assembly did not significantly affect Fsk-stimulated lipolysis, as it is primarily mediated by PKA activation. Disruption of other cytoskeletal components, actin and tubulin, by cytochalasin D and nocodazole, respectively, had no effect on CL-stimulated lipolysis. Similar results were seen in another model of adipocytes, 3T3-L1 (Fig. 2B). The specificity of IDPN in our hands to collapse vimentin filament assembly was confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). There was no effect of IDPN on actin and tubulin assembly (data not shown). Also shown in Fig. 3 is that neither cytochalasin D nor nocodazole disrupted vimentin assembly (nocodazole did lead to some reorganization of vimentin filament assembly as reported by others (19Molero J.C. Whitehead J.P. Meerloo T. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43829-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Together these results strongly suggest that vimentin filament assembly is a necessary component contributing to lipolysis mediated by β3AR.FIGURE 3Confocal microscopy of vimentin filaments treated with various cytoskeletal disrupting agents. Differentiated T1/2 cells were treated with indicated cytoskeletal disrupting agents for 1 h before fixation in methanol (-20 °C). The cells were stained with monoclonal antibody against vimentin and were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, untreated; IDPN, cells pretreated with imniodipropionitrile; Cyto, cells pretreated with cytochalasin D; Noco, cells pretreated with nocodazole.

Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since we observed that disruption of vimentin intermediate filaments resulted in substantially decreased CL-stimulated lipolysis, we measured the effect of vimentin disruption on PKA activation. There was no change in CL-mediated PKA activation in cells treated with IDPN as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4A). Another kinase pathway in adipocytes, downstream of PKA, is p38 MAPK and is also activated by βARs (20Cao W. Medvedev A.V. Daniel K.W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27077-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This pathway was also unaffected by vimentin disruption (Fig. 4B) (although basal activity was increased by nocodazole and cytochalasin D, as these compounds are known activators of this stress kinase (21Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). It was possible that a decrease in lipolysis observed by disruption of vimentin filaments was due to the interference in association of vimentin with other proteins at the lipid droplet. However, disruption of vimentin filaments with IDPN essentially blocked CL-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, removal of IDPN and provision of fresh medium for 3 h allowed restoration of ERK activation by CL (Fig. 4, C and D). This effect of IDPN on ERK activation by CL was deemed specific based on the following observation. In cells in which actin or tubulin assembly had been disrupted there was no effect on ERK activation by CL (Fig. 4, C and D), although there seemed to be a small but insignificant increase in basal ERK phosphorylation. These results were also strongly supported by lipolysis studies in which specific inhibitors of either the PKA (H89) or ERK (PD098059) pathway were used in T1/2 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). In IDPN-treated cells, H89 completely blocked glycerol release in response to CL, whereas with PD098059 there was no further effect. However, pretreatment of control cells (i.e. not treated with IDPN) with H89 showed a residual response to the lipolytic action of CL that is due to the ERK pathway as previously reported (11Robidoux J. Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A second approach was employed to test the requirement for vimentin in the β3AR-dependent activation of ERK and lipolysis. Using a previously published sequence for knockdown of vimentin by siRNA duplex (22Ermakova S. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Kang B.S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16882-16890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we confirmed its efficacy in proliferating T1/2 cells (Fig. 6A); however, the efficiency was less than 10% once the cells were fully differentiated. Therefore this sequence was used to produce a lentiviral vector for delivery of shRNA to differentiated cells. Infection of differentiated T1/2 cells with pLenti6-si-vim suppressed vimentin expression by more than 60% (61 ± 7.4%, n = 3, p < 0.01), whereas pLenti6-scramble had no effect (Fig. 6B). Using this protocol, pLenti6-si-vim in differentiated T1/2 cells resulted in 21% decrease in CL-stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 6C) and total inhibition of ERK activation (Fig. 6D). Since the small molecule IDPN, which can act on 100% of the cells to disrupt vimentin filament integrity, decreased CL-stimulated lipolysis by 40%, this 21% decrease by the shRNA approach is consistent with the fact that vimentin expression was reduced by approximately half (60%). These results confirm that vimentin is required for CL-stimulated both ERK activation and lipolysis. In this study we have shown that vimentin associates with β3AR in adipocytes upon agonist activation of the receptor, and intact vimentin filament assembly plays a critical role in the β3AR-stimulated increase in ERK activity and lipolysis. This work arose from our earlier observation that the β3AR directly recruits Src to its intracellular domains through conserved proline-rich motifs in the receptor, and this interaction is necessary for the activation of ERK (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have also shown that one of the roles of ERK in the adipocyte following β3AR stimulation is to contribute to the maximal lipolytic response (11Robidoux J. Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, neither the target(s) of ERK that is/are phosphorylated to promote lipolysis nor the detailed mechanism of ERK activation by β3AR is understood. A related unresolved issue is the apparent requirement for multiple proline-rich PXXP binding motifs in the receptor: even though there are three to four PXXP motifs in all the species homologues of the β3AR, disrupting just one or two is sufficient to abrogate signaling to ERK (9Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that additional molecules are required in this complex and/or the stoichiometry and binding of Src at multiple motifs is necessary for proper signal transduction. We have identified one of these molecules recruited to the β3AR-Src complex as vimentin. Vimentin is a vital component of the IF: a structure shown to be involved in many cellular signaling pathways (23Helfand B.T. Chou Y.H. Shumaker D.K. Goldman R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 568-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In adipocytes vimentin IFs have been shown to be required for their differentiation from preadipocytes into mature lipid-laden cells (12Franke W.W. Hergt M. Grund C. Cell. 1987; 49: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). During adipocyte differentiation vimentin IFs undergo reorganization to form a cage-like structure around the lipid droplets (12Franke W.W. Hergt M. Grund C. Cell. 1987; 49: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, compensatory mechanisms must also exist, because in mice lacking vimentin, adipocyte differentiation evidently proceeds normally (24Colucci-Guyon E. Portier M.M. Dunia I. Paulin D. Pournin S. Babinet C. Cell. 1994; 79: 679-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In our studies the interaction of β3AR with vimentin was dependent on Src kinase activity, although it is not clear how the β3AR-vimentin interaction is modulated by Src. Nevertheless, there is precedent for interaction between vimentin and Src family kinases. For example, it was previously demonstrated by Valgeirsdottir et al. (25Valgeirsdottir S. Claesson-Welsh L. Bongcam-Rudloff E. Hellman U. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that tyrosine phosphorylation of vimentin in response to PDGF requires activated Src, while in microglial cells the Src family member Yes was shown to colocalize with vimentin (26Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study (11Robidoux J. Kumar N. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F. Medvedev A.V. Cao W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37794-37802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we have shown that lipolysis stimulated by β3AR is largely dependent on PKA activation (required for hormone-sensitive lipase phosphorylation and translocation) with a lesser contribution from the ERK pathway (target(s) still unidentified). This role of ERK in the regulation of lipolysis is supported by our current results with the identification of vimentin as a necessary interacting partner of β3AR, thus providing one component linking β3AR to ERK and lipolysis. We show that by interfering either qualitatively (by IDPN) or quantitatively (by shRNA) with vimentin IF integrity, these maneuvers led to inhibition of both β3AR agonist-stimulated ERK activation and lipolysis. β3AR-stimulated PKA activity and hormone-sensitive lipase translocation were unaffected (data not shown). A role for vimentin IFs in lipolysis may not be totally unexpected, since a previous proteomic analysis of lipid droplet associated proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that vimentin is present on lipid droplets (17Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of vimentin filament assembly prevented accumulation of lipid droplets in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (15Lieber J.G. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3047-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this latter case there was also increased turnover of lipids, indicating that vimentin filaments are involved not only in lipid storage but are also required for the accessibility of these lipids to be acted upon by lipases. Our results here support this idea. Although it is presently unclear how vimentin IFs are recruited to β3AR, or how they lead to ERK activation and lipolysis in adipocytes, at least one other connection between vimentin and ERK has been observed. Recently it was shown that newly synthesized vimentin interacts with ERK MAP kinase at sites of axon injury in dorsal root ganglion neurons, and in this situation vimentin is instrumental in signal propagation by serving as a scaffold to connect activated impotin β and dynein (27Perlson E. Hanz S. Ben-Yaakov K. Segal-Ruder Y. Seger R. Fainzilber M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For our part, we also do not rule out other effects of vimentin on lipolysis, since being present on the lipid droplet, it may be associated with other proteins that are themselves the target of ERK or of other signaling pathways. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the association of vimentin with the agonist activated β3AR. We also show that vimentin filament assembly is necessary for β3AR-mediated ERK activation and lipolysis. This interaction of vimentin seems to be specific to β3AR, as we could not observe any significant interaction with another βAR that is capable of activating ERK, the β2AR. These results place vimentin in a position as a structural link between the β3AR-Src complex and ERK activation. As such, future mechanistic studies of the interactions between the β3AR and vimentin filaments in adipocytes may provide new insight into the formation of signaling complexes for the spatiotemporal integration of external stimuli.

This has been presumed to indicate the mechanism of action of methotrexate and 6-MP. Although controversial, there are increasingly compelling data that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) may be an etiological agent in some or all of IBD. We hypothesized that the clinical efficacy of methotrexate and 6-MP in IBD may be to simply inhibit the growth of MAP.The effect on MAP growth kinetics by methotrexate and 6-MP were evaluated in cell culture of two strains each of MAP and M. avium using a radiometric ((14)CO(2) BACTEC detection system that quantifies mycobacterial growth as arbitrary ""growth index units"" (GI). Efficacy data are presented as ""percent decrease in cumulative GI"" (% -DeltacGI).The positive control antibiotic (clarithromycin) has >or=85% -DeltacGI at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml. The negative control (ampicillin) has minimal inhibition at 64 microg/ml. MAP ATCC 19698 shows >or=80% -DeltacGI for both agents by 4 microg/ml. With the other three isolates, although more effective than ampicillin, 6-MP is consistently less effective than methotrexate.We show that methotrexate and 6-MP inhibit MAP growth in vitro. Each of the four isolates manifests different % -DeltacGI. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical improvement in patients with IBD treated with methotrexate and 6-MP could be due to treating a MAP infection. The decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, thought to be the primary mechanism of action, may simply be a normal, secondary, physiological response. We conclude that henceforth, in clinical studies that evaluate the effect of anti-MAP agents in IBD, the use of methotrexate and 6-MP should be excluded from any control groups."

Vernos I. Surrey T. Giannis A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). There is stereo-selectivity, since the (S)-enantiomer of monastrol binds preferentially to Eg5 (5Maliga Z.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas the (R)-enantiomer shows significantly reduced inhibitory activity. The crystal structures of the Eg5 motor domain alone (19Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and in complex with (S)-monastrol (20Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A.

In addition, the crystal structure allows rational design of new monastrol analogues that might result in improved effectiveness of the inhibitor compared with the original compound. There are several good reasons to further develop more potent monastrol-based compounds as drug candidates. First, the parallel synthesis of new analogues using combinatorial chemistry is easily accessible through the one-pot Biginelli three-component cyclocondensation (21Kappe C.O. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Second a highly enantioselective Biginelli asymmetric synthesis for dihydropyrimidines (DHPMs) is now available (22Huang Y. Yang F. Zhu C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16386-16387Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) allowing the enriched synthesis of one enantiomer over the other. We have recently prepared a library of about 140 monastrol analogues (DHPM core structure) using combinatorial chemistry techniques for structure-activity-relationship studies and tested their inhibition of Eg5 ATPase activity as well as induction of monoastral spindles in HeLa cells, which led to the identification of more potent monastrol analogues (23Lopez, R., Rousseau, B., Kozielski, F., Skoufias, D. A., and DeBonis, S. (March 15, 2005) FR Patent 05-02518 and World Patent WO2006097617 (September 21, 2006)Google Scholar). 3R. Lopez, H. Comas, F. Trucco, B. Rousseau, R.-L. Indorato, S. DeBonis, I. Garcia-Saez, D. A. Skoufias, and F. Kozielski, manuscript in preparation. Surprisingly, a subgroup of compounds effectively inhibited Eg5, although the inhibition could not be explained by modeling these compounds into the inhibitor-binding pocket, based on the current model of the Eg5-(S)-monastrol complex. The first likely possibility is that the structure of the inhibitor-binding pocket changes to better accommodate the inhibitor analogue. A second possibility is that the conformational change induced by the presence of a phenyl group in this new Eg5 inhibitor analogue imposes a different positioning with respect to monastrol to be accommodated by the Eg5 inhibitor-binding pocket. Here we report the crystal structure of human Eg5 in complex with a new monastrol analogue named (R)-mon-97, belonging to the new potent ketodihydropyrimidine family (Fig. 1B). We show that while monastrol binds to Eg5 as the (S)-enantiomer, it is the (R)-enantiomer of mon-97 that binds to the same site. Surprisingly the structure of the inhibitor-binding pocket as well as the overall Eg5 structure is very similar to that of the Eg5-(S)-monastrol complex. These results show that rational drug design of monastrol-type analogues that is only based on the structure of the Eg5-(S)-monastrol complex should therefore be taken cautiously, since some important active analogues might simply be missed. Future work on developing more effective inhibitor analogues should certainly consider these results broadening the possibilities to find even more potent DHPM-based inhibitors. Protein Expression and Purification—The motor domain of human Eg5 (residues 1–386) was initially cloned into the His tag vector pET28a, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen) and purified with a 5-ml HisTrap HP column using standard fast protein liquid chromatography procedures (Amersham Biosciences). Failure to crystallize the His-tagged protein led us to modify the original vector by site-directed mutagenesis to shorten the protein construct to 368 residues (19Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and to remove the expression of the histidine tag by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following forward and reverse primers: Eg5-1, 5′-CCT GAA GTG AAT CAG AAA TGA ACC AAA AAA GCT TTG ATT AAG G-3′; Eg5-2, 5′-C CTT AAT CAA AGC TTT TTT GGT TCA TTT CTG ATT CAC TTC AGG-3′. The modified plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)Star (Invitrogen). Further purification steps follow the protocol described by Turner et al. (19Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Three liters of bacterial culture were grown at 37 °C in 2× yeast tryptone medium to an A600 nm of approximately 0.7 and induced overnight with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (MP Biomedicals). Harvested cells were suspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with ½ tablet of a mixture of protein inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 2.5 mg of lysozyme and disrupted by four cycles of freeze-thaw. After bacterial lysis, 1 mm DNase I and 10 mm MgCl2 were added and incubated in gentle centrifugal mixing during 1 h at 4°C (all the following steps were performed at this temperature). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h, and the supernatant was mixed with a pre-equilibrated ion-exchange cellulose DE-52 (Whatman) in buffer A (approximately 5 ml of equilibrated resin for 6 ml of supernatant). Resin and sample were mixed gently for a few minutes, loaded onto a plastic syringe, and the flow-through and two column washes were collected. The pooled sample was applied to a 5-ml SP-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted by using a KCl gradient (buffer B: buffer A + 250 mm KCl) at approximately 140 mm. Eg5 fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and diluted with buffer A to 50 mm KCl. The protein sample was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 5-ml Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer A, and fractions were collected immediately and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified Eg5 (about 24 mg of protein) was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –20 °C. Crystallization of the Eg5-(R)-mon97 Complex—Crystals obtained with mon-97 appeared after 5 days in hanging drops by mixing 1 μl of protein (7.7 mg/ml), 1-μl reservoir containing 20% polyethylene glycol-4000, 0.2 m K2HPO4, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.6–6.5, 0.2 μl of 5 mm racemic mon-97, and 0.2 μl of 64 mm AMPPCP, in VDX plates (Hampton Research) at 4 °C. To obtain good diffracting crystals, each condition was repeated two to four times due to a problem of reproducibility that could not be solved by macro- or microseeding. A nice looking plate obtained with the described conditions at pH 5.6 was immersed in cryoprotectant solution (24% polyethylene glycol-4000, 0.2 m K2HPO4, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.6, 20% glycerol), flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen for further crystallographic analysis, since crystals were not stable in the crystallization drops. Under these conditions, the complex crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 69.37 Å, b = 79.90 Å, c = 159.86 Å and 2 molecules per asymmetric unit. Crystals of native Eg51–368 (7.7 mg/ml) were obtained with 18% polyethylene glycol-3350, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.6, 0.2 m NaNO3, and 8% erythritol, after 2 days using vapor diffusion by hanging drops (1 μl of protein and a 1-μl reservoir) in 24-well VDX plates at 20 °C. The crystal tested was monoclinic P21 with unit cell parameters a = 52.36 Å, b = 77.76 Å, c = 93.06 Å and β = 93.76° and 2 molecules per asymmetric unit as described previously (19Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement— The Eg5-mon-97 crystals were measured on beamline BM30A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were processed at 2.7 Å with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Since this crystal had the same space group and similar unit cell parameters as the crystal of Eg5 in complex with (S)-monastrol (Ref. 20Yan Y. Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar; PDB code 1Q0B), this structure was used without inhibitor, Mg2+ADP, or solvent molecules, as a model for rigid-body refinement using RIGID from CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The refinement yielded a Rfree of 31.2%. An initial electron density map inspection showed the presence of Mg2+ADP in the nucleotide-binding site plus an extra density around loop L5 that indicated the presence of the inhibitor. The model was rebuilt manually using TURBO-FRODO (27Roussel A. Cambillau C. In silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 81. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and refined by successive runs of density modification by solvent flipping, energy minimization, and B-factor refinement. Mg2+ADP was included in early stages of refinement, and water molecules were added progressively. The (R)-mon-97 structure deduced from the x-ray data of the corresponding R,R-diastereoisomer (see below) was fitted in the last steps of refinement into the electron density. The final Rworking and Rfree for the Eg5-(R)-mon-97 model were 23.4 and 28.1%, respectively; more data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The quality of the final model was assessed with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R. MacArthur M Moss D Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 91-97Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT IF (29Vriend G. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The Ramachandran plot showed 90.3% of residues in most favored regions and 9.7% in additional allowed regions. A data set of native Eg5 to 2.5 Å was collected on ID14-3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), to have an in-house reference model in case modifications in purification, etc. would occur and affect the Eg5 structure in comparison with the formerly published structure. We also wanted to be able to compare the electron densities of native and inhibitor-bound structures and not only rely on the structure coordinates. Data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and SCALA from CCP4 (31Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) gave a final model with Rworking 23.01% and Rfree 26.9%. After confirming that our in-house structure and PDB code 1II6 were almost identical, we used PDB code 1II6 for structural superpositions, since this structure was reported to have a higher resolution (2.1 Å). Structural superpositions were calculated using the server SuperPose Version 1.0 (33Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (Web Server issue): W590-W594Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Preparation of mon-97—Racemic mon-97 was prepared using a modification of the procedure by Dondoni et al. (34Dondoni A. Massi A. Sabbatini S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 5913-5916Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To a stirred solution of 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3.7 g, 30 mmol, 1.0 eq) we added benzoylacetone (4.9 g, 30 mmol, 1.0 eq), methylthiourea (0.93 g, 90 mmol, 3.0 eq), and Ytterbium triflate (0.93 g, 1.5 mmol, 0.05 eq). The mixture was refluxed overnight and evaporated. Ethyl acetate was added, and the insoluble material was removed by filtration. The filtrate was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude solid obtained was crystallized from a ether:hexane mixture and yielded 4.25 g (42%) of mon-97 as a white solid. Separation of mon-97 Enantiomers by Chiral HPLC—The two enantiomers were separated by chiral high performance liquid chromatography (ChiralPack AS, 250 × 4.6 mm), elution hexane/ethanol, 86:14 v/v; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; detection, 220 nm. Preparation of the Mosher Ester—2.4 g of imidazole (34.7 mmol, 2.2 eq) and 2.6 g of tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (17.4 mmol, 1.1 eq) were added to a stirred solution of 5.35 g mon-97 (15.8 mmol, 1.0 eq) in 50 ml of dry N,N-dimethylformamide and stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with water and extracted with Et2O(4 × 50 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with a CuSO4 solution (2 × 50 ml) followed by brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporated under vacuum. Purification by crystallization with hexane:ether yielded 2.6 g (37%) of pure silylated aldehyde as a pale yellow solid. 164 mg (0.36 mmol) of this silylated compound in 2 ml CH2Cl2 was added to a mixture of (R)-(+)-Mosher acid (127 mg, 0.54 mmol, dicyclohehylcarbodiimide (134 mg, 0.65 mmol), and dimethylaminopyridine (16 mg, 0.13 mmol)) in 4 ml of dry dichloromethane. The resulting mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The precipitate obtained by adding 25 ml of diethylether was removed by filtration. The filtrate was washed successively with diluted aqueous HCl solution (2 × 10 ml), water (15 ml), aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (2 × 10 ml), and finally brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum. Purification of the crude product by flash chromatography on silica gel (eluent Et2O-hexane 1:2 to 1:1) gave 45 mg of each of the two diastereoisomers (less polar, Rf = 0.67, ether:hexane 3:7) and (more polar, Rf = 0.48, ether:hexane 3:7) with a total yield of 38%. X-ray analysis showed the R,R configuration for the more polar diastereoisomer. Confirmation of Absolute Configuration of the More Active Enantiomer—A 10-ml solution containing 35 mg of the (R,R)-diastereoisomer (0.05 mmol) in 10% KOH in H2O:MeOH (3:1) was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After solvent evaporation, 10 ml of ethyl acetate was added, and the mixture was neutralized with diluted HCl and then washed with water. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuum. Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel (Et2O-hexane 1:1) yielded 3.2 mg (17%, white solid) of enantiopure (R)-mon-97. Chiral HPLC analysis showed a retention time (tR = 39.6 min) identical to the (+)-enantiomer resulting from chiral HPLC resolution. The crystallographic data for (R)-mon-97 coupled with the (R)-Mosher acid were collected at 100 K on a Nonius Kappa-CCD area detector diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97 and subsequent Fourier-difference synthesis and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97 (35Sheldrick G.M. SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97. University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany1997Google Scholar). Absorption effects were corrected with SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms were introduced at calculated positions and were treated as riding atoms with an isotropic displacement parameter equal to 1.2 (CH) or 1.5 (CH3) times that of the parent atom. Thanks to the presence of anomalous scatterers, the absolute configuration could be determined. 2788 Friedel pairs were measured, and the correct enantiomorph was determined from the value of the Flack parameter, refined together with all other parameters, –0.10(8) (Ref. 36Flack H.D.

https://openalex.org/W2033662995,"CD34 glycoprotein in human hematopoiesis is expressed on a subset of progenitor cells capable of self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and hematopoietic reconstitution. Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional phosphoprotein of growing eukaryotic cells, involved in regulation of gene transcription, chromatin remodeling, and RNA metabolism, whose transcripts are enriched in murine hematopoietic stem cells, as opposed to differentiated tissue. Here we show that, in human CD34-positive hematopoietic cells, nucleolin activates endogenous CD34 and Bcl-2 gene expression, and cell surface CD34 protein expression is thereby enhanced by nucleolin. Nucleolin-mediated activation of CD34 gene transcription results from direct sequence-specific interactions with the CD34 promoter region. Nucleolin expression prevails in CD34-positive cells mobilized into peripheral blood (PB), as opposed to CD34-negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Therefore, in intact CD34-positive mobilized PB cells, a recruitment of nucleolin to the CD34 promoter region takes place, accompanied by nucleosomal determinants of gene activity, which are absent from the CD34 promoter region in CD34-negative PBMCs. Our data show that nucleolin acts as a component of the gene regulation program of CD34-positive hematopoietic cells and provide further insights into processes by which human CD34-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are maintained.

Here we analyzed a possible involvement of nucleolin in gene regulation in human CD34-positive hematopoietic cells. We show that nucleolin activates endogenous CD34 and Bcl-2 gene expression, and cell surface CD34 protein expression is thereby enhanced by nucleolin. Nucleolin-mediated activation of CD34 gene transcription results from direct sequence-specific interactions with the CD34 promoter region. Nucleolin expression prevails in CD34-positive cells mobilized into PB, as opposed to CD34-negative PBMCs. Therefore, in intact CD34-positive mobilized PB cells, a recruitment of nucleolin to the CD34 promoter region takes place, accompanied by nucleosomal determinants of gene activity, which are absent from the CD34 promoter region in CD34-negative PBMCs.

Stable KG1-Nuc transfectant cells were obtained using nucleolin expression vector containing the full-length human nucleolin cDNA in-frame with N-terminal FLAG tag, in the pCMV-Tag2B expression vector (Stratagene), and the selection was performed by addition of 200 μg/ml G418 to the culture medium. Stable KG1-mock transfectant cells were obtained using the same vector with no insert. Exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. Cell Separation and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—Mobilized PB CD34-positive cells were obtained from apheresis collections from normal adult volunteers and enriched using CD34 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech), after ammonium chloride red cell lysis, according to the supplier's instructions. For enrichment of natural killer (NK) cells, red cell lysis was followed by selection with the CD56 MultiSort Kit, and depletion of residual T cells using CD3 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech). The purity of all preparations was monitored by FACS analysis with the following antibodies (Abs), directly coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) or fluorescein isothiocyanate: anti-CD34 (8G12), anti-CD56 and anti-CD3 (BD Pharmingen), and isotype-matched control monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Nucleolin expression vector contained the full-length human nucleolin cDNA downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. DNA was purified using a plasmid purification system (Qiagen). KG1 and KG1a cells were transiently transfected using the DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen), and NIH-3T3 cells, using the Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), according to the respective manufacturer's protocols. Measurements of luciferase were performed according to the recommended procedures by the producer of the luciferase kit (Roche Applied Science), and the results were normalized to protein concentration according to manufacturer's specifications. Results in figures represent at least three independent experiments. Nucleolin Down-modulation Experiments—Distinct small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to different regions of the mRNA of human nucleolin were used: a pool of four siRNA molecules targeting human nucleolin (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, M-003854-00), referred to as nucleolin siRNA-A, or the siRNA duplex corresponding to nucleolin mRNA nucleotide numbers 1755–1774 (nucleolin sequence from GenBank™ accession NM_005381), referred to as nucleolin siRNA-B.

In brief, siRNA (100 nm) was applied to growing KG1 cells as described above, however, twice at 24-h intervals. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection for analysis of RNA, and 2–4 days after transfection for immunoblotting. For antisense-mediated inhibition of nucleolin expression, phosphorothioate-modified nucleolin antisense oligonucleotide 5′-TCACCATGATGGCGGCGG-3′ was used, that is complementary to the 5′ end of the human nucleolin mRNA encompassing the translation initiation region.

The comparative threshold cycle (CT) method and an internal control (β-actin) were used to normalize target gene expression. Activation of Endogenous CD34 and Bcl-2 Expression by Nucleolin in CD34-positive Cells—Human BM-derived CD34-positive myeloblast cell line KG1 (32Koeffler H.P. Golde D.W. Science. 1978; 200: 1153-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was stably transfected with a nucleolin expression vector, containing nucleolin cDNA in-frame with FLAG tag under control of cytomegalovirus promoter, referred to as KG1-Nuc cells, or with the empty expression vector, referred to as KG1-mock cells. Nucleolin expression was 3.5-fold increased in KG1-Nuc versus KG1-mock cells (Fig. 1A, top, lanes 1 and 2), and expression of exogenous nucleolin in KG1-Nuc cells was verified by immunoblotting with an Ab directed at the FLAG tag (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Immunoblotting of cell extracts with Abs specific for CD34, Bcl-2, and β-actin demonstrated that the levels of CD34 and Bcl-2 proteins were significantly increased in KG1-Nuc cells, ∼7-fold and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), while β-actin levels were identical (Fig. 1A, bottom, lanes 1–4). Furthermore, FACS analysis revealed that the increased nucleolin expression resulted in a ∼3-fold up-regulation of the cell surface CD34 (Fig. 1A, right). The levels of CD34 and Bcl-2 transcripts were increased in KG1-Nuc versus KG1-mock cells, as was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, using β-actin as internal control (Fig. 1B). To provide further evidence for nucleolin-dependent activation of CD34 and Bcl-2 expression in CD34-positive cells, siRNA approach was employed. Two previously validated siRNAs (34Huddleson J.P.

As compared with control non-targeting siRNA, either nucleolin-targeting siRNA significantly reduced nucleolin protein levels (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 2 and 5). β-Actin expression was not changed (Fig. 1C, bottom, lanes 1–5), and no significant effect on PCNA protein was detected (data not shown). The level of nucleolin in untransfected cells did not differ detectably from that in cells treated with the control siRNA (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 3 and 1, respectively). The knockdown of nucleolin expression with either nucleolin-targeting siRNA was accompanied by a significant reduction of CD34 and Bcl-2 protein levels, as was demonstrated by immunoblotting of cell extracts with Abs specific for CD34 and Bcl-2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 5). The levels of CD34 and Bcl-2 transcripts were investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1C, lanes 6–8 and 9–11, respectively). As internal control β-actin wa"

Here we show that β-catenin co-localizes with IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and N-cadherin at actin-positive membrane ruffles in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We used deletion mapping to identify the membrane ruffle-targeting region of β-catenin, localizing it to amino acids 47-217, which overlap the IQGAP1 binding site. Knockdown by small interference RNA (siRNA) revealed IQGAP1-dependent membrane targeting of β-catenin, APC, and N-cadherin. Transient overexpression of IQGAP1 or N-cadherin increased β-catenin at membrane ruffles. IQGAP1/APC regulates cell migration, and using a wound healing assay we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated loss of β-catenin also caused a modest reduction in the rate of cell migration. More significantly, we discovered that β-catenin is internalized by Arf6-dependent macropinocytosis near sites of membrane ruffling. The β-catenin macropinosomes co-stained for APC, N-cadherin, and to a lesser extent IQGAP1, and internalization of each binding partner was abrogated by siRNA-dependent knockdown of β-catenin. In addition, β-catenin macropinosomes co-localized with the lysosomal marker, lysosome associated membrane protein 1, consistent with their recycling by the late endosomal machinery. Our findings expand on current knowledge of β-catenin function. We propose that in motile cells β-catenin is recruited by IQGAP1 and N-cadherin to active membrane ruffles, wherein β-catenin mediates the internalization and possible recycling of the membrane-associated proteins N-cadherin and APC. β-Catenin is an integral component of E-cadherin dependent cell-cell junctions.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin is involved in cell adhesion through its interaction with E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and as a transcriptional activator it binds/activates the lymphoid enhancing factor-1/T-cell factor transcription factors to induce genes involved in cell transformation (3Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic β-catenin is normally subject to strict regulation by the APC 2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; ASEF, APC-stimulated exchange factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IQGAP1, IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1; LAMP1, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; ca, constitutively active; wt, wild type; ct, C terminus; HA, hemagglutinin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; ASEF, APC-stimulated exchange factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IQGAP1, IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1; LAMP1, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; ca, constitutively active; wt, wild type; ct, C terminus; HA, hemagglutinin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate./axin/glycogen synthase kinase-3β degradation complex, which promotes β-catenin turnover through the proteasome (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of β-catenin degradation results in increased β-catenin protein levels and an altered distribution of β-catenin, which shifts from membrane and cytoplasm to the nucleus, culminating in changes typical of the transformed cellular phenotype including enhanced cell migration and increased proliferation. Despite an increase in our knowledge concerning β-catenin subcellular distribution, nuclear transport, and turnover (3Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 4Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), our understanding of how membrane-associated β-catenin is internalized and recycled is rather poor. Membrane-localized β-catenin is mostly bound to E-cadherin at adherens junctions, structures that mediate cell-cell adhesion and maintain epithelial cell contact, polarity, and communication (5Yap A. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The adherens junctions are positioned at the basolateral membrane, and their formation is dependent on the homophilic binding of the transmembrane protein E-cadherin. β-Catenin together with α-catenin tethers adherens junctions to the actin cytoskeleton (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 6Adams C.A. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The formation and disassembly of adherens junctions is a dynamic process linked to tissue remodeling and tumor cell invasion (7Wheelock M.J. Soler A.P. Knudsen K.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The loss of adherens junctions can result in disruption of apical-basal polarity and loss of the epithelial phenotype and is a contributing factor to the so-called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a shift in cellular phenotype associated with the progression of epithelial-derived cancers (8Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). The loss of β-catenin and E-cadherin from the cell surface is emerging as a key event in this process, especially in breast and colon carcinomas where E-cadherin down-regulation occurs through multiple mechanisms (7Wheelock M.J. Soler A.P. Knudsen K.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, 9Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In addition to the reduced anchorage of cells caused by loss of E-cadherin, they can also acquire a more migratory phenotype through the release of β-catenin from the membrane and its translocation to the nucleus, where it activates genes involved in cell transformation and migration (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). More recently, a second membrane localization of cellular β-catenin was reported. Etienne-Manneville et al. (10Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) showed that β-catenin was detectable at the leading edge of migrating rat astrocytes; however, this localization pattern has not yet been confirmed or characterized. Although it is possible this atypical membrane staining pattern reflected artifactual antibody staining, it is equally plausible that β-catenin does localize to lamellipodia and active ruffling membrane in mesenchymal cells or fibroblasts. The appearance of the β-catenin binding partner, APC, was recently reported at such dynamic membrane structures (11Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the membrane association of APC was functionally linked to cell migration. In this study we performed a series of experiments that provide compelling evidence for the localization of β-catenin at membrane ruffles. We further show that membrane-associated β-catenin correlates with a modest contribution to cell migration and that this unexpected localization pattern is important for the internalization of β-catenin and specific binding partners through the process of macropinocytosis. We identified IQGAP1, an important regulator of actin dynamics and cell migration (11Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev.

All cell lines were confirmed mycoplasma-free and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For transfection cells were grown on glass coverslips in 8-well dishes (Nunc) and 12 h post-seeding were transfected with 2 μg of DNA or 3 μg of siRNA per ml of media using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); the lipid-DNA mix was left on cells for 6 h before replacing the medium and processing cells 40 h later. Cells were processed for microscopy or wound healing assay. The effect of ARF6 was studied by treating the cells with 30 μm Myr-Arf6 peptide (Calbiochem) for 1 h.

Cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 45 min, incubated with 150 μl of primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution; see below for dilutions), and washed 3 times with PBS. Cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibody. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. After extensive washes in PBS, slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The following antibodies were used for immunofluorescence labeling and Western blotting: β-catenin polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., #H102), β-catenin monoclonal antibody (1:100, Transduction Laboratories #610153), M-APC rabbit polyclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Inke Nathke), N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (1:100, Zymed Laboratories Inc. #33-3900), IQGAP1 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz, H109), IQGAP1 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Transduction Laboratories, #610612), clathrin monoclonal antibody (1:100, Transduction Laboratories #610499), anti-HA (1:200, Santa Cruz, clone Y-11), Arf6 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz, clone 3A-1), β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Sigma clone AC-74), Rab 3A polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz, clone K-15), Rab5 (1:100, Transduction Laboratories #610281), EEA1 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz clone C-15), LAMP1 monoclonal antibody (1:200, Transduction Laboratories #611042), Rab11 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Transduction Labs #610656), TGN38 (1:200, Transduction Laboratories, #610898), β-COP (1:2000, Affinity Bioreagents #PA1-061), TRITC- or FITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma P1951 or P5282, respectively). Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to biotin (1:500, DAKO), Texas Red conjugated to avidin (1:800, Vecta Laboratories), anti-mouse conjugated to FITC (1:100, Santa Cruz), or anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC (1:100, Santa Cruz). Confocal microscope images of labeled cells were taken at ×600 magnification using the Leica TCS SP2 confocal system attached to a Leica upright fluorescence microscope (DMRE) and using Leica Confocal Software Version 2.00. Other images were taken using an Olympus BL51 fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification. A SPOT 32 camera and SPOT Advanced software was used for general image capture. The images were modified in Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Deconvolution Analysis of Microscope Images—For high resolution imaging of cells, an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope was used to capture 21 sections of cell samples, each section of 0.35 μm, a z axis range that spanned the apical to basal part of the cell. Images were resolved by iterative deconvolution using the Zeiss software inverse filter algorithm. The deconvolved images selected for presentation in this study correspond to sections 10-15 and represent a mid-plane transsection of the cell. Dextran Labeling Experiment—For uptake of dextran-FITC (71 kDa; Sigma) or dextran-TRITC (76 kDa; Sigma), cells were transfected with ASEF-ca plasmid. After 30 h cells were incubated with 4 mg/ml dextran for 15 min to 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free media followed by 3 washes with fresh media and PBS (17Schafer D.A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 892-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formalin, stained with β-catenin monoclonal antibody or M-APC polyclonal antibody, and analyzed by Zeiss deconvolution microscopy as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were resuspended in protein extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics) and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After a quick thaw at 37 °C, cells were refrozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice for 20 min, and cleared of insoluble components by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant containing total protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell extracts were then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS), and 40 μg of proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-poly-acrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Membranes were treated in blocking solution (5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 2 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Prestained broad range molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) was used as the molecular size standard. RNA Interference—Double-stranded 21-mer RNA oligonucleotides homologous to sequences in mouse IQGAP1 or β-catenin (see Table 2) were purchased as purified duplexes (Qiagen-Xeragon Inc). Cells at medium density were transfected with 3 μg of RNA duplexes in 1 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium using Lipofectamine for 6 h and either harvested 48 h post-transfection for image analysis or analyzed by time-lapse microscopy.TABLE 2siRNA sequences used in this studyTargetSequenceControl siRNA5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′β-Catenin siRNA 15′-CAGGGTGCTATTCCACGACTA-3′β-Catenin siRNA 25′-CAGATAGAAATGGTCCGATTA-3′IQGAP1 siRNA5′-CGACATGATGATGATAAACAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Wound Healing Assay—NIH 3T3 cells were grown on 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, #155383). After 72 h, the confluent cells were wounded using a Gilson P1000 pipette tip. Cells were imaged live along the wound at 8 different regions per well for 15 h using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. For each region, the distance migrated by cells was measured at three different points. Thus, for each well the distance migrated was recorded as an average of 24 points every hour. At the end of the time-lapse experiment cells were fixed and stained with β-catenin and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody and FITC-conjugated phalloidin to confirm knock-down of the β-catenin. The assay was repeated twice. β-Catenin Is Localized at Membrane Ruffles in Migrating Cells—Our laboratory has an ongoing interest in the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking of β-catenin (18Henderson B.R.

The steady-state localization of β-catenin in the nucleus and at cell-cell junctions is well documented (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin has been reported at cell membrane lamellipodia (10Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and we have detected β-catenin at lamellipodia, filopodia, and short membrane ruffles; however, such localization patterns remain poorly characterized. We tested for non-adherens junction membrane staining of β-catenin in a panel of cell lines using the wound healing assay, which permits analysis of actively migrating cells. Confluent monolayers of different epithelial cell lines were scratched and allowed to heal for 6 h then immunostained with antibody to β-catenin and with fluorescent-tagged phalloidin to detect actin (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In canine kidney epithelial cells, visible β-catenin was primarily restricted to cell-cell junctions, consistent with the fact that these cells form extremely tight and stable cell-cell junctions and are not highly motile. In the breast cancer epithelial cell lines T47D and MCF-7, β-catenin was detected both at cell-cell junctions and also at membrane ruffles in migrating cells at the wound edge. The staining of β-catenin was more biased toward actin-positive membrane ruffles in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). To confirm specificity of the membrane staining of β-catenin, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with siRNA to silence β-catenin and observed a consequent loss of staining from cell-cell junctions, the nucleus and cytoplasm, and also from the membrane ruffles. In contrast, a control siRNA had no effect on β-catenin staining patterns, and the actin staining pattern was unaffected, indicating that membrane ruffles are a genuine site of β-catenin accumulation. To further test the localization of β-catenin at membrane ruffles, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with plasmids encoding different factors known to modulate actin dynamics and induce membrane ruffling; a constitutively active form of Rac1 GTPase (13Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. Eustachio P.D. Rush M. Phillips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 21Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar), the Rac1 GTPase exchange factor, ASEF (14Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishdate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and a constitutively active form of ASEF (15Kawasaki Y. Sato R. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and stained cells for actin and β-catenin. Both Rac1 and ASEF increased the proportion of transfected cells with actin-positive membrane ruffles by 1.5-2.5-fold, and a corresponding increase in cellular β-catenin was detected at these membrane structures (Fig. 1C). The strongest effect was elicited by constitutively active ASEF (ASEF-ca), which induced a 3-fold increase in actin-positive ruffles and a 2.5-fold increase in β-catenin-positive ruffles. Thus, the localization of β-catenin at membrane ruffles is associated with induction of these migratory structures. β-Catenin Co-localizes with IQGAP1, APC, and N-cadherin at Membrane Ruffles—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with ASEF-ca plasmid to induce membrane ruffles then stained for β-catenin and three partner proteins previously reported to locate at membrane ruffles (Fig. 2A). Cells positive for β-catenin were compared for the extent to which β-catenin co-located with each partner at ruffles (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). IQGAP1 is a known marker protein of membrane ruffles (22Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We detected co-localization of IQGAP1 or actin in ∼97% of NIH 3T3 cells with β-catenin-positive ruffles. Watanabe et al. (11Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) showed that IQGAP1 recruits APC to membrane ruffles. We, therefore, stained for APC protein (using M-APC antibody) and found that 62% of cells with β-catenin-positive membrane ruffles co-stained with APC. We next tested β-catenin-positive membrane ruffles for the presence of N-cadherin, a transmembrane protein and binding partner of β-catenin previously observed at free membrane and implicated in cell migration and invasion (23Wong A.S.T. Gumbiner B.M J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1191-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A high degree of co-localization was observed between these two proteins at membrane ruffles (95% of cells analyzed). Other membrane proteins such as E-cadherin and Zo-1 displayed poor co-staining with β-catenin at ruffles (see supplemental Fig. S3). We conclude that β-catenin-positive membrane ruffles co-localize with actin, IQGAP1, APC, and N-cadherin. Transiently Expressed N-cadherin and IQGAP1 Increase β-Catenin at Membrane Ruffles—In contrast to APC, which regulates β-catenin turnover (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), N-cadherin and IQGAP1 independently locate at free membrane and are potential regulators of β-catenin targeting to membrane ruffles. Indeed, when transiently expressed in cells, GFP-tagged forms of both N-cadherin and IQGAP1 stimulated β-catenin staining at ruffles relative to the effect seen with E-cadherin (Fig. 2, B and C) or a GFP control (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S4). The IQGAP1 Binding Region (Amino Acids 47-217) Is Required for β-Catenin Localization to Membrane Ruffles—We next investigated the sequences that are necessary to target β-catenin to membrane ruffles. To address this, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a series of GFP-tagged β-catenin deletion constructs (Fig. 3A) and co-expressed with pASEF-ca to elicit membrane ruffling. We scored transfected cells for the localization of ectopic ASEF-ca and β-catenin-GFP. Wild-type β-catenin localized to ASEF-positive membrane ruffles in 25% of transfected cells, displaying ∼80% co-localization with ASEF at ruffles (Fig. 3, B and C). Deletion of amino acids 1-47, the primary phosphorylated sequence of β-catenin, did not change its localization at membrane ruffles, suggesting that phosphorylation per se is not required for membrane localization. Subsequent deletion of residues 1-132 reduced β-catenin localization at membrane ruffles by ∼40%, whereas deletion of amino acids 1-217 reduced this staining pattern by 75%. Interestingly, an internal deletion of the arm domain (amino acids 218-467) that prevents binding to APC and N-cadherin did not impair β-catenin localization at ruffles. Thus, although N-cadherin may boost β-catenin at the free membrane, it is not essential. These results indicate that residues 47-217 are critical for localization of β-catenin at membrane ruffles. This sequence contains the binding site for IQGAP1 (amino acids 123-183; Ref. 24Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Shoji I. Yoshiharu M. Yonehara S. Fujisawa H. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26044-26050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), implicating IQGAP1 as a primary anchor or regulator of β-catenin at membrane ruffles. Silencing IQGAP1 Expression Reduces β-Catenin, APC, and N-cadherin at Membrane Ruffles—We examined the effect of silencing IQGAP1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells. Relative to cells treated with a control siRNA, endogenous IQGAP1 was reduced ∼80% by an IQGAP1-specific siRNA as shown by Western blot (Fig. 4A). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with control or IQGAP1 siRNA, and 48 h later cells were immunostained with antibodies against IQGAP1 and partner proteins. More than 200 cells were scored in each case, comparing cells that were either positive for IQGAP1 membrane ruffles (control siRNA group) or cells that were negative for IQGAP1-stained ruffles (IQGAP1 siRNA) as shown in Fig. 4B. Cells were subconfluent, and all displayed free membrane with the potential to form ruffles. We found that ∼55% of cells that stained positive for IQGAP1 at membrane ruffles also stained positive for β-catenin at these structures. In contrast, those cells negative for IQGAP1 at ruffles showed only ∼20% staining of β-catenin at ruffles. The loss of IQGAP1 did not result in a net loss of ruffle formation as revealed by staining for actin-positive ruffles, which was unaffected by IQGAP1 knock-down (data not shown). Moreover, siRNA-dependent silencing of APC, although less efficient in NIH 3T3 cells (50% of cells with loss of APC ruffles), caused an increase in β-catenin nuclear staining but had no significant aff"

Identification and characterization of these folding intermediates are particularly difficult as they are often only transiently populated and play different mechanistic roles, being either on-pathway productive species or off-pathway kinetic traps. To define the role of folding intermediates, a quantitative analysis of the folding and unfolding rate constants over a wide range of denaturant concentration is often required. Such a task is further complicated by the reversible nature of the folding reaction, which implies the observed kinetics to be governed by a complex combination of different microscopic rate constants. Here, we tackled this problem by measuring directly the folding rate constant under highly denaturing conditions, namely by inducing the folding of a PDZ domain through a quasi-irreversible binding reaction with a specific peptide. In analogy with previous works based on hydrogen exchange experiments, we present evidence that the folding pathway of the PDZ domain involves the formation of an obligatory on-pathway intermediate. The results presented exemplify a novel type of kinetic test to detect an on-pathway folding intermediate.

In analogy with previous works based on hydrogen exchange experiments, we present evidence that the folding pathway of the PDZ domain involves the formation of an obligatory on-pathway intermediate. The results presented exemplify a novel type of kinetic test to detect an on-pathway folding intermediate. The existence and importance of productive on-pathway intermediates are fundamental questions for our understanding of protein folding. Classically it was thought that proteins fold in a stepwise manner via a series of partially structured intermediates. This framework model was later challenged when several small, single-domain proteins, with chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 as a first example (1Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), were found to fold without detectable intermediates. This observation provided the basis for a nucleation-condensation mechanism, with folding through simultaneous formation of secondary and tertiary structure (2Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 260-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). A more recent view proposed that proteins fold via parallel routes, depicted as a flux of molecules along different folding channels partitioned by the relative effect of denaturant on the relevant transition states (3Bryngelson J.D. Onuchic J.N. Socci N.D. Wolynes P.G. Proteins. 1995; 21: 167-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the statistical view of folding as a search through a funnel-like energy landscape where intermediates are not considered necessary steps during the folding but kinetic traps because of the ruggedness the folding landscape (4Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). It is well known that failure to detect intermediates in classical kinetic folding experiments does not necessarily exclude their existence. Thus, an intermediate state can be identified if it is formed and disappears with appropriate rate constants. In protein folding, detection of a curved chevron plot, i.e. a nonlinear dependence of folding/unfolding kinetics on denaturant concentration in a semi-logarithmic plot, has been taken as an indication for the presence of intermediates. By classical kinetic analysis of (un)folding data, it has been shown that curved chevron plots may arise either from the accumulation of partially folded intermediates states (5Matouschek A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 6Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or from changes in rate-limiting steps invoking sequential barriers on the path to the native state (7Sanchez I.E. Kiefhaber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Khan F. Chuang J.I. Gianni S. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, deviations from linearity in chevron plots have been explained in terms of movement of transition states over a broad barrier without discrete intermediates (the Hammond effect) (9Ternstrom T. Mayor U. Akke M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14854-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are a large family of proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions (10Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). These globular proteins generally consist of 80–100 residues that fold into six β-strands and two α-helices. The presence of folding intermediates has been proposed for different PDZ domains. A late folding intermediate was suggested in the folding of the third domain of PDZ from the synaptic protein PDS-95 based on the result of hydrogen exchange experiments (11Feng H. Vu N.D. Bai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An early folding intermediate was proposed for murine PDZ2 from PTP-BL (PDZ2, the second PDZ domain from protein-tyrosine phosphatase Bas-like) based on a rollover effect occurring in the chevron plot under certain folding conditions (12Gianni S. Geierhaas C.D. Calosci N. Jemth P. Vuister G.W. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vendruscolo M. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fersht (14Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has proposed a critical test to define the role of intermediates in protein folding pathways based on native hydrogen exchange methods. Using an approach conceptually analogous to hydrogen exchange (15Takei J. Chu R.A. Bai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10796-10801Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated here that the intermediate previously identified in the folding of PDZ2 is an obligatory species en route to the native state. By employing ligand-induced folding experiments, we were able to measure the folding rate of PDZ2 under highly denaturing conditions. Data were analyzed in terms of a three-state folding scheme involving either a low or a high energy intermediate as well as in terms of a single broad energy barrier. Trapping the native state by addition of a specific ligand (the peptide EQVSAV) proved to be a conceptually straightforward approach to demonstrate the on-pathway nature of the folding intermediate of PDZ2. The V44A site-directed mutant was produced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PDZ2 was purified as described previously (13Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in the presence of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 25 °C. All reagents were of analytical grade. An engineered variant of PDZ2 with Tyr-43 replaced with Trp (pWT43 PDZ2) and a dansylated peptide, d-EQVSAV, were used, as described previously (16Gianni S. Engstrom A. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the introduced Trp-43 is decreased upon peptide binding by Förster resonance transfer between the Trp-43 and the dansyl group. Kinetic experiments were carried out on an Applied Photophysics Pi-star stopped-flow instrument (Leatherhead, United Kingdom); peptide induced binding experiments were carried out by mixing unfolded PDZ2 (i.e. in the presence of 6–8 m urea) with different concentrations of peptide. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the fluorescence emission was measured using a 330 ± 20 nm band-pass glass filter. PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules recognizing simple C-terminal motifs, comprising short consensus sequences, with approximately micromolar affinity (10Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The addition of a large excess of a native PDZ binding partner to the denatured protein will shift the equilibrium toward the native conformation, posing the protein folding as quasi-irreversible. Thus, in principle, ligand-induced folding experiments may be used for the direct determination of the folding rate constant, kF, even under strongly denaturing conditions as shown previously for barnase (17Sanz J.M. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Of course this binding-driven experiment provides an unequivocal determination of the folding rate constant only when and if (i) the binding step is faster than the folding reaction, and (ii) the binding partner interacts only with the fully native state, as depicted in Scheme I, D⇄kUkFN+P⇄koffkonN⋅PSCHEME I where D and N represent the denatured and native states, respectively, and P the peptide ligand. In the case of PDZ2, we have shown previously that the observed rate constant for binding of the specific peptide EQVSAV is in the submillisecond time domain, i.e. faster than the folding rate constants at any ligand concentration (13Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Gianni S. Engstrom A. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, for the purpose of this study, it was necessary to define the mechanism whereby the peptide ligand promotes the folding of PDZ2. To this end, we carried out a binding-induced folding experiment on a destabilized mutant of PDZ2, namely V44A. This variant, which is essentially unfolded at room temperature even in absence of denaturant (data not shown), displays an affinity for the ligand similar to that of the wild type protein when monitored under stabilizing conditions (18Gianni S. Walma T. Arcovito A. Calosci N. Bellelli A. Engström Å. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Brunori M. Jemth P. Vuister G.W. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 1801-1809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The addition of peptide (EQVSAV) to the V44A promoted the folding reaction, shifting the equilibrium toward the native state (see Scheme I). We investigated the binding kinetics for the V44A mutant at pH 7.0 and 25 °C under pseudo-first order conditions, varying either the concentration of peptide or of the protein (Fig. 1). When the experiments were carried out in the presence of an excess of protein, the pseudo-first order rate constant yielded a linear concentration dependence. In contrast, when the experiments were carried out in the presence of an excess of the ligand, the observed rate constant was decreased upon increasing the peptide concentration. By analogy with the classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) concerted model (19Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6057) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the ligand significantly interacts only with the native state (20Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct interaction with the denatured state or with the intervening folding transition state(s) would result in an increase of the apparent rate constant with increasing ligand concentration. It has been shown that the chemical exchange of labile amide protons can be employed successfully to measure the unfolding rate constant under native conditions (15Takei J. Chu R.A. Bai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10796-10801Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, under the so-called EX1 condition (21Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein. Sci. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 22Roder H. Wagner G. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7396-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Ferraro D.M. Lazo N.D. Robertson A.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 43: 587-594Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the observed exchange rate constant will be identical to the unfolding rate constant. In analogy with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange methodology, the observed kinetics, induced by a quasi-irreversible binding reaction (i.e. k′on[P] » kU and koff; see Scheme I), will be essentially limited by the folding microscopic rate constant even under strongly denaturing conditions (i.e. kU » kF) given a sufficiently high peptide concentration. We measured the binding-induced folding rate constant for PDZ2 at different urea concentrations by mixing denatured PDZ2 with an excess of peptide ligand. All of the observed binding traces followed single exponential behavior. The binding-induced folding kinetics were followed as a function of peptide concentration, as exemplified for one representative urea concentration in Fig. 2. Observed kinetics were fitted to the equation,kobs=kFapp+KD⋅kUapp[P]+KD(Eq.1) where kappF and kappU are the apparent folding and unfolding rate constants and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the ligand P. The logarithms of the calculated kF values, together with the conventional chevron plot for PDZ2 measured under the same experimental conditions, are shown in Fig. 3. Inspection of Fig. 3 clearly shows that the folding arm, obtained from binding-induced experiments, displays a downward curvature, mimicking the rollover effect observed in the unfolding arm of the conventional chevron plot at high urea concentrations (13Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Top, complete chevron plot of PDZ2. Folding rate constants obtained from peptide binding-induced folding experiments (filled circles) are plotted together with folding rate constants obtained by conventional dilution experiments (open circles). The rate constants from the two approaches are superimposed at low urea concentrations. Data were fitted globally to models implying the presence of either a low energy intermediate (gray lines) or a high energy unstable on-pathway intermediate (black lines). Bottom, schematic energy diagrams for the binding-induced folding of PDZ2. As formalized in Equation 2, when and if an on-pathway high energy intermediate can be identified, the rollover effect reflects a change in the rate-limiting step, and a symmetrical curvature of the folding and unfolding arm should be observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nonlinear dependence of log kobs on denaturant concentrations have been explained both by folding pathways involving intermediates and by the Hammond effect (9Ternstrom T. Mayor U. Akke M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14854-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In theory, the kinetics of a two-step reaction should be fitted to the roots of a quadratic equation. However, because it is often impossible to measure the two relaxation rate constants experimentally, different approximations have been introduced. On one hand, assuming the presence of an unstable, high energy, on-pathway intermediate in steady state with the ground states (7Sanchez I.E. Kiefhaber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Khan F. Chuang J.I. Gianni S. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the following equation can be derived,kobs=kF1+kIUkIN+kU1+kIUkIN(Eq.2) where kF and kU are the overall folding and unfolding rate constants and kAB are the microscopic rate constants for the interconversion of the substrate A to the product B. Under such condition the curvature is supposed to reflect a change in the rate-limiting step (14Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and a symmetrical curvature for the folding and unfolding arm should be observed, as pictured in the energy diagram in Fig. 3. Alternatively, the intermediate (which can be either on- or off-pathway) may be assumed to be in a fast pre-equilibrium with the ground states (5Matouschek A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 6Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), as formalized in Equation 3.kobs=kF+kU1+KINeq(Eq.3) According to this model, the curvature in the plot is caused by a change in stability of the intermediate relative to the ground states as the urea concentration is changed. Furthermore, accumulation of an intermediate prior to the main rate-limiting barrier (as postulated in Equation 2) implies multiphasic (un)folding kinetics, as described previously for a variety of different proteins (24Eaton W.A. Munoz V. Thompson P.A. Chan C.K. Hofrichter J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E.

Under such conditions, the kinetically resolved amplitudes may be different from those expected from the total signal change between the native and the denatured states (“burst phase effect”). However, it should be noted that detection of additional phases, escaping the stopped-flow time resolution, requires long extrapolations that may jeopardize quantitative analysis (29Krantz B.A. Mayne L. Rumbley J. Englander S.W. Sosnick T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both Equations 2 and 3 lead to very similar solutions with a partition factor describing alternatively either the KeqI – N or kIU/kIN (i.e. reflecting the difference between the activation barriers for the intermediate to revert to the reagents rather than proceeding to the products). In fact, although a symmetrical curvature of the folding and unfolding arm may be postulated in Equation 2, the reversible nature of the folding reaction prevents a direct measurement of the folding rate constants at higher denaturant concentrations, with the process being dominated by the unfolding rate constant. This implies that the two models are kinetically indistinguishable on the basis of the analysis of rate constants obtained from folding/unfolding experiments only. The combined PDZ2 folding experimental data, obtained from (i) binding-induced experiments, i.e. the folding arm, and (ii) conventional chevron plot, reflecting kobs, are reported in Fig. 3 and have been globally fitted to both Equations 2 and 3. The curve fitting clearly favored Equation 2, and a symmetrical curvature for the folding and unfolding arm can be observed. The quadratic equation describing folding over a single broad energy barrier (9Ternstrom T. Mayor U. Akke M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14854-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was also fitted to the combined data set and produced a fit that was basically indistinguishable from Equation 2 (not shown). The existence of a folding intermediate of PDZ2 was suggested previously from the curvature observed in the chevron plots under certain reaction conditions (12Gianni S. Geierhaas C.D. Calosci N. Jemth P. Vuister G.W. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vendruscolo M. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the proposed intermediate is a productive on-pathway species, we employed the peptide-induced folding approach. This experiment exemplifies a quantitative kinetic test to define the role of intermediates in the folding pathway. In conventional folding/unfolding experiments, the observed rate constant is the sum of kF and kU. To assess the presence of folding intermediates, long extrapolations of the observed amplitudes may be required, which often jeopardize quantitative analysis (29Krantz B.A. Mayne L. Rumbley J. Englander S.W. Sosnick T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ultra-rapid mixing devices can be employed only to detect the presence of low energy intermediates, which accumulate early in protein folding pathways (28Shastry M.C. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the peptide-induced folding experiment presented herein, the refolding rate constant could be obtained independently of the unfolding rate constant even at high denaturant concentrations, and the full folding limb of PDZ2 could be added to the conventional chevron plot (Fig. 3). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, by combining the data sets we can discriminate between two of the models brought forward to explain the curvature in the chevron plots, i.e. (i) the presence of a low energy intermediate (either on or off of the productive pathway leading to the native state) and (ii) the presence of a high energy unstable on-pathway intermediate. Curve fitting of the peptide-induced folding data (Fig. 3) clearly favors the latter case. An alternative model that accounts for the rollover effect in chevron plots has been introduced by Oliveberg and co-workers (9Ternstrom T. Mayor U. Akke M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14854-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), who proposed the folding transition state as represented by a broad ensemble of structures along the reaction coordinate. A powerful parameter in analyzing the nature of protein folding transition state is the βT value for unfolding, which is given by (δlogkf/δ[denaturant])(δlogKD – N/δ[denaturant]), reflecting the degree of accessible surface area of the transition state relative to the denatured and native states. The relationships between mutational perturbations and transition state movements, i.e. changes in βT value, have recently been employed to measure the site-specific contact formation along the folding reaction coordinate (30Hedberg L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7606-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of a ligand-induced folding experiment, we measured the folding rate constant directly over a wide denaturant concentration range comprising high values of urea (Fig. 3). Thus, as shown previously for barnase (14Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was possible to calculate the βT value as a function of urea concentration from the derivative of the analytical equation for the fitted curve. The value of βT, plotted in Fig. 4, displays a cooperative transition with increasing urea concentration and changes from 35% exposure at low urea (reflecting transition state 1) to 85% at high urea (reflecting transition state 2), with the midpoint at 3.5 m urea. Monotonic changes in denaturant concentrations are expected to result in continuous changes in the surface-accessible area for a protein folding via a continuum of transition states over a broad energy barrier (9Ternstrom T. Mayor U. Akke M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14854-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the other hand, consistent with what we observed here for PDZ2 folding, three-state reactions imply an identifiable sigmoidal transition at increasing concentration of urea (14Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is impossible to distinguish between the three-state and the broad barrier models on the basis of observed rate constants alone, analysis of the βT value provides a strong indication in favor of the presence of an on-pathway intermediate. In conclusion, as described above, the ligand-induced binding procedure allows a direct determination of the refolding rate constant under highly denaturing conditions. As exemplified by the PDZ2 folding, an important added value of this methodology lies in testing the validity of linear free energy relationships in protein folding studies and in defining the mechanistic role of intermediates along folding pathways.

The protective antigen (PA) protein binds to receptors, either tumor endothelial cell marker 8 (TEM8) or CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis protein 2), and orchestrates the delivery of the lethal and edema factors into the cytosol. TEM8 is reported to be overexpressed during tumor angiogenesis, whereas CMG2 is more widely expressed in normal tissues. To extend prior work on targeting of tumor with modified anthrax toxins, we used phage display to select PA variants that preferentially bind to TEM8 as compared with CMG2. Substitutions were randomly introduced into residues 605–729 of PA, within the C-terminal domain 4 of PA, which is the principal region that contacts receptor. Candidates were characterized in cellular cytotoxicity assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing either TEM8 or CMG2. A PA mutant having the substitutions R659S and M662R had enhanced specificity toward TEM8-overexpressing CHO cells. This PA variant also displayed broad and potent tumoricidal activity to various human tumor cells, especially to HeLa and A549/ATCC cells. By contrast, the substitution N657Q significantly reduced toxicity to TEM8 but not CMG2-overexpressing CHO cells. Our results indicate that certain amino acid substitutions within PA domain 4 create anthrax toxins that selectively kill human tumor cells.

During an anthrax infection PA plays the critical role of facilitating the entry of EF and LF into host cell cytoplasm. Internalization begins with binding of PA to toxin receptors present on the host cell membrane. The two closely related receptors are tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis gene 2 product) (5Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), leading to loss of the N-terminal domain and allowing the C-terminal 63-kDa region to heptamerize to form a “pre-pore” structure that can then bind LF and EF. The complex is internalized by endocytosis, and at a subsequent step LF and EF are translocated across endosomal membranes to the cytosol (8Abrami L. Reig N. van der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TEM8 and CMG2 are type I transmembrane proteins possessing an extracellular integrin-like I domain, a member of the larger family of von Willebrand factor A domains (9Carson-Walter E.B. Watkins D.N. Nanda A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St Croix B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6649-6655PubMed Google Scholar, 10Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The TEM8 and CMG2 proteins share 40% overall amino acid identity, with 60% identity within their I domains, including a perfectly conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif. CMG2 is widely expressed in normal tissues (6Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), whereas TEM8 was reported to be selectively overexpressed during tumor angiogenesis (11St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V.

The indication that TEM8 is a specific tumor cell marker has led researchers, including ourselves, to develop strategies to exploit TEM8 for targeting of tumors. Crystal structures have been determined for the extracellular domain of CMG2 alone (12Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Scobie H.M. Young J.A. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and bound to PA (13Santelli E. Bankston L.A. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the PA-TEM8 complex has yet to be solved, given the high level of homology with CMG2 the interactions are expected to be very similar to those of the PA-CMG2 complex. In the PA-CMG2 complex, PA domains II and IV pack together at the base of PA and engage the upper surface of CMG2 in the region surrounding the MIDAS motif. Prior evidence that the interaction of PA with receptor involves residues in the “small loop” region of domain 4, residues 679–693 (15Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was confirmed in the structure. An adjacent “large loop” region, residues 704–723, does not make direct contacts with the receptor, so that mutations in this loop must affect binding indirectly (16Brossier F. Sirard J.C. Guidi-Rontani C. Duflot E. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 964-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the PA domain 2 residues 335–350 in binding to CMG2 had not been recognized by prior mutagenesis studies. Modified anthrax toxins are being developed as potential anti-cancer agents (17Liu S. Schubert R.L. Bugge T.H. Leppla S.H. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Liu S. Redeye V. Kuremsky J.G. Kuhnen M. Molinolo A. Bugge T.H. Leppla S.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our previous work in this area has focused on achieving specificity by making PA dependent on cell surface proteases that are enriched on tumor cells. We hypothesized that additional specificity could be achieved by directing PA preferentially to TEM8 or CMG2. To test this hypothesis, we randomly mutated domain 4 of PA and selected PA variants that bind preferentially to TEM8. Additional variants were found that bind preferentially to CMG2. In addition to their potential as therapeutic agents, these variants may have value in characterizing the toxin receptors, and thereby help to understand the pathogenic effects caused by anthrax toxin during infections by B. anthracis. Reagents—FP59 and PA proteins were prepared as described previously (19Liu S. Aaronson H. Mitola D.J. Leppla S.H. Bugge T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FP59 is a fusion protein containing residues 1–254 of LF and the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (21Liu S. Netzel-Arnett S. Birkedal-Hansen H. Leppla S.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6061-6067PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-PA antibody 14B7 (22Rosovitz M.J. Schuck P. Varughese M. Chopra A.P. Mehra V. Singh Y. McGinnis L.M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

A cDNA encoding a secreted extracellular domain (amino acids 35–227) of TEM8 with a C-terminal His6 sequence was expressed in CHO cells. The protein was concentrated and purified from the culture medium with a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and further purified by MonoQ column chromatography (GE Healthcare). The extracellular domain of CMG2 (amino acids 40–218) was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (13Santelli E. Bankston L.A. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The enzymes and reagents for DNA manipulations were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pro-uPA was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from GE Healthcare. The minimum essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640 medium, HEPES buffer, hygromycin B, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. 8-Oxo-dGTP was from Trilink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). Other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Construction of a Mutated Domain 4 PA Phage Display Library—For random mutagenesis of PA domain 4 with the nucleotide analogue 8-oxo-dGTP (23Zaccolo M. Williams D.M. Brown D.M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), 10 ng of pYS5 template DNA (24Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified using 2.5 units of Takara Ex TaqDNA polymerase in a 25-μl reaction containing forward primer 5′GCTTGAATTCAAGCTTTCATTATGATAGAAATAAC3′ and reverse primer 5′GCTTGAATTCAAGCTTTCCTATCTCATAGCCTTTTTT3′ at 1 μm, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, and dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and 8-oxo-dGTP, each at 400 μm. After various numbers of cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 5 min), 1 μl of the amplified material was used in a second PCR in which the above conditions were used except that no 8-oxo-dGTP was added. The product of the second PCR was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, cloned into the T7Select10-3 phage display system, and packaged into bacteriophage according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). Selection of PA Domain 4 Variants from the Phage Display Library—Bacteriophage libraries were selected for TEM8-selective clones by three rounds of panning on 96-well plates coated with mouse anti-PA monoclonal antibody 14B7. The antibody (50 μl of 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) was adsorbed overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with 250 μl of 1× Tris buffered saline (TBS: 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 24.8 mm Tris, pH 7.4) plus 5 mm MgCl2 to remove unbound antibody. Surfaces were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin plus 5 mm MgCl2, incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and washed five times with 250 μl of TBS plus 5 mm MgCl2. To discriminate against CMG2-binding variants, the bacteriophage lysate (1 × 109 particles) was preincubated with 6.4 μg of extracellular domain of CMG2 for 30 min before adding to the antibody-coated wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, washed five times with 1× TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5 mm MgCl2, and bound bacteriophage were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS). Bacterial cells, E. coli BLT 5403, in log phase were infected with eluted bacteriophage, and the culture was grown until lysis occurred. Bacterial cells were pelleted by 15 min of centrifugation at 3000 × g, and the bacteriophage were used for further rounds of panning. Sequencing of DNA Inserts in T7 Bacteriophage—Bacteriophage from the third round of panning were plated onto LB agar containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) with host strain E. coli BLT5403, and individual bacteriophage plaques were suspended in 0.3 ml of M9LB broth (Novagen, Madison, WI) and set at room temperature for 2 h to allow bacteriophage particles to diffuse from the agar. Then EDTA was added to the bacteriophage suspension to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the suspension was heated at 65 °C for 10 min. One microliter of the sample was used for PCR amplification using 2.5 units of Takara Ex TaqDNA polymerase in a 25-μl reaction containing forward primer 5′TAAGTACGCAATGGGCCACG3′ and reverse primer 5′AACTCAGCGGCAGTCTCAAC3′ under the PCR conditions described above, except the annealing temperature was 50 °C. The PCR product was sequenced by dideoxy-mediated sequencing reactions. Construction and Screening of Defined PA Domain 4 Mutants— To facilitate cloning of mutated PA domain 4 sequences, the expression vector pYS5 (24Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified by adding several new cloning sites. An 843-bp DNA fragment having new silent restriction sites was synthesized (supplemental Fig. 1) (Blue Heron Biotechnology, Bothell, WA). The fragment produced by PmeI (blunt end) and BglII cleavage of this synthetic DNA was cloned between the SwaI (blunt end) and BamHI sites of the pYS5 plasmid. The resulting plasmid pYS54 contains unique StuI and SalI sites at positions corresponding to amino acids 650–652 and 716–718, respectively. To express individual PA variants of interest, bacteriophage DNA was amplified in PCRs containing the forward primer 5′GATACTGAAGGCCTTAAAGAAGTTATA3′ and reverse primer 5′TCCCGTTGGTCGACGTATCCCCATTCTCACTAGGATT3′ (StuI and SalI sites are underlined). The resulting PCR products were digested with SalI and StuI, ligated into pYS54 digested with the same restriction endonucleases, and transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue. To obtain all 19 amino acid substitutions of Asn-657, pYS54 DNA was amplified in PCRs containing the forward primer 5′GATACTGAAGGCCTTAAAGAAGTTATANNNGACAGATATGATATGTTGAATA3′ that contains a randomized codon (indicated as NNN) at Asn-657 and reverse primer 5′ATCTTGCCGTAAACTCGAG3′ (StuI and XhoI sites are underlined). The resulting PCR products were digested with StuI and XhoI and cloned as noted above. The same procedure was also applied to create of a library of PA sequence variants in pYS54 by amplifying en masse the DNA amplified from the population of bacteriophage obtained after three rounds of panning. Construction of Domain 4 Mutated PA Proteins Also Having Modified Furin Sites—To prepare PA proteins having both the domain 4 mutations and an altered furin site, pYS54 constructs described above were digested with PstI and HindIII, and the intervening region was replaced with the corresponding PstI to HindIII fragment, isolated from plasmids encoding PrAg-U2, PrAg-L1, and PrAg-U7 (21Liu S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17976-17984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The doubly mutated PA proteins derived from PA N657Q and PA R659S/M662R (also named PA D7) were accordingly named PA N657Q-U2, PA D7-U2, PA N657Q-L1, PA D7-L1, PA N657Q-U7, and PA D7-U7. Expression and Purification of PA Proteins—Plasmids encoding individual constructs described above were transformed into the nonvirulent strain B. anthracis BH445 (26Ramirez D.M. Leppla S.H. Schneerson R. Shiloach J. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 28: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and transformants were grown in FA medium with 10 μg/ml each kanamycin and chloramphenicol for 15 h at 37 °C. PA proteins were concentrated from culture supernatants and purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column (GE Biosciences) by methods described previously (26Ramirez D.M. Leppla S.H. Schneerson R. Shiloach J. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 28: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For screening libraries of BH445 transformed by the mixture of mutated PA domain 4 mutant-encoding plasmids, individual B. anthracis BH445 transformant colonies were inoculated into 180 μl of FA medium with 10 μg/ml kanamycin and chloramphenicol in 96-well plates and grown for 15 h at 37 °C. Culture supernatant (25 μl) was used directly in cytotoxicity assays to identify mutated PA proteins that preferentially killed CHO cells overexpressing either TEM8 or CMG2. The protein concentration was determined by running samples in Phastgel (GE Biosciences) and was quantified by densitometry. Cells and Culture Media—Parental wild-type CHO cells (CHO WTP4) and receptor-deficient CHO PR230 cells derived from them were described previously (27Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5227-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CHO PR230 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TEM8 (27Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

The resulting cells are designated CHO TEM8-T4 and CHO CMG2-C4. CHO cells were grown in α-modification of minimum essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin with or without 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. Human tumor cells A549/ATCC, CAKI-1, DU-145, EKVX, HOP-62, NCI-H226, NCI-H460, SN12C, and SF-539, obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) were cultured in M199 medium containing 10% FBS, 33 μg/ml endothelial mitogen, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 2 mm glutamine, 9 units/ml heparin, 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. HUVEC were passaged at 85–90% confluence by splitting 1:4 and used within the first eight passages. Cytotoxicity Assays of CHO and Human Tumor Cells—Cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h before treatment. PA proteins (0–4472 ng/ml) combined with FP59 (100 ng/ml) were added to cells to a final volume of 200 μl/well. Cell viability was assayed 48 h after treatment by replacing the medium with 50 μl of medium containing 0.5 mg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Medium was removed after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, and the blue pigment produced by viable cells was dissolved in 50 μl/well of 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm HCl, in 90% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. Plates were vortexed, and oxidized 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was measured as A570 using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices). Results were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego) as percentage viability of control wells containing FP59 without PA. EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression sigmoidal dose-response analysis with variable slopes. Each assay was performed three times, and data from a representative assay are shown. Cytotoxicity Assays of HUVEC—HUVEC were plated at a density of 2500 cells/well in 96-well plates in the medium described above and cultured for 24 h before use. Cells were treated with PA and FP59 (100 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% FBS for 6 h, and medium was then replaced with the toxin-free medium containing 10% FBS. Viability was analyzed after 48 h using CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Measurement of PA Affinity for Receptors—Schild plot analyses were used as described previously (24Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the affinity (apparent Kd) of domain 4 mutated PA proteins for cellular receptors. Briefly, the nontoxic PA-U7, PA N657Q-U7, and PA D7-U7 proteins were used as competitors to block the toxicity of wild-type PA to CHO cells. Multiple PA dose-response cytotoxicity assays were done, each in the presence of a different fixed concentration of the competitor. The midpoints on the dose-response curves (Ti) were plotted against the competitor concentration. Ti is the midpoint of the dose-response curve obtained at a particular fixed competitor concentration. To is the value of Ti with no competitor added. The intercept of the resulting line at the point where log((Ti/To) - 1) = 0 identifies the competitor concentration equal to the apparent Kd value, a measure of the affinity of the competitor for the receptor used by the toxin to produce toxicity. Random Mutagenesis of PA Domain 4—Previous studies in our laboratory with alanine-scanning mutants identified the small loop region of PA domain 4, which lies between β strands 4β8 and 4β9, as critical for binding to anthrax receptors (15Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rosovitz M.J. Schuck P. Varughese M. Chopra A.P. Mehra V. Singh Y. McGinnis L.M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30936-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To further characterize PA domain 4 residues involved in receptor binding and to identify PA mutants that discriminate between TEM8 and CMG2, we used random mutagenesis and phage display. PCR mutagenesis was performed by amplifying domain 4 DNA fragment with Taq polymerase in the presence of equimolar concentrations of the four normal dNTPs and 8-oxo-dGTP. The mutated PCR product was cloned into T7Select10-3 bacteriophage. The resulting T7 bacteriophage particles are expected to display 5–15 copies of PA domain 4 as a C-terminal fusion to the T7 capsid protein 10B. To enrich for PA mutants that bind selectively to the PA receptor TEM8, but not CMG2, soluble recombinant extracellular domain of CMG2 was incubated with the phage lysate before it was added to the panning surface. Instead of selecting on a TEM8-coated surface, to which binding was poor, we used plates coated with mouse monoclonal antibody 14B7, which recognizes the same region as CMG2 and TEM8 (22Rosovitz M.J. Schuck P. Varughese M. Chopra A.P. Mehra V. Singh Y. McGinnis L.M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30936-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and therefore can be viewed in this situation as a receptor mimic. However, because we predict the PA-binding surfaces of TEM8 and CMG2 to be more similar to each other than to the PA-binding site of the antibody, we expected this procedure to generate predominantly PA mutants that bound less well to both TEM8 and CMG2, and this was indeed the case (see below). Individual bacteriophage plaques were picked after three rounds of panning and were sequenced. These had a variety of amino acid changes (Fig. 1). Inclusion of 8-oxo-GTP was expected to cause predominantly A to C and T to G transitions (23Zaccolo M. Williams D.M. Brown D.M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and these accounted for >95% of the substitutions observed. Amino acid codons lacking A and T in their first 2 positions (e.g. a total of 16 Pro, Gly, and Ala codons, marked in Fig. 1) were expected to have few substitutions, and few were obtained. All of the Arg codons in PA domain 4 are AGA, and as expected, mutation to Ser (AGC) is the only change observed because a substitution to yield CGA (Arg) is silent.FIGURE 1Amino acid sequences of PA domain 4 variants expressed in T7 bacteriophage and selected by panning. Mutations were produced by 8-oxo-dGTP used in equimolar amount (400 μm) with the four normal dNTPs in a PCR, the product of which was introduced into the bacteriophage T7 phage display system. Bacteriophage were enriched for those that bind to monoclonal antibody 14B7 (a receptor mimic) but not to soluble CMG2. The PA variant sequences are sorted according to the more frequent substitutions into A–D. The summary results line shown at the bottom of each panel summarizes results and identifies positions substituted at least once (×) and those having codons containing only G and C and therefore not expected to change at significant frequencies (*).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing data for all PA domain 4 mutants are shown in Fig. 1, A–D, grouped according to the most frequent changes observed. Fig. 1A lists the largest group of mutations obtained, those having substitutions in the region between β strands 4β6 and 4β7 (amino acids 656–665). Residues Asn-657, Arg-659, and Met-662 were the most frequently mutated amino acids, indicating that these residues are critical for binding of PA to CMG2. As expected, no mutations were found in the region 684–688, as this has been shown to be critical for 14B7 antibody binding. In the crystal structure of PA, Asn-657 is completely buried. Its side chain points into the interior of domain 4, away from the MIDAS motif, and makes H-bonds with the main chain of strand 4β5, as well as the carbonyl oxygen of Met-662, thus contributing to the stability of the tertiary structure of domain 4. Met-662 is fairly exposed; its side chain makes van der Waals contact with the side chain of Tyr-681, adjacent to the key MIDAS-binding residue, Asp-683, and thus contributes to the stability of the small loop. In the CMG2 complex, Met-662 also makes van der Waals contacts with CMG2 residues Glu-117 (Asp in TEM8) and Tyr-1119. Arg-659 is buried behind Met-662; it makes H-bonds across the domain 2-domain 4 interface and makes a long range (∼4 Å) contact with Tyr-1119 on CMG2 (Fig. 2). Thus, not surprisingly, the principal mutations occur in a region adjacent to the antibody epitope that overlaps with the receptor binding surface; based on structural grounds the mutants are predicted to destabilize the local fold of domain 4 (or specific interactions with the receptor) in that part of the receptor-binding surface that is not critical for 14B7 binding. The selection procedure also selects for mutants that are properly folded, because the antibody recognizes a three-dimensional epitope on domain 4. Mutation by 8-oxo-dGTP of one nucleotide in the Asn-657 codon, AAT, could yield codons for Thr, His, or Lys, and all three are found, although His is by far the most common replacement and the one that is the most conservative from a steric and H-bonding perspective. Similarly, mutation of Arg-659 (AGA codon) could yield retention of Arg (as a CGA codon, a silent mutation) or substitution by Ser, and only Ser was found. Finally, mutation of Met-662 (ATG codon) could yield substitutions by either Leu or Arg, but only the latter is observed; this is also considered a conservative mutation when the side chain is partly exposed to solvent, as found here. Therefore, for two of these positions, the panning imposed a strong selection for a particular amino acid substitution. One clone of special interest show"

However, questions remain concerning which domains in the C terminus of NR2 subunits control the assembly of receptor complexes and how the assembled complexes are selectively trafficked through the various cellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. In the present study, we found that the three amino acid tail after the TM4 region of NR2 subunits is necessary for surface expression of functional NMDA receptors, while truncations with only two amino acids following the TM4 region (NR2Δ2) completely eliminated surface expression of the NMDA receptor on co-expression with NR1-1a in HEK293 cells. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) analysis showed that these NR2Δ2 truncations are able to form homomers and heteromers on co-expression with NR1-1a. Furthermore, when NR2Δ2 subunits were cotransfected with either the NR1-4a or NR1-1aAAA mutant, lacking the ER retention motif (RRR), functional NMDA receptors were detected in the transfected HEK293 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the replacement of five residues after TM4 with alanines gave results indistinguishable from those of NR2BΔ5 (EHLFY), demonstrating the short tail following the TM4 of NR2 subunits is not sequence-specific-dependent.

Co-assembly of NR1 and NR2 subunits is essential for formation of a functional channel, presumed to be a tetramer containing two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (1Clements J.D. Weatbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). NR1 is a single subunit with eight splicing variants, which have distinct trafficking and functional properties (3Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NR2 subunits are coded by four separate genes, NR2A-D, each of which can endow the receptor channel with different properties (4Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Thus, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors is a major determinant of NMDA receptor-mediated activity in the central nervous system. Although much is known about the physiological roles that NMDARs play in long term potentiation (LTP), learning and memory (5Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. Mar. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, 6Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 7Thompson S.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 23: R218-R221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar), much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which these receptors are assembled, sorted, targeted, and anchored to the appropriate location.The C-terminal domains of the receptor subunits contain critical determinants of subcellular receptor localization. Regulation of receptor trafficking by these determinants ensures that only fully assembled multimeric receptors are expressed on the plasma membrane. When expressed alone in heterogeneous cells, the major NR1 isoform (NR1-1) is retained in the ER because of an RRR motif in its C1 cassette, but NR1-2, NR1-3, and NR1-4 are not retained in the ER because of their lack of the RRR motif and/or their possession of the C2′ cassette (3Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of NR2 subunits can overcome the ER retention mediated by the RRR motif in NR1-1 and deliver the NR1-1/NR2 receptor complexes to the membrane surface. The NR2 subunit is also retained in the ER when expressed alone in heterogeneous cells (10Hawkins L.M. Prybylowski K. Chang K. Moussan C. Stephenson F.A. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28903-28910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in neurons lacking the NR1 subunit (11Fukaya M. Kato A. Lovett C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). That the intracellular C terminus of the NR2B subunit plays a role in its ER retention is suggested by a study using Tac chimeras of its C terminus (10Hawkins L.M. Prybylowski K. Chang K. Moussan C. Stephenson F.A. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28903-28910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but to date there is no particular domain or motif identified as being responsible for the ER retention. Partial truncation of the C terminus of NR2 subunits does not abolish the assembly and surface expression of functional NMDA receptor channels in neurons from genetically modified mice, although the synaptic localization of the receptors is impaired as a result of loss of the PDZ binding domain (12Rossi P. Sola E. Taglietti V. Borchardt T. Steigerwald F. Utvik J.K. Ottersen O.P. Kohr G. D'Angelo E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9687-9697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Steigerwald F. Schulz T.W.

Mutation of the four amino acids (HLFY) following the TM4 region of the NR2B subunit markedly reduces the level of surface expression of NR1/NR2B complexes in heterologous cells (10Hawkins L.M. Prybylowski K. Chang K. Moussan C. Stephenson F.A. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28903-28910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that the several amino acids following the TM4 domain of the NR2 subunit play a crucial role in releasing the assembled functional NMDA receptor complex from the ER. However, the interpretation of these studies is complicated by the fact that no clear motif in the C terminus of NR2 subunits or related exporting signal have been found to control the assembly and surface expression of the NMDA receptor complex.In this study, we addressed these questions further, especially in regard to the role of the C terminus of both NR2A and NR2B in the assembly and surface expression of NMDA receptors. Although the C terminus of NR2A and NR2B shares high sequence identity, several elegant studies have suggested that different mechanisms may apply to regulate the trafficking and synaptic localization of NR2A containing NMDARs versus NR2B-containing ones (17Prybylowski K.

To this end, a series of C-terminally truncated NR2A or NR2B mutants tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were made for detecting surface expression by whole cell patch clamp recordings and live cell surface immunocytochemical staining. We found that a short tail of at least three amino acids, which required no sequence specificity, following the TM4 of NR2 subunits was required for overcoming the ER retention motif of NR1 subunits, but was not necessary for the assembly of NMDAR complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The expression vectors for GFP-NR2A and GFP-NR2B were generated as described previously (20Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A variety of mutants for NR2A and NR2B with C-terminal truncation were constructed from GFP-NR2A and GFP-NR2B, respectively, using conventional DNA cloning techniques. These mutants were named 2AΔ or 2BΔ followed by a number indicating the number of residues left following the TM4 region and/or by a subscript “A” indicating an alanine substitute (Figs. 1A and 2A). For example, 2BΔ5AAAAA represents a GFP-NR2B mutant with five residues (AAAAA) left immediately following TM4. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.FIGURE 2The three amino acids following TM4 of the NR2B subunit are required for the surface expression of NMDA receptors in HEK293 cells.

The plasmids for NR1 and NR2 subunits were transfected at a molar ratio of 1:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were grown in the presence of 0.5 mm ketamine and 1 mm kynurenic acid (Sigma). The transfected cells were used for electrophysiological recording and immunocytochemical staining 24-h later.Hippocampal Culture and Transfection—Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged embryonic day 18 according to the procedures previously described (21Fitzsimonds R.M. Song H.J. Poo M.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The cultures were transfected at DIV5 with the constructs for NR subunits using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescent staining of the live neurons at DIV7 was performed under the same conditions as described above for the transfection of HEK293 cells. The neurons transfected with GFP-tagged NR subunits and surface stained were observed and imaged on a confocal microscope (FV500, Olympus).Electrophysiology—Whole cell recordings from HEK293 cells were made at room temperature 24-48 h after transfection. The resistance of the patch pipette was between 5 and 8 mΩ. Electrical signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon, Foster City, CA) and the pCLAMP system (Version 8.2, Axon) was used for data acquisition and analysis. The extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): NaCl 145, KCl 3, HEPES 10, CaCl2 3, glucose 8, MgCl2 2 (310 Osm, pH adjusted to 7.30 with NaOH). Patch pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mm): potassium gluconate 136.5, KCl 17.5, NaCl 9, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 0.2 (310 Osm, pH adjusted to 7.20 with KOH). Recordings were made at -60 mV during the application of 100 μm glutamate and 20 μm glycine or 50 μm D-AP5, an antagonist of NMDA receptors.Immunofluorescent Staining—GFP-tagged NR2 subunitcontaining NMDA receptors expressed on the cell surface were detected using immunofluorescent staining in living cells as described previously (20Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Chemicon) for 7 min, rinsed three times in extracellular recording solution, and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for another 7 min. After another brief wash in extracellular recording solution, cells were immediately fixed and imaged on a confocal microscope equipped with FluoView imaging analysis software (FV500, Olympus). All processes were performed at room temperature.Quantitative Analysis of Surface Expression—Surface expression of GFP-tagged NMDA receptors in HEK293 cells was measured as the percentage of cells positively stained in the population of cells with GFP expression. For each sample, more than 100 GFP-positive cells were counted from 3-4 different transfections. The surface expression in transfected hippocampal neurons was analyzed quantitatively by calculating the density of Cy3-stained puncta on the dendrites. Each individual secondary dendrite segment used for counting was at least 50-μm long. Several neurons per coverslip were selected on the basis of healthy morphology. Measurements of individual neurons from three coverslips per culture were averaged. The means were obtained from three different cultures. Data values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired Student's t test.Detection of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) via Three Cube FRET Measurement—The fluorescence imaging work station for FRET was described previously (19Lopez de Armentia M.

Average background signal was determined as the mean fluorescence intensity from an area not expressing the constructs and was subtracted from the raw images before carrying out FRET calculations. The effective FRET efficiency was calculated using the FRET ratio (FR) measurement (22Qiu S. Hua Y.L. Yang F. Chen Y.Z. Luo J.H. J. Biol.

The number following Δ indicates the number of amino acids left after TM4 (Fig. 1, A and B). We then did live cell surface immunocytochemical staining with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody followed by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody, so positive labeling was indicated by numerous red puncta scattered on the cell surface (25Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells to be tested were co-transfected with NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B, or NR2A, NR2B alone. As expected, only cells co-expressing NR1-1a exhibited red puncta, representing surface-expressed GFP-NR2, whereas in cells without NR1-1a, no red puncta were observed (Fig. 1C).To determine which motif in the proximal C terminus of the NR2B subunit is required for cell surface expression of NR1-1a/GFP-NR2B receptors, we transfected HEK293 cells with a series of truncations of this subunit (5 constructs, see above) in the presence of NR1-1a and studied the effect on the cell surface expression of the assembled receptor. We found that, with the exception of NR1-1a/2BΔ2, surface labeling was detected from cells transfected with all the truncations of NR2B (Fig. 2A), suggesting that removal all but three amino acids of the NR2B C terminus still produced receptors that reached the cell surface when co-expressed with NR1-1a. Strikingly, quantification of the percentage of cells with positive labeling (from 3 batches of different transfections) showed no significant difference among the experimental groups examined with expression of the different NR2B truncations (NR1-1a/GFP-NR2B, 73.0 ± 4.7%; NR1-1a/2BΔ59, 56.3 ± 3.3%; NR1-1a/2BΔ5, 60.0 ± 4.8%; NR1-1a/2BΔ4, 57.1 ± 5.5%; NR1-1a/2BΔ3, 53.3 ± 8.5%; Fig. 2B). This suggests that the successful detection of surface-expressed truncates of NR2B was not an exceptional phenomenon observed from a few transfected cells. Of note, the surface expression level of different truncates seemed to vary with the remaining length of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit. The surface expression level of NR2BΔ59 appeared to be no different from that of full-length NR2B based on the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A), which suggests that trafficking and delivery of the NMDARs was relatively unaffected by the loss of the last 585 amino acids of the C terminus. As for NR2BΔ5, NR2BΔ4, and NR2BΔ3, while there was no distinguishable difference between them, we noted an obvious reduction in surface expression level compared with cells expressing the NR1-1a/GFP-NR2B complex (Fig. 2A). These results strongly suggested that at least three amino acids after TM4 were required for the successful delivery of NR1-1a/NR2B receptors to the cell surface. Notably, with only one amino acid difference between NR2BΔ3 and NR2BΔ2, a distinctly different effect on NMDA receptor trafficking was produced.Whole cell current responses were measured to determine the surface expression level of NMDARs in HEK293 cells with the different transfected NR2B truncations. We used focal application of saturating doses of glutamate (100 μm) and glycine (10 μm). The evoked whole cell current represented the number of functional receptors on the cell surface. Representative currents through these truncation mutants evoked by a 500 ms glutamate application are shown in Fig. 2D. The average amplitudes of glutamate-evoked currents in cells expressing either NR1-1a/GFP-NR2B, NR1-1a/2BΔ59, 2BΔ5, 2BΔ4, or 2BΔ3 were 323.6 ± 28.5 (n = 6), 298.7 ± 31.8 (n = 4), 200.0 ± 18.3 (n = 4), 110.5 ± 45.2 (n = 5), or 153.5 ± 28.1 pA (n = 4), respectively (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the live cell surface immunostaining pattern, no responses were detected from cells transfected with the NR1-1a/2BΔ2 complex (n = 10). The average peak currents recorded from cells co-transfected with NR1-1a/2BΔ3, NR1-1a/2BΔ4, and NR1-1a/2BΔ5 were significantly reduced compared with those recorded from cells co-expressing NR1-1a/full-length NR2B, whereas cells expressing NR1-1a/2BΔ59 showed a slight but insignificant decrease in peak currents. This strongly suggests that removal of most (at least 585 amino acids) of the NR2B C terminus does not affect the trafficking and surface expression of functional NR1-1a/NR2B complexes, while the short sequence proximal to TM4, especially the very first three amino acids, plays a crucial role in this process. However, the decreased surface expression level of NR2BΔ5, NR2BΔ4, and NR2BΔ3 suggests that very likely a specific region between 841 and 897 can facilitate the maximal surface expression of NMDARs.It is well known that the sequences of the NR2A and NR2B subunits are highly homologous, but recent studies indicated that the functional role of the C terminus of NR2A may different from that of NR2B subunits. We then investigated the functional role of the NR2A C terminus by following a strategy similar to that used for examining the NR2B C terminus described above. The structures of the different NR2A truncations used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1B. Similarly, all truncates but 2AΔ2 were expressed on the cell surface in the presence of NR1-1a (Fig. 3A). Compared with the 49.3 ± 4.0% of HEK293 cells cotransfected with NR1-1a and GFP-NR2A (full-length) that exhibited positive labeling, all the truncates of NR2A, except NR2AΔ59 (42.7 ± 6.9%), showed significantly fewer transfected cells with detectable red puncta on the surface (7.7 ± 2.4% for NR1-1a/2AΔ3, 22.0 ± 3.5% for NR1-1a/2AΔ4 and 21.3 ± 3.2% for NR1-1a/2AΔ5, summary data in Fig. 3B). This indicated that trafficking of the NR1-1a/NR2A receptor complex was relatively unaffected by the loss of 568 amino acids of the C terminus, while the short sequence of at least three amino acids following the TM4 of NR2A was also necessary for the assembled receptor complex to leave the ER and be expressed on the cell surface. We then made the whole cell recordings to measure glutamate-evoked whole cell currents response by applying a focal saturating dose of glutamate and glycine. The glutamate-evoked currents were detectable in cells transfected with NR1-1a/NR2A (full-length) (131.9 ± 12.1 pA, n = 16), as well as with NR1-1a/2AΔ59 (89.8 ± 38.8 pA, n = 10), NR1-1a/2AΔ5 (99.2 ± 4.1 pA, n = 4), NR1-1a/2AΔ4 (54.5 ± 12.1 pA, n = 4), and NR1-1a/2AΔ3 (58.8 ± 15.5 pA, n = 5) (Fig. 3D). In agreement with the results from surface immunostaining, no glutamate-mediated currents were detected from HEK293 cells co-expressing NR1-1a and 2AΔ2. Taken together, these results suggest that the three amino acid segment after TM4 in the NR2 subunit is necessary for surface expression of the NR1-1a/NR2 receptor complex.FIGURE 3The three amino acid segment following TM4 of the NR2A subunit is critical for the surface expression of NMDA receptors in HEK293 cells.

In agreement with their results, we found that the removal of all but three amino acids of the NR2B C terminus still produced functional NMDARs on the cell surface on co-expression with the NR1 subunit. Therefore, both of our findings can be interpreted similarly that the three amino acid segment following TM4, EHL, is critical for forming a functional receptor on the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W1976839886,"Background Genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing (GRT) in HIV infection with drug resistant virus is recommended to optimize antiretroviral therapy, in particular in patients with virological failure. We estimated the clinical effect, cost and cost-effectiveness of using GRT as compared to expert opinion in patients with antiretroviral treatment failure. Methods We developed a mathematical model of HIV disease to describe disease progression in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure and compared the incremental impact of GRT versus expert opinion to guide antiretroviral therapy. The analysis was conducted from the health care (discount rate 4%) and societal (discount rate 2%) perspective. Outcome measures included life-expectancy, quality-adjusted life-expectancy, health care costs, productivity costs and cost-effectiveness in US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Clinical and economic data were extracted from the large Swiss HIV Cohort Study and clinical trials. Results Patients whose treatment was optimized with GRT versus expert opinion had an increase in discounted life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy of three and two weeks, respectively. Health care costs with and without GRT were $US 421,000 and $US 419,000, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US 35,000 per QALY gained. In the analysis from the societal perspective, GRT versus expert opinion led to an increase in discounted life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy of three and four weeks, respectively. Health care costs with and without GRT were $US 551,000 and $US 549,000, respectively. When productivity changes were included in the analysis, GRT was cost-saving. Conclusions GRT for treatment optimization in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure is a cost-effective use of scarce health care resources and beneficial to the society at large."

Chordate Zic genes control the development of neural and mesodermal tissue, and ecdysozoan Zic homologues control ectodermal and mesodermal development. In vertebrates, there are five Zic genes, each of which has a common or specific function in development. The biological and clinical importance of Zic2, a member of the vertebrate Zic gene family, has been demonstrated by several studies. In humans and mice, mutations of Zic2 result in holoprosencephaly, a forebrain anomaly characterized by loss of midline structures (3Brown S.A. Warburton D. Brown L.Y. Yu C.Y. Roeder E.R. Stengel-Rutkowski S. Hennekam R.C. Muenke M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4Nagai T. Aruga J. Minowa O. Sugimoto T. Ohno Y. Noda T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, Zic2 mutant mice show various abnormalities, including spina bifida, axial/limb skeletal malformation, retinal axon mis-projection, and reduced production of neural crest cells (4Nagai T. Aruga J. Minowa O. Sugimoto T. Ohno Y. Noda T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, overexpression of Zic2 induces expansion of the neural crest and neuroectoderm markers, and depletion of maternal Zic2 results in a gastrulation defect (5Nakata K. Nagai T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although these facts elucidate the versatility of the Zic2 protein, its molecular function is not yet fully understood. Its nuclear localization and the altered expression status of various genes in Zic2-manipulated model animals strongly suggest that Zic2 has a critical role in gene expression, particularly in the transcriptional regulation. In fact, Zic2 overproduction causes marked activation of several promoters, including those of apolipoprotein E (apoE), SV40, adenovirus major late, HSV thymidine kinase, and Zic1 (6Salero E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An intriguing point of the transcriptional activation capacity of Zic protein is its broad range of target genes (6Salero E. Perez-Sen R. Aruga J. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1881-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Mizugishi K. Aruga J. Nakata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This feature is consistent in vertebrate Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3. A similar capacity seems to be possessed by the urochordate Zic homologue Macho-1, because Macho-1 overproduction causes enhanced expression of a broad range of genes (8Yagi K. Satoh N. Satou Y. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In structural terms, Zic2 protein possesses two functional domains known as Zic Opa-conserved (ZOC) and ZF. The ZF domain is composed of a tandem repeat of five C2H2 ZF motifs that is very similar to those of the Gli and Glis families (1Aruga J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A crystallographic study of Gli1 has shown that it binds DNA with the last four fingers (9Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), where the similarity is particularly high between Gli and Zic families. ZOC is a stretch of around 10 amino acid residues, initially found to be conserved between the mouse and fly Zic homologues. A recent molecular phylogenic study has indicated that both ZOC and ZF have been retained in several animal phyla, suggesting the importance of these domains (10Aruga J. Kamiya A. Takahashi H. Fujimi T.J. Shimizu Y. Ohkawa K. Yazawa S. Umesono Y. Noguchi H. Shimizu T. Saitou N. Mikoshiba K. Sakaki Y. Agata K. Toyoda A. Genomics. 2006; 87: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous structure-function analyses have indicated that ZF can bind to GC-rich DNA target sequences (1Aruga J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Mizugishi K. Aruga J. Nakata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) whereas the N-terminal region, including ZOC, plays a role in transcriptional regulation (11Mizugishi K. Hatayama M. Tohmonda T. Ogawa M. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the function of ZF is not limited to DNA binding, because ZF has significant transcriptional ability, even in the absence of clear binding sequences (11Mizugishi K. Hatayama M. Tohmonda T. Ogawa M. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the case of ZOC, it is known that I-mfa, a repressor of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factor, can bind to the region, including ZOC, and can inhibit the transcriptional activation by exporting the Zic2 protein from cell nuclei (11Mizugishi K. Hatayama M. Tohmonda T. Ogawa M. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The above circumstances led us to investigate the molecular machinery that mediates transcriptional regulation by the Zic2 protein. We report here the isolation and characterization of two novel types of molecular complexes that include Zic2 protein. Our results suggest that the assemblies of these two complexes are essential for Zic2-dependent transcriptional activation. Our results also present a new role for DNA-dependent protein kinase in transcriptional regulation.

To concentrate it, the eluted 0.3 m fraction was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), loaded onto DE52 (0.1 ml), and eluted with buffer containing 0.2 m KCl. Eluted proteins were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and samples (0.5 ml) were collected after 40 ml had been eluted. Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—Peaks of Zic2-containing complexes were concentrated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained proteins were cleaved by trypsin, and these fragments were used in the analysis by ion trap mass spectrometer, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry system, LCQ-DECA XP (Thermo-Quest). The data were analyzed by using the MASCOT search program (Matrix Science, London, UK). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—We performed in vitro phosphorylation using affinity-purified protein FLAG-HA-Zic2 (200 ng), baculovirus recombinant RHA (100 ng), PARP (N-terminal His6-tagged) (100 ng), and active DNA-PK (100 units) (Promega). The proteins were mixed into the reaction buffer (final concentration: 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 75 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40) containing 100 ng of pGL4-apoE plasmid, 0.2 mm ATP, and 4.6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 14-μl reaction mixture, and the reaction was started by the addition of 1 μl (100 units) DNA-PK. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to imaging plates (Fuji) and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (BAS2500, Fuji). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected with the following antibodies using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-RHA antibody was generated in rabbits by using an E. coli recombinant C-terminal His6-tagged protein fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–299. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma); anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science); anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Medical and Biological Laboratories); anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma); anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma); anti-DNA-PK (StressGen); anti-Ku70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Ku86 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-acetylhistone H3 [Ac-Lys9] (Sigma); anti-dimethylhistone H3 [Me-Lys9] (Upstate); anti-TBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-TFIIB (Pharmingen), anti-pol II (8WG16: CTD of RPB1) (QED Bioscience); anti-PARP (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch); anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch); anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch); anti-mouse IgG Alexa 488 (Invitrogen); anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (Invitrogen); anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 (Invitrogen); and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 594 (Invitrogen). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—Transfected cells were washed and harvested in PBS(-) containing 1 mm PMSF, and total cell extracts were prepared with lysis wash buffer 150 (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF). The extracts were incubated with 5 μl of anti-HA or anti-FLAG affinity beads at 4 °C for 6 h. E10.5 mouse whole embryo and adult mouse cerebellum protein extracts were prepared by homogenization in the buffer. After centrifugation of the samples, the proteins in the supernatants were quantified, and 0.5 ml of diluted 0.5 mg/ml extracts were used for this assay. The protein extracts were mixed at 4 °C for 6 h with 5 μl of anti-Zic2 serum or preimmune serum, together with 5 μl of protein A affinity beads, and analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. For preparation of de-phosphorylated Zic2 protein, HA-Zic2 was first produced in 293T cells by transfection and was then immobilized on beads by incubating the cell lysate with anti-HA affinity beads. The beads were washed with lysis wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 units of active or inactivated CIP (heat-treated at 65 °C for 40 min with 1 mm EDTA). Beads were washed with high salt buffer (the buffer containing 500 mm NaCl) two times and then used in this binding assay. For immunoprecipitation, recombinant RHA, PARP, and purified DNA-PK (50 ng each) were mixed with the beads in lysis wash buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. GST Pulldown Assay—FLAG-HA-Zic2 and Zic2-interacting proteins (FLAG-HA-DNA-PKcs, FLAG-HA-RHA, FLAG-HA-PARP, and HA-Ku70/FLAG-Ku80 dimer) were overproduced in 293T cells by transfection of double-tagged expression plasmids or cotransfection of FLAG- and HA-tagged protein expression plasmids. Cells on 2-1–cm dishes were harvested and lysed in 4 ml of lysis wash buffer 300 (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF), and total cell extracts were incubated with anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma), 40 μl at 4 °C for 6 h. These beads were washed three times, and the bound proteins were eluted with 0.8 μl of the lysis wash buffer 300 containing 100 μg/ml HA peptide. Eluted proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma), 10 μl for 12 h, and after the beads had been washed three times, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 ml of FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml). Any free peptides were eliminated by use of a centrifugal filter (Microcon YM-50; Millipore), and purified proteins were used for GST pulldown assays. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-Ku70 and GST-Ku80 were produced in E. coli (BL21) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, as described (15Ishiguro A. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GST-Zic2 was additionally purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography with a NaCl gradient. C-terminal His6-tagged proteins TBPch6 and TFIIBch6 were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction with an A600 of 0.4 at 37 °C (in LB media containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin). Harvested cells were disrupted in the buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm PMSF) containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. After sonication, the extracts were centrifuged and loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with the buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and protein was eluted by the buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. After dialysis against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA), samples were loaded onto a heparin CL6B column, and proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 400–600 mm NaCl. GST and GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated together with the purified proteins for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Interacting proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer and detected by Western blotting analysis using anti-HA (3F10) antibody. Immunofluorescence Staining—PK34S and PK33S cell lines were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-Zic2 alone or together with pCMV-FLAG-Ku70 or pCMV-FLAG-Ku80. After 24 h, the cells were used for the immunofluorescence staining and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy as described (11Mizugishi K. Hatayama M. Tohmonda T. Ogawa M. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preparation of Baculovirus Recombinant Proteins—A Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used for producing recombinant PARP and RHA proteins. Recombinant bacmids were generated by transformation of E. coli strain DH10bac by pFastBac-His6-PARP and pFastBac-His6-GST-TEV-RHA. Recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected to Sf9 insect cells, and the viruses generated were used for protein production. Two hundred milliliters of infected culture kept for three overnights was washed with PBS(-) containing 1 mm PMSF and harvested; the cells were then disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF). His6-PARP was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads (20 μl) in 1.5-ml microtubes and washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and dialyzed against dialysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for use in the in vitro assay. GST-His6-RHA protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl). After the beads had been washed with buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with buffer containing 10 μm reduced glutathione. Purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm EDTA and then digested by addition of an enhanced form of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) and 1 mm DTT (final concentration). After dialysis of the sample against dialysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the digested GST protein and an enhanced form of tobacco etch virus protease were removed by using Ni-NTA-agarose beads and glutathione-Sepharose beads. Gel Shift Assay—A promoter containing the DNA fragment was prepared by PCR amplification of the apoE promoter region -78 to +40 by using the IRD700 (LI-COR) end-labeled primers 5′-IRD700-GCACAGCCCGCCCTAGCCCTGAGG-3′, 5′-IRD700-GCTCCTTCCGAAACAAGTCCTTAGCC-3′, and pGL4-apoE as a template. Protein-DNA complexes (100 fmol of DNA, 100 ng of F-HA-Zic2, and 100 ng of RHA for one reaction) were formed as described (15Ishiguro A. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and analyzed using 4% polyacrylamide gel and an infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Odyssey). Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously (7Mizugishi K. Aruga J. Nakata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter plasmid pGL4 or pGL4-apoE (200 ng) was cotransfected with pEFBOS or pEFBOS-Zic2 (800 ng) and pEF-LacZ (200 ng). For the analysis in Fig. 7B, pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA-HA-PARP (200 ng) was also cotransfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega) using a luminometer, Minilumat LB 9506 (Berthold). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR Assay—We performed the ChIP-PCR assay as described (16Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A40 cell extracts, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Zic2 and the components of the complexes, and normal rabbit serum were used for the immunoprecipitation. The precipitates were subjected for the PCR analysis using specific primers for apoE 5′ upstream sequence (5′-AGGCTCTGTGGGCCGTGCTGTTGG-3′ and 5′-TGGCCCGTGTCTCCTCCGCCACTG-3′) (6Salero E. Perez-Sen R. Aruga J. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1881-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (5′-CCGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTCTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCAGAGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3′) (17Hoshino J. Aruga J. Ishiguro A. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 120: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To identify the essential functions of Zic2 protein, we purified Zic2-containing molecular complexes. N-terminal HA (hemagglutinin antigen)-tagged Zic2 expression vector was transfected into 293T cells. HA-Zic2 protein and interacting proteins were affinity-purified by anti-HA antibody immobilized beads. Bound proteins were eluted with HA peptide (Fig. 1, A and B), fractionated on Bio-Rex70, and concentrated by DE52 columns (Fig. 1A). The purified protein complexes were subjected to gel filtration analysis. Two high molecular weight complexes were separated by the gel filtration. One (complex I) had a molecular weight of more than 700,000 and the other (complex II) was between 232,000 and 440,000 (Fig. 1C). The components of complex I and complex II were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Complex I contained a DNA-PKcs, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Ku80, and Ku70, whereas RNA helicase A (RHA), Ku80, and Ku70 were identified in complex II (Fig. 1D). The components in each fraction were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). To confirm the existence of complex I and complex II in vivo, we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using anti-Zic2 antibody. DNA-PKcs, RHA, PARP, Ku80, and Ku70 were coprecipitated with Zic2 from both E10.5 mouse whole embryo and adult cerebellum tissue lysates (Fig. 1, F and G). These results suggest that Zic2 is contained in complex I and complex II in vivo. DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 (Ku86) are known as subunits of a serine-threonine kinase, DNA-PK, which plays essential roles in V(D)J recombination, repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, and transcriptional regulation (18Blunt T.

https://openalex.org/W2031625420,"The site of cocaine binding on the dopamine transporter (DAT) was investigated using the photoactivatable irreversible cocaine analog [125I]3β-(p-chlorophenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid, 4′-azido-3′-iodophenylethyl ester ([125I]RTI 82). The incorporation site of this compound was mapped to transmembrane domains (TMs) 4–6 using epitope-specific immunoprecipitation of trypsin fragments and further localized using cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which hydrolyzes proteins on the C-terminal side of methionine residues. CNBr hydrolysis of [125I]RTI 82-labeled rat striatal and expressed human DATs produced fragments of ∼5–10 kDa consistent with labeling between Met271/272 or Met290 in TM5 to Met370/371 in TM7. To further define the incorporation site, substitution mutations were made that removed endogenous methionines and inserted exogenous methionines in combinations that would generate labeled CNBr fragments of distinct masses depending on the labeling site. The results obtained were consistent with the presence of TM6 but not TMs 4, 5, or 7 in the labeled fragments, with additional support for these conclusions obtained by epitope-specific immunoprecipitation and secondary digestion of CNBr fragments with endoproteinase Lys-C. The final localization of [125I]RTI 82 incorporation to rat DAT Met290–Lys336 and human DAT I291M to R344M provides positive evidence for the proximity of cocaine binding to TM6. Residues in and near DAT TM6 regulate transport and transport-dependent conformational states, and TM6 forms part of the substrate permeation pathway in the homologous Aquifex aeolicus leucine transporter. Cocaine binding near TM6 may thus overlap the dopamine translocation pathway and function to inhibit TM6 structural rearrangements necessary for transport.

DA reuptake is necessary for appropriate control of dopaminergic function and may be dysregulated in disorders such as Parkinson disease and drug abuse (1Miller G.W. Gainetdinov R.R. Levey A.I. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 424-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Cocaine and many other compounds bind to DAT and inhibit DA reuptake, resulting in increased transmitter levels believed to mediate drug reinforcement (2Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S. Kuhar M.J. Science. 1987; 237: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar). Despite extensive pharmacological investigation of transport inhibitors, the molecular mechanisms by which they are recognized by DAT and exert their effects remain largely unknown. DAT and the related norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (NET and SERT) are integral membrane proteins that consist of 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), connecting intracellular (IL) and extracellular (EL) loops, and intracellular N and C termini (3Shimada S. Kitayama S. Lin C.-L. Patel A. Nanthakumar E. Gregor P. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G. Science. 1991; 254: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Substrate translocation is thought to occur by an alternating access mechanism that sequentially exposes extracellular and intracellular portions of the substrate permeation pathway to opposite sides of the membrane (4Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of these proteins are unknown, although they are recently proposed to be similar to that of the homologous Aquifex aeolicus leucine transporter, LeuTAa (5Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The substrate binding site on LeuTAa is composed of residues from TMs 1, 3, 6, and 8, and some analogous sites have been identified in DAT, NET, and SERT (6Surratt C.K. Ukairo O.T. Ramanujapuram S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E739-E751Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Volz T.J. Schenk J.O. Synapse. 2005; 58: 72-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). LeuTAa, however, is not cocaine-sensitive, and its structure does not indicate how cocaine or other uptake blockers might interact at monoamine transporters. Cocaine binding to DAT is reduced by mutagenesis of many amino acids throughout the primary sequence (6Surratt C.K. Ukairo O.T. Ramanujapuram S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E739-E751Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Volz T.J. Schenk J.O. Synapse. 2005; 58: 72-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but in most cases it is not clear if these effects are due to disruption of specific ligand interaction sites or to conformational alterations that indirectly impact binding. Thus the structure of the inhibitor binding site on DAT and the identities of the residues that dock cocaine and other blockers remain largely unknown. Using photoaffinity labeling as a positive function approach to investigate inhibitor binding domains, our laboratory has found two distinct regions of DAT containing TMs 1–2 and TMs 4–7 that are incorporation sites for photoactive cocaine, benztropine, and GBR analogs (8Vaughan R.A. Agoston G.E. Lever J. Newman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 630-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vaughan R.A. Gaffaney J.D. Wang N. Lever J. Reith M.E.A. Dutta A. Mol.

Meth. 2005; 143: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of the GBR compounds labels both domains, suggesting that the sites are adjacent and form a binding pocket for multiple classes of transport inhibitors. Of the photoaffinity labels analyzed to date, the cocaine analog [125I]RTI 82 (Fig. 1) is the only one that becomes incorporated solely into the TM 4–7 region (10Vaughan R.A. Parnas M.L. Gaffaney J.D. Lowe M.J. Wirtz S. Pham A. Reed B. Dutta S.M. Murray K.K. Justice J.B. J. Neurosci. Meth. 2005; 143: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More precise identification of its incorporation site, however, has been limited by the use of antibody-based procedures. In this study we use chemical cleavage and site-directed mutagenesis to further localize the site of [125I]RTI 82 attachment and identify its incorporation in a sequence containing TM6. This increases our understanding of the structure of the cocaine binding pocket on DAT and the molecular mechanism of cocaine action.

HEK 293 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA); electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA); cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen; protease inhibitors and FuGENE transfection reagents and trypsin were from Roche Applied Science; endoproteinase Lys-C was from Wako (Richmond, VA); cyanogen bromide, (-)-cocaine, GBR 12909, nomifensine, mazindol, desipramine, and imipramine were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); (+)-cocaine was the generous gift of Dr. Maarten Reith (New York University); the QuikChange mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene; and synthetic oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Genscript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA) and were housed and treated in accordance with regulations approved by the University of North Dakota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In Situ Proteolysis—Labeling of rat striatal tissue with [125I]RTI 82, in situ proteolysis, and DAT immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as previously described (15Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21672-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For pharmacological analysis of photolabeling, (-)-cocaine, (+)-cocaine, GBR 12909, mazindol, nomifensine, desipramine, or imipramine were added to the photolabel binding reaction to final concentrations of 1 or 10 μm. For proteolysis studies photolabeled rat striatal membrane suspensions were treated with or without 20–200 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, and membranes were centrifuged, washed, and solubilized. Photolabeled DAT and DAT fragments were immunoprecipitated with antiserum 16 generated against rDAT N-terminal amino acids 42–59 or antiserum 5 directed against rDAT EL2 amino acids 225–242 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A 3×FLAG-His6-human (h) DAT cDNA in pcDNA3.1/His® vector was kindly provided by Dr. J. B. Justice, Jr. (Emory University). This sequence contained a previously described arginine to methionine variation at residue 344 (16Eshleman A.J. Neve R.L. Janowsky Neve K.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 276-283PubMed Google Scholar). The methionine was reconverted to arginine using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the resulting product is indicated as the wild-type (WT) protein. Several additional point mutations were made singly or in combinations in the hDAT WT or R344M backgrounds to remove or insert methionines to generate custom CNBr cleavage sites. The mutations made were M272L, M272L/I291M, M272L/R344M, and M272L/I291M/R344M, and all were confirmed by sequencing the entire hDAT coding region (Northwoods DNA, Solway, MN). Cell Culture—Initial experiments on hDAT were performed using HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hDAT R344M variant, which has been previously characterized (16Eshleman A.J. Neve R.L. Janowsky Neve K.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 276-283PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and subsequently modified by the addition of a 3×FLAG-His6 epitope tag at the N terminus (10Vaughan R.A. Parnas M.L. Gaffaney J.D. Lowe M.J. Wirtz S. Pham A. Reed B. Dutta S.M. Murray K.K. Justice J.B. J. Neurosci. Meth. 2005; 143: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For generation of new cell lines expressing methionine mutants, HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 5% CO2/95% O2 at 37 °C. Cells in 12-well plates were transfected with the indicated mutant plasmids using FuGENE transfection reagent and 0.5 μg of DNA/well, and transformed cells were selected after 24 h by addition of 400 μg/ml G418 to the culture medium. Stably transfected cell pools were grown to 70–80% confluence in 12- or 24-well plates for use. DAT expression was verified by Western blotting cell lysates with hDAT monoclonal antibody 369 (MAB 369, Chemicon International) as previously described (Gaffaney and Vaughan (18Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). [3H]DA Transport and [3H]CFT Binding Assays—Cells expressing WT and mutant DATs were assayed for [3H]DA transport and [3H]CFT binding essentially as previously described (18Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 24-well plates, washed with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and assayed in triplicate for DA transport using 10 nm [3H]DA plus 10 μm DA in KRH and using 30 μm (-)-cocaine to define nonspecific uptake. Assays were conducted for 8 min at 37 °C, transport was stopped by washing cells with ice-cold buffer, and cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. For [3H]CFT binding, washed cells were incubated in triplicate with 5 nm radioligand in KRH for 1 h at 0°C using 30 μm (-)-cocaine to define nonspecific binding. Binding was stopped by washing cells with ice-cold buffer, and cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity in solubilized uptake and binding lysates was assessed by liquid scintillation counting at 62% efficiency. IC50 values for cocaine inhibition of [3H]DA uptake and [3H]CFT binding were determined by conducting assays in the presence of 10-9–10-3 m (-)-cocaine. All uptake and binding assays were performed at least three times with similar results. Non-linear regression analysis and analysis of variance were performed using Prism 3 software. Photoaffinity Labeling—For irreversible labeling of hDAT with [125I]RTI 82, cells expressing WT or mutant proteins were washed once with KRH and incubated with 5 nm radioligand in KRH buffer for 1 h on ice with shaking to allow reversible binding to occur. Cells were then irradiated with 254 nm ultraviolet light for 45 s to covalently attach the ligand to DAT, washed once with ice-cold KRH buffer, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors on ice for 1 h with shaking. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. Electrophoresis and Autoradiography—Photoaffinity-labeled samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography on 10% acrylamide gels for intact DAT or 17–20% or 18% acrylamide gels for peptide fragments using high and low range Rainbow markers as molecular mass standards (15Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21672-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For gel purification of DAT the 80-kDa region of the gel containing labeled protein was excised, and the was protein extracted by electroelution as previously described (19Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar). Electroeluted samples were dialyzed against MilliQ purified water in 10-kDa cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce) and evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator. CNBr Hydrolysis—Dried electroeluted samples were incubated for 24 h at 22 °C in the dark with 0.1 ml of 1 m CNBr prepared in 70% formic acid or with 70% formic acid only (20Crimmins D.L. Mische S.M. Denslow N.D. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2005: 11.4.1-11.4.2Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of water followed by drying in a SpeedVac concentrator, and the resulting pellets were subjected to three additional rounds of suspension in water and drying. Dried samples were either prepared directly for electrophoresis by solubilization in gel sample buffer or were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for immunoprecipitation with antiserum 5. All CNBr digestion experiments were replicated two to six times with similar results. Molecular masses of CNBr and trypsin fragments were calculated using the ExPASy peptide mass program (us.expasy.org/tools/peptide-mass.html). For ease of discussion, the fragments obtained by CNBr or trypsin digestion are referred to by their flanking methionine or arginine and lysine residues, although at the N termini the fragments begin at the residues following the cleavage sites. The residue numbers used to designate fragments or mutagenesis sites in various experiments are specific for rDAT or hDAT isoforms, which differ by one position at most of the sites discussed. Lys-C Digestion of CNBr Fragment—CNBr digestion and electrophoresis of [125I]RTI 82-labeled rDAT were performed as described above. The gel region containing the labeled fragment was excised, and the peptide was eluted by rotating gel pieces in 1 ml of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, overnight at 21 °C. The eluate was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 9.0, and treated with 10 μg/ml endoproteinase Lys-C for 1 h at 37 °C. Digested samples were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Pharmacology of [125I]RTI 82 Labeling of DAT—To examine the pharmacological specificity of [125I]RTI 82 binding to DAT, labeling was performed in the presence of several DA transport blockers (Fig. 2). Labeling obtained in the control sample was completely displaced by the DA uptake blockers (-)-cocaine, mazindol, GBR 12909, and nomifensine, but was not affected by (+)-cocaine or the NET and SERT blockers desipramine and imipramine. These findings reflect the ability of these compounds to inhibit the reversible binding of [125I]RTI 82 to DAT and support the hypothesis that irreversible ligand attachment occurs in or near a pharmacologically relevant region of the protein. Tryptic Mapping of [125I]RTI 82-Labeling Site—In situ proteolysis of [125I]RTI 82-labeled rat striatal membranes with trypsin, which cleaves polypeptides at the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine residues, yielded several fragments of DAT that were immunoprecipitated by EL2 antibody 5 (Fig. 3A). Prominent fragments of ∼32, 25, and 16 kDa produced by 20 μg/ml trypsin have been previously characterized (15Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21672-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These fragments are not glycosylated (15Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21672-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that their N termini are generated by cleavage at Arg218 in EL2 (Fig. 3B), which is the only trypsin site between epitope 5 and the N-glycosylation residues. The 32-kDa fragment also precipitates with a C-terminal tail antibody and thus contains all of the TMs between Arg218 and the C terminus, while the other fragments lose the C-terminal epitope, indicating cleavage between Arg218 and the C-terminal tail. Although the 16-kDa fragment is the smallest trypsin product previously identified, in more recent studies using higher trypsin concentrations (200 μg/ml) we isolated a serum 5-precipitable-labeled fragment that migrated at ∼10 kDa (Fig. 3A, arrow). Because in situ proteolysis is performed using membrane suspensions, residues within the TMs are protected from protease and only amino acids in exposed loops are accessible to enzyme. Based on the LeuTAa structure, lysine and arginine residues in rat (r) DAT between Arg218 and the C-terminal tail that are exposed and could produce fragments of ∼25, 16, and 10 and kDa are present in IL5 (Lys514 and Arg520), EL4 (Lys373 and Arg379), and IL3 (Lys336 and Arg343), respectively (Fig. 3B). Retention of the photoaffinity label in the 16-kDa fragment thus indicates that ligand attachment occurs N-terminal to EL4, and the mass difference between the labeled 16- and 10-kDa fragments is consistent with excision of TM7 and retention of label in TMs 4–6 (Fig. 3B). The 10-kDa fragment is the smallest [125I]RTI 82-labeled peptide we have been able to precipitate with antibody 5, because more extensive proteolysis with trypsin separates the labeled domain from the antibody epitope (10Vaughan R.A. Parnas M.L. Gaffaney J.D. Lowe M.J. Wirtz S. Pham A. Reed B. Dutta S.M. Murray K.K. Justice J.B. J. Neurosci. Meth. 2005; 143: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CNBr Mapping of [125I]RTI 82-Labeling Site—To more precisely define the [125I]RTI 82 incorporation site on DAT we undertook a study to map photolabeled sites using cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of methionines. Both rat and human (h) DAT have a limited number of methionines in their sequence (Fig. 4). Within the first seven TMs of hDAT endogenous methionines are present at positions 1 and 11 in the N-terminal tail; 106, 111, and 116 in TM2; 272 in TM5; and 371 at the extracellular end of TM7 (Fig. 4, black circles). The analogous methionines plus another two at positions 173 in EL2 and 290 at the extracellular end of TM5 are present in rDAT (Fig. 4, open circles). The remaining six methionines in TMs 8–12 are present in both hDAT and rDAT, but are C-terminal to the [125I]RTI 82-labeling site and do not impact the results presented here. Our initial CNBr mapping studies were done with the hDAT R344M variant isolated by Eshleman et al. (16Eshleman A.J. Neve R.L. Janowsky Neve K.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 276-283PubMed Google Scholar); this residue is indicated by the gray circle in Fig. 4. To determine the cleavage pattern of [125I]RTI 82-labeled DAT with CNBr we used gel-purified, electroeluted DAT as the starting sample. Because the pharmacological displacement of [125I]RTI 82 photolabeling demonstrates that DAT is the only radiolabeled protein that electrophoreses at ∼80 kDa (Fig. 2) (15Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21672-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), gel purification produces a starting sample in which all radioactivity originates from DAT, and thus all radioactive fragments generated are DAT cleavage products. In contrast to in situ proteolysis of native protein where TM residues are protected from cleavage, the gel-purified protein is denatured and solubilized, potentially exposing all sites to protease. Several findings described below indicate that all of the methionines surrounding the photolabeled site in the gel-purified protein were CNBr-accessible, thus our discussions are oriented toward description of complete cleavage products. Proteolysis of gel-purified [125I]RTI 82-labeled rDAT with CNBr is shown in Fig. 5A. The untreated protein migrated at ∼80 kDa (lane 1), consistent with its original mass, whereas after CNBr treatment most of the intact sample disappeared and the radioactivity appeared as a discrete band of ∼5–8 kDa (lane 3, arrow). This fragment was produced with good stoichiometry (30–60% recovery) and thus represents a major photolabeling site. The same cleavage pattern was obtained with shorter and longer CNBr treatment times, indicating that the fragment is a limit digestion product, and in most experiments only minor levels of higher Mr incomplete cleavage products were present, indicating close to complete hydrolysis. In this gel and other experiments (see Fig. 7) the fragment migrated as a broad but evenly labeled band and on other gels (see Figs. 6 and 8) displayed a narrower appearance, consistent with the presence of a single peptide.FIGURE 7CNBr analysis of [125I]RTI 82-labeled hDAT methionine mutants. A, WT, R344M, M272L/I290M/R344M, and M272L/R344M hDATs were labeled with [125I]RTI 82 and gel-purified. Equal amounts of radioactivity were subjected to treatment with or without CNBr as indicated followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography on a 17–20% gel. Schematic diagrams of the first three proteins below the autoradiograph indicate the positions of endogenous and engineered methionines cleaved to produce the fragments obtained (black circles), Met371 that remains in the sequence but does not affect the masses of labeled fragments (open circle), and protein regions consistent with masses of labeled fragments (shading).

Cocaine displacement of labeling for the sample in lane 2 was obscured by overexposure from lane 1, but aliquots of the same preparations in lanes 5 and 6 show the blockade of [125I]RTI 82 labeling.

https://openalex.org/W1976536656,"The Y chromosome has recently been suggested to have an association with prostate cancer risk in human populations. Since this chromosome is haploid and lacks recombination over most of its length, haplotypes constructed from binary markers throughout the chromosome can be used for association studies. To assess the possible Y-chromosomal contribution to prostate cancer risk, we have therefore analyzed 14 Y-chromosomal binary markers in 106 prostate cancer cases and 110 controls from the Korean population. In contrast to previous findings in the Japanese population, no statistically significant difference in the distribution of Y-chromosomal haplogroup frequencies was observed between the case and control groups of Koreans. Thus, our data imply that the previously reported associations between Y-chromosomal lineages and a predisposition to, or protection against, prostate cancer might be explained by statistical fluctuations, or by genetic effects that are seen only in some environments."
https://openalex.org/W2015086269,"Expression of Hox genes is tightly regulated in spatial and temporal domains. Evx2 is located next to Hoxd13 within 8 kb on the opposite DNA strand. Early in development, the pattern of Hoxd13 expression resembles that of Evx2 in limb and genital buds. After 10 dpc, however, Evx2 begins to be expressed in CNS as well. We analyzed the region responsible for these differences using ES cell techniques, and found that the intergenic region between Evx2 and Hoxd13 behaves as a boundary element that functions differentially in space and time, specifically in the development of limbs, genital bud, and brain. This boundary element comprises a large sequence spanning several kilobases that can be divided into at least two units: a constitutive boundary element, which blocks transcription regulatory influences from the chromosomal environment, and a regulatory element, which controls the function of the constitutive boundary element in time and space."

In order to identify regions of ASLV Env that can regulate this process, a genetic selection method was used to identify subgroup B (ASLV-B) virus-infected cells resistant to low pH-triggered fusion when incubated with cells expressing the cognate TVB receptor. The subgroup B viral Env (envB) genes were then isolated from these cells and characterized by DNA sequencing. This led to identification of two frequent EnvB alterations which allowed TVB receptor-binding but altered the pH-threshold of membrane fusion activation: a 13 amino acid deletion in the host range 1 (hr1) region of the surface (SU) EnvB subunit, and the A32V amino acid change within the fusion peptide of the transmembrane (TM) EnvB subunit. These data indicate that these two regions of EnvB can influence the pH threshold of fusion activation."

Despite opposition by the Australian Prime Minister, the Senate and House of Representatives voted to adopt the recommendations of the Lockhart Review and approve human somatic cell nuclear transfer, thus providing a consistent national policy for all researchers in Australia. A conscience vote of individual parliamentarians in the Australian government last month regarding amendments to current legislation regulating human embryonic stem cell research yielded a surprising outcome. Despite opposition by the Australian Prime Minister, the Senate and House of Representatives voted to adopt the recommendations of the Lockhart Review and approve human somatic cell nuclear transfer, thus providing a consistent national policy for all researchers in Australia. Australia has an outstanding record in reproductive biology research and clinical translation commencing with the first child born by in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 1980 (2 years after Steptoe's and Edward's original IVF success in the UK) and the first live birth from a frozen IVF embryo in 1983 (Leeton, 2004Leeton J. Australian and New Zealand J. Obst. Gynaecol. 2004; 44: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Today, approximately 2% of births in Australia involve some form of assisted reproductive technology. The techniques that are essential for assisted reproductive technology, including human egg collection and the creation and freezing of embryos, are also the core methodologies by which human embryonic stem cells are isolated. The Australian government's commitment to human embryonic stem cell research seemed assured in 2002 with the award of $98.5 million in federal grants to establish the Australian Stem Cell Centre in Melbourne. The center conducts research on both embryonic and adult stem cells, tissue repair, and immune modulation. Simultaneously, the Australian parliament began debating legislation to regulate the use of human embryos in research. Legislation was enacted that allowed the granting of licenses to use surplus IVF embryos for research but banned somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) (Wilmut et al., 1997Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar), a technique that can be used to generate patient-specific human embryonic stem cell lines for the study of different diseases. Since 2002, only nine licenses for experimentation involving human embryos have been issued: five for further development of assisted reproductive technologies and four for derivation of new human embryonic stem cell lines. As part of this legislation, the Australian government commissioned an independent committee chaired by former federal judge John Lockhart to review the effects of these regulations on assisted reproduction and on research efforts and their possible therapeutic applications. After reviewing over 1000 submissions and international practices and after extensive discussions with state governments, other stakeholders, and the community, the Lockhart Review committee produced 54 recommendations for the government to consider and proposed amending current legislation to allow SCNT under license and following strict guidelines (Australian Government, 2005Australian Government (2005). Legislation Review: Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002, Reports, Canberra, 284 pages. http://www.lockhartreview.com.au/reports.html.Google Scholar). A key observation of the Lockhart Review was that there is no single societal view on research using human embryos. Rather, such research encompasses many questions of fundamental scientific, religious, and moral importance. There are many strongly held, and often entrenched positions, and the reality is that very few of the opponents or proponents would be expected to change their minds. Because of these divergent views, the committee accepted that some disagreement would remain, whether or not any changes were made to the existing legislation. However, the committee also noted broad community support for medical research and for clinically assisting people to have children, even though this process involves the “wastage” of some embryos. The Lockhart Review argued that even though some people think that an activity is unethical, it does not follow that such an activity should be illegal. The committee considered that the wider the range of ethical views on a particular activity, the weaker the case for declaring that activity illegal. SCNT was highlighted as the Rubicon over which public opinion was divided. The Lockhart Review recognized that apart from outright support or outright opposition, there were three major arguments concerning SCNT that the government needed to consider.•“It is wrong to create human embryos with the sole purpose of destroying them for the derivation of stem cells.” The committee agreed that human embryonic clones created by SCNT are human embryos with the capability, under certain (prohibited) conditions, of developing into humans. However, the committee stated that the question of intent was important. Under these circumstances there was no intent to create a human but rather a collection of cells that are identical to, and therefore an extension of, the tissues of the donor. Further, the committee took the view that the moral significance of cloned embryos that are not implanted is more linked to their potential for research into treatments for serious diseases and not their potential as human lives. The committee recognized that this view is supported by many people but is also unacceptable to many others.•“Community support for medical research and acceptance of processes aimed at assisting people to have children.” The current use and wide acceptance of assisted reproductive technologies means that excess human embryos are currently created knowing that those not used for procreation are destined for destruction. A number of Australian states require the destruction of surplus IVF embryos after 5 or 10 years. These embryos are allowed, under current strict legal guidelines, to be used for both IVF and stem cell research. The committee regarded as inconsistent the position of accepting one destructive use and denying another, particularly when both uses aim to alleviate medical conditions, either infertility or a range of serious diseases.•“The slippery slope.” Although SCNT may be intended for good, for example, to produce patient-specific human embryonic stem cell lines for studying different diseases (therapeutic cloning), it could also be used for unethical purposes, for example, to produce live born humans from embryos generated by SCNT (reproductive cloning). One argument put forward to the committee was that allowing the former will inevitably lead to the latter. However, the Lockhart Review committee had already recommended that human reproductive cloning should continue to be prohibited on the grounds of both ethics and safety, and so the “slippery slope” argument was rejected. The committee did note that when considering currently prohibited practices involving embryos (including embryos created by SCNT or other methods not involving fertilization of eggs by sperm or embryos with genetic material from more than two people) the strongest community objection was to the implantation of such embryos into a woman's body or to their development beyond 14 days. Thus, the committee recommended that a number of currently prohibited practices involving human embryos should be permitted under strict legal guidelines providing that such embryos do not develop beyond 14 days and are not implanted into a woman's or animal's body. In recommending that SCNT be permitted under license, the Lockhart Review did emphasize concerns about the difficult issues surrounding human egg donation and the possibility of donor coercion, a situation that arose during the research of Woo-Suk Hwang in South Korea (Magnus and Cho, 2005Magnus D.

So strict guidelines were proposed to protect against such abuse. The Lockhart Review also reported several unexpected findings, such as that current legislation adversely impacted the practice of reproductive medicine (by restricting training of technicians for assisted reproductive technologies, and by effectively banning sperm competency tests that use mammalian eggs). A second unexpected issue was the lack of requests from researchers for creating human embryos for research by the union of sperm and egg, which is currently permitted in the UK under strict guidelines but not in Australia. After considering the Lockhart Review, the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, opposed adopting the committee's recommendations (Howard, 2006Howard, J.W. (2006). http://www.pm.gov.au/news/media_releases/media_Release1989.html.Google Scholar). Within the Australian government, the split opinions of politicians seemed to reflect a similar split among the general public (Murphy, 2006Murphy, K. (2006). http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/battle-lines-drawn-on-stem-cell-research/2006/04/05/1143916593243.html.Google Scholar). Following considerable public debate, and equivalent debate by the cabinet and party room of the Government, the Prime Minister announced the highly unusual step of allowing all parliamentarians to take a conscience vote on any bill pertaining to adoption of amended legislation. Senator Kay Patterson, a former Health Minister, sponsored a Private Members Bill that sought to implement the reforms recommended by the Lockhart Review. In November of last year, the Senate narrowly voted in favor of the Bill, 34 votes to 32, although a key amendment was accepted in which SCNT using animal eggs would be prohibited. Last month, the Bill was presented to the House of Representatives, who voted 82 to 62 to accept the amended Bill. Australia now has legislation, regulating research involving human embryos and SCNT, that is nationally more consistent and embracing than that in the US, where there are differing rules for private companies versus government-funded research and substantial differences between different states in the ability to conduct such work. In September of last year, President Bush vetoed a Bill passed by the US Senate that sought to loosen restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research, indicating that current restrictions are likely to continue in the US (Bush, 2006Bush, G.W. (2006). http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060719-3.html.Google Scholar). Consistent with the British lead in liberal regulation of this research field, SCNT using donated human eggs will now be allowed in Australia (the new amendments take effect in June this year). By introducing a licensing system for researchers wishing to perform SCNT, Australia joins countries such as the UK, Belgium, and China. Granting licenses for research involving SCNT is seen as an option with greater built-in safeguards than, for example, allowing SCNT by not specifically prohibiting it (as is the case in South Korea). Consistent with community attitudes, the production of embryos by egg and sperm for research will not be permitted in Australia, although other countries such as the UK, Belgium, China, Singapore, South Korea, and Sweden permit this. By establishing clear and strict guidelines to permit the conduct of research involving human embryos in Australia, the incentive for researchers to move to other countries with less regulated ethical approaches is reduced. By adopting the recommendations of the Lockhart Review, Australia joins a cluster of other countries in providing a consistent national blueprint for responsible research involving human embryos.
