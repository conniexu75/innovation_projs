https://openalex.org/W2028714658,"DIMETHYLNITROSAMINE is a powerful liver poison and carcinogen1,2, the mode of action of which is being studied in these Laboratories. As part of this programme, we have investigated the metabolic products from rats and mice using (14C) dimethylnitrosamine3."

https://openalex.org/W2017660989,"IT has been known for some time that the nucleic acids of the coli-dysentery phages, T 2, T 4 and T 6, contain hydroxymethylcytosine and that the composition of their purine and pyrimidine bases is essentially identical1. More recently it was found in this laboratory that a hexose is present in T 4 phage2. This sugar was identified as glucose and was shown to be a constituent of the viral nucleic acid3. It was afterwards demonstrated that T 2 and T 6 nucleic acids also contain glucose and that enzymatic hydrolysates of T 2 and T 4 nucleic acids contain small quantities of the glucoside of hydroxy methylcytidylic acid4,5. In the present communication it will be shown that the nucleic acids of T 2, T 4 and T 6 phages differ in their content of glucose and that this hexose is attached to the acid-resistant part of nucleic acid, the apurinic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1965377685,"THE presence of proteolytic enzymes in Entamoeba histolytica has been suspected for many years and the extracellular secretion of these enzymes has been put forward by many authors as an explanation of the mechanism of tissue invasion by this parasite1. Experimental evidence of their occurrence in E. histolytica has been presented by several authors2, though a detailed study of them has not been made."

https://openalex.org/W1998077635,"ALTHOUGH there are many references in the literature to the existence of different types of cholinesterase in mammalian sera1, it is generally believed that human red cells contain only one type2. Furthermore, we can find no evidence in the literature for the existence of a pseudo-cholinesterase in any mammalian erythrocytes, although many workers have stated that benzoylcholine is hydrolysed by red cells. Since, however, the rate of hydrolysis is slow, this breakdown of a substrate formerly presumed to be specific for pseudo-cholinesterase has been attributed to true cholinesterase. Indeed, Adams3 has shown that purified true cholinesterase does hydrolyse benzoylcholine, at a rate which would account for such observations. In spite of this, some results obtained by Fraser with benzoylcholine4 imply the existence of more than one type of cholinesterase in red cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046576728,"THIOCYANATES are known to inhibit the concentration of iodide by the thyroid. We have found that labelled thiocyanate is concentrated in the follicles of the hamster's thyroid. Adult hamsters were given 35S-thiocyanate (150 µc. with 100 µgm. of carrier) by intramuscular injection. The thyroid was removed 1 hr. later and dried from the frozen state at − 40° C. Contact autoradiographs were then made from sections of the tissue1. Patches of blackening were seen on the autoradiographs, corresponding to the areas of colloid in the section (Fig. 1). The density of the photographic grains over the centres of the follicles varied from 2.1 to 4.9 times the density over the centres of blood-vessels, the density over the smaller areas of colloid tending to be greater than that over the larger areas."

It is, however, not known whether the two medullary hormones, adrenaline and noradrenaline, are present in the grafts. Moreover, all previous work has been without regard to the fact that there are two different types of cells in the adrenal medulla2. A substantial body of evidence is now available indicating that one of these cell types contains and secretes adrenaline, and the other noradrenaline3,4. It seemed therefore to be of interest to investigate adrenal grafts by chemical and histochemical methods which differentiate between adrenaline and noradrenaline."

https://openalex.org/W1997220156,"IT has been observed that carbon dioxide is a precursor to the carboxyl carbon of glycine in incubations with a hen-oviduct mince. Carbon 2 of the glycine is completely unlabelled when determined as the formaldehyde domed one complex obtained after ninhydrin degradation. Carboxyl-labelled acetate is also formed in this system from carbondioxide1. Acetate 1,2-14C, however, was found to be a poor precursor to glycine, although it was converted to glutamic acid much more efficiently than carbon dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W1995673121,"THE physical basis of insect repellency being unknown, the search for new repellents has had to be conducted on an essentially hit-or-miss basis. With the accumulation of evidence that the odours of substances may be correlated with the low-frequency, fundamental vibrations of their molecules1, it seemed worth while to examine the absorption of some typical insect repellents in the far infra-red part of the spectrum."
