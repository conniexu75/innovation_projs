https://openalex.org/W2012985988,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily are potent regulators of apoptosis, a process that is important for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that TNFR-1 and Fas and TRAIL receptors can also trigger an alternative form of cell death that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Because distinct molecular components including the serine/threonine protein kinase receptor-interacting protein (RIP) are required, we have referred to this alternative form of cell death as “programmed necrosis.” We show that TNFR-2 signaling can potentiate programmed necrosis via TNFR-1. When cells were pre-stimulated through TNFR-2 prior to subsequent activation of TNFR-1, enhanced cell death and recruitment of RIP to the TNFR-1 complex were observed. However, TNF-induced programmed necrosis was normally inhibited by caspase-8 cleavage of RIP. To ascertain the physiological significance of RIP and programmed necrosis, we infected Jurkat cells with vaccinia virus (VV) and found that VV-infected cells underwent programmed necrosis in response to TNF, but deficiency of RIP rescued the infected cells from TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, TNFR-2–/– mice exhibited reduced inflammation in the liver and defective viral clearance during VV infection. Interestingly, death effector domain-containing proteins such as MC159, E8, K13, and cellular FLIP, but not the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-xL, p35, and XIAP, potently suppressed programmed necrosis. Thus, TNF-induced programmed necrosis is facilitated by TNFR-2 signaling and caspase inhibition and may play a role in controlling viral infection.

It is a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine in innate immunity and has been shown to be important for protection against certain bacterial and viral infections (1Benedict C.A. Norris P.S. Ware C.F. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2Herbein G. O'Brien W.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 241-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hornef M.W. Wick M.J. Rhen M. Normark S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). TNF exerts its biological functions mainly through binding to its two cell-surface receptors, the p55/p60 TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and the p75/p80 TNFR-2. Whereas most of the biological effects induced by TNF have been attributed to TNFR-1, TNFR-2 has been reported to enhance TNFR-1 signaling under certain conditions (4Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar).Signaling of the pre-assembled TNFR-1 results in the recruitment of the death domain-containing TRADD adapter. Subsequent binding of TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) or the serine/threonine protein kinase receptor-interacting protein (RIP) is critical for TNF-induced JNK and NF-κB activation, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 5Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar and 6Chan F.K.-M. Siegel M.R. Lenardo J.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of FADD and caspase-8 or caspase-10 to TRADD can initiate the caspase cascade, which results ultimately in cell death by apoptosis. Although TNFR-2 does not contain a cytoplasmic death domain and cannot directly engage the apoptotic machinery, it can enhance the cell death signal of TNFR-1, possibly through TRAF2 degradation (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2 degradation may cause reduced steric hindrance, thereby leading to enhanced recruitment of FADD and RIP to TNFR-1 and increased cell death (8Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, direct competition among FADD, RIP, and TRAF2 for TNFR-1 binding has not been tested previously, and the mechanism by which TNFR-2 signaling enhances TNFR-1-mediated cell death remains unknown.Although caspases are critical for the mediation of classical apoptosis, they do not appear to be obligatory for all forms of cell death (9Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, blockade of caspases can result in sensitization of necrotic death induced through Fas and TNFR-1 (reviewed in Ref. 10Jaattela M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recently, Holler et al. (11Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) reported that the RIP kinase is essential for Fas-, TRAIL-, and TNF-induced programmed necrosis. However, the physiological significance and the signals that differentially turn on programmed necrosis as opposed to apoptosis are unknown.Because of our previous study implicating TNFR-2 in amplifying the apoptotic signal of TNFR-1 (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether TNFR-2 signaling may also play a role in mediating programmed necrosis. We found that, in addition to enhancing apoptosis, TNFR-2 also switches on the necrosis program associated with TNFR-1. Interestingly, pre-stimulation of TNFR-2 enhanced subsequent TNF-dependent RIP recruitment to the TNFR-1 signaling complex. However, programmed necrosis was suppressed by caspase-8 activation and cleavage of RIP during apoptosis, thus explaining why apoptosis is usually the dominant form of cell death unless caspases are inhibited. During infection with VV, when caspase-8 is inhibited by the viral inhibitor SPI-2 (12Shisler J.L. Moss B. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), RIP was essential for TNF-induced programmed necrosis of the infected cells. TNFR-2–/– mice failed to properly control vaccinia virus (VV) replication, and this is correlated with a reduction of inflammatory foci in the liver. Furthermore, death effector domain (DED)-containing proteins such as MC159 can potently suppress TNF-induced programmed necrosis without affecting RIP recruitment to TNFR-1. Hence, programmed necrosis may be an important antiviral mechanism of the host.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell Lines—FADD–/–, caspase-8–/–, and RIP–/– Jurkat cells were provided by Drs. J. Blenis and B. Seed. TNFR-2-overexpressing cells were generated by stable transfection of Jurkat cells and selection for G418 resistance. The RIP-K45A and RIP-D324A mutations were generated by QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) and cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). RIPn (amino acids 1–324), E8, K13, and cellular FLIP proteins were generated by PCR cloning into pEGFP-N1. RIPc (amino acids 325–671) was cloned into pEGFP-C1. The MC159 plasmid has been described (13Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The cDNA for ASK1 and anti-caspase-8 antibody were provided by Drs. H. Ichijo and P. Krammer, respectively. Other antibodies used in this study include those raised against TRADD, FADD, and RIP (BD Transduction Laboratories); TRAF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Fas (Kamiya Biomedical Co.); TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 (R&D Systems); and hemagglutinin (HA) (Roche Applied Science). The anti-TNFR-1 antibody used in Western blotting has been described (14Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Z-VAD-fmk and geldanamycin were purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. and Sigma, respectively.Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat cells (5 × 107) were stimulated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human TNFα (rhTNFα) (R&D Systems) for the indicated amounts of time. In some experiments, cells were pre-stimulated with agonistic anti-TNFR-2 antibodies for 6 h prior to stimulation with TNF to induce TRAF2 degradation (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were precleared with three washes of protein G-agarose beads (15-min incubation at 4 °C for each wash) and then immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of goat anti-human TNFR-1 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) and protein G-agarose beads for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, twice with high salt immunoprecipitation buffer (containing 500 mm NaCl), and once with immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for standard Western blot analysis.TNF Cytotoxicity Assay—Jurkat cells were incubated with the indicated doses of rhTNFα for 8–24 h. Cell viability was determined by exclusion of propidium iodide using a FACScan flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using Flowjo (Treestar Inc.). All samples were collected on constant time, and percent cell loss was calculated with the following equation: % cell loss = (1 – (number of live cells in treated sample/number of live cells in untreated sample)) × 100. In some cases, cells were preincubated with geldanamycin for 12 h or Z-VAD-fmk for 30 min prior to stimulation with rhTNFα.In Vitro VV Infections—Jurkat cell derivatives were infected with 20 plaque-forming units of virus/cell at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum. For all infections, cells were incubated for 1 h with virus before changing the medium. At 6 h after infection, cells were incubated in fresh medium with or without 10 ng/ml rhTNFα. Twelve hours later, cell death was detected by forward/side scatter or propidium iodide exclusion upon flow cytometry. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Fixed cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to an early protein of VV (E3L) to monitor infectivity, followed by incubation with a Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) for analysis, only individual cells positive for E3L staining were analyzed for cell death.In Vivo VV Infection—C57BL/6 mice and TNFR-2–/– mice in the C57BL/6 background (8–10 weeks old) were infected via intraperitoneal administration of 106 plaque-forming units of wild-type VV. Fat pads, spleens, and livers were harvested from VV-infected mice 4 days later. Tissues were divided into two portions. Half of the tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for histological analysis. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 4 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remaining tissues were homogenized in 1–2 ml of medium for determination of viral titers. 10-Fold serial dilutions were made and overlaid on Vero cells. After a 90-min incubation at 37 °C, a 0.4% agarose solution in Eagle's minimal essential medium was overlaid on the cells. On day 2, the plates were stained with neutral red. Plaques were counted on day 3.RESULTSTNFR-2 Facilitates Caspase-independent Programmed Necrosis—Recently, death receptors including TNFR-1 and Fas have been shown to activate an alternative death program that resembles programmed necrosis when caspase activity is suppressed (reviewed in Ref. 10Jaattela M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Holler et al. (11Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) reported that signaling through TNFR-1 and Fas and TRAIL receptors can trigger programmed necrotic death that requires a functional RIP kinase. We have shown previously that TNFR-2 can facilitate TNFR-1-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether TNFR-2 signaling may also potentiate TNF-induced programmed necrosis, we introduced TNFR-2 into FADD–/– or caspase-8–/– Jurkat cells (15Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 16Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Although caspase-8–/– cells (I9.2 cells) are normally resistant to TNF-induced death (15Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the introduction of TNFR-2 (J3.2 cells) led to a striking sensitivity to TNF-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A). In a similar fashion, the introduction of TNFR-2 into FADD–/– Jurkat cells also led to enhancement of TNF-induced cytotoxicity, although FADD–/– cells also underwent TNF-induced death at a lower level in the absence of TNFR-2 (Fig. 1B) (11Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 17Khwaja A. Tatton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36817-36823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The cytotoxic effects of TNF in J3.2 cells could be mimicked by using a combination of agonistic antibodies against TNFR-1 and TNFR-2. However, either antibody alone was much less effective in triggering cell death compared with TNF (Fig. 1C). When used alone, greater death was obtained with two TNFR-1-specific antibodies compared with the anti-TNFR-2 antibodies (Fig. 1C). Moreover, an antagonistic TNFR-2-specific antibody (monoclonal antibody 226) failed to synergize with either anti-TNFR-1 antibody (Fig. 1C). Because TNF can induce programmed necrosis in TNFR-2-negative FADD–/– cells, we conclude that programmed necrosis is triggered through TNFR-1, but requires an enhancing signal from TNFR-2.When the cytotoxic responses of different TNFR-2-expressing Jurkat cells were compared, it was clear that the loss of caspase-8 and FADD dramatically enhanced cell death responses to TNF (Fig. 1D). The enhanced response to TNF was not due to cell line idiosyncrasies, as multiple TNFR-2-positive clones of each variety exhibited consistent phenotypes (Supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, the reconstitution of full-length FADD in FADD–/– cells resulted in the suppression of TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Fig. 1E). Unlike classical Fas-induced apoptosis, TNFα-induced programmed necrosis in caspase-8–/– J3.2 cells was distinguished by extensive loss of membrane integrity, swelling of intracellular organelles, and limited chromatin condensation (Fig. 1, F and G). This is reminiscent of the necrotic morphology reported by others (11Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 18Li M. Beg A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7470-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).TNFR-2-facilitated Programmed Necrosis Requires the Protein Kinase RIP—Holler et al. (11Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) have shown that the protein kinase RIP is essential for Fas-induced programmed necrosis. Although the major function of RIP appears to be the induction of NF-κB upon TNF stimulation (19Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), RIP overexpression also causes spontaneous cell death under certain circumstances (20Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RIP is also involved in TNFR-2-facilitated programmed necrosis, we introduced TNFR-2 into RIP–/– Jurkat cells (21Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). As reported previously (22Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), TNFR-2 expression in RIP–/– cells (R1.1 cells) failed to enhance TNF-induced death over the level observed in the parental cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Nevertheless, TNF-induced death was completely inhibited in these cells by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A). This is in stark contrast to the caspase-8–/– and FADD–/– cells, in which Z-VAD-fmk failed to provide any protection against TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Supplemental Fig. 1). In wild-type 4E3 cells, Z-VAD-fmk had a partial protective effect, indicating that the 4E3 cells died by apoptosis, but that a significant fraction of the cells underwent programmed necrosis when caspases were suppressed. Treatment with geldanamycin, which targets Hsp90 and indirectly reduces RIP protein expression (23Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), also modestly decreased TNF-induced death in 4E3 cells (Fig. 2A, inset). However, Z-VAD-fmk and geldanamycin synergized to completely suppress TNF-induced death in wild-type 4E3 cells (Fig. 2A). Significantly, geldanamycin treatment completely suppressed TNF-induced programmed necrosis in caspase-8–/– J3.2 and FADD–/– I42 cells, but had no effect on TNF-induced apoptosis in RIP–/– cells (Fig. 2, A and B) (data not shown). Kinase-inactive RIP (RIP-K45A), but not the kinase-inactive apoptosis signaling kinase ASK1, strongly suppressed TNF-induced programmed necrosis in J3.2 cells (Fig. 2C). As expected, no caspase activity was detected in J3.2 or I42 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Hence, our results show that two programmed cell death pathways, caspase-dependent apoptosis and RIP-mediated programmed necrosis, are functional in wild-type 4E3 cells.Fig. 2Essential role of RIP in TNFR-2-facilitated programmed necrosis.A, TNFR-2-positive 4E3 (wild-type (WT)) and R1.1 (RIP–/–) cells were stimulated as indicated, and cells were harvested and analyzed for cell death as described in the legend Fig. 1. The inset shows the reduction in RIP protein levels when 4E3 cells were treated with geldanamycin (GA). The addition of Z-VAD-fmk (zVAD) or geldanamycin alone had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). B, caspase-8–/– J3.2 cells pretreated with 0.5 μm geldanamycin or left untreated were stimulated with the indicated doses of rhTNFα, and cell loss was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Analysis of RIP protein expression by Western blotting showed a >90% reduction in RIP protein levels in cells treated with geldanamycin (data not shown). C, a kinase-inactive version of RIP (RIP-K45A) or ASK1 (ASK1-K709R) or the control vector pcDNA3 was cotransfected with pEGFP-N1 into caspase-8–/– J3.2 cells. Cells were treated with rhTNFα for 16 h, and live green fluorescent protein-positive cells were counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to determine specific cell loss of transfected cells. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TNFR-2 Pre-stimulation Enhances RIP Recruitment to TNFR-1—We next investigated the potential mechanism by which TNFR-2 facilitates programmed necrosis. In agreement with a role for TNFR-2 in enhancing programmed necrosis, pre-stimulating wild-type TNFR-2-positive, FADD–/–, and caspase-8–/– cells with an agonistic anti-TNFR-2 antibody enhanced subsequent cell death induced by TNF (Fig. 3A). Because TNFR-2 signaling causes degradation of TRAF2 (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a factor that binds to both TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, we reasoned that TNFR-2-mediated degradation of TRAF2 may reduce steric hindrance and enhance RIP recruitment to the activated TNFR-1 complex (8Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we pre-activated the cells through TNFR-2 to induce TRAF2 degradation, subsequent TNF-dependent RIP recruitment to TNFR-1 was dramatically enhanced (Fig. 3B). However, enhanced RIP recruitment was not observed in the absence of TNFR-2 pre-signaling. In fact, RIP and other factors began dissociating from the TNFR-1 complex shortly after TNF stimulation (Fig. 3C). Moreover, RIP recruitment in FADD–/– cells, which underwent programmed necrosis in the absence of TNFR-2 signaling (Fig. 1B), was not enhanced (Fig. 3C). Hence, although enhanced RIP recruitment to TNFR-1 under conditions of TNFR-2 pre-stimulation may account for the subsequent enhanced programmed necrosis, it is unlikely to explain the sensitizing effect of TNFR-2 in the absence of pre-stimulation.Fig. 3Pre-stimulation of TNFR-2 enhances cell death and recruitment of RIP to the TNFR-1 signaling complex.A, 4E3 (wild-type (WT)), I42 (FADD–/–), and J3.2 (caspase-8–/– (Casp-8–/–)) cells were pre-stimulated with an agonistic anti-TNFR-2 antibody or left untreated for 5 h, followed by stimulation with TNF for 4 h. Cell death was determined by a combination of annexin V and propidium iodide staining. B, normal Jurkat (TNFR-2-negative) and 4E3 (TNFR-2-positive) cells were pretreated with an agonistic anti-TNFR-2 antibody for 6 h to induce TRAF2 degradation prior to stimulation with rhTNFα for 5 min (7Chan F.K.-M. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared with three rounds of washing with protein G-agarose beads prior to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-TNFR-1 antibody. Western blotting was performed with antibodies to TRADD and RIP as indicated. Reprobing the blots revealed a loss of TRAF2 in the cell lysates and no contaminating TNFR-2 in the immune complexes. Similar results were obtained when a TNFR-2-specific mutein was used to pre-stimulate the cells (data not shown). C, I42 (FADD–/–) and 4E3 (wild-type) cells were stimulated with rhTNFα for the indicated times. Immunoprecipitation was performed with TNFR-1-specific antibody, and the same membranes were probed on Western blots using antibodies to RIP, TRADD, and TRAF2 as indicated. The whole cell extracts (WCE) showed that equivalent amounts of each protein were present in the cell lysates. The higher molecular weight species (*) associated with RIP in the immunoprecipitation represent ubiquitination of RIP (34Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Caspase-mediated Cleavage and Inactivation of RIP Dampen Programmed Necrosis—Although RIP was recruited to TNFR-1, apoptosis, but not programmed necrosis, was still the dominant response in wild-type 4E3 cells (Fig. 2A). Because genetic ablation of the apoptotic pathway in FADD–/– and caspase-8–/– cells or inhibition of caspases by tetrapeptide inhibitors causes increased programmed necrosis (24Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), we reasoned that caspase-8 activation during apoptosis may inactivate the necrotic pathway by proteolytic cleavage of RIP. Indeed, RIP was cleaved in TNF- or anti-Fas antibody-stimulated wild-type 4E3 cells, but not in either caspase-8–/– or FADD–/– cells (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). RIP cleavage was potently inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. To investigate whether RIP cleavage by caspases abrogates its ability to induce programmed necrosis, we reconstituted the TNFR-2-positive RIP–/– cells with RIP mutants corresponding to the N- and C-terminal cleavage products of RIP (RIPn and RIPc). We found that wild-type RIP and the non-cleavable mutant RIP-D324A potently restored TNF killing (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, cell death reconstituted by wild-type RIP was not blocked by caspase inhibitors (Fig. 4C). Although RIP-K45A and RIPc also restored killing by TNF, it was potently inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4C), suggesting that apoptosis, but not programmed necrosis, was restored. RIPn failed to restore the response to TNF (Fig. 4, B and C). Collectively, these data show that RIP is cleaved and inactivated by caspase-8 during apoptosis. Thus, in addition to TNFR-2 signaling, caspase-8 inhibition is also required to switch on the programmed necrosis machinery.Fig. 4RIP is cleaved and inactivated in the presence of apoptotic activation of caspases.A, 4E3 (wild-type (WT)) and J3.2 (caspase-8–/– (Casp-8–/–)) cells were treated with rhTNFα, Apo-1 (anti-Fas antibody), and Z-VAD-fmk (zVAD) for 6 h before whole cell lysates were harvested. Western blot analysis using a C terminus-specific RIP antibody showed that full-length RIP was cleaved into a smaller fragment (RIPc) in 4E3 cells in response to TNF and anti-Fas antibody stimulation. B and C, R1.1 (RIP–/–) cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and stimulated with TNF as indicated. Cell loss was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

However, the programmed necrosis that we observed could eliminate infected cells when apoptosis is suppressed. To test this hypothesis, we infected various Jurkat cells with recombinant VV. VV encodes a gene called SPI-2, which is homologous to the cytokine response modifier A (crmA) gene and is a potent inhibitor of caspase-8- and TNF- or Fas-induced apoptosis (12Shis"
https://openalex.org/W2052378749,"Liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-Fabp) is an abundant cytosolic lipid-binding protein with broad substrate specificity, expressed in mammalian enterocytes and hepatocytes. We have generated mice with a targeted deletion of the endogenous L-Fabp gene and have characterized their response to alterations in hepatic fatty acid flux following prolonged fasting. Chow-fed L-Fabp–/– mice were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates with regard to growth, serum and tissue lipid profiles, and fatty acid distribution within hepatic complex lipid species. In response to 48-h fasting, however, wild-type mice demonstrated a ∼10-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content while L-Fabp–/– mice demonstrated only a 2-fold increase. Hepatic VLDL secretion was decreased in L-Fabp–/– mice suggesting that the decreased accumulation of hepatic triglyceride was not the result of increased secretion. Fatty acid oxidation, as inferred from serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels, was increased in response to fasting, although the increase in L-Fabp–/– mice was significantly reduced in comparison to wild-type controls, despite comparable induction of PPARα target genes. Studies in primary hepatocytes revealed indistinguishable initial rates of oleate uptake, but longer intervals revealed reduced rates of uptake in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice. Oleate incorporation into cellular triglyceride and diacylglycerol was reduced in L-Fabp–/– mice although incorporation into phospholipid and cholesterol ester was no different than wild-type controls. These data point to an inducible defect in fatty acid utilization in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice that involves targeting of substrate for use in triglyceride metabolism.

These data point to an inducible defect in fatty acid utilization in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice that involves targeting of substrate for use in triglyceride metabolism. A major function for differentiated mammalian enterocytes and hepatocytes centers on their ability to direct intracellular trafficking of long chain fatty acids, both in connection with the processing of exogenous dietary lipid and in the complex metabolic regulation of endogenous lipid homeostasis. Key to such intricate regulation is the ability to direct delivery of fatty acids to sites of complex lipid synthesis and to provide a physiological buffer in order to accommodate fluxes that accompany changes in fatty acid delivery. In regard to hepatic and intestinal fatty acid metabolism, there is an obvious need to accommodate large periodic fluxes, such as might occur in connection with dietary lipid ingestion or alternatively in association with changes in hepatic fatty acid uptake. An important component of such accommodation likely occurs following fatty acid uptake across the plasma membrane, where tissue-specific regulation of fatty acid binding has been attributed to distinct members of a large multigene family of small cytosolic lipid-binding proteins, among them liver (L-Fabp), 1The abbreviations used are: Fabpfatty acid-binding proteinVLDLvery low density lipoprotein particleFATPfatty acid transport proteinTGtriglyceridePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinBACbacterial artificial chromosomeES cellsembryonic stem cellsPLphospholipidFFAfree fatty acidsSCP2sterol carrier protein 2SCPxsterol carrier protein xELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayWTwild typePBSphosphate-buffered salineCEcholesterol esterDAGdiacylglycerol. heart (H-Fabp), adipocyte (A-Fabp), and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-Fabp) (1Hertzel A.V.

Spener F. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1437: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and also from quantitative estimates of endogenous hepatic fatty acid binding activity (14Martin G.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21429-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggest that L-Fabp is likely the most important single source of such binding in mammalian liver. In addition to fatty acid binding and sequestration, emerging evidence suggests that L-Fabp may be involved in regulating the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) through its ability to shuttle ligand (polyunsaturated fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators) to the nucleus (15Wolfrum C.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1390-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further study has revealed that L-Fabp interacts physically with PPARα both in vitro and in vivo, providing a plausible basis for the possibility that ligand delivery via L-Fabp may represent a potential regulatory restriction point in this metabolic cascade (15Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, despite the observation that L-Fabp represents one of the most abundant gene products in enterocytes and hepatocytes, details of its physiological functions in vivo have yet to be elucidated. Studies in HepG2 cells implicated L-Fabp in fatty acid uptake following antisense RNA expression (13Wolfrum C. Buhlmann C. Rolf B. Borchers T. Spener F. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1437: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), while gain-of-function experiments revealed increased fatty acid uptake and augmented lipoprotein secretion from rat hepatoma cells (17Linden D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23044-23053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that L-Fabp may play an important role in fatty acid delivery and metabolic utilization. In order to study the role of L-Fabp in a more representative physiological context, we have generated a mouse line with a targeted deletion in the L-Fabp gene. These mice were used to examine elements of the physiological adaptations associated with prolonged fasting, a well established model of altered hepatic fatty acid flux in which mobilization of adipose tissue triglyceride (TG) stores results in the release of large amounts of fatty acids for delivery and uptake by hepatocytes (18van den Berghe G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1991; 14: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Materials—Serum- and tissue-free fatty acid, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were determined using NEFA C, Cholesterol E, and L-Type TG-H kits, respectively, from Wako Chemicals. Serum glucose concentrations were measured using a kit from Sigma. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels were measured by RIA and serum insulin levels were determined by ELISA using a kit from Crystal Chem (Chicago, IL). Anti CD-36 IgG was obtained from Cascade Bioscience (catalog ABM-5525), anti-GFP antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-8334), anti-albumin antiserum was from ICN. Anti-L-Fabp and I-Fabp antisera were a generous gift from Dr. Jeff Gordon. The anti-FATP1 antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Jean Schaffer. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to mouse FATP2, FATP4, and FATP5 were generated by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) by injecting peptides corresponding to the sequence of each FATP isoform: FATP2, CRRVRSYRQRRPVR; FATP4, CLDQEAYTRIQAGEEKL; FATP5, KPDVYQAVCEGTWNL. The resulting antisera were affinity purified by incubation with the immunizing peptide coupled to resin. Control experiments demonstrated that each FATP antiserum specifically recognized only the appropriate family member. Western blotting used the ECL reagent kit from Amersham Biosciences. Generation of L-Fabp–/–Mice—A genomic BAC clone was obtained by screening a 129/SvJ genomic BAC library (Incyte, St. Louis, MO) with a full-length mouse L-Fabp cDNA clone. The BAC was digested with EcoRI, and the fragments subcloned into pUC19. Clones containing the L-Fabp gene were identified by colony hybridization and mapped by restriction digest and partial sequencing. To create the 5′-arm, a fragment containing 2.5 kb of DNA upstream of the initiator methionine was amplified by PCR using the BAC as a template. To create a “GFP-knock in” construct, the initiator ATG of L-Fabp was replaced with the ATG of green fluorescent protein by overlapping PCR, using pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as a template for the coding sequence and polyadenylation signal of GFP. This arm was then subcloned into the Kpn/Bam sites of p1339 (accession number AF335420, a kind gift from Dr. Tim Ley), using restriction sites introduced by PCR. The 3kb 3′-arm, which includes exons 3 and 4 of the L-Fabp gene, was also amplified by PCR using the BAC clone as a template, and subcloned into the XhoI/ApaI sites of p1339. The targeting construct was electroporated into the RW-4 subclone of 129X1/SvJ embryonic stem (ES) cells. Genomic DNA was isolated from G418-resistant colonies and Southern blot analysis was performed on XbaI-digested DNA using a 32P-labeled 300 nucleotide probe corresponding to sequence upstream of the 5′-arm (Fig. 1). In 2 out of 65 clones, a 5-kb band was detected in addition to the 11-kB wild-type band, indicating homologous recombination of one of the L-Fabp alleles. Additional Southern blots were performed to confirm complete integration of the targeting construct. ES clones were individually injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, yielding two high percentage chimeras, one from each ES cell line. Both chimeric founders produced offspring containing the targeted allele when crossed with C57BL/6 females. Intercrosses of the heterozygotes produced viable and fertile homozygous L-Fabp–/– mice at the expected Mendelian frequency in both sexes. The two lines of mice have been maintained separately on a C57BL/6 129/SvJ background and appear to display an identical phenotype. Mice were housed in a full barrier facility with a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and were maintained on standard chow (Picolab Rodent Diet) with free access to food and water unless otherwise noted. Age-matched, male mice between the ages of 8 and 14 weeks were used for all experiments, with L-Fabp+/+ mice on a mixed 129/SvJ C57BL/6 background used as controls. All animal protocols were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Hepatocyte Isolation and Uptake Assay—Mice were studied following ad libitum feeding or following a 48-h fast. Hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion as previously described (19Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). Viable hepatocytes were by identified by trypan blue exclusion and counted. For the uptake assay, 200 μl of assay buffer (40 μm sodium oleate, 10 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 5 μCi/ml [3H]oleate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1.2 mm CaCl2) was added to 200 μl of the cell suspension and incubated for various times at 37 °C. Assays were stopped by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold stop solution (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 500 μm phloretin). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g, resuspended in 200 μl of water, and analyzed for cell associated-radioactivity by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in duplicate and corrected for the number of viable cells per assay. Nonspecific binding was determined by simultaneous addition of uptake assay buffer and stop solution to 200 μl of the cell suspension on ice. This background value was obtained for each cell preparation and subtracted from all time points. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, dried under nitrogen, and resolved by thin layer chromatography (70 ml of hexane/30 ml of ethyl ether/1 ml of acetic acid). Isolation of RNA and Protein—Tissue was collected, washed in PBS, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until needed. For isolation of RNA, tissues were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) and 20 μg of total RNA used for Northern blot analyses. For preparation of protein extracts, tissues were homogenized in 25 mm Hepes (pH7.9), 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm EDTA containing 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (1 Complete-Mini tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) per 10 ml of solution). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material, and assayed for protein concentration (BioRad DC Protein Assay, BioRad) prior to Western blotting. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was treated with DNaseI using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) and incubated with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) to prepare cDNA. Real time PCR reactions were performed on SDS 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using 2× Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as directed by the manufacturer. Relative gene expression was determined using the comparative Ct method (User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). PCR primers used were as follows (5′ → 3′): Fatp2, GGT ATG GGA CAG GCC TTG CT and GGG CAT TGT GGT ATA GAT GAC ATC; Scp2, GGC TTT GAT GAC TGG AAA AAT GA and CCC ATG TTA CCA GCA ATC TTC A; HMGS, TGG TGG ATG GGA AGC TGT CTA and TTC TTG CGG TAG GCT GCA TAG; MCAD, TGA CGG AGC AGC CAA TGA and ATG GCC GCC ACA TCA GA; 18S, CGG CTA CCA CAT CCA AGG AA and GCT GGA ATT ACC GCG GCT; ACO, GGA TGG TAG TCC GGA GAA CA and AGT CTG GAT CGT TCA GAA TCA AG. VLDL Secretion—Hepatic VLDL production was determined as described (20Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Tsukamoto K. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Thumser A.E. Storch J. Frolov A. Woodford J.K. Murphy E.J. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were weighed and injected intravenously with 20 mg of Tyloxapol (Sigma T-8761) in 100 μl of PBS. Serum was collected prior to injection of tyloxapol and at 30-min intervals thereafter up to 2 h, and triglyceride content determined. Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Livers were homogenized in PBS and protein concentration determined. 300 μl of homogenate was extracted with 5 ml of chlorofom/methanol (2:1) and 0.5 ml of 0.1% sulfuric acid (21Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the organic phase was collected, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 2% Triton X-100. Hepatic FFA, TG, PL, and cholesterol content were determined using commercially available kits. Data were normalized for differences in protein concentration. For mass spectrometry, lipids were extracted using LiCl as detailed (22Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and analyzed using both positive ion and negative ion electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (23Han X. Gross R.W. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Oil red O staining of frozen liver samples was conducted using established methods. Generation of L-Fabp–/–Mice—The targeting construct was designed to replace the initiator methionine and coding sequence of exon 1 and 2 with the ATG and coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1A). Clones demonstrating homologous recombination were identified and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Intercrosses of the resultant L-Fabp+/– mice yielded viable L-Fabp–/– mice at the expected Mendelian frequency. Expression of L-Fabp mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein (Fig. 1C) were undetectable in L-Fabp–/– mice. GFP protein was expressed in a tissue specific manner, its distribution paralleling the expression of endogenous L-Fabp in wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). No compensatory up-regulation of I-Fabp protein or mRNA was detected in the small intestine or the liver of L-Fabp–/– mice (Fig. 1C). There was also no compensatory change in mRNA abundance of epidermal, adipocyte, brain, or heart FABPs as inferred from semi-quantitative RT PCR (data not shown). Findings in relation to SCP2 mRNA and protein abundance will be presented in a later section of this report. Phenotype of L-Fabp–/–Mice—There was no difference in postnatal growth or body weight of either male or female mice (Fig. 2), or in liver or epididymal fat pat weights of male wild-type (WT) or L-Fabp–/– mice at 10–14 weeks of age (Table I). Furthermore, there were no differences in the equivalent parameters in female mice (data not shown). No difference was observed in serum TG, cholesterol, FFA, or glucose levels in WT versus L-Fabp–/– mice (Table I), nor was there a difference in serum ApoB100 or B48 levels as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Serum insulin levels were significantly decreased in fed male L-Fabp–/– mice (1200 versus 737 pg/ml) in the setting of indistinguishable levels of free fatty acids (Table I). These findings are of interest in view of the demonstration that mice lacking intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-Fabp) display hyperinsulinemia when fed either a low or high fat diet (24Vassileva G. Huwyler L. Poirier K. Agellon L.B. Toth M.J. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There was no difference in hepatic TG, FFA, phospholipid, or cholesterol content in L-Fabp–/– mice compared with WT controls (Table I), indicating that the absence of L-Fabp does not dramatically alter the abundance of complex lipid species within the liver. These findings are at variance with the recent report of Martin et al. (14Martin G.G. Danneberg H. Kumar L.S. Atshaves B.P. Erol E. Bader M. Schroeder F. Binas B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21429-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a 3-fold increase in hepatic cholesterol content in L-Fabp–/– mice; this point will be discussed below. Because L-Fabp binds a wide range of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, we examined the fatty acid species present in hepatic free fatty acids, TG, and phospholipid of ad libitum fed WT and L-Fabp–/– mice. Overall, no dramatic differences were observed in fatty acid species present in free fatty acids, TG, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylethanolamine, in terms of either mass (data not shown) or species distribution (Fig. 3). Thus, the absence of L-Fabp does not dramatically alter complex lipid abundance or the individual component fatty acid species present in these lipids within the liver.Table IFed male mice aged 10–14 weeks were used for all analysesParameterL-Fabp+/+ malesnL-Fabp-/- malesnp valueBody weight (g)26.32 ± 0.682624.75 ± 0.6325nsans, not significant.Liver weight (g)1.07 ± 0.06131.06 ± 0.0612nsLiver weight/body weight (%)4.17 ± 0.17134.30 ± 0.1112nsEpididymal fat weight (g)0.58 ± 0.05160.49 ± 0.0516nsEpididymal fat wt/body wt (%)2.26 ± 0.18162.00 ± 0.1716nsSerum triglyceride (mg/dL)74.34 ± 7.661965.12 ± 4.9020nsSerum total cholesterol (mg/dL)76.10 ± 3.331969.48 ± 3.6921nsSerum free fatty acids (mmol/liter)0.375 ± .0289160.359 ± 0.03021nsSerum glucose (mg/dL)169.8 ± 17.416172.8 ± 15.319nsSerum insulin (pg/mL)1238 ± 11811737 ± 1509p = 0.016Liver cholesterol (μg/mg protein)15.56 ± 0.771014.68 ± 1.286nsLiver TG (μg/mg protein)36.00 ± 8.48725.89 ± 2.598nsLiver FFA (nmol/mg protein)15.02 ± 2.021012.65 ± 1.196nsLiver PL (μg/mg protein)60.57 ± 4.071065.25 ± 4.398nsa ns, not significant.

As shown in Fig. 4A, livers of WT mice contain abundant TG droplets following a 48-h fast. By contrast, livers of fasted L-Fabp–/– mice accumulate significantly less neutral lipid (Fig. 4B). Quantitative determination revealed that hepatic TG content was ∼4-fold lower in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice compared with WT controls (Fig. 4C), with no difference in the distribution of fatty acid species present in these triglycerides (data not shown). Consistent with decreased hepatic steatosis, liver weight in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice was significantly reduced compared with fasted controls (Table II). As shown in Table II, no significant differences were observed in serum FFA, glucose, insulin, or cholesterol levels between fasted WT and L-Fabp–/– mice. Additionally, there was no difference in hepatic concentrations of cholesterol or non-esterified fatty acids between fasted WT and L-Fabp–/– mice (Table II) indicating that fatty acids are not being redirected into cholesterol or cholesterol ester synthesis rather than being stored as TG. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the profile of fatty acid species present in the livers of fasted WT or L-Fabp–/– mice when examined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Hepatic phospholipid content was significantly decreased in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice compared with ad libitum fed controls (48.4 ± 4.0 (n = 8) versus 65.3 ± 4.4 (n = 12), p = 0.013), yet no difference was observed between fasted and fed WT mice. Despite a trend toward lower hepatic PL content in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice versus fasted controls (Table II), these differences were not statistically significant. To further pursue the possibility that subtle differences may have been overlooked, we examined PL content of hepatocytes isolated from fasted mice of both genotypes. These data again revealed indistinguishable PL content between the groups (WT: 123.4 ± 13.1 μg/mg protein; L-Fabp–/–: 103.3 ± 12.0 μg/mg protein; n = 4). Bile collected from the gall bladders of fasted wild type and L-Fabp–/– mice revealed no difference in biliary cholesterol or phospholipid concentration in fasted wild-type versus fasted L-Fabp–/– mice (data not shown). These findings indicate that hepatic TG accumulation is decreased in L-Fabp–/– mice in response to prolonged fasting, without obvious redistribution of fatty acids into other complex lipid species or accumulation in either the plasma or liver.Table IIFasted male mice aged 10–14 weeks were used for all analysesParameterL-Fabp+/+ malesnL-Fabp-/- malesnp valueBody weight (g)23.70 ± 1.031121.38 ± 1.038nsans, not significant.Liver weight (g)1.01 ± 0.06110.75 ± 0.058p = 0.006Liver weight/body weight (%)4.26 ± 0.16113.49 ± 0.088p = 0.001Epididymal fat weight (g)0.62 ± 0.1060.38 ± 0.076nsEpididymal fat wt/body wt (%)2.54 ± 0.3161.83 ± 0.256nsSerum triglyceride (mg/dL)37.50 ± 4.671046.06 ± 7.7513nsSerum total cholesterol (mg/dL)83.48 ± 5.941086.38 ± 6.4413nsSerum free fatty acids (mmol/liter)0.617 ± .0336100.545 ± 0.04013nsSerum glucose (mg/dL)100.6 ± 11.210125.0 ± 10.410nsSerum insulin (pg/mL)370 ± 61.58430.9 ± 39.68nsLiver cholesterol (μg/mg protein)25.13 ± 4.31822.61 ± 2.9210nsLiver FFA (nmol/mg protein)25.29 ± 3.58820.21 ± 3.3210nsLiver PL (μg/mg protein)58.38 ± 6.431148.42 ± 4.0212nsa ns, not significant. Open table in a new tab Hepatic Fatty Acid Utilization in L-Fabp–/–Mice—Additional experiments were performed to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for decreased TG accumulation in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice. One possibility was that TG is preferentially incorporated into VLDL particles for secretion versus storage, resulting in decreased accumulation of hepatic TG. However, hepatic TG secretion rates in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice were significantly lower than in fasted WT controls (Fig. 5). Thus, the decreased neutral lipid accumulation in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice cannot be explained by increased TG secretion. A second possibility was that decreased accumulation of hepatic TG in fasted L-Fabp–/– mice reflects increased rates of β-oxidation, resulting in less fatty acid available for storage as TG. To examine this possibility we measured ketone body production using the surrogate of serum β–hydroxybutyrate. This revealed a ∼9-fold increase in WT mice following prolonged fasting (Fig. 6A), compared with a 3.5-fold induction in L-Fabp–/– mice, suggesting that induction of ketogenesis is significantly reduced in fasted male L-Fabp–/– mice. We further examined the expression of several PPARα target genes, including medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (25Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2003366894,"Retinoids are potent regulators of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis and are important therapeutic agents in oncology and dermatology. The gene regulatory activity of endogenous retinoids is effected primarily by retinoic acid isomers (all-trans and 9-cis) that are synthesized from retinaldehyde precursors in a broad range of tissues and act as ligands for nuclear retinoic acid receptors. The catabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is an important mechanism of controlling RA levels in cell and tissues. We have previously identified two cytochrome P450s, P450RAI-1 and P450RAI-2 (herein named CYP26A1 and CYP26B1), which were shown to be responsible for catabolism of atRA both in the embryo and the adult. In this report, we describe the identification, molecular cloning, and substrate characterization of a third member of the CYP26 family, named CYP26C1. Transiently transfected cells expressing CYP26C1 convert atRA to polar water-soluble metabolites similar to those generated by CYP26A1 and -B1. Competition studies with all-trans, 13-cis, and 9-cis isomers of retinoic acid demonstrated that atRA was the preferred substrate for CYP26C1. Although CYP26C1 shares extensive sequence similarity with CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, its catalytic activity appears distinct from those of other CYP26 family members. Specifically, CYP26C1 can also recognize and metabolize 9-cis-RA and is much less sensitive than the other CYP26 family members to the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole. CYP26C1 is not widely expressed in the adult but is inducible by RA in HPK1a, transformed human keratinocyte cell lines. This third CYP26 member may play a specific role in catabolizing both all-trans and 9-cis isomers of RA.

McCaffery P.J. Drager U.C. De Luca L.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1021-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The effects of RA are mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptors (α, β, γ), which are activated by both all-trans- (atRA) and 9-cis- (9-cis-RA) isomers of RA and RXRs (α, β, γ), which are selectively activated only by 9-cis-RA (2.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors regulate transcription by binding to specific response elements in promoters of RA target genes (2.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Although essentially all normal cell types have the capacity to respond to RA, the tissue distribution of RA is uneven due to tightly controlled, localized synthesis and catabolism (3.Abu-Abed S. Dolle P. Metzger D. Beckett B. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4.Niederreither K. McCaffery P. Drager U.C. Chambon P. Dolle P. Mech.

Dev. 2002; 110: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This tight regulation of RA distribution is critical for normal embryonic development and tissue maintenance in the adult. Most of the specific enzymes involved in this process have recently been cloned and characterized. The biosynthesis of RA in vertebrates involves oxidation steps converting retinol to retinaldehyde and subsequently to RA (8.Napoli J.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This first step is effected by a family of alcohol dehydrogenases, primarily ADHs 1, -2, -3, and -4, which are involved in converting all-trans retinol and 9-cis retinol to the corresponding all-trans and 9-cis retinaldehydes (9.Duester G. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 459S-462SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Bhat P.V. Labrecque J. Boutin J.M. Lacroix A. Yoshida A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Next, the dispersal of RA is tightly controlled by enzymes involved in localized RA synthesis from retinaldehyde (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase; ALDHs). Several class I aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3) have been cloned from several species, including human, and are characterized by their ability to form atRA and 9-cis-RA from their aldehyde precursers (11.Vermot J.

Noda M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These enzymes are differentially expressed in tissues demonstrated to have higher levels of RA and correspondingly higher levels of transcription of RA-regulated genes (16.Maden M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The diffusion of RA emanating from regions of localized synthesis is confined by the expression of cytochrome P450s, belonging to the CYP26 family, which specifically convert RA to less active and more readily excreteable polar metabolites (3.Abu-Abed S. Dolle P. Metzger D. Beckett B. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Two distinct members of this family, CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, have been characterized in several species (3.Abu-Abed S. Dolle P. Metzger D. Beckett B. Chambon P. Petkovich M.

Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of CYP26 enzymes A1 and B1 have been studied both in cultured cells and in microsomal extracts. Both enzymes similarly convert all-trans retinoic acid to 4-hydroxy-, 4-oxo-, and 18-hydroxy-RA intermediates (20.White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W. Zhang A. Everingham S. Creighton S. Tam S.P. Jones G. Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These intermediate metabolites may then be further hydroxylated to form more polar metabolites (8.Napoli J.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) or conjugated prior to elimination (21.Samokyszyn V.M. Gall W.E. Zawada G. Freyaldenhoven M.A. Chen G. Mackenzie P.I. Tephly T.R. Radominska-Pandya A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6908-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although in culture, some of these metabolites have activity when present at high concentration, recent genetic studies indicate that these metabolites do not have an essential role in regulating embryonic development and that this role is carried out by RA (22.Niederreither K. Abu-Abed S. Schuhbaur B. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Dolle P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both of these enzymes exhibit a high degree of specificity for atRA (atRA ⋙ 9-cis-RA > 13-cis RA > retinaldehyde > retinol) and, as with most cytochrome P450s, can be inhibited by imidazole-based compounds such as ketoconazole (20.White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W. Zhang A. Everingham S. Creighton S. Tam S.P. Jones G. Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of ALDHs and CYP26 genes are often complementary, particularly in the embryo, but are also required to control RA distribution in the adult (12.Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Fan X. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23.Swindell E.C. Thaller C. Sockanathan S. Petkovich M. Jessell T.M. Eichele G. Dev.

Studies employing a transgenic retinoic-acid reporter gene (RARE-lacZ) indicated enriched regions of RA activity coincident with those of expressing ALDHs (25.Mendelsohn C. Ruberte E. LeMeur M. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1991; 113: 723-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). CYP26A1 is expressed during early embryonic development in the tail bud to protect neuroepithelial tissues from premature exposure to RA and, at later stage of development, in the hindbrain and retina (17.MacLean G. Abu-Abed S. Dollé P. Tahayato A. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 107: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of CYP26A1 is embryonic lethal and causes many of the defects seen when embryos are exposed to a teratogenic excess of RA, including spina bifida (3.Abu-Abed S. Dolle P. Metzger D. Beckett B. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These genetic studies have very clearly demonstrated that the role of CYP26 enzymes is to inactivate RA by converting it to more polar metabolites and by doing so, protects certain tissues from RA exposure. CYP26A1 is expressed in a number of adult tissues following exposure to RA. This induction of RA is regulated at the transcriptional level (27.Loudig O. Babichuk C. White J. Abu-Abed S. Mueller C. Petkovich M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and is a mechanism whereby spikes in vitamin A or RA intake from dietary sources can be normalized. This autoregulation feedback loop can limit the effectiveness of RA therapy in skin disorders and cancer such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (28.Zouboulis C.C. Skin Pharmacol Appl. Skin Physiol. 2001; 14: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29.Njar V.C. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30.Marill J. Idres N. Capron C.C. Nguyen E. Chabot G.G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). CYP26B1 is expressed in the adult brain in several regions, which include pons, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and is expressed in hair follicles and the dermal layer of skin (7.Abu-Abed S. MacLean G. Fraulob V. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Dolle P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CYP26B1 expression can also be induced by RA (20.White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W. Zhang A. Everingham S. Creighton S. Tam S.P. Jones G. Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), however, the expression of this enzyme in adult appears to be mainly constitutive, in particular in brain and skin (7.Abu-Abed S. MacLean G. Fraulob V. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Dolle P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Differential expression of these enzymes distinguishes their roles in protecting tissues from inappropriate levels of atRA. Although CYP26A1 and B1 can efficiently catabolize atRA, their ability to oxidize 9-cis-RA is less so. It has been speculated that another enzyme might be responsible for this latter activity (31.Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Presently, we describe the cloning and characterization of a third member of this family, namely CYP26C1. Although CYP26C1 shares extensive sequence similarity with CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, we show that it exhibits catalytic activity distinct from those of other CYP26 family members. Specifically, CYP26C1 can metabolize atRA and can metabolize 9-cis-RA and is not sensitive to inhibition by ketoconazole. Identification of CYP26C1 cDNA—CYP26C1 was first identified by searching the Unfinished High Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS) data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the amino acid sequences of human CYP26A1 (Accession number O43174) and the human CYP26B1 (Accession number AAF76003). A bacterial stab of a BAC clone containing the CYP26C1 gene (AL358613) was obtained from the Sanger Genome Center. Colonies were screened by PCR using two sets of primers to identify positives containing the known fragments of CYP26C1. One set was specific for the first predicted exon, 5′-CTCATCATGTTCCCTTGGGGGCTGA and 5′-CTGCTGAACTAACCAGTGCAGCGTTTC. The other set was derived from within ba predicted exon 4, 5′-GCAAGGGACCAGCTGCATCGGCACCTG and 5′-CCCTTGCACTGTGAATGATTAGGTCG. BAC clone DNA was prepared and sent to the Centre for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, and sequencing was performed to complete the genomic sequence around the identified regions containing CYP26C1. Using sequence information from AL358613 and the sequence obtained from the Centre for Applied Genomics, a 1569-bp nucleotide sequence corresponding to a 522-amino acid protein sequence was predicted. The intron/exon boundaries were deduced based on comparison with CYP26A1 and CYP26B1. Cloning of the Full-length CYP26C1 cDNA—The full-length CYP26C1 was amplified by PCR using an upstream primer encompassing the translation initiation codon, 5′-CTCATCATGTTCCCTTGGGGGCTGAG, and a second primer 5′-ATGTCAGAGGCATAGCCCATTC, which corresponds to the sequence downstream of the assigned stop codon. Human Adrenal Poly(A) RNA (Ambion, TX) was used as the template to make cDNA using the Thermoscript RT-PCR System and oligo(dT) primer, as per the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A fragment of ∼1600 bp in length was PCR-amplified by the following reaction conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 99 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 105 s. The PCR-generated product was sequenced at Cortec DNA Service Laboratories (Kingston, Ontario, Canada) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate the CYP26C1 expression construct, pcDNA3.1-CYP26C1. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—CYP26C1 expression in HPK1a and HPK1a-ras cell lines (provided by Dr. Glenville Jones, Queen's University) was determined by RT-PCR. Briefly, cells were plated in the 6-well plates at 500,000 cells per well in 2 ml of suitable growth medium (final 50–70% confluence). At different time intervals, growth medium was removed, and 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added per well. After 5 min at room temperature, total RNAs were prepared according to Invitrogen's instruction. For induction studies, cells plated in 6-well plate 1 day prior treatment were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-RA at a concentrations of 1 μm for 24 h prior to harvesting. A control experiment was conducted by adding the vehicle only (Me2SO). Total RNA (10 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Invitrogen's Thermoscript RT-PCR system. Two microliters of cDNA were used for RT-PCR amplification using the Qiagen's Hotstar Taq master mix. The CYP26C1-selective primers used in this study amplified a 268-bp fragment between nucleotides 541 and 809 starting from the translation initiation codon (Forward primer: 5′-GTC TAC GAC GCC TCC AAA GCG CTC AC-3 and reverse primer: 5′-ATT AGG TCG AGG GCA TCA CCC GGC T-3′). PCR was conducted using a Mastercycler Gradient PCR Machine (Eppendorf) using the conditions as follow: 95 °C 15 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel. Real-time PCR—CYP26C1 TaqMan (FAM) probe was synthesized by Applied Biosystems and used in combination with the Universal TaqMan master mix. A 71-bp CYP26C1 fragment, corresponding to the cDNA region between nucleotides 674 and 744 from ATG initiation codon, was amplified. An ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System was used for real-time PCR amplification. As internal standard, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (JOE) was measured simultaneously. PCR amplification procedures followed manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the thermocycling program consisted of one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min and 50 cycles at 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (1 min). The reactions were then chilled to 4 °C. The data were analyzed using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System software. Transient Transfection of COS-1 Cells—Exponentially growing cells were plated in triplicate into six-well tissue culture plates at 150,000 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of either pcDNA3.1-CYP26C1 or pcDNA3.1-CYP26B1 or the empty vector pcDNA3.1 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Analysis of Retinoic Acid Metabolic Activity—Forty-eight hours post-transfection with pcDNA3.1-CYP26C1, COS-1 cells were washed twice with DMEM and then incubated in 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 5% FBS and either radiolabeled atRA (0.1 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences at 1 mCi/ml, 50 Ci/mmol) or radiolabeled 9-cis-RA (0.15 μCi/ml at 2 nm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences at 0.2 mCi/ml, 75 Ci/mmol) at 2 nm concentration. All procedures involving retinoids were conducted in an environment protected from light. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 10% acetic acid, and total retinoids were extracted using the Bligh-Dyer procedure as described previously (20.White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W. Zhang A. Everingham S. Creighton S. Tam S.P. Jones G. Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The water-soluble retinoid metabolites separated in the upper phase were quantified in a β-scintillation counter (Wallac, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The organic-soluble metabolites were dried by speed-vacuum, and residues were resuspended in 100 μl of HPLC mobile solvent consisting of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.5, v/v), and analyzed on HPLC (Alliance separation module 2695, Waters, Milford, MA). Separation of retinoid metabolites by HPLC was achieved by using a reverse-phase column (150 × 4.6 mm C18 Zorbax-SB, Hewlett Packard) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile at flow rate 1 ml/min. The HPLC conditions were initially isocratic for 2 min with solvent A (acetonitrile/water/acetic acid in the ratio 50:50:0.5, v/v containing 10 mm ammonium acetate), followed by the application of a linear gradient from 2 to 20 min to 100% solvent B (acetonitrile/water/acetic acid at the ratio 95:5:0.1 containing 10 mm ammonium acetate), solvent B was then held isocratically for 5 min before returning to the initial condition and equilibrating with solvent A for 5 min. Effluent from HPLC column flowed directly to a radioflow detector LB (EG & G Bethold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Cell-based Assay—In cell based-assay COS-1 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-CYP26C1 or pcDNA-CYP26B1 in six-well tissue culture plate as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, pooled, washed with DMEM, and plated into 48-well tissue culture plate with 5 × 10 5 cells per well in 0.2 ml of DMEM media containing 5% FBS. Cells were incubated with radiolabeled atRA (0.05 μCi/ml [3H]RA, at 2 nm concentration), in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of each unlabeled retinoid (atRA, 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA, retinol, and retinal), and ketoconazole, a nonspecific cytochrome P450 inhibitor. After 3 h incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding acetic acid and retinoid metabolites were extracted by using Bligh-Dyer procedure. The upper phase containing the water-soluble polar RA metabolites was counted in a scintillation counter. The IC50 values represent the concentrations of competitor required to inhibit 50% of RA metabolism and were derived by interpolation of log-transformed data. Microsome-based Assay—The microsome-based assay utilized microsomes prepared from the COS-1 cells transiently expressing either CYP26B1 or CYP26C1. Cells were harvested, 48 h after transfection, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, counted, then homogenized and sonicated in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugations for 10 min at 800 × g, then 10 min at 10,000 × g, and finally the postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min using ultracentrifugation (Beckman, L8–55M ultracentrifuge). Microsome pellets were isolated and homogenized gently in the storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentration in the microsomal preparation was determined using the Bradford reaction assay kit using bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Microsomes were aliquoted at 1 mg/ml in storage buffer, checked for RA-metabolic activity, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The microsome-based assay was conducted in the storage buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin using a mixture (total volume of 200 μl) composed of an appropriate amount (10 μg) of microsomal suspension incubated with radiolabeled atRA (0.05 μCi/ml [3H]RA, at 2 nm concentration) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of each unlabeled retinoid (atRA, 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA) or ketoconazole. Following a 10-min preincubation period at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 mm NADPH (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by acidification with 5 μl of 10% acetic acid. Extraction of the samples was conducted by Bligh-Dyer procedure, and water-soluble metabolites were counted in a scintillation counter as described above. LC/MS Analysis—LC/MS was used to obtain more precise information on the molecular mass of the atRA metabolites. HeLa cells were transfected with pcEBV-CYP26C1, comprising CYP26C1 subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus promoter based vector containing hygromycin B resistance gene. HeLa cells stably expressing CYP26C1 were isolated by selecting and cloning atRA-metabolism-positive cells in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Tissue culture plates of exponentially growing cells (70 to 80% confluency) were incubated in 5 ml of minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS and 1 μm of either atRA or 9-cis-RA. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, total retinoids were extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate containing 1% acetic acid. The upper organic phase was removed, dried using speed vacuum, and the total residue was resuspended in solvent for HPLC. The LC mobile phases consisted of water (solvent A), acetonitrile (solvent B), and 10% acetic acid (solvent C). The LC separation of retinoid metabolites was achieved by a reverse-phase column (150 × 2.1 Zorbax C18 Eclipse XDB 5 μm, Agilent Technologies, CA) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient of acetonitrile. The mobile phase started with mixture of solvents A:B:C in the ratio 64:35:1 for 2 min, and a linear gradient for 28 min up to 95% of solvent B with a constant flow rate of 1% solvent C. At 30 min the mobile phase was held isocratically for 10 min before returning to the initial conditions over 5 min, and equilibrating for 5 min. LC/MS was performed using Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple-stage quadruple mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) connected to a LC Alliance 2969 separation module 2969 (Waters, Milford, MA). The MS was operated in the negative electrospray mode (ES–) with a (–3.15 KV) capillary voltage and (–37 V) cone voltage. Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas at a flow of 871 liter/h. For MS/MS experiments, argon was used as a collision gas at a pressure of 2.3 × 10–3 torr with collision energy of 25 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in a full mass scan (m/z 200–500), and product ion scan. The major retinoid metabolites were further characterized using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) in the product ion scan mode, and daughter ions were detected from m/z 50 to m/z 400. Identification and Cloning of CYP26C1—A genomic region corresponding to a putative third member of the CYP26 family was identified by searching the HTGS data base for sequences with similarity to the human CYP26 family members (CYP26A1 and CYP26B1). The identified sequence (accession no. AL358613) corresponded to a 160,532-bp clone from human chromosome 10, which showed similarity to the nucleotide sequence encoding CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 (20.White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W.

N-terminal exon 1, as well as exons 4 and 5 and part of the C-terminal exon 6 were predicted from this sequence by comparison with the other known CYP26 family members. Exon 6 contained the heme thiolate benchmark motif characteristic of all cytochrome P450s (FXXGXRXCXG, where X can be any amino acid), FGGGARSCLG. A BAC clone (AL358613) was obtained and sequenced to confirm that the clone contained an open-reading frame that conceptually could be translated into a novel CYP26-like protein (CYP26C1). The predicted 6 exons and intron/exon boundaries of CYP26C1 are shown in Fig. 1A. We compared the amino acid sequence of CYP26C1 with those of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 (Fig. 1B). Overall CYP26A1 and CYP26C1 show 43% identity at the amino acid level and 52% at the nucleotide level over the region of the predicted open reading frame. The overall similarity of the two putative open reading frames is somewhat higher when conservatively substituted amino acids are considered. Overall CYP26B1 and CYP26C1 show 51% identity at the amino acid level and 61% at the nucleotide level over the region of the predicted open reading frame. Again, the overall similarity of the two putative open reading frames is somewhat higher when conservatively substituted amino acids are considered.

Here we report that, in response to IGF-1 stimulation, β-arrestin1 mediates activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a pathway that leads to the subsequent activation of Akt and anti-apoptosis. This process is independent of both Gi and ERK activity. The pathway fails in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both β-arrestins and is restored by stable transfection of β-arrestin1. Remarkably, this pathway is insensitive to chemical inhibition of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity. These results suggest that, in addition to their roles in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, β-arrestins couple the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase system and suggest that this mechanism is operative independently of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. β-arrestins (1 and 2) are widely expressed cytosolic proteins that play central roles in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. β-arrestin1 is also recruited to the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, upon agonist binding.

Although β-arrestins were initially described as negative regulators of GPCR function, more recent work has shown that β-arrestin recruitment to agonist-occupied receptors also leads to activation of a variety of signaling pathways (1McDonald P.H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For example, β-arrestin recruitment to agonist-bound receptors facilitates their clathrin-mediated endocytosis while acting as a scaffold to facilitate activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (3McDonald P.H.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).Although the preponderance of literature ties arrestins to GPCR-mediated signaling, β-arrestin1 is also recruited to at least two related receptor tyrosine kinases, the IGF-1 and insulin receptors, in an agonist dependent manner (5Lin F.-T.

The receptor for IGF-1, a classical receptor tyrosine kinase, binds β-arrestin1 in a ligand-dependent manner and, in a process reminiscent of GPCR-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment, this facilitates clathrin-mediated receptor internalization, MAP kinase activation, and the stimulation of cellular proliferation (5Lin F.-T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).IGF-1 plays central roles in controlling cellular metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Similarly to many receptor tyrosine kinases, the IGF-1 receptor mediates many of these effects via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), a conserved group of lipid kinases that play vital roles in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes including cellular proliferation, chemotaxis (7Haugh J.M.

Given the central roles played by PI3Ks in cellular responses to receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation, we sought to assess the roles, if any, played by β-arrestins in IGF-1-mediated activation of PI3K.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCreation of Double Knockout (DKO) and B1 Cell Lines—Mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking β-arrestin (16Perry S.J.

Stably transfected lines were selected and maintained in growth medium containing 0.3 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen).Staining for β-Arrestins—Cell lysates from DKO and B1 cells, normalized for protein content using BCA analysis (Pierce), were subjected to PAGE and blotted using an antibody to β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (18Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:5000 dilution. After incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2500 dilution), immunoblots were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Apoptosis Assays—Cells cultured in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were incubated in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, medium lacking serum, or medium lacking serum but supplemented with IGF-1 (5 nm) for a period of 12-16 h. Assays were always conducted when cells were <50% confluent, as confluence was found to impact the effect of IGF-1. Cells were trypsinized and counted, and equal numbers of cells were used for each analysis. Apoptosis was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Roche Applied Science cell death detection kit, which quantitatively measures fragmentation of histone-bound DNA. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and results are reported in units of mAU/min. Apoptosis was also measured using annexin staining. Cells were treated as described above, trypsinized, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin-V (Pharmingen), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantitated by flow cytometry.Assays of Akt Activity—Subconfluent cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 60 min and then stimulated with IGF-1 (5 nm) for 3 min. Cells were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1 mm sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors. Akt was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates normalized for protein content by BCA analysis (Pierce) using anti-Akt beads (Cell Signaling), and the phosphorylation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) substrate was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Akt assay kit; Cell Signaling). Cell lysates were also subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T), and immunoblots were probed for PO4Akt using an antibody to Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 (Cell Signaling) or Thr-308 (Cell Signaling). Identical results were obtained using either antibody or assays of Akt activity. Because Akt activity correlated with the detection of PO4Akt by an immunoblot of cell lysates, immunoblotting for PO4Akt was used in subsequent experiments to assay Akt activation. In control experiments to assay the effectiveness of pertussis toxin, cells under identical conditions were stimulated with IGF-1 (5 nm) or oleoyl-l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; 10 μm) for 5 min, and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, and immunoblots were probed for PO4ERK using an antibody specific for phosphorylated MAP kinase (Cell Signaling). Immunoblots were visualized using ECL (Biosciences).Assay of PI3K Activity—After incubation in serum-free medium (60 min), cells were stimulated with IGF-1 (5 nm) for 3 min. Cells were washed, suspended in KHEM (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, and 1.92 mm MgCl2), flash frozen in liquid N2, and membranes were suspended using a tuberculin syringe. Initial centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove nuclear and organelle material was followed by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 30 min to produce purified membranes. Membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). After normalization for protein content (BCA reagent; Pierce), PI3Kα was immunoprecipitated with anti-p110α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-85α (Upstate Biotechnology) antibody and protein A/G beads (Oncogene) overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer (3×), Tris/LiCl (3× 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 mm LiCl), and TNE (2× 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in 50 μl of TNE. MgCl2 (10 μl; 100 mm), phosphatidylinositol (10 μl; 2 mg/ml freshly suspended solution in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA), and ATP (5 μl; 10 μCi/reaction [γ-32P]ATP in 0.88 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 30° C for 12 min. Reactions were quenched with HCl (20 μl; 6 m), extracted with MeOH/CHCl3 (1:1; 160 μl), and the products were separated using TLC with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (112:95:20:5) on silica gel plates (Selecto plates; Fisher Science Co.) coated with potassium oxalate (1%). Plates were quantitated using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.Inhibitor Studies—Cells were pre-treated for 30 min in serum-free medium with wortmannin (Sigma; 100 nm), LY294002 (Calbiochem; 10 μm), PD98059 (Calbiochem; 10 μm), PP2 (Calbiochem; 10 μm), or SU6656 (Calbiochem; 10 μm) prior to IGF-1 stimulation and assays of either apoptosis or the activation of PI3K or Akt. To attain maximal inhibition of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity, cells were incubated overnight with AG1024 (Calbiochem; 10 μm) in serum-free medium. Inhibition of Gi was accomplished by pre-incubation with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 12 h in serum-free medium.Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1) Phosphorylation—Cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium with AG1024 (Calbiochem; 10 μm) prior to IGF-1 stimulation. After stimulation with IGF-1 (5 nm; Sigma), cells were lysed in lysis buffer and normalized for protein content. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated using 4 μg of anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A/G beads (Oncogene). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, and proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using PY20HRP antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories).Statistical Analysis—All comparisons are Student's two-valued t tests unless otherwise specified.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo assess a possible role for β-arrestin in IGF-1-mediated signaling, DKO and B1 mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were developed (16Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Because these cell lines are derived from a single precursor, they are identical except for the level of β-arrestin expression.The β-arrestin expression profiles for wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts, DKO cells, and B1 cells were analyzed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (Fig. 1A). Whereas DKO cells show no staining for either of the β-arrestins, B1 cells express β-arrestin1 at levels equivalent to those observed in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts. These cells were subsequently used to assess the role of β-arrestin1 in IGF-1 signaling.IGF-1 stimulation results in rapid and robust activation of PI3K and, subsequently, of Akt (19Butler A.A.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-arrestin1 mediates IGF-1-stimulated activation of PI3Kα, PI3Kα activity was assessed in membrane fractions of subconfluent B1 and DKO cells before and after IGF-1 stimulation. IGF-1 stimulates a 3-fold increase in membrane-associated PI3Kα activity in cells containing β-arrestin1 (B1 cells; Fig. 1B), whereas no increase in membrane associated PI3Kα activity is observed in DKO cells. Total PI3Kα activity, as assayed in whole cell lysates, is also increased in B1 cells (1.81 ± 0.11-fold induction; p < 0.0002), but not in DKO cells (1.17 ± 0.08-fold induction; p = not significant; n = 9; data not shown).Generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate by PI3Kα leads to membrane recruitment and activation of Akt, the first discovered downstream target of PI3K (21Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Akt activation proceeds via interaction of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate with the PH domain of Akt, with recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated by PDK1 on Thr-308 as well as by an unknown kinase on Ser-473 (21Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 22Meier R. Hemmings B.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess whether β-arrestin1-mediated PI3Kα activation results in activation of Akt, we compared the effect of IGF-1 on Akt phosphorylation and activation in B1 and DKO cells (Fig. 2A). After 60 min of serum starvation, no detectable phosphorylated Akt was observed in either B1 or DKO fibroblasts. Replicating the pattern of activation observed with PI3Kα, IGF-1 stimulation results in robust phosphorylation and activation of Akt in B1, but not DKO, cells. Control blots indicate that Akt is expressed at equal levels in these cell types (Fig. 2A, middle section). Identical results were obtained upon measurement of Akt activity as assayed by phosphorylation of an Akt substrate peptide or by using an immunoassay specific for Akt Thr-308 phosphorylation (data not shown). Although DKO and B1 cells were obtained from a common precursor, we wished to exclude the remote possibility that IGF-1 signaling had become defective in DKO cells. After stimulation with IGF-1, the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of cell lysates of DKO and B1 cells was compared. Under conditions in which Akt phosphorylation was observed only in the B1 cell line (Fig. 2A, top section, PO4Akt blot), IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 2A, bottom section, PO4Tyr blot), suggesting that both cell lines contain a functional receptor. We conclude that, in response to IGF-1 stimulation, β-arrestin1 mediates activation of PI3Kα at the plasma membrane, thereby effecting activation of Akt.Fig. 2IGF-1 stimulation leads to Akt activation and anti-apoptosis in subconfluent B1 cells but not in β-arrestin DKO cells.A, DKO and B1 cells were incubated in serum-free medium (60 min) and then stimulated for 2.5 min with IGF-1 (5 nm). Activation of Akt was measured using an Akt activity assay as well as by immunoblotting for PO4Akt. Shown is a representative immunoblot for PO4Akt. Cell lysates (normalized for protein content) were subjected to PAGE and then immunoblotted with an antibody specific for Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 (top section), total Akt (middle section), or tyrosine-phosphorylated residues (antibody 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology; bottom section). Shown is a representative (n = 3) immunoblot. Although a similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in response to IGF-1 stimulation in both cell types, Akt phosphorylation is observed only in β-arrestin-containing cells. B, DKO and B1 cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (white columns), serum-free medium (black columns), or serum-free medium supplemented with IGF-1 (5 nm, hatched columns) for a period of 16 h. After the incubation period, cells were trypsinized, counted in triplicate, and equal numbers of cells were used for each analysis. Apoptosis was quantitated using an ELISA assay for DNA fragmentation. Results are reported as mAU/min units. Experiments were run in triplicate, and results represent the mean ± S.E., of four individual experiments. *, p = not significant for comparison of DKO cells ± IGF-1; #, p < 0.001 for comparison of B1 cells ± IGF-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IGF-1 plays a vital role in regulating apoptosis in virtually all cell types, a role reflected by the importance of IGF-1 signaling in transformation, malignancy, and modulating cell survival (15Kennedy S.G.

To determine whether β-arrestin-mediated activation of PI3K and Akt is important to this role of IGF-1 signaling, we compared the ability of IGF-1 stimulation to protect subconfluent B1 and DKO from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal.As shown in Fig. 2B, serum withdrawal leads to an increase in apoptosis in both B1 and DKO cells as measured using an assay of DNA fragmentation. Although IGF-1 (5 nm) dramatically inhibits apoptosis in B1 cells, no such effect is observed in DKO cells, suggesting that β-arrestin1 may play an important role in mediating anti-apoptotic signaling in response to IGF-1 stimulation. To confirm these findings, measurement of cell surface annexin was used as an index of apoptosis and yielded identical results (data not shown). Interestingly, DKO cells undergo apoptosis at higher rates upon withdrawal of serum. It is possible that this reflects the presence of minute quantities of growth factors, including IGF-1, that signal via β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis.In addition to activation of PI3K, IGF-1 stimulation activates the MAP kinase ERK via the G protein Gi (6Dalle S.

Accordingly, we used chemical inhibitors of PI3K, MEK (an upstream kinase of ERK), and Gi to determine the relative importance of each of these IGF-1-stimulated pathways in β-arrestin1-mediated activation of Akt and anti-apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin or LY294002 blocks IGF-1-stimulated activation of Akt in B1 cells, whereas IGF-1 again fails to activate Akt in DKO cells (Fig. 3A). Irreversible PI3K inhibition using wortmannin also blocks IGF-1-stimulated anti-apoptotic signaling in B1 cells (Fig. 3B), establishing the central role of PI3K in β-arrestin1-mediated Akt activation and anti-apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of Gi signaling with pertussis toxin has no effect on either IGF-1-stimulated Akt activation (Fig. 3C) or the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1 (Fig. 3D) in B1 cells, but it does inhibit activation of ERK by either IGF-1 (Fig. 3C, bottom section) or oleoyl-l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (data not shown) by over 65% (24Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T.

Inhibition of ERK activation with PD98059, an inhibitor of the upstream kinase MEK, also has no effect on IGF-1-stimulated anti-apoptosis (Fig. 3E). Together, these findings suggest that β-arrestin1 plays a specific role in IGF-1 stimulated activation of PI3K, a pathway required for activation of Akt and responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1.Fig. 3IGF-1-stimulated activation of Akt and anti-apoptosis is dependent on β-arrestin-mediated activation of PI3K but is not influenced by inhibition of ERK or Gi signaling.A, B1 and DKO cells were incubated with wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (10 μm) for 30 min in serum-free medium.

To determine the importance of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity for β-arrestin1-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt, we examined the effect of AG1024, a specific inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity, on IRS-1 phosphorylation and on the activation of Akt in B1 cells.After a brief incubation in serum-free medium, no phosphorylated IRS-1 or Akt was detected in B1 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). IGF-1 stimulation leads to robust tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of Akt (Fig. 4, lane 2). In the presence of AG1024, IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is abolished (Fig. 4, top section, lane 4), indicating that IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity is responsible for phosphorylation of IRS-1 and that AG1024 effectively abolishes this activity.Fig. 4Inhibition of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity inhibits phosphorylation of IRS-1 but not β-arrestin-mediated activation of Akt.Top section, B1 cells were pre-treated with AG1024 (10 μm, 13-16 h; lanes 3 and 4) under serum-free conditions and then treated with or without IGF-1 (5 nm; lanes 2 and 4) for 5 min.

Many of them inactivate p53 by decreasing its thermodynamic stability. We have previously designed the superstable quadruple mutant M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D containing the second-site suppressor mutations N239Y and N268D, which specifically restore activity and stability in several oncogenic mutants. Here we present the x-ray structure of this quadruple mutant at 1.9 Å resolution, which was solved in a new crystal form in the absence of DNA. This structure reveals that the four point mutations cause only small local structural changes, whereas the overall structure of the central β-sandwich and the DNA-binding surface is conserved. The suppressor mutation N268D results in an altered hydrogen bond pattern connecting strands S1 and S10, thus bridging the two sheets of the β-sandwich scaffold in an energetically more favorable way. The second suppressor mutation N239Y, which is located in close proximity to the DNA-binding surface in loop L3, seems to reduce the plasticity of the structure in large parts of loop L3 as indicated by decreased crystallographic temperature factors. The same is observed for residues in the vicinity of the N268D substitution. This increase in rigidity provides the structural basis for the increase in thermostability and an understanding how N268D and N239Y rescue some of the common cancer mutants.

The tumor suppressor p53, which has aptly been described as the guardian of our genome, plays a key role in the prevention of cancer development (1.Lane D.P.

In response to cellular stress, p53, which is active as a tetramer, induces the transcription of genes for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (3.Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

In about half of all human cancers, p53 is inactivated as a direct result of missense mutations within the p53 gene. Most of these mutations map to the DNA-binding core domain (7.Hainaut P. Hollstein M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 81-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), and six “hot spots” stand out as most frequently associated with human cancer (R175H, G245S, R248Q, R249S, R273H, and R282W). The crystal structure of the human p53 core domain has been solved at 2.2 Å resolution in complex with a consensus DNA sequence (8.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). A large immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich provides the basic scaffold for the conserved DNA-binding surface consisting of a loop-sheet-helix motif and two large loops coordinating a zinc ion. Two of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit bind on the same face of the DNA duplex, forming a head-to-tail dimer with weak protein-protein interactions between the two molecules. The third molecule makes no significant contact with DNA. This structure provided a framework to subdivide common cancer mutations into two classes: “contact mutants” that directly affect DNA binding through loss of a contacting residue and “structural mutants” causing structural perturbations within the core domain. Quantitative folding and DNA-binding studies of numerous cancer-associated core domain mutants allowed a further classification into three broad phenotypes: (i) DNA-contact mutants with only minor effects on folding and stability; (ii) substitutions resulting in local changes, mainly in proximity to the DNA-binding surface, which are destabilized by < 2 kcal/mol relative to wild type; and (iii) mutations causing global unfolding of the β-sandwich, which are destabilized by > 3 kcal/mol (9.Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10.Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Because the thermodynamic stability of wild type p53 core domain is already rather low, it can be extrapolated that for mutants belonging to class (iii) the population of unfolded protein at 37 °C is higher than 50%. These results show that stabilization of p53 is crucial. This can be achieved by two ways, either by introducing stabilizing suppressor mutations into the p53 core domain or by addition of stabilizing agents. The “chaperone strategy” to rescue oncogenic mutants is based on the theory that conformationally destabilized mutants can be rescued by generic small molecules binding the native but not the denatured state. Friedler et al. (11.Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rüdiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a nine-residue peptide (CDB3) derived from the crystal structure of p53 core domain in complex with 53BP2 stabilizes various oncogenic mutants. Another molecule PRIMA-1 that increases p53 levels in vivo was found by random screening of a low-molecular-weight compound library (12.Bykov V.J. Issaeva N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Pugacheva E. Chumakov P. Bergman J. Wiman K.G. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). By semirational design based on the molecular evolution of the DNA-binding domain, Nikolova et al. (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have identified mutations that stabilize human p53 core domain. The most stable substitutions were combined in a quadruple mutant (M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D), which is stabilized by 2.65 kcal/mol but retains wild type DNA-binding function (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effects of the point mutations are nearly additive, and the main contribution to stability increase comes from the N239Y and N268D substitutions. These two mutations are of particular interest as they are known to act as second-site suppressors for various cancer-associated mutations (14.Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of this superstable p53 core domain mutant, which reveals that the overall structural characteristics of the wild type protein are retained in the quadruple mutant. The observed local structural changes caused by the mutations, however, seem to affect the flexibility of the protein and reduce the plasticity of the core domain structure both locally and globally. This provides an insight into how the two second-site suppressor mutations might rescue some of the common structurally destabilized cancer mutants. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Human p53 core domain (residues 94–312) mutant M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D was expressed and purified following published protocols (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J.

Initially, we attempted to solve the structure of the quadruple mutant with and without bound fluorescein-labeled peptide CDB3 (FL-CDB3). 1The abbreviations used are: FL, fluorescein-labeled; CNS, crystallography NMR software; rms, root mean square. 3 μl protein solution (5.2 mg/ml protein in 250 μm FL-CDB3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) was mixed with 3 μl reservoir buffer consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 19% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 above a reservoir solution of 700 μl. Yellow, rod-shaped crystals appeared within a few days. Colorless crystals of the same type were obtained in the absence of FL-CDB3. Crystals were flash frozen in mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 200. They belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 65.0 Å, b = 71.0 Å, c = 104.8 Å. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A diffraction set to 1.9 Å resolution was collected from a single crystal grown in the presence of FL-CDB3 at 100 K on beamline 14.2 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK.

Calculation of buried surface areas was performed with CNS using an accessible probe radius of 1.4 Å. Figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (21.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Overall Structure of the Quadruple Mutant—We have solved the crystal structure of the quadruple mutant M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D of the human p53 core domain at 1.9 Å resolution (Table I). Our final model of the quadruple mutant comprises residues 96–290 for both molecules in the asymmetric unit. As in the structure of wild type, the C-terminal residues up to Thr-312 are disordered. The overall structure is very similar to wild type (Fig. 1, A–C). It consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets of four and five twisted strands, forming a β-sandwich with a “Greek key” topology. This compact, barrel-like structure provides the basic scaffold for two large loops, L2 (residues 164–194) and L3 (residues 237–250), and a loop-sheet-helix motif at the same end of the β-sandwich. Loops L2 and L3 are stabilized by a zinc ion, which is tetrahedrally coordinated by Cys-176, His-179, Cys-238, and Cys-242. The loop-sheet-helix motif contains loop L1 (residues 113–123), a short β-sheet comprising the S2-S2′ turn and the C-terminal residues of the extended β-strand S10, and helix H2 (residues 278–289). Together with loops L1 and L3, helix H2 forms a positively charged surface, which is known to bind DNA (8.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). The Cα atoms of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the DNA-free quadruple mutant superimpose with a rms deviation of 0.26 Å. When molecule A is superimposed on the wild type (residues 96–289), the rms deviation for Cα atoms is 0.53 Å for wild type chain A (DNA-free), and 0.71 and 0.68 Å for chains B and C (DNA-bound), respectively. Similar rms deviations are obtained for the pair-wise superpositions of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. The largest deviations are found in the loop regions L1, L2, and the turn between β-strands S7 and S8 (Fig. 1C). The conformation of loop L1 resembles the one found in DNA-free wild type but is different from the one found in DNA-bound wild type, where the Cα atom of Ser-121 is displaced by 3.8 Å. Such a loop conformation is not compatible with DNA binding. In the complex of wild type p53 bound to the DNA consensus sequence, Lys-120 on loop L1 makes two DNA contacts. The backbone amide interacts with a deoxyribose moiety, and the ϵ amino group makes two hydrogen bonds with a guanine base in the major groove. Upon DNA binding, loop L1 has to undergo an induced fit movement to place Lys-120 in a position where it can form these interactions with DNA. As observed for loop L1, the conformation found for L2 is closer to DNA-free than to DNA-bound wild type. Maximum Cα displacements are 1.5 Å when compared with DNA-free and 3.5 Å when compared with DNA-bound wild type (for Ser-183 in both cases). The observed structural changes also include a partial unwinding of the short α-helical segment H1 into a 310-helical turn (residues 177–179). The S7/S8 turn is located on the opposite site of the β-sandwich. The conformation in the quadruple mutant is somewhat an intermediate between the conformations found in DNA-free and DNA-bound wild type. This turn is also one of the regions where we observe the largest Cα deviations between the two non-crystallographically related molecules in our mutant structure. It seems that the different conformations in this region are induced by the different crystallographic environment in the crystal and thus mirror the inherent flexibility of this region. This has also been observed in the structure of p53 core domain from mouse (23.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Crystal Packing—The crystal lattice of the quadruple mutant is built on the basis of a total of 4 different crystal contacts (Fig. 2A). Contacts I (960 Å2 buried surface area) and II (560 Å2 buried surface area) connect head-to-tail orientated molecules along the crystallographic x-axis. Contact III with a total buried surface area of 1050 Å2 generates chains of head-to-tail orientated molecules running parallel to the crystallographic y-axis with each molecule participating in two identical contacts. In z-direction of the crystal lattice, the molecules are connected only via a small interface (contact IV; 530 Å2 buried surface area) with head-to-head orientated molecules. A total of 21% of the solvent accessible surface of both molecules in the asymmetric unit is buried in these crystal contacts. The C-terminal helix, which is known to bind to DNA, makes no contacts with neighboring molecules and is exposed to a solvent channel within the crystal. Interestingly, crystal contact I is very similar to the interface of the head-to-tail orientated dimer formed by the two DNA-binding molecules (chains B and C) in the wild type structure (Fig. 2B). The two dimers generated by these contacts superimpose with a rms deviation of 1.7 Å (Cα atoms). When only one molecule of the dimer is used for the superposition, as shown for the molecule binding to the DNA consensus sequence in Fig. 2B, the second molecule of the quadruple mutant is slightly rotated and shifted from the DNA-binding position. It is locked in a position that results in an increase of the contacting area between the two molecules. (960 Å2 versus 720 Å2 buried surface area in the DNA complex). The striking similarity between these two dimers found in a different crystal lattice in the presence and absence of DNA raises the question whether this interface might also play a role in the context of the organization of the tetramer in the full-length protein. A different interface in the context of the crystal structure of p53 core domain from mouse, which is incompatible with simultaneous binding of both subunits to duplex DNA, has been attributed to a low affinity DNA state of the p53 tetramer (23.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Structural Changes at the Mutation Sites—Mutation M133L in strand S2′ of the loop-sheet-helix motif results in only minor changes in neighboring residues (Fig. 3A). In the quadruple mutant, the Cδ2 atom of Leu-133 occupies the position of the methionine sulfur atom in wild type. The Cδ1 atom of Leu-133 is involved in new hydrophobic interactions, namely with the Cβ atom of Tyr-126 and the aromatic ring of Phe-113. Mutation V203A, which is located in the turn between β-strands S5 and S6, induces a re-packing of the hydrophobic core, while retaining the backbone conformation found in wild type (Fig. 3B). The cavity created by truncating the hydrophobic side chain of residue 203 is compensated by a movement of the side chain of Leu-188, which fills the gap and is now engaged in new hydrophobic contacts with Ala-203 and Tyr-205. This is achieved mainly by a 130° rotation of Leu-188 around the Cα Cβ bond, which results in a maximum displacement of more than 4 Å for the Cδ1 atom. The N268D mutation alters the hydrogen bonding network (Fig. 3C). It is located in β-strand S10, which is part of both the β-sandwich and the loop-sheet-helix motif. In DNA-free wild type, the Nδ atom of Asn-268 donates a hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Phe-109. A comparison with the orientation of the amide group in the two molecules of DNA-bound wild type suggests a transient nature of this hydrogen bond fluctuating between the main-chain oxygens of Phe-109 and Arg-267. This hydrogen bond is lost in the quadruple mutant. Instead, the side chain of Asp-268 has flipped relative to the position of the original asparagine in wild type. In this orientation it uses both oxygens of its carboxylate group to form two well defined charged hydrogen bonds with backbone nitrogens: one intra-strand hydrogen bond with Ser-269 (2.7 Å distance) and one inter-strand hydrogen bond with Leu-111 from β-strand S1 (2.9 Å distance). By linking strands S10 and S1, Asp-268 connects the two sheets of the β-sandwich. Mutation N239Y in the loop L3 region is of particular interest as this mutation is known to act as suppressor mutation for various cancer hot-spot mutations such as G245S. Contrary to the other three mutations, the N239Y substitution has so far not been found in any known p53 sequence in nature. The aromatic ring of Tyr-239 is packed onto the side chain of Leu137, which is slightly rearranged (Fig. 3D). This hydrophobic packing shields one side of the phenol moiety from the solvent while the other side is left solvent exposed. Tyr-239 directly connects with zinc binding as it lies within a 5 Å distance to the three zinc ligands Cys-238, Cys-242, and His-179. The side chain of Cys-238 has slightly rotated, but the overall geometry of the zinc coordination sphere itself is preserved. Tyr-239 constitutes the interface between the core of the protein and the solvent. It makes contacts via its phenolic hydroxyl group with a defined network of ordered water molecules covering the protein surface. In the wild type structure of the p53 core domain DNA complex, Asn-239 is ∼4 Å away from the phosphodiester backbone of the bound DNA. The rotamer found for Tyr-239 positions its hydroxyl group still ∼4 Å away from the phosphate backbone when the mutant structure is superimposed on the wild type core domain DNA complex (molecule B). Temperature Factors—We have analyzed the crystallographic thermal factors (B-factors) in the quadruple mutant and the previously published wild type structure in order to get some information on the relative flexibilies of particular regions in both proteins. The main-chain temperature factor profiles for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the quadruple mutant superimpose very well as shown in Fig. 4A. The overall B-factors are much lower than in the structure of DNA-free wild type (Protein Data Bank code 1TSR chain A): 16.3 Å2 (molecule A) and 16.8 Å2 (molecule B) for the quadruple mutant and 26.4 Å2 for DNA-free wild type. There are some regions where the plasticity of the structure seems to be reduced in the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4, A and B); most notably residues 109–113, around residue 152 and residues 245–250, the region harboring the cancer hot-spot mutations G245S and R249S. His-179 in the zinc binding pocket next to the N239Y mutation site also exhibits significantly reduced B-factors, indicative of a more rigid structural framework. The structure of our p53 core domain quadruple mutant provides the framework for understanding the molecular basis of stabilizing mutations in p53. The fact that the overall structural features of wild type are conserved makes this superstable mutant a suitable substitute for wild type in biochemical and biophysical studies where the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the wild type protein causes experimental difficulties. Further, the structure provides direct evidence for the possible mode of action of the second-site suppressor mutations N268D and N239Y. The spatial separation of the four point mutations (the Cα atoms of residues 239 and 268, for instance, are more than 22 Å apart) and the observation that their effects on the overall stability of the protein are nearly additive allow us to look at their effects separately. As shown by urea-induced unfolding studies, mutations M133L and V203A make the smallest contribution to the stability increase in the quadruple mutant (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The crystal structure suggests that this is achieved by only small structural changes, mainly by local re-packing of the side chains around the mutations sites in the loop-sheet-helix motif and the turn S5/S6, respectively. The main contribution to the overall stabilization in the quadruple mutant, however, comes from the N268D and N239Y substitutions. Formation of an Alternative Hydrogen Bond Can Rescue Cancer Mutant V143A—It has been reported that the temperature-sensitive mutant V143A shows neither DNA-binding nor transactivation activity at physiological temperature, although these activities can be detected at lower temperatures (24.Zhang W. Guo X.Y. Hu G.Y. Liu W.B. Shay J.W. Deisseroth A.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this cancer-associated mutant is globally destabilized by more than 3 kcal/mol (25.Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR studies indicate that the V143A mutation results in changes in almost all residues of the β-sandwich (15.Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In wild type and our quadruple mutant (Fig. 3C), the side chain of Val-143, which is located on β-strand S3, points toward the hydrophobic core of the β-sandwich, where it is completely buried (8.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). It lies in the very heart of a cluster of hydrophobic residues contributed from different regions of the protein. The two methyl groups of Val-143 make direct contacts with the side chains of Leu-111, Phe-113, Tyr-234, and Phe-270. Apparently, the truncation of these methyl groups in mutant V143A is detrimental to the packing of the hydrophobic core residues. It has, however, been reported that this cancer mutation can be rescued when an additional N268D substitution is introduced (14.Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Double-mutant cycles have further shown that this is achieved by increasing the stability of the cancer mutant by 1.1 kcal/mol (25.Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The structure of our quadruple mutant provides an explanation how this stability increase may be achieved. The mechanism of rescue can be pinpointed to the formation of new hydrogen bonds. The energy loss by creating a hydrophobic cavity in mutant V143A can be partly compensated by Asp-268, which uses its two carboxylate oxygens to bridge the two sheets of the β-sandwich by hydrogen bonds in an energetically more favorable way than could be achieved by the asparagine in wild type. Apart from an effect on the overall stability of the protein, we can clearly see a local effect, which may be crucial in rescuing V143A. Leu-111, which acts as a hydrogen bond donor for Asp-268, makes direct contact with one of the methyl groups of Val-143. The hydrogen bond with Asp-268 significantly reduces the flexibility of residues Leu-111 and Phe-113 in the immediate vicinity of Val-143 as mirrored by the B-factors in our crystal structure (Fig. 4B). This may directly counteract the loss of interactions by the V143A mutation by providing a more rigid structural framework around the mutation site. Tyr-239 Stabilizes Regions of p53 Harboring Cancer Hot-spot Sites—N239Y has been reported to act as a second-site suppressor for various cancer-associated mutations, in particular the hot spot G245S in loop L3 (14.Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Contrary to the V143A mutation, which causes global unfolding of the β-sandwich, the two hot-spot mutations G245S and R249S in loop L3 cause only local distortions in the L2/L3 region (25.Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It had been suggested that Tyr-239 may come closer to the phosphodiester backbone of DNA and may consequently influence DNA binding (14.Brachmann R.K. Yu K. Eby Y. Pavletich N.P. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on the DNA-free structure of the quadruple mutant, there is no direct evidence that the N239Y substitution might produce new DNA contacts. This is consistent with the observation that the quadruple mutant shows virtually the same affinity for the gadd45 promoter DNA as the wild type core domain (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We cannot, however, completely rule out that Tyr-239 might rearrange upon DNA binding in the context of the full-length protein, although this seems not likely on the basis of the packing of the tyrosine in the crystal structure. Equilibrium thermodynamic data (in the absence of DNA) clearly show that Tyr-239 has a major stabilizing effect on the structure of the p53 core domain (13.Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14675-14680Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The N239Y substitution increases the thermodynamic stability of p53 core domain by 1.5 kcal/mol and can compensate for the loss of thermodynamic stability induced by G245S. This results in restoration of wild type stability in mutant G245S/N239Y (25.Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been pointed out that, in the wild type structure, loop L3 adopts a conformation which does not favor the presence of a side chain in position 245 because of the observed dihedral angles (ϕ and φ values in the three protomers range from -117° to -129° and -115° to -131°, respectively) and sterical hindrance (8.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). The same is true for the conformation observed in our structure of the quadruple mutant, where the dihedral angles ϕ and φ for Gly-245 are in the same range. The overall conformation of this loop is conserved (Fig. 3D) and residues Gly-245 and Arg-249 form the same interactions stabilizing this loop conformation. Via hydrogen bonds, Gly-245 connects with the backbone oxygen of the zinc ligand Cys-242 and the guanidinium group of Arg-249, which also forms a hydrogen bond with Met-246 and a salt-bridge with Glu-171 from loop L2. The significantly reduced B-factors in the vicinity of Tyr-239, and in particular in the region of L3 where the hot-spot mutations are located, indicate that the packing of the aromatic ring of Tyr-239 stabilizes this region and reduces the flexibility of loop L3. Initial results of NMR studies on the backbone dynamics of the superstable mutant and wild type in solution are consistent with the observations in our crystal structure. 2S. M. V. Freund, H. C. Ang, and A. R. Fersht, unpublished results. This indicates that the observed differences in crystallographic thermal factors are not merely crystal properties, but do indeed reflect the different intrinsic flexibilities of some regions of the protein and a reduced structural plasticity in the quadruple mutant. An apparent increased rigidity in the structure of a secondsite suppressor mutation has also been reported for T4 lysozyme, where the mutation E108V compensates the deleterious effect of the non-contiguous mutation L99A on protein stability (26.Wray J.W. Baase W.A. Lindstrom J.D. Weaver L.H. Poteete A.R. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As in our case, the suppressor mutation causes only very localized structural changes, but significantly reduces the temperature factors in the region of the second-site suppressor mutation as well as in the structural segment where the deleterious mutation can be found. Different suggestions have been brought forward about how the mutations N268D and N239Y might act as second-site suppressors for various oncogenic mutations. The crystal structure of the quadruple mutant M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D provides strong evidence that their mode of action is to locally stabilize regions of the protein. By reducing the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the protein and putting constraints on conformational/structural fluctuation in certain regions of the protein, they act as counterweight for lost interactions or structural perturbations induced by the oncogenic mutations. Stabilization of crucial anchor points in the p53 core domain structure can, therefore, compensate for the loss of structurally important interactions as for example the salt bridge between Arg-249 and Glu-171."

Consequently, resensitization of MOR1-dependent receptor functions was severely delayed in coexpressing cells as compared with cells expressing MOR1 alone.

Heterodimerization of somatostatin receptor subtypes modulates their ligand binding, signaling, and trafficking properties, e.g. the sst2A-sst3 somatostatin receptor heterodimer behaved like the sst2A homodimer but it did not reproduce the pharmacological characteristics of the sst3 homodimer, suggesting that physical interaction of sst3 with sst2A induced a functional inactivation of the sst3 subtype (13Pfeiffer M.

Unlike that observed for the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer, sst2A-μ-opioid receptor (MOR1) heterodimerization did not significantly affect the ligand binding or coupling properties but promoted cross-modulation of phosphorylation, internalization, and desensitization of these receptors (14Pfeiffer M.

Given the high level of sequence homology between opioid and somatostatin receptors existing in domains proposed to contribute to the dimerization interface (i.e. transmembrane helices) it was not unexpected that these closely related receptors can form heterodimers. However, so far little is known about dimerization of opioid receptors with distantly related GPCRs.

SP is released from nociceptive primary afferents in the spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn, where it activates spino-thalamic projection neurons. Recently, NK1 and MOR1 have been shown to coexist in trigeminal dorsal horn neurons, suggesting that MOR and NK1 functionally interact in these neurons during nociceptive neurotransmission. Furthermore, MOR1 and NK1 are highly expressed in brain regions implicated in depression, anxiety, and stress, but also in other regions such as the nucleus accumbens, which mediate the motivational properties of drugs of abuse including opioids. Interestingly, the rewarding effects of morphine are absent in mice lacking the NK1 receptor (20Murtra P. Sheasby A.M. Hunt S.P. De Felipe C.

Despite these observations, a molecular basis for the interactions between opioid and substance P receptors has not been established.

In addition, polyclonal rabbit anti-T7, anti-HA, and anti-MOR1 (9998) antibodies were used which have been generated in our laboratory and characterized extensively (13Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H.

All polyclonal rabbit antisera were affinity-purified against their immunizing peptides using the Sulfo-Link coupling gel according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293 cells (HEK) obtained from ATCC were transfected with plasmids containing either the MOR1 receptor or the NK1 receptor using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The wild-type HA epitope-tagged rat μ-opioid receptor MOR1 with puromycin resistance was generated as described previously (12Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The full-length coding region of the rat NK1 cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR from rat brain total RNA using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Gebouw, CA). The sense primer contained a HindIII and the antisense primer a XbaI restriction site. Purified PCR products were digested and ligated into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding a neomycin resistance and the T7 epitope tag sequence MASMTGGQQMG upstream to the HindIII insertion site. Double strand sequencing was employed to verify the resulting construct. To generate stable lines coexpressing two differentially epitope-tagged receptors, cells expressing HAMOR1 were subjected to a second round of transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). 6 clones expressing HAMOR1 alone, 4 clones expressing T7NK1 alone, and 6 clones coexpressing T7NK1 and HAMOR1 were generated. Receptor expression was monitored using saturation ligand binding assays as described below. In addition, quantitative Western blot analysis was carried out to ensure that clones coexpressing a ∼1:1 ratio of NK1 and MOR1 protein were selected. Furthermore, double immunofluorescent staining was performed in order to validate that NK1 and MOR1 were coexpressed within the same cells.

The reaction was quenched by addition of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml bacitracin). Cells expressing T7NK1 or HAMOR1 alone or coexpressing T7NK1 and HAMOR1 were lysed and further processed as described (12Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol.

Immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads using SDS-sample buffer for 20 min at 60 °C, and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto regular 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electroblotting, membranes were incubated with either mouse monoclonal anti-T7 (1:5000), rat monoclonal anti-HA (0.1 μg/ml), or affinity-purified rabbit anti-MOR1 (9998) antibody (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, followed by detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). BRET Assay—The NK1 and MOR1 coding sequences were amplified using sense and antisense primers harboring unique PstI and HindIII sites. Purified PCR products were digested and ligated into humanized pGFP-N3 and Rluc-N3 expression vectors (BioSignal Packard Biosciences, Montreal, Canada). For BRET measurements, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were detached with PBS/EDTA and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% glucose (w/v) and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were then transferred to 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from BioSignal Packard Biosciences) at a density of 100,000 cells/well. Deep Blue C (coelenterazine; BioSignal Packard Biosciences) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a Fusion microplate analyzer (BioSignal Packard Biosciences) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 330–490 nm and 485–545 nm windows using filters with the appropriate band pass. The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the receptor-GFP (485–545 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-Rluc (330–490 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting background signal detected in non-transfected cells. Whole Cell Phosphorylation Assays—Phosphorylation studies were carried out as described (12Koch T.

Briefly, after agonist incubation, [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells were scraped into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml bacitracin) and solubilized. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using 50 μl of T7 affinity beads (Novagen) or 50 μl of HA affinity beads (Covance). Immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads using SDS-sample buffer for 20 min at 56 °C. Samples were size-separated by 8% SDS gels followed by autoradiography. The extent of phosphorylation of receptor monomers was quantitated using a Fuji PhosphorImaging system and BAS 1000 software. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight. For single immunofluorescence, cells were preincubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-T7 or anti-HA antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml at 4 °C for 2 h and then either not exposed or exposed to various agonists. After fixation, bound primary antibodies were detected with cyanine 3.18 (Cy3)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). For double immunofluorescence, cells were preincubated with mouse anti-T7 and rabbit anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. After fixation, bound primary antibodies were detected with a mixture of cyanine 3.18 (Cy3)- and cyanine 5.18 (Cy5)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were then dehydrated, cleared in xylol and permanently mounted in DPX (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). To examine trafficking of β-arrestin, cells stably coexpressing T7NK1 and HAMOR1 were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing GFP-tagged β-arrestin2 (kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Caron; Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). After 48 h, cells were treated, fixed and then permanently mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Specimens were examined using a Leica TCS-NT laser scanner confocal microscope. Internalization Assays—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well onto poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well plates. On the next day, cells were preincubated with 1 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-T7 or anti-HA antibody for 2 h in OPTIMEM 1 (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Cells were then treated with 1 μm SP or 1 μm DAMGO in OPTIMEM 1 for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, plates were developed with 250 μl of ABTS solution (Roche Applied Science). After 10–30 min, 200 μl of the substrate solution from each well was transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed at 405 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad). Radioligand Binding Assays—Saturation binding assays were performed on membrane preparations from stably transfected cells as described (12Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E.

The dissociation constant (KD) and number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites (Bmax) were calculated by Scatchard analysis using at least six concentrations of [3H]DAMGO in a range from 0.25 to 10 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined as radioactivity bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled DAMGO. KD and Bmax values of NK1 binding sites were calculated by Scatchard analysis with increasing concentrations of [3H]SP ranging from 0.5 to 10 nm. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled SP. For competition binding assays, aliquots of membrane preparations containing 25 μg of protein were incubated with either 2.5 nm [3H]SP or 2.5 nm [3H]DAMGO in the presence or absence of SP or DAMGO in concentrations ranging from 10–12 to 10–5m. Determination of Receptor Desensitization and Resensitization by ERK Assays—Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 per well onto poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well dishes, grown in DMEM medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum overnight and then pretreated with OPTIMEM 1 for 2 h. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm SP or 1 μm DAMGO for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 6 h in OPTIMEM 1. For resensitization studies, cells were exposed to 1 μm DAMGO for 4 h followed by an additional incubation period of either 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 min in the absence of agonist. Cells were then exposed to either SP, DAMGO or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 5 min at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by removal of the culture medium, and subsequent addition of 150 μl of boiling SDS-sample buffer. The samples were assayed as previously described (13Pfeiffer M. Koch T.

Data Analysis—Data from ligand binding and ERK assays were analyzed by non-linear regression curve fitting using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software. Statistical analysis was carried out using the two-tailed paired t test. p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Characterization of NK1-MOR1 Heterodimerization by Coimmunoprecipitation—To examine the dimerization of NK1 and MOR1 receptors, we produced HEK 293 cells stably coexpressing T7-tagged NK1 receptors and HA-tagged MOR1 receptors. Quantitative Western blot analyses revealed that 4 of 6 clones coexpressed similar levels of NK1 and MOR1 receptors (not shown). Saturation binding experiments revealed that NK1-MOR1 double stable clones used for further studies express nearly equivalent numbers of SP and DAMGO binding sites (Table I). While coexpressing cells had a similar high affinity for SP as cells expressing T7NK1 alone, these cells exhibited an ∼3-fold higher affinity for DAMGO as cells expressing HAMOR1 alone (Table I). Competition binding assays also showed that SP did not compete with [3H]DAMGO binding, and DAMGO did not compete with [3H]SP binding in membranes prepared from T7NK1-HAMOR1 cells. When these cells were treated with the cross-linking agent DSP, solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using T7 affinity beads, the anti-T7 antibody detected a monomeric and a dimeric form of the NK1 receptor (Fig. 1A). When immunoprecipition was carried out with HA affinity beads, the anti-HA antibody detected a monomeric and a dimeric form of the MOR1 receptor (Fig. 1B). In addition, a band migrating at ∼ 50 kDa was seen which may correspond to the nonglycosylated form of the MOR1 receptor (12Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When T7NK1 receptors were immunoprecipitated using T7 affinity beads, the rat HA antibody detected a monomeric and a dimeric form as well as a nonglycosylated form of the HAMOR1 receptor only in extracts prepared from cells coexpressing T7NK1 and HAMOR1, but not in extracts prepared from a mixture of cells expressing these receptors separately (Fig. 1C). The coprecipitation of T7NK1 and HAMOR1 suggests that these receptors may form heterodimeric or higher order heterooligomeric complexes in coexpressing cells. NK1 and MOR1 Receptors Form Heterodimers in Living Cells—Detergent solubilization of cells during coimmunoprecipitation studies could promote artifactual aggregation of hydrophobic proteins such as receptors. We therefore analyzed NK1-MOR1 heterodimerization in living cells using BRET. This technique is a proximity assay based on nonradiative transfer of energy between a bioluminescent donor (Rluc) and a fluorescent acceptor (GFP) that allows real time monitoring of protein-protein interaction in living cells (33Angers S.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To assess NK1 and MOR1 homo- and heterodimerization, fusion constructs linking the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail to either Rluc or GFP were cotransfected in HEK 293 cells, and the transfer of energy between the two partners was assessed following the addition of Deep Blue C. Upon oxidation of the luciferase substrate, the enzyme emits light with a peak at 400 nm that can excite GFP, which, in turn, re-emits fluorescence with a peak at 510 nm but only if the two partners are within the BRET-permissive distance (<100 Å). The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the Receptor-GFP over the light emitted by the Receptor-Rluc. As shown in Fig. 2, a strong BRET signal was detected in cells expressing MOR1-Rluc/MOR1-GFP and in cells expressing MOR1-Rluc/NK1-GFP indicating that heterodimers between MOR1 and NK1 also form in living cells. No significant BRET was detected when MOR1-Rluc was coexpressed with soluble GFP, confirming the selectivity of the detected signals. No significant changes were detected in the measured MOR1-Rluc/NK1-GFP BRET levels when the cells were stimulated with either DAMGO, SP, or a mixture of DAMGO and SP (not shown). Endocytotic Trafficking of the NK1-MOR1 Heterodimer—We next examined the consequences of NK1-MOR1 heterodimerization on agonist-induced receptor endocytosis using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunocytochemistry. As depicted in Fig. 3A, quantitative analysis of receptor internalization after treatment with either 1 μm SP or 1 μm DAMGO revealed that NK1 and MOR1 were selectively internalized only in response to their cognate ligands"
https://openalex.org/W2114756704,"LAF389 is a synthetic analogue of bengamides, a class of marine natural products that produce inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. A proteomics-based approach has been used to identify signaling pathways affected by bengamides. LAF389 treatment of cells resulted in altered mobility of a subset of proteins on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Detailed analysis of one of the proteins, 14-3-3γ, showed that bengamide treatment resulted in retention of the amino-terminal methionine, suggesting that bengamides directly or indirectly inhibited methionine aminopeptidases (MetAps). Both known MetAps are inhibited by LAF389. Short interfering RNA suppression of MetAp2 also altered amino-terminal processing of 14-3-3γ. A high resolution structure of human MetAp2 co-crystallized with a bengamide shows that the compound binds in a manner that mimics peptide substrates. Additionally, the structure reveals that three key hydroxyl groups on the inhibitor coordinate the di-cobalt center in the enzyme active site.

Bengamides are natural products originally isolated from marine sponges (1Quiñoà E. Adamczeski M. Crews P. Bakus G.J. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 4494-4497Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Bengamide B is one of the most potent members of the family; it causes growth inhibition in vitro at low nm concentrations on all human tumor cell lines tested (2Thale Z. Kinder F.R. Bair K.W. Bontempo J. Czuchta A.M. Versace R.W. Phillips P.E. Sanders M.L. Wattanasin S. Crews P. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vivo, it significantly inhibits growth of MDA-MB435 human breast cancer xenografts at well tolerated doses (3Kinder F.R. Versace R.W. Bair K.B. Bontempo J.M. Cesarz D. Chen S. Crews P. Czuchta A.M. Jagoe C.T. Mou Y. Nemzek R. Phillips P.E. Tran L.D. Wang R.M. Weltchek S. Zabludoff S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 3692-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of bengamide B suggested its activity might be due to inhibition of a novel target, because its pattern of activity in the NCI 60 cell line screening panel was unique compared with that of other chemotherapeutic agents (2Thale Z. Kinder F.R. Bair K.W. Bontempo J. Czuchta A.M. Versace R.W. Phillips P.E. Sanders M.L. Wattanasin S. Crews P. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although bengamide B was a potent lead structure, its limited availability from natural sources, the complexity of its synthesis, and its relatively poor solubility prevented further development of the compound as a therapeutic agent. Therefore, a synthetic chemistry program was initiated to develop analogues of bengamide B with enhanced solubility and ease of synthesis. LAF389 was selected from a number of analogues because of its equivalent activity in vitro against a broad panel of human tumor cell lines and its improved activity in human tumor xenograft models (3Kinder F.R. Versace R.W. Bair K.B. Bontempo J.M. Cesarz D. Chen S. Crews P. Czuchta A.M. Jagoe C.T. Mou Y. Nemzek R. Phillips P.E. Tran L.D. Wang R.M. Weltchek S. Zabludoff S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 3692-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As was the case with bengamide B, the profile of LAF389 in standard cytotoxicity assays and tests of its effects on conventional cytotoxic targets did not suggest the molecular target of the compound. Because such knowledge can help to develop more potent or selective inhibitors and is also helpful in selecting the most responsive tumor types for clinical use, a number of approaches were used to determine a molecular target. LAF389 was not active in assays for DNA binding and damage, topoisomerase binding, polymerization of microtubules and actin, or proteasome function (data not shown). Similarly, no changes in mRNA transcription were detected in studies on transcriptional effects where cells were challenged for 8 h with LAF389. The relatively short exposure time was chosen to narrow the responses to initial effects on or close to the affected target. Here, we report on the identification of a molecular target for bengamides based on proteomic studies performed on cells treated in vitro with LAF389. Proteomics approaches have the potential to discover effects at the level of posttranslational modifications of proteins, an area where other powerful techniques such as RNA profiling experiments are not directly informative. In this case, proteomic analysis has proven pivotal to the discovery of methionine aminopeptidases as a molecular target for bengamides.

For resolving the 14-3-3 isoforms, ultrazoom pH gradient strips in the range of pH 4.5-5.5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were used. Western Blots—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3 proteins (pan-reactive and isotype-specific) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody specific to the amino terminus of 14-3-3γ was raised against a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acid residues, beginning with methionine, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed by testing against both the immunizing peptide as well as a 15-mer peptide missing the initial methionine and beginning with an acetylated valine (data not shown). siRNA—MetAp2 suppression was performed using an siRNA sequence designed as described (11Elbashir S.M.

Crystals isomorphous to the previously described unliganded and fumagillin-bound MetAp2 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

For co-crystallization with LAF153, an approximately 4-fold molar excess of the inhibitor was added to the protein solution (in ethanol). Diffraction data were recorded at 100 K on the A1 station at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab A Proteomics Approach Identifies an Alteration in a 14-3-3 Protein after LAF389 Treatment—A pilot study was performed using two-dimensional electrophoresis to analyze differences in protein expression of H1299 cells after treatment with a natural bengamide, bengamide E. In the initial experiments, roughly 1500 protein spots were visualized, and a limited number of differences were observed after bengamide treatment. Protein spots that were reproducibly altered in intensity were identified using MALDI-MS. Determination of tryptic peptide masses permitted identification of the parent protein in most cases (Table I). Examination of the differentially expressed proteins did not immediately suggest a common pathway affected by bengamide treatment, because with the exception of MetAp2 and eIF2α, the proteins are not known to be associated or co-regulated. One feature of the identified proteins was that a subset had treatment-dependent changes in charge, rather than changes in mass or abundance. Such changes are likely to arise from post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. A notable protein included in this set was a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous cytosolic adaptor proteins that bind to specific phosphoserine-containing motifs and modulate intracellular signaling, cell cycle control, transcriptional control, and apoptosis (16Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In humans, seven isoforms are encoded by a multigene family. Several isoforms are post-translationally modified by phosphorylation (17Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakamori S. J. Biol.

Initial experiments with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed that LAF389 treatment of H1299 cells shifted the isoelectric point of a 14-3-3 isoform, similar to the effects seen in pilot experiments using bengamide E (Fig. 2A). To broaden the observation of bengamide effects on changes in 14-3-3 isoforms and characterize which of the closely related 14-3-3 isoforms were altered by bengamide treatment, an analytical blotting method was used that resolved 14-3-3 isoforms by isoelectric focusing of cell lysates, followed by Western blotting using antibodies to 14-3-3 proteins (9Towbin H. Özbey Ö. Zingel O. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In experiments not shown, we studied the kinetics and LAF389 concentration dependence of the appearance of the base-shifted 14-3-3 protein. The band became detectable after about 8 h and accumulated for 48 h. After 24 h of incubation, effects in H1299 cells were observed at 3 nm LAF389, with gradual increases up to 300 nm, the highest concentration tested. The bengamide-responsive 14-3-3 isoform was then identified by testing cell lysates from LAF389-treated and control H1299 cells with the IEF immunoblotting method. The immunoblots were probed in parallel samples with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2B). Only the 14-3-3γ specific antibody recognized the inducible and more basic band, consistent with the shift seen in the original two-dimensional gels. The observed pH shift of 0.07 pH units was compatible with the theoretically calculated shift of 0.06 for a loss of one negative charge. For the generality of the response, three cell lines (U2OS, MDA-MB-435, and A549) were analyzed by this method, now using the γ-specific antibody. In all cell lines, LAF389 induced the base-shifted form of 14-3-3γ (data not shown). To corroborate these findings, extracts of LAF389-treated H1299 cells as well as control cells were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, where the first dimension was on a zoom gel (pH 4.5-5.5 over a distance of 18 cm). The region of the 14-3-3 proteins was identified from a contact blot of the two-dimensional gel that was probed with a pan-isoform-reactive anti-14-3-3 antibody. A series of proteins in the antibody-reactive region, including the additional isoform, was cut from a silver-stained two-dimensional gel for mass spectrometric analyses. The spots were digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Data base searching resulted in the identification of several 14-3-3 family proteins. The LAF389-induced spot gave the best fit to human 14-3-3γ. The LAF389-inducible Form of 14-3-3γ Lacks N-terminal Processing—Upon close inspection of the MALDI mass spectra of tryptic digests of the induced and constitutive forms of 14-3-3γ, a unique peak at m/z 1156.57 could be seen in the spectrum of the constitutive form that was absent in the spectrum of the induced form (Fig. 3A). This mass matched that calculated for [M+H]+ of the acetylated N-terminal peptide VDREQLVQK (amino acids 2-10). In the spectrum of the induced form, no mass was detected that fit this sequence with or without N-terminal acetylation. Instead, in both spectra, peaks at m/z 1245.61 and 1261.59 were observed. Three tryptic peptides of 14-3-3γ had masses matching m/z 1245.61: peptides (111-120) ([M+H]+ = 1245.51 Da), (163-172) ([M+H]+ = 1245.62 Da), and (1-10) ([M+H]+ = 1245.66 Da). Therefore, assignment based solely on mass was not possible. The peak at m/z 1261.59 matched perfectly the mass of the N-terminal tryptic peptide (1-10) (M(oxi)VDREQLVQK, [M+H]+ = 1261.65 Da) if its methionine was considered as oxidized (as revealed by the metastable loss of CH3SOH). Coincidentally, a second peptide which also contained an oxidized methionine (163-172, EHM(oxi)QPTHPIR, [M+H]+ = 1261.61 Da) perfectly matched that molecular mass as well. Interestingly, relative to a reference peak at m/z 1197.63, the intensity of the peak at m/z 1261.59 was lower in the spectrum of the constitutive isoform versus that of the induced isoform. This result suggested that the peak at m/z 1261.59 possibly corresponded to a mixture of two peptides in the induced form, whereas that peak would have been generated by a single peptide (163-172) in the constitutive form. This possibility was confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis of endoproteinase Lys-C digests of the inducible and constitutive isoforms of 14-3-3γ (Fig. 3B). The MALDI spectrum showed that the peak at m/z 1261.57 (matching the unprocessed N-terminal peptide M(oxi)VDREQLVQK) was found only in the spectrum of the induced 14-3-3γ form, whereas the peak at m/z 1156.57 (matching the acetylated N-terminal peptide VDREQLVQK) was found only in the constitutive form (Fig. 3B). The combined data from both MS methods (Lys-C and trypsin digest) resulted in sequence coverage of 94 and 82% for the constitutive and induced forms of 14-3-3γ, respectively. Confirmation of the assignment of the N-terminal sequences was performed by nano-ESMS/MS sequencing. Direct selection of the triply charged parent ion at m/z 421.22 from the Lys-C digest of the induced 14-3-3γ isoform and subsequent fragmentation produced sufficient y and b type fragment ions to identify unambiguously the sequence of the peptide as M(oxi)VDREQLVQK (1-10). A similar analysis of the amino-terminal peptide of the tryptic digest of the constitutive 14-3-3γ confirmed the complete sequence as acetyl-VDREQLVQK (2-10) (data not shown). The lack of acetylation in the inducible isoform readily explained the focusing position at a higher pH relative to the constitutive isoform. LAF389 Inhibits Methionine Aminopeptidases Directly—The retention of the initiator methionine in the inducible 14-3-3γ isoform suggested LAF389 treatment of cells reduced MetAp activity, but the data could not distinguish between a direct effect of LAF389 on MetAp activity versus LAF389 effects on proteins that regulated MetAp activity. To address this question, both human MetAp isoforms were expressed in recombinant form and tested in an enzymatic assay using a methionine-containing peptide as substrate (Fig. 4A). Both MetAp1 and 2 were inhibited by LAF389, thus establishing MetAps as direct targets of LAF389. Fumagillin, a well known covalently reacting inhibitor specific for MetAp2 (20Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q.W. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6099-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 21Griffith E.C. Su Z. Turk B.E. Chen S. Chang Y.-H. Wu Z. Biemann K. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), was tested in parallel in these assays. For MetAp2, the IC50 of LAF389 was 800 nm in this assay format, compared with 30 nm for fumagillin. In contrast to LAF389, however, fumagillin caused at most 20% inhibition of MetAp1 even at 300 nm. LAF389 Has Pronounced Activity on Endothelial Cells— Fumagillin selectively inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, and structure-activity relation studies of fumagillin analogues have shown that its anti-proliferative effect correlates well with MetAp2 enzyme inhibition (21Griffith E.C. Su Z. Turk B.E. Chen S. Chang Y.-H. Wu Z. Biemann K. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 22Griffith E.C. Su Z. Niwayama S. Ramsay C.A. Chang Y.-H. Liu J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15183-15188Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to test whether LAF389 could inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. In monolayer growth assays, LAF389 was a potent inhibitor of HUVEC proliferation, with a 20 nm IC50, roughly 10-fold more potent than on A549 tumor epithelial cells (Fig 4B). The endothelial specificity of LAF389 was less pronounced than that seen with fumagillin, which had ∼1000-fold selectivity for endothelial growth inhibition. LAF389 also differed from fumagillin in that substantial cell death of A549 cells was seen at micromolar concentrations of LAF389, whereas even at 10 μm, fumagillin was only cytostatic for this carcinoma cell line. MetAp processing of 14-3-3γ was inhibited in endothelial cells treated with LAF389, as detected by IEF-Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to the γ isoform (Fig. 5A, left). The unprocessed form of 14-3-3γ could also be detected with a monoclonal antibody raised against a 15-amino acid peptide from the amino terminus of 14-3-3γ (Fig. 5A, right). This monoclonal antibody permitted detection of the unprocessed form of 14-3-3γ in Western blots of lysates resolved on conventional SDS-PAGE gels. Treatment of endothelial cells with either LAF389 or fumagillin caused the appearance of the unprocessed form of 14-3-3γ, with the maximal response to fumagillin at 1 nm and maximal response to LAF389 at 1 μm (Fig. 5B). Unprocessed 14-3-3γ could also be detected in cells treated with siRNA to lower the level of MetAp2 (Fig. 5C). The level of MetAp2 was reduced ∼75% by this treatment. Both endothelial cells and tumor epithelial cells had detectable levels of the unprocessed form of 14-3-3γ upon treatment with MetAp2 siRNA, suggesting that in both cell types, 14-3-3γ may be processed at least in part by the MetAp2 isoform. Crystal Structure of a MetAp2/bengamide Complex—To understand the mechanism of inhibition of methionine aminopeptidases by bengamides, we co-crystallized human MetAp2 with LAF153. LAF153 is the primary metabolite of LAF389 both in cells and in vivo and is an equally potent inhibitor of human MetAp2 in vitro (data not shown). The structure, refined at 1.6 Å resolution (Table II), reveals that LAF153 binds in a manner that closely mimics that expected for a polypeptide substrate. The MetAp2 active site is a deep invagination in the surface of the enzyme, with a dinuclear metal center that is critical for enzymatic activity (23Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The innermost portion of the active-site cleft forms the P1 pocket, which recognizes the N-terminal methionine of a substrate polypeptide. The rather hydrophobic P1′ pocket, which accommodates the penultimate residue, lies in the central portion of the cleft, whereas the P2′ pocket is formed at its solvent-exposed surface. In the LAF153 inhibitor complex, the hydrophobic alkenyl linkage with attached tert-butyl alcohol substituent mimics the methionine side chain and occupies the deeply buried P1 pocket, the hydroxymethyl moiety extends into the P1′ pocket, and the caprolactam ring is coordinated in the solvent-exposed P2′ region (Fig. 6A). The 3, 4, and 5 hydroxyl groups of the inhibitor coordinate the two active-site cobalt ions. As discussed below, the geometry of the interactions of the hydroxyl groups with the di-cobalt center is remarkably similar to that observed for the main chain amide and carbonyl groups of peptidic inhibitors of aminopeptidases (24Lowther W.T. Orville A.M. Madden D.T. Lim S. Rich D.H. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The P1 pocket is formed largely by residues Phe-219, His-382, and Ala-414. The t-butyl group of LAF153 is in hydrophobic contact with each of these residues. The double bond through which the t-butyl group is attached is likely required for its proper positioning within this pocket. Interestingly, in the unliganded MetAp2 protein, which was crystallized in a buffer containing butanol (12Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), a butanol molecule is bound in the same position as that of the t-butyl group of LAF153. The smaller P1′ pocket is formed by Leu-328, Phe-366, and His-231. The side chain imidazole of His-231 hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group that is adjacent to the methoxy side chain. We expect that this portion of the inhibitor mimics the penultimate residue in a peptide substrate (Fig. 6E). The size and character of the P1′ pocket is consistent with the requirement for small, uncharged amino acids in this position in protein substrates (23Lowt"

GABA-AT is a validated target for antiepilepsy drugs because its selective inhibition raises GABA concentrations in brain. The antiepilepsy drug, γ-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin) has been investigated in the past by various biochemical methods and resulted in several proposals for its mechanisms of inactivation. In this study we solved and compared the crystal structures of pig liver GABA-AT in its native form (to 2.3-Å resolution) and in complex with vigabatrin as well as with the close analogue γ-ethynyl-GABA (to 2.3 and 2.8 Å, respectively). Both inactivators form a covalent ternary adduct with the active site Lys-329 and the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor.

The concentration of GABA is regulated by two pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, l-glutamic acid decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of l-glutamate to GABA, and GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT, EC 2.6.1.19), which degrades GABA to succinic semialdehyde (2.Baxter C.F.

GABA-AT is a homodimer with each subunit containing an active-site PLP covalently bound to Lys-329 via a Schiff base. The primary sequence of GABA-AT has been deduced from the cDNA of pig brain (3.Kwon O.S. Park J. Churchich J.E. J. Biol.

GABA is transaminated to succinic semialdehyde, thereby converting the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor to its pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) form. In the reverse half-reaction the enzyme is regenerated by conversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate.When the concentration of GABA diminishes below a threshold level in the brain, convulsions result (8.Karlsson A. Fonnum F. Malthe-Sorenssen D. Storm-Mathisen J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 3053-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), raising the brain GABA levels terminates the seizure (9.Gale K. Epilepsia. 1989; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The incidence of seizure activity is very prevalent in the world. In fact, when epilepsy is defined broadly as any disease characterized by recurring convulsive seizures, then almost 1% of the entire world population can be classified as having epilepsy (10.Rogawski M.A. Porter R.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 223-286PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, anticonvulsant agents have been sought for centuries. Not until diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) was introduced onto the drug market over 65 years ago was any particular anticonvulsant drug widely used (11.McNamara J.O. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 461-486Google Scholar). However, this drug is not generally applicable. In fact, about one-quarter of epileptic patients worldwide (about 12 million people) do not respond to any marketed anticonvulsant drug. Therefore, the need for new anticonvulsant drugs is great (10.Rogawski M.A. Porter R.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 223-286PubMed Google Scholar).A reduction in the concentrations of GABA has been implicated not only in the symptoms associated with epilepsy (12.Bakay R.A.E. Harris A.B. Brain Res. 1981; 206: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13.Loyd K.G. Munati C. Bossi L. Stoeffels C. Talairach J. Morselli P.L. Morselli P.L. Loescher W. Loyd K.G. Neurotransmission, Seizures, Epilepsy. Raven Press, New York1981: 325-338Google Scholar) but also with several other neurological diseases such as Huntington's chorea (14.Butterworth J. Yates C.M. Simpson J. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (15.Nishino N. Fujiwara H. Noguchi-Kuno S.-A. Tanaka C. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 48: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (16.Aoyagi T. Wada T. Nagai M. Kojima F. Harada S. Takeuchi T. Takahashi H. Hirokawa K. Tsumita T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1990; 38: 1748-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and tardive dyskinesia (17.Gunne L.M. Haeggstroem J.E. Sjoequist B. Nature (Lond.). 1984; 309: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Administration of GABA peripherally is not effective, because GABA, under normal conditions, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier; however, several other approaches have been taken to increase the brain concentrations of GABA. One approach is the use of a compound that crosses the blood-brain barrier and then selectively inhibits or inactivates GABA-AT, thereby causing a buildup of GABA. Numerous competitive inhibitors of GABA-AT, particularly compounds having a backbone structure similar to GABA (18.Johnston G.A.R. Curtis D.R. Beart P.M. Game C.J.A. McColloch R.M. Twichin B. J.

New Biol. 1971; 234: 80-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a variety of mechanism-based inactivators (24.Silverman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 240-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) of GABA-AT (25.Nanavati S.M. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) show anticonvulsant activity. The earliest analog reported was 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid (1, γ-ethynyl GABA, GEG), which did not become a clinical candidate (25.Nanavati S.M. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The corresponding alkene, 4-amino-5-hexenoic acid (2, γ-vinyl GABA, vigabatrin) (26.Lippert B. Metcalf B.W. Jung M.J. Casara P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), was the most effective of these mechanism-based inactivators as an anticonvulsant agent.Vigabatrin (2), which has high potency (27.Loscher W. Neuropharmacology. 1982; 21: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), has been shown to be an effective treatment for epilepsies that are resistant to other anticonvulsant drugs (28.Gidal B.E. Privitera M.D. Sheth R.D. Gilman J.T. Ann. Pharmacother. 1999; 33: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and currently is used in over 60 countries worldwide (but not in the U. S., where it is presently at the pre-registration status for treatment of infantile spasms). However, about 0.5 g of this drug has to be taken daily to be efficacious. As with all psychotropic drugs, there are a variety of side effects, most severe in this case is a visual field defect (29.Kalviainen R. Nousiainen I. CNS Drugs. 2001; 15: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which restricts the monotherapy of vigabatrin to refractory epilepsy. The drug is sold as a racemic mixture, and it is not known how many of the side effects arise from the administration of the inactive enantiomer (R-isomer). Other mechanism-based inactivators of GABA-AT, such as gabaculine (30.John R.A. Jones E.D. Fowler L.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31.Rando R.R. Bangerter F.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and ethanolamine-O-sulfate (32.Fowler L.J. John R.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), are generally toxic, nonspecific, and/or cross the blood-brain barrier poorly.Recently, it was found that vigabatrin possesses another remarkable activity: it prevents addiction to various abusive substances in rats and baboons (33.Dewey S.L. Morgan A.E. Ashby Jr., C.R. Horan B. Kushner S.A. Logan J. Volkow N.D. Fowler J.S. Gardner E.L. Brodie J.D. Synapse. 1998; 30: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The mechanism was determined to be the same as that for epilepsy, namely increasing the GABA concentration in the brain by inactivating GABAAT. Increased GABA levels antagonize the extracellular dopamine levels responsible for drug addiction. New inhibitors that are in particular more potent and lipophilic, that is so they can more easily cross the blood-brain barrier, are needed.Two mechanisms were proposed for inactivation of GABA-AT by GEG (34.Burke J.R. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9329-9340Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar); these are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. For inactivation by vigabatrin, three different potential mechanisms (shown in Schemes 3 and 4) were suggested, based on spectroscopic and radiolabeling evidence (35.De Biase D. Barra D. Bossa F. Pucci P. John R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20056-20061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chemical intuition (26.Lippert B. Metcalf B.W. Jung M.J. Casara P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 36.Metcalf B.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and extensive radiochemical experiments (37.Nanavati S.M. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9341-9349Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The controversy regarding the inactivation mechanisms and structures of the covalent adducts could be settled with crystal structures of these inactivators bound to GABA-AT.Here, we have been able to use crystallography and polarized absorption microspectrophotometry to differentiate the inactivation mechanisms and adduct structures for the two mechanism-based inactivators of GABA-AT, GEG (1), and vigabatrin (2). Moreover, we report the presence of a [2Fe-2S] cluster at the center of the dimer, observed in the complex structures as well as in the native enzyme at 2.3-Å resolution.MATERIALS AND METHODSCrystallograph—Pig liver GABA-AT was purified as described previously (35.De Biase D. Barra D. Bossa F. Pucci P. John R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20056-20061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of native enzyme were grown at room temperature in sitting drops by vapor diffusion and microseeding. The protein solution (10-14 mg/ml in 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with precipitant solution containing 16-18% polyethylene glycol4000, 0-10% glycerol, and 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol.The GEG-inactivated GABA-AT crystals were obtained by overnight soaking of native crystals in a solution containing 10 mm GEG. Vigabatrin-inactivated GABA-AT crystals were obtained by pre-treatment of native GABA-AT with 10 mm vigabatrin for 1 h prior to crystallization. Each data set was obtained from a single flash-cooled crystal using either 10% ethylene glycol or Panjelly™ (Jena Bioscience) as cryoprotectants. Only a few cycles of crystal annealing were performed to improve crystal mosaicity. Data were collected on MAR image plates, processed with MOSFLM, and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite (38.Collaborative computational project number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The models were refined with REFMAC5, including TLS refinement (39.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Strong non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on the positional and thermal parameters of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit. In the initial rounds of refinement, the cofactor and Lys-329 were set as dummy values. This was followed by cyclic averaging using DM (40.Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) to obtain the best unbiased map for interpretation of the adducts. After model building, refinement of the final model was performed without torsional angle restraints on the linkages between Lys-329, cofactor, and the inhibitor moiety. Planarity was imposed on the atoms of the pyridine ring, the carboxylate group, and, in case of the GEG complex, on the atoms belonging to the planar system of the CA=C double bond.Chemical Analysis of Iron and Sulfur Content—The amount of iron bound to GABA-AT was determined colorimetrically, by using the iron chelator ferrozine (41.Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). GABA-AT (5-10 μm, 460 μl) was mixed with ultrapure concentrated HCl (100 μl) and was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min with periodic vortexing. Following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the denatured protein, the supernatant (510 μl) was mixed with 10 mm ferrozine (20 μl) and 75 mm ascorbic acid (20 μl). To allow ferrozine chelation, the mixture was neutralized with saturated ammonium acetate and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance at 562 nm of the newly formed magenta Fe(ligand)32+ species was determined, and the iron concentration was calculated using the extinction coefficient for ferrozine, ϵ = 27,900 m-1 cm-1 (41.Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). Acid-labile inorganic sulfide was determined by the method of King and Morris (42.King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 631-641Google Scholar).Crystal Microspectrometry—Crystals of GABA-AT were stored at 15 °C in a stabilizing solution containing 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mm sodium citrate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 5.6. The GABA-AT complexes were produced by soaking single crystals in the stabilizing solution containing 100 mm GEG or 10 mm vigabatrin, respectively. Crystals were loaded in a quartz flow cell that was mounted on the thermostated stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer, equipped with a ×10 UV-visible Ultrafluar objective. Single crystal absorption spectra were collected in the range 300-700 nm with the electric vector of the linearly polarized light parallel and perpendicular to the extinction directions, as previously described (43.Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The isotropic crystal spectrum Ai of GABA-AT was calculated according to Ai = 1/3(Ax + Ay + Az), where Ax, Ay, and Az are the spectra recorded along the three perpendicular extinction directions (45.Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Coordinates—The coordinates for native GABA-AT, and its complex structures with GEG and vigabatrin, have been deposited in the Rutgers Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1ohv, 1ohy, and 1ohw, respectively).RESULTSOverall Structure—The quality of the native GABA-AT data (2.3 Å) has been considerably improved since the previous study (6.Storici P. Capitani G. De Biase D. Moser M. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8628-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) due to better crystal order, use of flash-cooled crystals, and data acquisition at a synchrotron radiation source. Crystallographic details are given in Table I. The new structure confirms the previous model. The asymmetric unit contains two physiological dimers (AB and CD) with C2 symmetry. The two dimers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.23 Å, and the four subunits show pairwise r.m.s.d. values between 0.18 and 0.30 Å. This indicates that, within the limits of error, there is no structural asymmetry between the four different copies in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Also, considering the good quality of the overall crystallographic parameters (Table I), it appears unlikely that asymmetric dimers have been incorporated stochastically into the crystal lattice. Refinement of global temperature factors (TLS refinement), however, revealed that AB is the more mobile dimer within the crystal lattice. After TLS refinement, the remaining (intrinsic) B-factors of the subunits were virtually identical. This allowed the imposition of strong NCS constraints not only on the positional parameters but also on the individual B-factors.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData setNativeVigabatrin complexGEG complexSampleNative GABA-ATGABA-AT co-crystallized with 10 mm vigabatrinGABA-AT soaked in 10 mm GEG for 24 hX-ray source; λ(Å)ESRF, Grenoble; 0.984Elettra, Trieste; 0.984Rotating anode; 1.542Unit cell: a, b, c (Å)68.6, 225.0, 70.369.7, 226.7, 71.469.0, 225.9, 70.3β (o)108.4108.8108.5Resolution range (Å)30.0—2.330.0—2.330.0—2.8Number of reflections80,29788,76742,802Rsym (%)aRsym = ΣhklΣi(|I(hkl) — 〈I(hkl)〉|)/ΣhklΣi 〈I(hkl)〉8.57.39.8〈I〉/σ(I)5.96.76.6Completeness (%)90.096.185.7Multiplicity2.02.22.5Rfactor (%)bRfactor is the conventional R factor18.819.419.8Rfree (%)cRfree is the R factor calculated with 5% of the data that were not used for refinement22.122.422.9Number of protein atoms29,21629,21629,216Number of cofactor atoms152424Number of FeS atoms888Number of water molecules641739337Mean overall B-factor (Å2)dIn parentheses, residual overall B-factor after TLS refinement24.0 (18.1)26.3 (11.9)25.9 (9.2)r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)er.m.s.d. from ideal stereochemistry0.0090.0100.012r.m.s.d. bond angles (o)er.m.s.d. from ideal stereochemistry1.11.21.4a Rsym = ΣhklΣi(|I(hkl) — 〈I(hkl)〉|)/ΣhklΣi 〈I(hkl)〉b Rfactor is the conventional R factorc Rfree is the R factor calculated with 5% of the data that were not used for refinementd In parentheses, residual overall B-factor after TLS refinemente r.m.s.d. from ideal stereochemistry Open table in a new tab Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Native Cofactor: Structure and Absorption Spectrum— All four copies of the PLP cofactor in the asymmetric unit form a Schiff base linkage with Lys-329 (Fig. 1) and exhibit similar B-factors (between 15 and 20 Å2) after TLS refinement. With a torsional angle κ (for torsion angle definition and atom nomenclature see Fig. 4C) of 23° ± 3° the Schiff's base nitrogen is roughly in the plane of the pyridine ring and forms a short H-bond with the pyridine oxygen (O3) indicative of a protonated aldimine. The torsional angle around the formal C4′=N double bond is 140° ± 2°. Thus, the conformation appears to be rather strained.Fig. 1Stereographic projection of the active site of GABA-AT.

This band is usually attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the protonated internal aldimine (i.e. with the proton on the aldimine nitrogen). However, there is a second band centered between 333 and 338 nm. A band at a similar position has been found in several PLP-dependent enzymes (43.Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Phillips R.S. Demidkina T.V. Zakomirdina L.N. Bruno S. Ronda L. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol.

Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4043-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, the position of the minor band changes with the polarization direction, which suggests that this band does not originate from a single electronic transition, but results from overlapping bands. The reconstructed isotropic spectrum of the crystal (Fig. 2, inset) is similar to the spectrum of the enzyme in solution (35.De Biase D. Barra D. Bossa F. Pucci P. John R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20056-20061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with respect to both the peak positions and relative intensities, indicating that crystallization did not perturb the coenzyme environment or the tautomeric equilibrium.Fig. 2Polarized absorption spectra of native GABA-AT crystals.

Previously, it was not possible to resolve this feature because of poor resolution (3 Å) (6.Storici P. Capitani G. De Biase D. Moser M. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T.

Fig. 3B shows that cysteines 135 and 138 at the N-terminal end of helix 5 together with their symmetry related mates chelate the cluster. Each of the iron atoms is coordinated tetrahedrally by two cysteines of one subunit and the two free sulfur atoms, which lie on the molecular 2-fold axis and cross-link to the symmetry related second iron atom. The Fe-S distances are 2.2-2.3 Å. The B-factors of the cluster atoms and the cysteines match well (differences < 4 Å2).Fig. 3The [2Fe-2S] cluster at the center of the GABA-AT dimer.A, structure of the GABA-AT dimer.

https://openalex.org/W2170278099,"Most cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations identified to date result in the premature translational termination of the protein, highlighting a crucial role for the C-terminal, BRCT repeat region in mediating BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. However, the molecular and genetic effects of missense mutations that map to the BRCT region remain largely unknown. Using a protease-based assay, we directly assessed the sensitivity of the folding of the BRCT domain to an extensive set of truncation and single amino acid substitutions derived from breast cancer screening programs. The protein can tolerate truncations of up to 8 amino acids, but further deletion results in drastic BRCT folding defects. This molecular phenotype can be correlated with an increased susceptibility to disease. A cross-validated computational assessment of the BRCT mutation data base suggests that as much as half of all BRCT missense mutations contribute to BRCA1 loss of function and disease through protein-destabilizing effects. The coupled use of proteolytic methods and computational predictive methods to detect mutant BRCA1 conformations at the protein level will augment the efficacy of current BRCA1 screening protocols, especially in the absence of clinical data that can be used to discriminate deleterious BRCT missense mutations from benign polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2168865603,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging syndrome caused by mutations in the WS gene (WRN) and a deficiency in the function of the Werner protein (WRN). WRN is a multifunctional nuclear protein that catalyzes three DNA-dependent reactions: a 3′-5′-exonuclease, an ATPase, and a 3′-5′-helicase. Deficiency in WRN results in a cellular phenotype of genomic instability. The biochemical characteristics of WRN and the cellular phenotype of WRN mutants suggest that WRN plays an important role in DNA metabolic pathways such as recombination, transcription, replication, and repair. The catalytic activities of WRN have been extensively studied and are fairly well understood. However, much less is known about the domain-specific interactions between WRN and its DNA substrates. This study identifies and characterizes three distinct WRN DNA binding domains using recombinant truncated fragments of WRN and five DNA substrates (long forked duplex, blunt-ended duplex, single-stranded DNA, 5′-overhang duplex, and Holliday junction). Substrate-specific DNA binding activity was detected in three domains, one N-terminal and two different C-terminal WRN fragments (RecQ conserved domain and helicase RNase D conserved domain-containing domains). The substrate specificity of each DNA binding domain may indicate that each protein domain has a distinct biological function.

The substrate specificity of each DNA binding domain may indicate that each protein domain has a distinct biological function. The importance of these results is discussed with respect to proposed roles for WRN in distinct DNA metabolic pathways.

WRN belongs to the RecQ helicase family of proteins, which is a conserved group of proteins implicated in several aspects of DNA metabolism (2Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F.

The abbreviations used are as follows: NTS, nucleolar targeting sequence. B, WRN fragments were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Approximately 1 μg of each recombinant fragment was loaded, except in lanes 7 and 10, where ∼3 and ∼6 μg of each recombinant were loaded, respectively. Numbers indicate WRN amino acid coordinate.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13483-13488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For example, WRN interacts with Holliday junctions, forked duplexes, 5′-overhang duplexes, and D-loops. Typically, WS cells carry a C-terminal truncated WRN that lacks a nuclear localization signal (20Matsumoto T. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of WRN also plays a central role in WRN protein-protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 7Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and nucleolar targeting (30von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The conserved RQC domain (RecQconserved) includes the nucleolar targeting sequence (nuclear localization signal-dependent) and participates in WRN protein-protein interactions (9Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of WRN also contains the conserved HRDC (helicase, RNase DConserved) domain (2Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), whose function is still unclear, but which may play a role in DNA binding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 and human RecQ homologues (21Liu Z.

While the enzymatic activities of WRN have been studied extensively (7Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), very little is known about the DNA binding properties of WRN. A more complete understanding of WRN DNA binding properties is essential to define the mechanism by which WRN recognizes, binds, and processes DNA substrates. Earlier biochemical studies on full-length WRN suggest that WRN binds DNA with low efficiency (22Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This study examines the DNA binding properties of a series of truncated recombinant WRN proteins and addresses whether distinct functional domains of WRN display differential DNA binding properties that might be required in different stages of helicase and exonuclease reactions. These WRN variants were challenged with several WRN DNA substrates including long forked duplex, Holliday junction, 5′-overhang duplex, ssDNA, and blunt-ended duplex (Table I). The results demonstrate that WRN has three distinct structure-specific DNA binding domains that co-localize with the exonuclease, RQC, and HRDC regions of WRN, respectively. The importance of this finding and its implications for WRN cellular functions are discussed.Table IBiological pathways in which the substrates used in this study could be formed Open table in a new tab Recombinant Proteins—The cloning and expression of most of the GST-WRN fragments was described previously (9Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C.

Briefly, lysates from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS expressing recombinant proteins were obtained by sonication of bacterial pellets in lysis buffer (2× phosphate-buffered saline and a mixture of protease inhibitors, Amersham Biosciences). After sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 35 K for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti60 rotor. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the lysates, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer plus Triton X-100 (0.1%), and the recombinant proteins were eluted with glutathione elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm glutathione). The purified GST-WRN fragments were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Recombinant, hexahistidine-tagged WRN and the N-terminal domain of WRN (N-fragment, aa 1-368) were purified as described previously (24Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GST-WRN RQC (aa 950-1360) was cloned into the NotI-KpnI restriction sites of pGEX-TEV vector and purified basically as described above.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions (20 μl) were conducted in standard binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Protein and DNA substrate concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 30 min on ice and then directly loaded on 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1). Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 12.8 V/cm at 4 °C in 1 × TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), for 2 h 20 min. Products were visualized using a PhosphoImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).

The DNA substrate (short forked duplex) and protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legend to Fig. 2B. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3× stop dye (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol).

In a typical experiment, 30 μg of protein was digested with increasing amounts of subtilisin (Fluka) ranging from 0.065 to 2% (w/v), for 10 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 10 mm. Samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing. The DNA binding activity of WRN was localized to specific protein regions by performing DNA binding assays with a series of recombinant truncated WRN variants and various DNA substrates (Figs. 1, A and B). DNA binding was assayed on ice in the absence of ATP and divalent cations so that DNA substrates would not be degraded or altered by WRN catalytic activity. The long forked duplex DNA substrate has ssDNA and dsDNA regions and is a good substrate for WRN enzymatic activities (17Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The long forked DNA substrate was used for initial assessment of WRN DNA binding capacity, because it can be recognized as ssDNA, dsDNA, a dsDNA break, or a forked structure (Fig. 1C). The forked DNA substrate is also recognized by replication protein A, a ssDNA binding protein, and Ku 70/80, a dsDNA break binding protein complex (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1-4), full-length recombinant WRN binds to the long forked substrate when the binding assay is carried out at a high enzyme concentration (lane 4). WRN binds to DNA more strongly in the presence of ATP than in its absence (22Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which may explain the relatively weak binding of WRN to the long forked DNA substrate under the standard binding conditions used in these experiments. On the primary amino acid sequence level, WRN can be subdivided into three characterized structural domains, the exonuclease, the RecQ like helicase, and the HRDC domain (Fig. 1A). We examined whether these domains expressed by themselves would constitute autonomously folded domains. The integrity of the catalytic exonuclease (aa 1-368) and helicase (aa 500-946) expression constructs were verified by virtue of their enzymatic activity. The exonuclease construct (aa 1-368) posses 3′-5′-exonuclease activity identical to that of the full-length protein (24Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The helicase domain expression construct (aa 500-946) was initially designed based on sequence alignment with other RecQ helicases and was subsequently shown to be catalytically active (Ref. 18Harrigan J.A. Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Kedar P.S. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22686-22695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and this study; Fig. 2B). In the absence of catalytic activities, the domain organization of the C terminus was assessed on the basis of limited proteolysis experiments (Fig. 1D). The rationale behind this approach is that unfolded proteins are generally less resistant to proteases and disappear without distinct intermediates. Folded proteins are more resistant, and proteolysis often reveals distinct intermediates corresponding to subdomains. Limited subtilisin digest of a purified C-terminal WRN fragment (aa 950-1360), which included the RQC and HRDC domains, produced two protease-resistant fragments (Fig. 1D). N-terminal sequencing showed that the 17-kDa fragment started at residue 958 (corresponding to the RQC domain), while the 14-kDa fragment started at either residue 1128 or 1148 (corresponding to the HRDC domain). This limited proteolysis pattern indicated that the C-terminal region of WRN contains two folded domains that encompass the RQC and HRDC domains, respectively. Based on the observed molecular weight in the SDS-PAGE, we estimated the C terminus of the structural domain corresponding to the RQC domain to be around residue 1092. A recombinant RQC fragment with similar boundaries is resistant to limited proteolysis by subtilisin (data not shown), providing further evidence that the RQC fragment is folded. In the studies of the HRDC domain, we also included the linker region connecting RQC and HRDC domains. This linker is predicted to be unstructured by secondary structure prediction programs (data not shown). Thus, the HRDC construct used starts at amino acid 1072 and ends at 1236. Having established these boundaries, we designed and expressed various constructs containing either RQC (aa 949-1092), HRDC (aa 1072-1236), RQC and HRDC (aa 949-1236), HRDC containing C-terminal domain (aa 1072-1432), and the C-terminal half of WRN starting at 949 up to the very C terminus (aa 949-1432) (Fig. 1, A and B). Four WRN fragments were initially used to localize WRN DNA binding domains. Binding activity was detected in the N-terminal exonuclease domain (aa 1-368; Fig. 2A, lane 7) and a C-terminal fragment (aa 949-1432; Fig. 2A, lane 10), but GST (Fig. 2A, lane 6), the acidic region (aa 239-499; Fig. 2A, lane 8), and the helicase domain (aa 500-946; Fig. 2A, lane 9) did not bind the long forked DNA substrate specifically. However, the GST-WRN helicase domain unwinds DNA in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (18Harrigan J.A. Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Kedar P.S. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22686-22695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between this WRN fragment and the DNA substrate may have been too weak to detect by gel mobility shift assay in the absence of enzyme cofactors. This idea was tested by comparing binding activity in the presence and absence of ATP, ATPγS, and Mg2+ at 37 °C and on ice. As shown in Fig. 2B, the helicase domain efficiently unwound the short forked DNA substrate in binding buffer plus ATP and Mg2+ (lanes 3 and 4), but GST did not (lane 2). In binding reactions on ice, plus Mg2+ and ATP (Fig. 2C), the WRN helicase domain formed a weak protein-DNA complex with short and long forked DNA substrates (lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). Specific binding did not occur in reactions at 37 °C, although DNA was detected at the origin of electrophoresis (lanes 5 and 11). This supershifted DNA might be a high molecular weight DNA-helicase domain complex that only forms under these conditions. Under the same conditions, GST does not form a similar high molecular weight complex (lanes 6 and 12). These results indicate that WRN includes three distinct DNA binding regions: the N-terminal region, the C-terminal region, and the helicase domain. The DNA binding activity of the N- and C-terminal domains appears to be fairly robust, but the helicase domain binds DNA weakly and requires ATP/Mg2+ for binding. The WRN C-terminal DNA binding domain was localized more precisely with four purified GST-WRN fragments that lie within the aa 949-1432 region. The long forked DNA was used as the DNA binding substrate (Fig. 2D). Three of the C-terminal subfragments, aa 949-1236, 949-1092, and 1072-1432 formed strong protein-DNA complexes (lanes 3, 4, and 6), but the aa 1072-1236 fragment and GST did not bind the DNA substrate (lanes 2 and 5). These results suggest that the WRN C-terminal region has two DNA binding subdomains, one associated with the RQC domain (aa 949-1092) and one associated with the HRDC containing C-terminal domain (aa 1072-1432). Binding curves were carried out with a constant DNA concentration (long forked substrate) and variable concentrations of the WRN N-terminal, RQC, or HRDC regions of WRN (Fig. 3). The N-terminal region (aa 1-368) and the HRDC-containing domain (aa 1072-1432) only formed stable DNA complexes at high protein concentrations; at a ratio of 1 pmol of protein to 30 fmol of DNA, the N-terminal region bound 40% of the DNA substrate and the HRDC-containing domain bound 85% (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 13). The RQC domain (aa 949-1092) bound the forked DNA substrate with much higher affinity, forming complexes with 70-99% of the DNA substrate at 0.1-1.0 pmol protein per assay (Fig. 3, lanes 7-10). In addition, three protein-DNA complexes formed when RQC was present at 1 pmol (50 nm; lane 7). At lower protein concentrations (6.2-25 nm), the protein-DNA complexes were faster migrating (lanes 8, 9, and 10, corresponding to 25, 12.5, and 6.2 nm, respectively). This result suggests that the RQC domain may form a higher order oligomer that assembles in a stepwise manner and that may involve distinct binding sites on the DNA substrate (ssDNA, dsDNA, or forked structures). The structure specificity of the three DNA binding regions of WRN was tested with four DNA substrates known to form in vivo in DNA metabolic pathways that are linked to WRN function (Table I). The substrates used were a 34-bp blunt-ended duplex (sequence identical to the long forked substrate), a 5′-overhang duplex, ssDNA (same sequence as labeled strand of 5′-overhang substrate), and a Holliday junction. The N-terminal region and the HRDC-containing domain of WRN did not bind the blunted-ended DNA substrate (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4 and 9-12), and the RQC-containing domain only bound this substrate at high enzyme concentration (50 nm, 17% binding efficiency; Fig. 3B, lane 7). This result suggests that the RQC domain has lower affinity for blunt-ended than for forked DNA (50 nm, 99% binding efficiency; Fig. 3, lane 7), in agreement with previous reports (22Shen J.C.

The N-terminal region bound to this DNA substrate poorly (Fig. 4B, lane 3, 7% binding), whereas the HRDC-containing domain showed 27% binding to the DNA substrate at a high concentration (Fig. 4B, lane 7) and formed a faint smeared species during electrophoresis. In contrast, the RQC domain bound efficiently to this substrate, binding 71% of the DNA substrate at 50 nm and 10% of the DNA substrate at 12.5 nm (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). The 5′-overhang is a good substrate for the exonuclease activity of full-length WRN and also for the exonuclease domain (aa 1-368), despite the fact that this domain does not form a gel-stable protein-DNA complex under the conditions tested. A similar observation was noted above for the WRN helicase domain (Fig. 2C). ssDNA was only a substrate for the RQC domain, which bound up to 60% of the input DNA substrate (Fig. 4B, lanes 9-12). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that WRN binds efficiently to ssDNA (23Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A.

Here, we demonstrated that activation of a caspase cascade is necessary for induction of apoptosis by fibrillogenic amylin variants in two pancreatic β-cell lines. Human amylin, as well as truncated 8–37human amylin, evoked sequential activation of caspases-8 and -3, and apoptosis, whereas non-β-sheet forming and non-fibrillogenic homologs, such as [25,28,29triprolyl]human amylin, did not, implying that the β-sheet conformer is required for human amylin-induced caspase activation. Significant inhibition of apoptosis was evoked by a selective caspase-1 inhibitor, indicating that caspase-1 is also essential for activation of the caspase cascade. Furthermore, we showed that specific jnk1 antisense oligonucleotides, which suppress phospho-JNK1 expression, effectively decreased human amylin-induced activation of c-Jun. Studies of the interplay between the caspase cascade and the JNK pathway showed that both apoptosis and caspase-3 activation were suppressed by treatment with a JNK inhibitor and by transfection of antisense jnk1 oligonucleotides or antisense-c-jun, whereas a selective inhibitor of caspases-1 and -3 prevented apoptosis but not c-Jun activation. Thus, the JNK1 activation preceded activation of caspases-1 and -3. However, selective JNK inhibition had no effect on caspase-8 activation, and selective caspase-8 inhibition only partially suppressed apoptosis and c-Jun activation, indicating that caspase-8 may partially act upstream of the JNK pathway. Our studies demonstrate a functional interaction of a caspase cascade and JNK1. Fibrillogenic amylin can evoke a JNK1-mediated apoptotic pathway, which is partially dependent and partially independent of caspase-8, and in which caspase-3 acts as a common downstream effector.

It is synthesized by islet β-cells, and its co-secretion with insulin increases rapidly following nutrient stimulation (5Moore C.X. Cooper G.J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

There is substantive evidence that those amylin molecules that aggregate in vivo, such as human amylin, are cytotoxic to islet β-cells, whereas the non-aggregating variants are not (2Hoppener J.W.M.

Int. 2001; 25: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, aggregation of human amylin could cause progressive in vivo damage to β-cells. Recent studies have indicated that there are structure-function relationships in the amylin molecule that link aggregation and fibril formation to the associated cytotoxicity (12Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Kapurniotu A.

Biol. 2003; 326: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Human amylin, when present in physiological solutions in vitro, undergoes progressive time-dependent physical changes that include: the adoption of increasing amounts of β-sheet conformation (16Goldsbury C. Goldie K. Pellaud J. Seelig J. Frey P. Muller S.A. Kistler J. Cooper G.J.S. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), formation of oligomers of progressively increasing size (17Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and aggregation into polymorphic fibrillar assemblies (17Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). By contrast, rat amylin, whose sequence differs from the human at six residues, neither forms fibrils nor is cytotoxic, but rather adopts stable, random conformations in physiological solutions (13Kapurniotu A. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 438-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The fibrillogenic propensity of human amylin was formerly attributed to a lack of prolyl residues at one or more of positions 25, 28, and 29 within the segment, human amylin-(20–29) (19Cooper G.J.S. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Roberts A.N. Reid K.B.M. Leighton B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Westermark P. Engström U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposition, the synthetic human amylin agonist, [25,28,29triprolyl]human amylin, retains random conformations during prolonged dissolution under physiological conditions (21Janes S. Gaeta L. Beaumont K. Beely N. Rink T. Diabetes. 1996; 45 (abstract 865)Google Scholar). However, recent studies have indicated that different regions in the peptide, including amylin-(30–37) and amylin(8–20), contain additional loci that might also mediate fibril formation (22Nilsson M.R. Raleigh D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Jaikaran E. Higham C.E. Serpell L.C. Zurdo J. Gross M. Clark A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol.

Moreover, a recent study with full-length substituted rat amylin mutants has pinpointed several residues, both within and outside amylin(20–29), that confer aggregation and fibril formation in these molecules (15Green J. Goldsbury C. Min T. Sunderji S. Frey P. Kistler J. Cooper G. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This study also showed that properties of peptide fragments are not necessarily consistent with those of full-length amylin molecules. None of these fibril-promoting structural properties can provide a sufficient explanation for in vivo amyloid formation, however, because islet amyloid is not typically found in healthy human individuals (1Cooper G.J.S. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Exactly how soluble monomeric human amylin becomes converted into β-sheet conformers and amyloid fibrils in diabetes remains uncertain. Factors triggering alteration in β-cell function, such as deregulation of hormone production, processing, and/or secretion, could result in the initiation of amylin aggregation in human diabetes (12Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol.

J. Endocrinol. 1999; 140: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These initial aggregates could then progressively accumulate into larger amyloid fibrils and eventually replace islet β-cell mass (2Hoppener J.W.M. Ahren B. Lips C.J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Studies using human amylin transgenic mice as animal models of T2DM showed that increased dietary fat intake and/or changes in lipid metabolism could be factors leading to development of islet amyloid (26Verchere C.B. D'Alessio D.A. Palmiter R.D. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Baskin D.G. Kahn S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3492-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The association of progressively decreasing islet mass with increasing amyloid deposits could lead to progressive impairment of insulin secretion, declining glucose tolerance, and eventually the development of fasting hyperglycemia (12Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). type-2 diabetes mellitus acetyl 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin activator protein 1 antisense c-jun jnk1 antisense oligonucleotide jnk2 antisense oligonucleotide bicinchoninic acid enhance chemiluminescence fluoromethyl ketone green fluorescent protein c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase peroxidase sense c-jun jnk1 sense oligonucleotide jnk2 sense oligonucleotide benzyloxycarbonyl. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which human amylin elicits β-cell death remain to be fully elucidated. There is evidence that the cytotoxic action of human amylin correlates with an increased cellular oxidative response and low density lipoprotein uptake (27Janciauskiene S. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that human amylin might kill β-cells through aggregation and formation of membrane ion channels that could in turn disturb intracellular calcium homeostasis (28Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M.C. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, our own studies of amylin-evoked cell death in RINm5F β-cells showed that calcium homeostasis remained normal until late in the cytotoxic process (29Bai J.Z. Saafi E.L. Zhang S. Cooper G.J.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that it is small or intermediate-size precursors of the human amylin fibrils rather than large, mature amyloid deposits that cause membrane instability and subsequent islet β-cell death (30Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is now substantive evidence that apoptosis (programmed cell death) is the mode of death induced by human amylin in islet β-cells (7Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. MacGibbon G. Dragunow M. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol.

Contact of small human amylin aggregates with the β-cell membrane is probably required for the initiation of apoptosis, indicating that human amylin might exert a direct cytotoxic effect through membrane interactions (7Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). We have previously studied the cytotoxicity of fibril-forming amylin in cultured β-cells, where we demonstrated that exogenously applied human amylin significantly inhibits RINm5F islet β-cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis associated with increased expression of known apoptosis-related genes p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (10Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. Saafi E.L. Cooper G.J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Human amylin elicited growth arrest and apoptosis in RINm5F cells in a manner dependent upon time and cell passage, indicating a link between aggregate-evoked apoptosis and the cell cycle (10Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. Saafi E.L. Cooper G.J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The roles of c-Jun and of the JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase) pathway in this apoptotic process were also investigated. Human amylin treatment caused increased expression and site-specific phosphorylation of c-Jun accompanied by increased activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA binding and c-Jun transcriptional activity (9Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. MacGibbon G. Dragunow M. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, human amylin evoked activation of Jun kinase, and apoptosis was suppressed by expression of an antisense c-jun (AS c-jun). Furthermore, recent studies in human amylin transgenic mice have also demonstrated that overproduction of human amylin can lead to the development of hyperglycemia associated with islet amyloid formation and β-cell disappearance (8Janson J. Soeller W.C. Roche P.C. Nelson R.T. Torchia A.J. Kreutter D.K. Butler P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Verchere C.B.

Hart S.E. Parker J.C. Carty M.D. Stevenson R.W. Kreutter D.K. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consequently, targeting the β-cell death process evoked by human amylin is increasingly recognized as a new potential therapeutic approach for suppression of β-cell failure in T2DM. Apoptosis is a genetically controlled process of cell suicide that is essential for the normal development and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms (32Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, abnormal cell death regulation can contribute to a variety of diseases, including autoimmunity, and cancer, as well as neurodegenerative disorders and diabetes (33Strasser A. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Cory S. Nature. 1990; 22: 331-333Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S.

One key component of the apoptotic machinery is the caspase family, which comprises a group of intracellular aspartyl-specific cysteine proteases with at least 15 members (35Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Caspase activation plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis and caspases have been identified as targets for therapeutic intervention, where apoptosis occurs inappropriately (37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar, 39Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-3 is essential for the induction of apoptosis in mouse β-cells transfected with human Fas (40Yamada K. Ichikawa F. Ishiyama-Shigemoto S. Yuan X. Nonaka K. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is activated by the signaling pathways for CD95/Fas and tumor necrosis factor α and is the furthest upstream caspase in the CD95 apoptotic pathway (37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar, 39Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The activation of the caspase pathway and the resultant cleavage of substrate molecules, mediate a critical function in the regulation and execution of cell death. However, the detailed biological roles of each caspase, their interrelationships and the interactions between caspase(s) and the other cellular signal pathways, such as the JNK or p38 pathways, in the regulation of apoptosis are not well defined and are currently the subject of intensive investigation. There is data indicating that the JNK and p38 pathways may function downstream of caspase activation in apoptotic signaling, because activation of JNK and p38 by many apoptotic stimuli can be blocked by caspase inhibitors (35Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 41Schulzeosthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 42Ohtsuka T. Zhou T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29294-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, death receptor-mediated JNK/p38 activation requires caspase-8, because Fas antibody did not activate JNK and p38 in caspase-8-deficient cells (41Schulzeosthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 43Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, studies also showed that overexpression of upstream components of the JNK and p38 pathway, such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, can induce caspase activation and apoptotic cell death, indicating that JNK and p38 could act upstream of caspases in apoptotic signaling (44Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). It is not known which caspase(s) play a major role in human amylin-induced apoptosis of islet β-cells and how caspase(s) might cooperate with JNK to regulate this apoptotic process. In the current study, possible roles for caspases in human amylin-induced apoptosis of islet β-cells were investigated using two insulinoma β-cell lines, rat RINm5F and human CM cells. We found that human amylin induced time- and dose-dependent activation of initiator caspase-8, caspase-1, and downstream effector caspase-3 and that apoptosis could be suppressed by treatment with selective caspase inhibitors. Caspase activation was also examined in β-cells treated with different human amylin variants. The non-fibrillogenic agonist, [25,28,29triprolyl]-human amylin, elicited neither apoptosis nor caspase activation, whereas by contrast, the truncated but fibrillogenic 8–37human amylin evoked cytotoxicity similar to that of the wild-type protein. Further studies on the relationship between caspase activation and the JNK pathway demonstrated that human amylin might simultaneously induce multiple pathways that mediate apoptotic cell death. We showed here that JNK1 activation occurs upstream of caspase-3, because blocking of the JNK1 activation by a specific jnk1 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited caspase-3 activation. In addition, activation of the JNK pathway is dependent on the initiator caspase-8, because suppression of caspase-8 activity significantly, although incompletely, inhibited c-Jun activation. However, the JNK pathway could also be activated independent of caspase-8 activation. We expect that these studies will lead to a greater understanding of the molecular basis for the cause and progression of β-cell dysfunction in T2DM and may thus reveal new therapeutic targets for this common disease. Cell Culture and Treatments—The rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F, was a gift of Dr. H. K. Oie (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the human insulinoma cell line CM, was kindly provided by Dr. P. Pozzilli (Department of Diabetes & Metabolism, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London). This cell line was established from cells isolated from ascitic fluid of a patient with a malignant insulinoma (45Gueli N. Toto A. Palmieri G. Carmenini G. Delpino A. Ferrini U. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 1987; 6: 281-285Google Scholar). RINm5F and CM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 290 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/ml NaHCO3 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 as previously described (9Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. MacGibbon G. Dragunow M. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Zhang S.P. Liu J.X. Saafi E.L. Cooper G.J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using RINm5F cells between passages 28 and 35 and CM cells between passages 6 and 28. For amylin treatment, stock solutions (500 μm) were prepared by dissolving synthetic human amylin (Lot 524836, Bachem, CA), rat amylin (Lot ZM275, Bachem, CA), 8–37human amylin (Lot ZN582, Bachem, CA), or [25,28,29triprolyl]human amylin (L31214, Auspep) powder in water and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were cultured to ∼70% confluence, after which peptides were added to a final concentration of 10 μm. Cultures were then incubated for further periods of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 h, respectively. Untreated control cells were also cultured and processed in an otherwise equivalent manner. For JNK inhibition treatment, we employed the JNK inhibitor 1, (L)-Form (Calbiochem), which contains the minimal 20-amino acid inhibitory domain of islet brain protein (critical for interaction with JNK) linked to the 10-amino acid HIV-TAT48–57 sequence as a carrier peptide and containing two proline residues as a spacer (46Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). JNK inhibitor 1 or JNK inhibitor 1-negative control peptide were applied to RINm5F or CM cell cultures, at final concentrations of 1 μm, 1 h before the addition of human amylin. Caspase activities were measured after 16 h treatment and apoptosis after 24-h treatment. Analysis of Caspase Activity—RINm5F and CM cells were cultured in 24-well plates and exposed to synthetic wild-type human amylin or rat amylin, 8–37human amylin or [25,28,29triprolyl]human amylin for specified time periods as described above. For treatment with caspase inhibitors, the specific peptide-FMK inhibitors (Bachem, Switzerland) were dissolved in Me2SO and added directly to the cultured cells (1 μg/ml), 30 min prior to amylin treatment. Control cells received the same volume of Me2SO alone (final Me2SO concentration of 0.1% v/v), which had no effect on cell proliferation and viability. Cells were rinsed with PBS, and the cell lysate was prepared by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS with freshly added 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Applied Science). The plate was rocked for 20 min on ice to facilitate lysis, followed by three to four freeze-thaw cycles with suspension and transfer between dry ice and room temperature. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected for caspase activity assay in a 96-well plate. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Caspase activity was quantified by measuring liberation of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC) from the specific caspase AFC substrates (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of each cell extract was incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS with freshly added 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 40 ng/μl fluorogenic AFC substrate in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor in a black 96-well plate at 37 °C for 3–4 h. The AFC released was measured on a fluorescence plate reader (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) at λ = 400-nm excitation and 540-nm emission. Peptide substrates used for the assay are made by modifying the COOH-terminal aspartic acid with AFC and the NH2-terminal amino acid by addition of an acetyl (Ac) group. Caspase inhibitors are made by modifying the COOH-terminal aspartic acid with fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) and the NH2-terminal with benzyloxycarbonyl (z).

K., and Rutter, G. A. (2003) Biochem. J. 371, 761–774). Here, we examine the possibility that activation of AMPK may regulate distal steps in insulin secretion, including vesicle movement and fusion with the plasma membrane. Vesicle dynamics were imaged in single pancreatic MIN6 β-cells expressing lumen-targeted pH-insensitive yellow fluorescent protein, neuropeptide Y.Venus, or monomeric red fluorescent protein by total internal reflection fluorescence and Nipkow disc confocal microscopy. Overexpression of a truncated, constitutively active form of AMPK (AMPKα1, 1–312, T172D; AMPK CA), inhibited glucose-stimulated (30 versus 3.0 mm) vesicle movements, and decreased the number of vesicles docked or fusing at the plasma membrane, while having no effect on the kinetics of individual secretory events. Expression of the activated form of AMPK also prevented dispersal of the cortical actin network at high glucose concentrations. Monitored in permeabilized cells, where the effects of AMPK CA on glucose metabolism and ATP synthesis were bypassed, AMPK CA inhibited Ca2+ and ATP-induced insulin secretion, and decreased ATP-dependent vesicle movements. These findings suggest that components of the vesicle transport network, including vesicle-associated motor proteins, may be targets of AMPK in β-cells, dephosphorylation of which is required for vesicle mobilization at elevated glucose concentrations.

Using TIRF, as well as conventional confocal microscopy, we examine here the effect of forced changes in AMPK activity on the motion of single insulin vesicles during physiological stimulation. Our results indicate that AMPK CA inhibits both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin vesicle movement and recruitment, and markedly decreases the number of exocytotic events, but does not affect the kinetics of vesicle docking or fusion. Importantly, the effects of active AMPK CA on vesicle movement were also observed in permeabilized cells, in which ATP and Ca2+ concentrations were clamped, demonstrating an effect of AMPK that is independent of the actions of the activated enzyme on glucose metabolism (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of components of the vesicle translocation machinery may help to block the recruitment of dense core secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane at low glucose concentrations.

Briefly, a high numerical aperture objective lens (HR, Apochromatic, 100×, numeric aperture = 1.65, infinity corrected, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) (32Terakawa S. Tsuboi T. Sakurai T.

Bioimages. 1997; 5: 24Google Scholar) was mounted on the nosepiece of a thermostatically controlled stage (37 °C, MC-60, Linkam, Surrey, UK) equipped inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus). A liquid (Cargille Laboratories, Cedar Grove, NJ) of a high refractive index was used to couple the lens to a coverslip. The incident light for total internal reflection illumination was introduced from the high numerical aperture objective lens through a single mode optical fiber and two illumination lenses. To observe the NPY.Venus fluorescence image, we used a 488-nm laser (argon ion laser, 30 milliwatts, Spectra-Physics) for total internal fluorescence illumination and a long pass filter (515 nm) as an emission filter. The laser beam was passed through an electromagnetically driven shutter (Till Photonics). The shutter was opened synchronously with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (640X480 pixels, IMAGO, Till Photonics) controlled by TillvisilON software (Till Photonics). Images were acquired every 500 ms or otherwise as indicated. To analyze the data, single exocytotic events were manually selected and the average fluorescence intensity of individual vesicle regions was calculated. Live Cell Confocal Imaging—To assess the movement of NPY.Venus-expressing vesicles, we employed a Nipkow disk confocal microscope (UltraVIEW™ Live Cell Confocal Imaging System, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Before monitoring vesicle movement, the bottom of the cell was located by inspection in confocal mode. The focal plane was then moved up by 1.5 μm using a piezo motor, which drove the objective lens and was controlled by the system software. During experiments, the focal plane was held at this level (see Fig. 3, B and E). Images were acquired every 500 ms over 3 min. Adenoviral Infection—For immunocytochemistry, we used adenoviruses expressing AMPK CA or AMPK DN (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) at a viral titer of 30 infectious particles/cell. Cells were incubated with adenoviruses in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose for 16 h, and then in DMEM containing 3 mm glucose for an additional 24 h in the absence of added virus. Viral expression was verified by monitoring the production of EGFP, encoded in the viral genome. AMPK Assay—AMPK activity was measured by SAMS peptide assay, as described previously (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Leclerc I. Kahn A. Doiron B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100 as described in detail elsewhere (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and observed on a Leica TCS-AOBS laser-scanning confocal microscope using a 63× PL-Apo 1.4 numeric aperture oil immersion objective. Insulin Secretion Assay—MIN6 cells, seeded in 6-well microtiter plates, were grown to 70–80% confluence and infected with null, AMPK CA, or AMPK DN adenoviruses (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Culture was continued for 24 h in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, and then at 3 mm glucose for another 16 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in KRB medium and either 3 or 30 mm glucose. Incubations were performed for 20 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Secreted and total insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay, as described previously (42Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Vesicle Movement from Permeabilized Cells—To study the effect of various cytosolic ATP concentrations on vesicle movement, NPY.Venus and AMPK CA- or AMPK DN-expressing cells were permeabilized for 1 min at 37 °C with 20 μm digitonin in intracellular buffer (IB) containing 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm sodium succinate, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0–5 mm MgATP, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.05. Cells were perfused (1 ml/min) at different concentrations of MgATP (0–5 mm) in IB solution. Vesicle movements were observed and analyzed by TIRF or confocal microscopy. Insulin Secretion from Permeabilized Cells—To study the effect of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration on insulin or NPY.Venus release events, NPY.Venus and AMPK CA- or AMPK DN-expressing cells were permeabilized for 1 min at 37 °C with 20 μm digitonin in Ca2+ free IB solution and then perfused with intracellular buffer: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl,1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm sodium succinate, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 1 mm cAMP, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.05. The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated using Metlig software (43Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and set to < 1 nm or 1 μm by addition of CaCl2 as required. NPY.Venus release events and insulin secretion were analyzed by TIRF microscopy and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Tracking Single Vesicles—To quantify the mobility of vesicles beneath the plasma membrane, we measured their position using Meta-Morph software (Universal Imaging Co., West Chester, PA). Movies of 30s duration were analyzed. The mean square displacement (MSD) of each vesicle in the plane of the membrane was calculated by the following formula. Images are taken at time intervals (δt). The coordinates of the vesicle in one image are x(t) and y(t), and x(t + nδt) and y(t + nδt) are those in another image taken nδt later. Thus, the square of the displacement during nδt is [x(t + nät) - x(t)]2 + [y(t + nät) - y(t)]2. For a given interval nδt, the MSD (44Kusumi A. Sako Y. Yamamoto M. Biophys.

Glucose-induced Insulin and NPY.Venus Release Is Inhibited by AMPK CA—Increasing the glucose concentration from ≤3.0 mm to >16 mm leads to the progressive inhibition of complexes containing either isoform of the catalytic subunit of AMPK (α1 and α2) in clonal MIN6 β-cells (13da Silva Xavier G.

AMPK CA is a constitutively active form of AMPK, which comprises the 312-amino acid catalytic domain common to both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 (36Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and in which the regulatory threonine residue is mutated to aspartate (T172D). Expression of AMPK CA using an adenoviral vector (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) leads to a substantial increase in total AMPK activity in cells incubated at elevated glucose (30 mm; data not shown) or 17 mm (Fig. 1A), but increases AMPK activity more modestly (∼20%) at 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that the expression of AMPK CA inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in static incubations of MIN6 cells and islets (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To monitor the effect of AMPK CA on the dynamics of insulin release, we followed the accumulation of insulin in the medium above MIN6 cells incubated initially at 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1B). Addition of 30 mm glucose to control (null virus-infected) cells caused a rapid increase in the concentration of insulin in the medium, which slowed with time, reflecting the initial and sustained phases of glucose-stimulated secretion from these cells (26Varadi A. Ainscow E.K. Allan V.J. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4177-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, squares). By contrast, the effects of 30 mm glucose were almost completely suppressed in AMPK CA-expressing cells (Fig. 1B, circles). The above experiments indicated that inhibition of AMPK activity is required for the stimulation of insulin secretion at elevated glucose concentrations. To determine whether inhibition of AMPK might be sufficient to stimulate insulin release, we next expressed a full-length, dominant-negative form of AMPKα1 (AMPK DN), mutated at the ATP binding site (D157A). Expression of this construct substantially inhibits the increase in total AMPK activity elicited at 3 (versus 25) mm glucose in MIN6 cells (13da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), an effect likely to be caused in part by the binding and sequestration of AMPK β-subunits with which both the α and γ subunits usually interact (14Rutter G.A. da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Destabilization of the displaced α and γ subunits then leads to a decrease in the levels of both AMPK α1 and α2, in both liver (36Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre"
https://openalex.org/W2087609091,"SMAD4 is a critical cofactor in signal transduction pathways activated in response to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-related ligands, regulating cell growth and differentiation. The roles played by SMAD4 inactivation in tumours highlighted it as a tumour-suppressor gene. However, restoration of the TGF-beta antiproliferative pathway following SMAD4 gene transfer in null-tumour cell lines is controversial. Herein, we report the inhibitory effects of SMAD4 on pancreatic tumour invasion and angiogenesis. Adenoviral transfer of this gene in a panel of SMAD4 homozygous-deleted human pancreatic tumour cell lines restored SMAD4 protein expression and function. Although it did not affect proliferation significantly in vitro, SMAD4 inhibited in vivo tumour growth in immunodeficient mice. In this xenograft setting, differential suppression of tumour growth in vivo was mediated, at least in part, through downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and expression of gelatinases. We documented the reduced invasion and angiogenesis histologically and by intravital microscopy, and gained mechanistic insight at the messenger and protein level. Finally, we found a negative reciprocal regulation between SMAD4 and ETS-1. ETS-1 is considered a marker for tumour invasion. Upon SMAD4 deletion, we detected high expression levels of ETS-1 in pancreatic tumour cells, suggesting the shift of the pancreatic tumour toward an invasive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2165751778,"Integrin-ligand interactions are regulated in a complex manner by divalent cations, and multiple cation-binding sites are found in both α and β integrin subunits. A key cation-binding site that lies in the β subunit A-domain is known as the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Recent x-ray crystal structures of integrin αVβ3 have identified a novel cation binding site in this domain, known as the ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS). The role of this novel site in ligand recognition has yet to be elucidated. Using the interaction between α5β1 and fibronectin as a model system, we show that mutation of residues that form the ADMIDAS site inhibits ligand binding but this effect can be partially rescued by the use of activating monoclonal antibodies. The ADMIDAS mutants had decreased expression of activation epitopes recognized by 12G10, 15/7, and HUTS-4, suggesting that the ADMIDAS is important for stabilizing the active conformation of the integrin. Consistent with this suggestion, the ADMIDAS mutations markedly increased the dissociation rate of the integrin-fibronectin complex. Mutation of the ADMIDAS residues also reduced the allosteric inhibition of Mn2+-supported ligand binding by Ca2+, suggesting that the ADMIDAS is a Ca2+-binding site involved in the inhibition of Mn2+-supported ligand binding. Mutations of the ADMIDAS site also perturbed transduction of a conformational change from the MIDAS through the C-terminal helix region of the βA domain to the underlying hybrid domain, implying an important role for this site in receptor signaling.

Integrins constitute a large family of α/β heterodimeric transmembrane receptors found in all metazoa (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions mediated by integrins are central to many fundamental biological processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, leukocyte trafficking, and platelet aggregation. Integrins can exist in either active (ligand competent) or inactive conformational states; the equilibrium between these two states is regulated intracellularly by the binding of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 3Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Integrin-ligand interactions also require divalent cations and are regulated in a complex manner by changes in the concentrations of these ions. The effects of activation can be mimicked in vitro by cations such as Mn2+ or Mg2+, whereas Ca2+ typically favors the inactive state. The different effects of these cations are related to their differential abilities to induce the integrin to undergo the shape changes involved in activation (4Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P.

The overall structure of the heterodimer is that of a “head” on two “legs.” The head region (where ligand binding takes place) comprises a seven-bladed β-propeller in the α subunit and a von Willebrand factor A-type domain in the β subunit (βA 1The abbreviations used are: βAβ subunit von Willebrand factor A-domainαAα subunit von Willebrand factor A-domainMIDASmetal-ion dependent adhesion siteADMIDASadjacent to MIDASLIMBSligand-associated metal-binding sitemAbmonoclonal antibodytrα5β1-Fcrecombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing C-terminal truncated α5 and β1 subunits (α5 residues 1–613 and β1 residues 1–455) fused to the Fc region of human IgGγ1α5β1-Fcrecombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing full-length extracellular domains of α5 and β1 subunits (α5 residues 1–951 and β1 residues 1–708)CHOChinese hamster ovary.; also referred to as “I-like domain”), an α,β-fold, which is inserted by short N- and C-terminal linkers into a “hybrid” domain. The hybrid domain is a β-sandwich fold made up of the ∼60 amino acid residues preceding and the ∼90 residues following βA. Both tertiary and quaternary structural changes are observed upon the binding of a ligand mimetic peptide containing the RGD recognition sequence to the preformed integrin crystal (8Xiong J.-P.

Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), however, a pivotal conformational change appears to be an inwards movement of the α1 helix of βA. This shift of the α1 helix appears to be necessary for activation (6Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Although originally thought to be EF-hand-like, these sites are now known to form β-hairpin loops (7Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.

All four hairpin loops are linked in a chain-like arrangement and the β-hairpin loop in blade 7 is probably important for stabilizing interactions with the underlying “thigh” domain. A fifth cation binding site is observed at the junction between the α subunit “thigh” and “calf” domains. Three sites are present on the top face of βA. The first, known as MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site), plays a central role in ligand recognition. One of the carboxylate oxygens of the aspartic acid side chain of RGD coordinates directly to a metal ion bound at the MIDAS, thus explaining the absolute dependence of ligand binding on divalent cations (8Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the MIDAS also induces conformational changes associated with activation of this domain. The second site lies adjacent to the MIDAS and is therefore termed ADMIDAS. The third is termed LIMBS (ligand-associated metal-binding site). The MIDAS and LIMBS sites were occupied only in the liganded structure (8Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M.

Open table in a new tab We have previously used the interaction between integrin α5β1 and fibronectin as a model system to identify and characterize cation-binding sites that can support or modulate ligand recognition (13Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our results showed that several classes of cation-binding sites could be identified. Occupancy of the first class by Mg2+ or Mn2+ was required for ligand binding (ligand-competent sites). The second class was implicated in the allosteric inhibition of Mn2+-supported ligand binding by Ca2+ (inhibitory sites), whereas the third class was involved in the stimulation of Mg2+-supported ligand binding by Ca2+ (stimulatory sites). Recently we have shown that the ligand competent site for both Mg2+ and Mn2+ is the MIDAS of the β1 A domain (4Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The identity of the two classes of Ca2+-binding regulatory sites is currently unclear. In addition, how occupancy of these sites affects conformational movements has not yet been investigated. Here we have examined the role of the ADMIDAS site in ligand binding by α5β1. Our findings provide evidence that the ADMIDAS is a member of the class of Ca2+-binding inhibitory sites and, while not essential for ligand binding, the ADMIDAS may have a role in stabilizing the active conformation through an effect on the α1 helix of βA. The ADMIDAS is also important for the transduction of cation-induced conformational changes from βA to the underlying hybrid domain.

Cells were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, and plated overnight into 6-well culture plates (Costar). Approximately 1 μg of wild-type or mutant β1-(–455)-Fc with 1 μg of wild-type α5-(–613)-Fc DNA/well, or 1 μg of wild-type or mutant β1-(1–708)-Fc with 1 μg of wild-type α5-(1–951)-Fc DNA/well was used to transfect the cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In these assays 3Fn6–10 coupled to sulfo-NHS LC biotin was used at 0.1 μg/ml, unless stated otherwise. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Experiments were performed using the BIAcore 3000 (Biacore AB). Running buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4. 3Fn6–10 coupled to biotin maleimide (Sigma) was bound to the surface of a streptavidin-coated chip (Biacore AB). Dilutions of wild-type α5β1-Fc or α5β1-Fc with the D137A or D138A mutations in the running buffer were injected at 10 μl/min, 25 °C, into flow cells containing approximately 300 response units of 3Fn6–10 fragment. The same buffer containing 5 mm EDTA in place of MnCl2 was used to regenerate the surface after each injection. No binding was observed when samples were injected in the presence of EDTA. All measurements were baseline-corrected by subtracting the sensorgram obtained with that from a control flow cell coated with streptavidin alone. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software version 3.1. Effect of Divalent Cations on 15/7 Binding—96-well plates (Costar ½-area EIA/RIA, Corning Science Products, High Wycombe, UK) were coated with goat anti-human γ1 Fc (Jackson Immunochemicals, Stratech Scientific, Luton, UK) at a concentration of 2.6 μg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (50 μl/well) for 16 h. Wells were then blocked for 1–3 h with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (blocking buffer). Blocking buffer was removed and supernatant from cells transfected with wild-type α5-(–613) β1-(–455)-Fc diluted 1:1 with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (25 μl/well), was added for 1–2 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (buffer A). Buffer A was treated with Chelex beads (Bio-Rad) to remove any small contaminating amounts of endogenous Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. 15/7 (1 μg/ml) in buffer A with 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Mn2+, 2 mm Mg2+, or 2 mm Ca2+ was added to the plate (50 μl/well). The plate was then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Unbound antibody was aspirated and the wells washed three times with buffer A. Bound antibody was quantitated by addition of 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) peroxidase conjugate (Jackson Immunochemicals) in buffer A for 30 min at room temperature (50 μl/well). Wells were then washed four times with buffer A, and color was developed using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (50 μl/well). Absorption at 405 nm was measured using a plate reader (Dynex Technologies). Background binding to mAbs to wells incubated with supernatant from mock-transfected cells was subtracted from all measurements. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. Comparison of Epitope Expression by Wild-type and Mutant Heterodimers—Plates were coated with anti-human Fc and blocked as described above. The blocking solution was removed and cell culture supernatants were added (25 μl/well) for 1–2 h. All supernatants were assayed in triplicate, and supernatant from mock-transfected cells was used as a negative control. The plate was washed 3 times with buffer A with 1 mm MnCl2 (buffer B) (200 μl/well), and anti-α5 or anti-β1 mAbs (5 μg/ml) were added (50 μl/well). The plate was incubated for 2 h and then washed 3 times in buffer B. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in buffer B; Jackson Immunochemicals) were added (50 μl/well) for 30 min, the plate was washed four times in buffer B, and color was developed as described above. All steps were performed at room temperature. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments. In each assay involving a comparison between different heterodimers the binding of mAb 8E3 (5 μg/ml) was used to normalize for any differences between the amounts of the different heterodimers bound to the wells. For example, normalized A405 for 15/7 binding = (AM15/7 – Am15/7) × ((AWT8E3 – Am8E3)/(AM8E3 – Am8E3)), where A15/7M = mean absorbance of wells coated with mutant integrin, Am15/7 = mean absorbance of wells coated with mock supernatant, AWT8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with wild-type integrin, Am8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with mock supernatant, and AM8E3 = mean absorbance of 8E3 binding to wells coated with mutant integrin. 8E3 recognizes a non-functional epitope in the N-terminal region of the β1 subunit (16Coe A.P.

In experiments using heterodimers captured from cell culture supernatants similar results were obtained using Protein A-purified heterodimers (data not shown). Each experiment shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. ADMIDAS Mutants Have Low Constitutive Activity and Show Reduced Expression of Activation Epitopes—The ADMIDAS site contains residues Ser134, Asp137, Asp138, and Ala341 (or Asp259) (see Table I). The side chains of both Asp137 and Asp138 contribute two carboxylate oxygens to cation coordination, hence mutation of either residue would be expected to abrogate cation binding to this site. The other ADMIDAS residues contribute only a backbone carbonyl (except in the case of Asp259, which also participates in cation coordination at the MIDAS site). Hence to selectively test the role of the ADMIDAS site we made mutants D137A and D138A. For these studies we employed a recently described system for expression of recombinant soluble α5β1 (16Coe A.P. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We mainly used a truncated version of α5β1, α5-(–613) β1-(–455), fused to the Fc region of human IgGγ1 (hereafter referred to as trα5β1-Fc). This heterodimer contains the α subunit β-propeller and thigh domain with the β subunit A, PSI, and hybrid domains (7Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A.

The advantages of this system have been described previously (6Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

The ligand binding activity of the wild-type or mutant integrins was tested after either capture of the integrin onto a 96-well plate coated with anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody, or by directly coating the purified integrin onto the plate (16Coe A.P.

Wild-type trα5β1-Fc had low activity when Fc captured but had high activity after direct adsorption (Fig. 1, A and B); the activating mAb 12G10 (15Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) restored the activity of Fc-captured integrin but did not further increase the activity of directly coated receptor. In contrast, both ADMIDAS mutants had very low activity after either Fc capture or direct adsorption. 12G10 only partially rescued the activity of either Fc-captured or directly adsorbed D137A and D138A mutants (in the case of directly adsorbed integrin to ∼15 and ∼70% of wild-type levels, respectively). The D137A and D138A mutations were also made in a construct containing the full-length extracellular domains of α5 and β1 (hereafter referred to as α5β1-Fc). The mutations had little or no effect on the expression of α and β subunit epitopes, apart from low expression of the 15/7 activation epitope in the D138A mutant (data not shown). After Fc capture, the wild-type α5β1-Fc had constitutively high ligand binding activity but the mutants displayed little or no activity (Fig. 2). Activating mAbs TS2/16 and 12G10 had little effect on the ligand binding activity of the wild-type receptor but partially (D137A) or completely (D138A) restored the activity of the ADMIDAS mutants (Fig. 2). These results show that under conditions where the wild-type receptor is fully active (either constitutively or after mAb- or coating-induced activation), the ADMIDAS mutants have low activity. Because activity can be rescued (at least in part) by activating mAbs, the ADMIDAS mutants are not defective in ligand binding but instead the mutations appear to inhibit ligand binding by inactivating the receptor (i.e. shifting the equilibrium toward the inactive state). Consistent with this interpretation, the D137A and D138A trα5β1-Fc mutants showed decreased expression of activation epitopes, such as that recognized by mAb 12G10 (Table II). Interestingly, Asp137 and Asp138 lie at the top of the α1 helix of βA and we have previously shown that a movement of this helix is important for activation (6Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR showed that this reduction was regulated at the mRNA level. Expression of ADAMs 8, 9, and 17 were increased, and ADAM15 was decreased by stimulation of THP-1 with PMA, although these ADAMs were not regulated by PPARγ or RXR agonists.

Many of the known target genes are involved in fatty acid metabolism, as PPARγ is a key component in regulating adipocyte differentiation, and controlling plasma lipid and sugar levels. When ligand-activated, PPARγ binds the PPAR response element (PPRE) as a dimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (3Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar), and affects the transcription of PPARγ target genes. RXR is also able to form homodimers, and heterodimers with other nuclear receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and liver X receptor (LXR). The endogenous agonist of RXR is 9-cis-retinoic acid, a natural derivative of vitamin A, which is also able to activate the RAR. Natural ligands of PPARγ include polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites, in particular the lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, respectively (4Nagy L.

Sidell N. Immunology. 2002; 106: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During all stages of atherogenesis, monocytes and macrophages secrete proteolytic enzymes, which may influence plaque composition or stability (reviewed by Galis and Khatri, Ref. 17Galis Z.S. Khatri J.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). One such protease, MMP-9 is already known to be regulated by PPAR-γ (10Marx N. Sukhova G. Murphy C. Libby P.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), are also members of the metalloptroteinase family, but little is known about their regulation, or role in atherosclerosis, even though some are expressed in the vasculature (reviewed by Herren, Ref. 18Herren B. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the specific functions of ADAMs are unknown, although they are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and signaling (reviewed by Primakoff and Myles, Ref. 19Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar and Blobel, Ref. 20Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ADAMTS proteinases are closely related to the ADAMs. They are secreted, and have at least one thrombospondin type-1 domain, which is thought to associate with proteoglycans. Several known functions of the ADAMs could be implicated in atherosclerosis, and the vascular complications of Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has been associated with increased circulating levels of TNF-α and its receptor, possibly shed by ADAM17 (21Fernandez-Real J.M. Lainez B. Vendrell J. Rigla M. Castro A. Penarroja G.

In the initial stages of developing atheroma, monocyte recruitment involves adhesion to endothelial cells via selectins, integrins, and cellular adhesion molecules. L-selectin (28Giuffre L. Cordey A.S. Monai N. Tardy Y. Schapira M. Spertini O. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) has been shown to be shed by ADAM17 (25Peschon J.J. Slack J.L.

Pathobiology. 2002; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A proteolytically processed form of ADAM8 also shows adhesive properties to ADAM8-expressing cells (30Schlomann U. Wildeboer D. Webster A. Antropova O. Zeuschner D. Knight C.G. Docherty A.J. Lambert M. Skelton L. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48210-48219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human ADAM28 (or MDC-L) was first identified on lymphoid cells, and also exists in a soluble form (31Roberts C.M. Tani P.H. Bridges L.C. Laszik Z. Bowditch R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29251-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The disintegrin domain of ADAM28 is able to bind integrin α4β1, which implies that it may play a role in cell to cell adhesion, or targeting or sequestering its protease activity (32Bridges L.C.

The receptor for α4β1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is expressed on endothelial cells, and is also thought to be a target of MMP-mediated proteolysis (33Leca G. Mansur S.E. Bensussan A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1069-1077PubMed Google Scholar). Within the subendothelial space, apolipoprotein B lipoproteins can become trapped by interactions with highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans (reviewed by Williams, Ref. 34Williams K.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is of relevance that in addition to degrading aggrecan in articular cartilage, ADAMTS4 (reviewed by Tang, Ref. 35Tang B.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (also known as aggrecanase-1) is able to degrade the proteolglycan versican (36Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D.

The proteoglycan composition of SMC secreted extracellular matrix (ECM), including increased versican expression ((37Olsson U. Bondjers G. Camejo G.

In non-human primates, versican has been localized with macrophages in intermediate and advanced lesions (39Evanko S.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Gold L.I. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 533-546PubMed Google Scholar), and is increased in human atherosclerotic lesions (40Kolodgie F.D. Burke A.P. Farb A. Weber D.K. Kutys R. Wight T.N. Virmani R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The expression of versican is increased in proliferating and migratory SMC (41Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), the phenotype associated with developing atheromas. ADAM15 has been located in cultured human SMC, endothelial cells and atherosclerotic blood vessels, although not in normal vessels (42Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), where it may play a role in adhesion and migration. The soluble form of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) has been shown to be shed by ADAM9 (43Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E.

Inui Y. Higashiyama S. Matsuda Y. Igura T. Tamura S. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1962-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which could have implications in diabetes-related atherosclerosis. The anti-inflammatory properties of PPARγ and RXR agonists have lead to their possible use in the treatment of atherosclerosis (46Li A.C. Brown K.K. Silvestre M.J. Willson T.M. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and arthritis (7Ji J.D. Cheon H. Jun J.B. Choi S.J. Kim Y.R. Lee Y.H. Kim T.H. Chae I.J. Song G.G. Yoo D.H. Kim S.Y.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the highly potent PPARγ agonist GW7845 reduced rat mammary carcinogenesis (48Suh N. Wang Y. Williams C.R. Risingsong R. Gilmer T. Willson T.M. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5671-5673PubMed Google Scholar), so their therapeutic actions against cancer are also under investigation (49Palakurthi S.S. Aktas H. Grubissich L.M. Mortensen R.M. Halperin J.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6213-6218PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ and RXR ligands have already been shown to have a broad effect on cell physiology, and it is important to understand the full effects that these drugs will have when being used therapeutically. We investigated the effects of the synthetic PPARγ agonist GW7845, and the natural agonist 15d-PGJ2 alone, or in combination with the RXR agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid, on the MMP-9 protein and mRNA levels of phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cells. We then looked at the effects of these agents on the transcription of other metalloproteinases: the ADAMs and ADAMTS4, and how the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (50Leesnitzer L.M. Parks D.J. Bledsoe R.K.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) affects these changes. Cell Culture—THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were cultured in the same media, except 0.2% fetal calf serum was used. GW7845 and 15d-PGJ2 (Calbiochem) were solubilized in Me2SO, and 9-cis-retinoic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol. Cells were incubated alone, with the agonists or with the vehicle controls at various concentrations for 1 h prior to the addition of 5 ng/ml PMA. In some experiments cells were pretreated with the antagonist GW9662 (5 μm) for 30 min before the agonists were added. Gelatin Zymography—Media samples were prepared 24 h after addition of PMA to cells. MMP-9 gelatinilytic activity was assessed by gelatin zymography. Samples were prepared in non-reducing sample buffer (0.625 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% bromphenol blue), and run through 8% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.5 mg/ml gelatin type A from porcine skin (Sigma). Gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 solution, before incubation in 100 mm Tris-HCl pH7.9, 30 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Gels were stained with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue, 50% (v/v) methanol, and 20% (v/v) acetic acid and destained with 30% (v/v) methanol and 1% (v/v) acetic acid. Bands of enzyme activity appear as clear bands on a blue background. RNA Isolation and Taqman Analysis—After PMA addition, cells were incubated for 6, 9, or 24 h before media was removed and the cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was isolated using the SV Total RNA isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Samples were analyzed by Taqman real-time PCR (PerkinElmer) as described previously (51Koshy P.J.T. Lundy C.J. Rowan A.D. Porter S. Edwards D.R. Hogan A. Clark I.M. Cawston T.E.

Comparisons of group means were performed by Tukey test. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. GW7845 and 9-cis-Retinoic Acid Additively Suppress MMP-9 Activity—THP-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the endogenous PPARγ agonist 15d-PGJ2 and the synthetic agonist GW7845 alone, or with increasing concentrations of the RXR agonist, 9-cis-retinoic acid for 1 h before the cells were stimulated with PMA. After 24 h, the gelatinase activity of secreted MMP-9 was assessed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1). In the absence of PMA, MMP-9 is undetectable using the zymogram conditions described in materials and methods (data not shown). GW7845 and 15d-PGJ2 caused a dose-dependent decrease in PMA induced MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity, however, this was much more pronounced with the GW7845. THP-1 cells stimulated with PMA (Control), or PMA and Me2SO (vehicle control) and treated with 9-cis-retinoic acid also produced a slight decrease in MMP-9 activity at the highest concentration used (50 nm). Combined GW7845 and 9-cis-retinoic acid caused an additive decrease in MMP-9 expression, but the effect of 9-cis-retinoic acid on 15d-PGJ2-treated cells was much less pronounced. The cells remained viable throughout the experiment, as determined by the MTT assay (52Gieni R.S. Li Y. HayGlass K.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 187: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Differential Regulation of MMP-9, MMP-1, and TIMP-1 Gene Expression by GW7845 and 9-cis-Retinoic—To determine whether the decreases in secreted MMP-9 activity were regulated at the level of transcription, Taqman real-time PCR was used to measure the relative quantities of MMP-9 mRNA in THP-1 cells treated for 6 and 9 h (Fig. 2, top panel). PMA induced a 5- and 35-fold induction of mRNA over 6 and 9 h, respectively. Cells treated with 5 nm 9-cis-retinoic acid or 5 μm GW7845 suppressed PMA induced MMP-9 mRNA expression by 3-fold after 9 h. When added in combination expression was reduced 8-fold. Similar changes were observed after 6 h of treatment, but were less pronounced. 15d-PGJ2 (1 μm) did not suppress PMA-induced MMP-9 mRNA significantly, and was only reduced 2-fold when added in combination with 9-cis-retinoic acid. TIMP-1 mRNA was induced less than 3-fold by PMA treatment over 9 h. Neither PPARγ agonists nor 9-cis-retinoic acid altered TIMP-1 mRNA levels significantly at these time points. MMP-1 mRNA was almost undetectable in untreated THP-1 cells, but this was induced by PMA stimulation. There was a trend for levels of MMP-1 mRNA to be reduced when the cells were treated with 9-cis-retinoic acid; however, these changes were not statistically significant. Differential Regulation of ADAM8, -9, -15, -17, -28, and ADAMTS4 by PMA, GW7845 and 9-cis-Retinoic Acid—We also looked to see whether PPARγ or RXR agonist treatment affect mRNA expression of ADAM8, -9, -15, -17, or -28, or ADAMTS4 in PMA-stimulated cells. Fig. 3 shows that PMA stimulation of THP-1 cells induced significant increases in ADAM8, -9, and -17 mRNA levels at 6 and 9 h. PMA caused a 3-fold repression of ADAM15 mRNA, but had no significant effect on ADAM28 and ADAMTS4 after 9 h. Neither of the PPARγ agonists or 9-cis-retinoic acid produced significant changes in mRNA levels of any of the ADAMs tested or ADAMTS4 after 6 or 9 h (data not shown). Interestingly, after 24 h of treatment, expression of ADAM8, -9, -15, and -17 mRNA were not altered by PMA any further (data not shown). However, at this time point ADAM28 and ADAMTS4 were both induced by PMA 5- and 16-fold, respectively (Fig. 4). In addition, ADAM28 gene expression was induced >2-fold by addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid, alone or in combination with GW7845 and 15d-PGJ2. PMA-induced expression of ADAMTS4 was suppressed 5-fold by 9-cis-retinoic acid, 14-fold by GW7845, and was undetectable when added in combination. 15d-PGJ2 induced a statistically significant 1.5-fold decrease in ADAMTS4 mRNA expression, which was further suppressed (10-fold) by the addition 9-cis-retinoic acid.Fig. 4PPARγ agonists and 9-cis-retinoic acid modulate the transcription of ADAM28 and ADAMTS4 after 24 h of PMA stimulation of THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells (0.83 million/ml) were treated as in Fig. 2. Cells were washed and lysed for RNA samples 24 h after addition of 5 ng/ml PMA.

However, the additional effect of 10 nm GW7845 combined with 9-cis-retinoic acid was suppressed by the addition of GW9662. This was also reflected in the secreted MMP-9 activity assessed by gelatin zymography 24 h after PMA stimulation (Fig. 5, inset). Suppression of ADAMTS4 mRNA by 10 nm GW7845 alone, and combined with 9-cis-retinoic acid was reversed by pretreatment with GW9662. Similarly to MMP-9 expression, GW9662 had no effect on ADAMTS4 when 9-cis-retinoic acid was used alone. In contrast, the antagonist GW9662 suppressed the further induction of ADAM28 mRNA induced by 9-cis-retinoic acid. The extent of the suppression was reduced"
https://openalex.org/W1988987892,"Nitric oxide (NO) is shown to overcome the cyanide inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase in the presence of excess ferrocytochrome c and oxygen. Addition of NO to the partially reduced cyanide-inhibited form of the bovine enzyme is shown by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to result in substitution of cyanide at ferriheme a3 by NO with reduction of the heme. The resulting nitrosylferroheme a3 is a 5-coordinate structure, the proximal bond to histidine having been broken. NO does not simply act as a reversibly bound competitive inhibitor but is an auxiliary substrate consumed in a catalytic cycle along with ferrocytochrome c and oxygen. The implications of this observation with regard to estimates of steady-state NO levels in vivo is discussed. Given the multiple sources of NO available to mitochondria, the present results appear to explain in part some of the curious biomedical observations reported by other laboratories; for example, the kidneys of cyanide poisoning victims surprisingly exhibit no significant irreversible damage, and lethal doses of potassium cyanide are able to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase activity by only ∼50% in brain mitochondria.

Several catalytic cycles have been proposed (4Sarti P. Giuffre A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Some of these cycles implicitly treat the NO as an auxiliary substrate rather than simply a competitive inhibitor, to account for the observed production of nitrite in addition to the slowing of electron transfer rate. In some cases an oxyferryl intermediate of heme a3 is proposed and interaction of incoming NO with CuB assumed (15Torres J. Cooper C.E. Sharpe M. Wilson M.T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Giuffre A. Barone M.C. Mastronicola D. D'Itri E. Sarti P. Brunori M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15446-15453Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas other schemes invoke the formation of a nitrosylheme a3 intermediate (4Sarti P. Giuffre A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6Sarti P. Giuffre A. Barone M.C. Forte E. Mastronicola D.

Consequently, clarification of which (if either) of the two centers of the binuclear pair, heme a3 or CuB, preferentially reacts with NO to form detectable derivatives should be of some value in assessing the relative likelihood of one proposed scheme over another as conditions are varied.When metalloenzymes have multiple binding sites for small molecular substrates and inhibitors, especially within the same active site domain, studies with mixed-ligand adducts can often reveal useful details of the coordination chemistry. Here we report the results of an investigation into the preferred site of NO reaction with bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase in the presence of the potent competitive inhibitor, cyanide, both under conditions of turnover and where the enzyme has been allowed to equilibrate in the presence of NO, cyanide, and reducing equivalents. The findings we report appear to be surprising in two respects. First, the inhibitory effects of NO plus cyanide toward the enzyme are not additive; NO actually eliminates cyanide inhibition. Second, contrary to the observations of earlier authors (18Stevens T.H. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. FEBS Lett. 1979; 97: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Stevens T.H. Brudvig G.W.

Chem. 1981; 256: 1069-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we find that cytochrome c oxidase displays a marked tendency to form NO adducts of heme a3 that are clearly 5-coordinate. The results have bearing on two related issues addressed under “Discussion.” These are the likely mechanism of NO oxidation by the enzyme under conditions of high electron flux and the apparent existence of a cyanide-insensitive “pool” of cytochrome c oxidase in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymes and Reagents—Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1, complex IV) was isolated from beef heart pericardium without the preparation of Keilin-Hartree particles (requiring acidification to pH < 6) common to most procedures. Using intact mitochondria, complex IV was separated from the other components of the electron transport chain by deoxycholate extraction as described by Ragan et al. (22Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar) and then finally purified by ammonium sulfate/cholate fractionation according to the procedure of Yonetani (23Yonetani T. Maehly A.C. Biochemical Preparations. Vol. 11. John Wiley & Sons, New York1966: 14-20Google Scholar). This method (in which the pH is maintained in the range of 7.8 to 8.0 throughout) yields good activity preparations of the oxidase that exhibit a 424 nm Soret absorption maximum, do not exhibit a g = 12 EPR signal, rapidly bind cyanide, and rapidly react with NO, which are characteristics of the pulsed form of the enzyme (24Giuffre A. Stubauer G. Brunori M. Sarti P. Torres J. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32475-32478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the preparations usually persist in the pulsed form when stored overnight at 5–6 °C or for months (at least) in frozen (glassing) solution at 77 K. The enzyme was determined to be spectroscopically pure if the 444–424 nm ratio for the reduced enzyme was 2.2 or higher (25Gibson Q. Palmer G. Wharton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 915-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatives were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm in sodium EDTA, and 0.1% in lauryl maltoside, pH 7.4–7.8, to concentrations of 10–80 μm (in enzyme). Enzyme concentrations were determined as total heme a using the differential (absorption) extinction coefficient of Δϵ604 = 12 mm-1 cm-1 for the reduced minus oxidized spectrum of the enzyme (26van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 36-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations throughout are given on a per enzyme concentration basis (not per [heme a]). Ferrocytochrome c:O2 oxidoreductase activity was determined employing the high ionic strength method of Sinjorgo et al. (27Sinjorgo K.M. Durak I. Dekker H.L. Edel C.M. Hakvoort T.B. van Gelder B.F. Muijsers A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we obtain a turnover number with respect to cytochrome c of 340 (±30) s-1 (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.1% lauryl maltoside, pH 7.4, 22 °C) similar to that of the bovine enzyme isolated from a variety of tissues by others (27Sinjorgo K.M. Durak I. Dekker H.L. Edel C.M. Hakvoort T.B. van Gelder B.F. Muijsers A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).A typical heme a extraction, maintaining nominally anaerobic conditions and under subdued light, was as follows. Approximately 2 ml of 0.26 mm (in total heme a) cytochrome c oxidase solution was taken, and 8 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid were added to precipitate the protein. After centrifugation (7000 × g, 22 °C, 2 min) the supernatant was discarded and heme a extracted from the pellet (22 °C, 20 min, frequent vortexing) into 1 ml of dimethylformamide. The concentration of heme a (80–100 μm) was determined using the extinction coefficient ϵ558 = 24 mm-1 cm-1 reported for the pyridine hemochrome (28Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The procedure also results in the extraction of copper from the enzyme which appears in the final dimethylformamide solution as a stable Cu(II) species that is not reducible by ascorbic acid. EPR signals arising from this species have been removed from the nitrosylferroheme a spectra of Fig. 2, C and D, by subtracting the spectra of control samples prepared without adding NO.All reagents were ACS grade or better, used without further purification, and unless stated to the contrary, were purchased from Aldrich or Sigma. Sodium dithionite, 87% minimum assay (+H2O), was obtained from EM Science.13C sodium cyanide, 99%, was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Argon and nitric oxide gases were obtained from Matheson Incorporated. Nitric oxide was scrubbed with water and KOH pellets prior to use and added to enzyme samples volumetrically with gas-tight syringes. Buffered solutions never exhibited any significant change of pH (i.e. <0.05 pH units) following NO and/or sodium dithionite additions.Instrumental Methods—Electronic absorption spectra were measured and photometric determinations made using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrophotometer. X-band EPR spectra were obtained using an IBM ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker B-E 25 electromagnet and Bruker ER4116DM resonant cavity. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained using an Oxford Instruments ESR 910 liquid helium flow cryostat in conjunction with a VC30 controller. Frequency calibration was with reference to diphenylpicrylhydrazyl.RESULTSEnzyme Kinetics—The enzymatic activity (Fig. 1) of cytochrome c oxidase (50 nm) was assayed photometrically by measuring the rate of oxidation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of excess oxygen (control, •) as described previously (17Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The presence of a small excess of cyanide (100 nm) was observed to inhibit the measured activity greatly (▪), and the presence of NO (1 μm) was also observed to inhibit the activity, but less so (▴). However, when NO was added to the assay mixture in the presence of cyanide (♦), a net increase in the enzyme activity was attained compared with the experiment with cyanide alone. That is, with both “inhibitors” present, the effect of NO was phenomenologically opposite to that of cyanide, reversing the cyanide inhibition. This is a very surprising result because the effects of two inhibitors competitive with oxygen binding are expected to be additive and would be predicted to yield results as indicated by the broken line in Fig. 1. In fact, we made the effort to verify, at least in qualitative terms, that the net inhibition observed with 100 nm cyanide plus 1 μm carbon monoxide did indeed follow this simple expectation (not shown), although obtaining good quality linear data at the resulting very high levels of inhibition was challenging.Fig. 1Lineweaver-Burk plots showing inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity by 100 nm cyanide (▪), a mixture of 100 nm cyanide plus 1 μm NO (♦), 1 μm NO only (▴), and a control with no inhibitor present (•) at 22 °C, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, pH 7.4. Total cytochrome c oxidase and initial oxygen concentrations were 50 nm and ∼250 μm, respectively, for each individual assay. Reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically by following the disappearance of the ferrocytochrome c band at 550 nm. The broken line shows the expected result for the additive effect of two concerted inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It should be noted additionally that under these particular reaction conditions, biphasic kinetics were observed in the case of the cyanide plus NO experiments (♦), with the initial rates comparable with those obtained in the presence of NO only and the later phase (not shown) identical to that observed with only cyanide present. The results of these turnover experiments strongly suggest that NO displaces cyanide during reaction cycles with oxygen. Also, it is clear that the NO is not simply acting as a reversibly bound competitive inhibitor, because if it were, the inhibitory effects of NO and cyanide would be additive. Rather, NO seems to be consumed during the reaction, in keeping with the earlier findings of several groups (2Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Rosquist A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Cooper C.E. Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) who have shown that the reaction between cytochrome c oxidase and NO leads to production of nitrite under a variety of conditions. We have suggested previously (17Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) one way in which this process can also support oxygen consumption (NO oxidase activity, see “Discussion”). Cyanide is not consumed during turnover, merely temporarily displaced, with the system returning to cyanide-inhibited kinetics once the available NO has been oxidized.EPR Spectroscopy—A series of EPR experiments was undertaken to further examine the ability of NO to displace cyanide from the binuclear, oxygen-binding site of the enzyme. It has been observed previously that NO undergoes a variety of reactions with the resting oxidized and reduced forms of “dimeric” cytochrome c oxidase (i.e. preparations containing enzyme aggregates with >20 subunits, rather than the 13 minimally required). The nitrosylferrocytochrome a3 (g = 2.09, 2.00, 1.97, and 9-line hyperfine structure on g = 2.00, ANO = 21 G, AHis = 7 G) resulting from the reduction of Hartzell-Beinert enzyme preparations in Tween 80 detergent incubated with NO have been investigated intensely (19Stevens T.H. Brudvig G.W. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Studies using15NO and the yeast enzyme from cells grown in15N-labeled histidine-rich media (18Stevens T.H. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. FEBS Lett. 1979; 97: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1069-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated conclusively that (i) the NO was bound to ferrocytochrome a3 and (ii) the EPR signal was further split by the presence of the proximal histidine ligand of the enzyme.The EPR spectrum obtained immediately following the addition of NO (1 atm) to a reduced sample of the current pulsed oxidase preparation is shown in Fig. 2A. Unlike the previously reported EPR spectrum of nitrosylferrocytochrome a3 derived from other preparations dispersed in Tween 80, the present data consist of overlapping spectra containing both 3-line (A = 18 G) and 9-line (A ∼ 20 G and A ∼ 7 G) hyperfine features. The two sets of signals clearly indicate a mixture of at least two products; one is the 6-coordinate species described above and the other (minority species) a new 5-coordinate derivative (see below).It has been shown repeatedly by magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy (30Eglinton D.G. Johnson M.K. Thomson A.J. Gooding P.E. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Johnson M.K. Eglinton D.G. Gooding P.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Hill B.C. Brittain T. Eglinton D.G. Gadsby P.M. Greenwood C. Nicholls P. Peterson J. Thomson A.J. Woon T.C. Biochem.

Biochem. 1985; 23: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that in the presence of excess reductant, cyanide-bound heme a3 is 6-coordinate and remains in the ferric form, whereas the other metal ion centers become reduced. Almost certainly, this partially reduced cyanide adduct is the major inhibited form in turnover experiments where cyanide is present. The EPR spectrum of the partially reduced cyanide adduct (10 mm in sodium cyanide plus excess sodium dithionite) is broad but readily detectable at 15 K (Fig. 2B, broken line). Treatment of this inhibited species with NO (1 atm) results in the quantitative formation of a new derivative exhibiting a characteristic EPR signal containing a distinct 3-line hyperfine pattern (A = 18 G) (Fig. 2B, solid line). This spectrum is predicted in the case of a single electron spin coupled to the three allowed orientations (MI = -1, 0, +1) of a nucleus like14N with nuclear spin IN = 1 and is sometimes referred to as “superhyperfine” structure if it is known that the electron and nuclear spins are not mainly localized on the same atom. We have also obtained qualitatively similar results starting from preparations of the dimeric resting enzyme dispersed in Tween 80 detergent (not shown); but in this case, the derivative exhibiting the 3-line hyperfine signals appeared to be only one of at least two species formed. The nitrosyl complexes of ferrohemes have been shown to have 5-coordinate structures in the absence of other strong-field ligands by elemental analysis of pure crystalline model compounds (34Scheidt W.R. Frisse M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 35Spaulding L.D. Chang C.C. Yu N.-T. Felton R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 2517-2525Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 36Yoshimura T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1978; 51: 1237-1238Crossref Google Scholar) and a structure determination by x-ray crystallography (34Scheidt W.R. Frisse M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, complexes of this type (NO-bound, d7, 5-coordinate hemes) have been demonstrated unequivocally to exhibit distinct 3-line hyperfine EPR spectra like those shown in Fig. 2 (37Wayland B.B. Olson L.W. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1973; : 897-898Crossref Google Scholar, 38Yoshimura T. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1986; 125: L27-L29Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To better illustrate the point, the EPR spectrum of the nitrosyl adduct of extracted ferroheme a is shown in Fig. 2C (solid line), and also the spectrum of the analogous enzyme derivative has been superimposed (broken line) for comparison. It is to be stressed that the 5-coordinate nature of the complex is unambiguously demonstrated by the nitrosylferroheme a EPR spectrum of Fig. 2C. If two axial nitric oxide ligands were bound, they would either couple antiferromagnetically, resulting in no EPR signal, or couple ferromagnetically, leading to a more complicated signature than the observed 3-line hyperfine. The effect of introducing a sixth nitrogenous ligand (e.g. pyridine) on the EPR spectrum of the extracted nitrosylferroheme a EPR spectrum is shown in Fig. 2D. Clearly, the spectrum of the nitrosyl enzyme derivative formed in the presence of cyanide does not look at all like the 6-coordinate case.In summary, the EPR data convincingly demonstrate that substitution of cyanide by NO at heme a3 in the partially reduced cyanide adduct (starting with monomeric pulsed enzyme) renders the heme a3 site 5-coordinate (Fig. 2B). To verify that the enzyme spectrum of Fig. 2B (solid line) represents a species in which cyanide is no longer bound to heme a3 after NO addition, samples made with13C-labeled cyanide were examined and found to contain no additional hyperfine features (not shown), confirming the displacement of the cyanide ion. The overall similarity of the 3-line hyperfine features of Fig. 2, A and B, indicates that, contrary to the earlier findings of others, a fraction of the heme a3 can also be pentacoordinate in the fully reduced derivative prepared in the absence of cyanide. These results suggest that the histidine ligand proximal to heme a3 is more labile than previously thought, indicating some conformational flexibility at the binuclear pair. In support of this observation, it is noteworthy that the proximal ligand-to-heme a3 bond length in the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus enzyme is significantly longer than in other reported structures (39Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy—In Fig. 3A the electronic absorption spectra of two NO adducts of cytochrome c oxidase are shown. The first is formed by the addition of NO to the dithionite-reduced enzyme (dashed line) and the second by the addition of NO to the partially reduced cyanide adduct (solid line). In the case of the second species, the order in which cyanide, NO, and reducing agent are added is not important, as the same derivative was always obtained (result confirmed by EPR spectroscopy; data not shown). These data appear to be in agreement with the EPR spectra of Fig. 2, A and B; that is, in the presence and absence of cyanide somewhat different NO adducts are obtained.Fig. 3Electronic absorption spectra of bovine cytochrome c oxidase at 22 °C, 1.00 cm path length.A, pulsed monomeric oxidase (8 μm in 0.1% lauryl maltoside, 25 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) reduced with sodium dithionite plus 1 atm of NO (dashed line) and after subsequent addition of 1 mm cyanide (solid line). B, Soret region of the enzyme (8 μm in 0.1% lauryl maltoside, 25 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4): pulsed monomeric enzyme (solid line); resting monomeric enzyme (dashed line); with 1 mm sodium nitrite added to the pulsed monomeric enzyme (dotted line). C, pyridine hemochrome derived from extracted heme a (50 μl of buffered enzyme solution, 0.70 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, 0.25 ml of pyridine, excess solid sodium dithionite) demonstrating the absence of other contaminating hemes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because NO is converted to nitrite by cytochrome c oxidase (2Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Rosquist A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) it was important to establish whether any of the species formed in the presence of excess NO were nitrite adducts. As shown in Fig. 3B, the Soret maximum shifts from 424 nm in the pulsed enzyme (solid trace) to 419 nm (dotted trace) following the addition of excess sodium nitrite. Note that neither of these is the same Soret maximum found associated with the monomeric resting enzyme (421 nm, dashed line). Furthermore, we did not observe the appearance of a g = 12 EPR signal (not shown) upon formation of the nitrite adduct. In fact, when nitrite is added to the pulsed enzyme, some reduction of nitrite to NO occurs, and a very small amount of nitrosylferrocytochrome a3 appears in the EPR spectrum. Superficially, the absorption spectrum of the nitrite adduct resembles that of the dimeric resting cytochrome c oxidase in Tween 80 (Soret maximum 417–418 nm, not shown), but these are clearly not the same species. More importantly, there is no evidence in the spectra of Fig. 3A, where the Soret features are at 431 and 442 nm, for a shoulder in the vicinity of 419 nm. Consequently, none of the species formed in the presence of excess NO seem to be simple nitrite adducts.It is important to bear in mind that the Soret maxima of cytochrome c oxidase derivatives are subject to distortion by the presence of heme contaminants. Specifically, complex III of the electron transport chain can be an especially difficult impurity to eliminate (40Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pyridine hemochrome spectrum (28Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) of heme a extracted from the current enzyme preparations is shown in Fig. 3C. The presence of the visible region band at 588 nm establishes that the heme a macrocycle was not derivatized during the extraction procedure. More importantly, the absence of any peaks at 557 and 550 nm confirms that the preparations contained no significant amounts of heme b or heme c, respectively (we estimate <3% of these relative to heme a). The Soret maxima we document herein have, of course, all been determined employing preparations essentially free of other heme-containing impurities.DISCUSSIONMechanism of NO Turnover—In conjunction with the findings of others, the present results have implications concerning the likely mechanism(s) of NO turnover by cytochrome c oxidase.

https://openalex.org/W2088273979,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are necessary for several cellular functions and in stress tolerance. Most sHsps are oligomers; intersubunit interactions leading to changes in oligomeric structure and exposure of specific regions may modulate their functioning. Many sHsps, including αA- and αB-crystallin, contain a well conserved SRLFDQFFG sequence motif in the N-terminal region. Sequence-based prediction shows that it exhibits helical propensity with amphipathic character, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the structure and function of α-crystallins. In order to investigate the role of this motif in the structure and function of sHsps, we have made constructs deleting this sequence from αA- and αB-crystallin, overexpressed, purified, and studied these engineered proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies show changes in tertiary and secondary structure on deletion of the sequence. Glycerol density gradient centrifugation and dynamic light scattering studies show that the multimeric size of the mutant proteins is significantly reduced, indicating a role for this motif in higher order organization of the subunits. Both deletion mutants exhibit similar oligomeric size and increased chaperone-like activity. Urea-induced denaturation study shows that the SRLFDQFFG sequence contributes significantly to the structural stability. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies show that the rate of exchange of the subunits in the αAdel-crystallin oligomer is higher compared with that in the αA-crystallin oligomer, suggesting that this region contributes to the oligomer dynamics in addition to the higher order assembly and structural stability. Thus, our study shows that the SRLFDQFFG sequence is one of the critical motifs in structure-function regulation of αA- and αB-crystallin.

Urea-induced denaturation study shows that the SRLFDQFFG sequence contributes significantly to the structural stability. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies show that the rate of exchange of the subunits in the αAdel-crystallin oligomer is higher compared with that in the αA-crystallin oligomer, suggesting that this region contributes to the oligomer dynamics in addition to the higher order assembly and structural stability. Thus, our study shows that the SRLFDQFFG sequence is one of the critical motifs in structure-function regulation of αA- and αB-crystallin. α-Crystallin, a multimeric protein composed of two types of subunits, αA- and αB-crystallin, is abundantly present in the eye lens (1Quax-Jeuken Y. Quax W. van Rens G. Khan P.M. Bloemendal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both αA- and αB-crystallin have subunit molecular masses of ∼20 kDa each, share high sequence homology (2Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-41Google Scholar), can form homomultimers (3Bhat S.P. Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J.

A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), while comparing the sequences of four small heat shock proteins from Drosophila, discovered the remarkable similarity between αB-crystallin and small heat shock proteins. Prompted by this sequence similarity, Klemenz et al. (8Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) investigated the expression of α-crystallin under heat shock and concluded that indeed α-crystallin is a heat shock protein. Horwitz (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar) subsequently showed that α-crystallin prevents aggregation of other proteins like other heat shock proteins. αB-crystallin and not αA-crystallin is stress-inducible. Its levels increase under stress such as heat shock, ischemia, oxidation, and infection and in various disease conditions (10Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have shown that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins is temperature-dependent. The observed temperature-induced enhancement of activity involves a structural transition that enhances the activity by increasing or favorably reorganizing the hydrophobic substrate-binding surfaces (13Raman B.

Its differential and reversible interaction with early unfolding, refolding-competent intermediates of target proteins decreases their partitioning into aggregation-prone late unfolding intermediates (18Goenka S.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This appears to be important in the observed protection offered by α-crystallin to enzymes from heat-induced inactivation (23Rajaraman K. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Hook D.W.A. Harding J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Hess J.F.

Markedly decreased chaperone-like activity and altered structure (28Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 31Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W. Weleber R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The R116C mutant of αA-crystallin offers reduced protection to apoptosis in lens epithelial cells subjected to UV stress (32Andley U.P. Patel H.C. Xi J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10178-10186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These and other similar observations suggest that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is important in normal cellular function as well as in stress tolerance. Although growing evidence implicates the functional importance of α-crystallins in many cellular processes (27Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), knowledge about its structure-function relationship remains elusive largely due to the lack of an x-ray crystal structure or NMR solution structure. Sequence comparison between several sHsps shows an evolutionarily conserved sequence of about 80-100 amino acids, called the “α-crystallin domain” (33de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), flanked by the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal region (generally termed as C-terminal extension). The C-terminal region is largely unstructured and is believed to have a solubilizing role, since it contains many charged residues (34Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our recent study showed that besides its solubilizing role, it could also influence the structure and the chaperone-like activity significantly (35Pasta S.Y. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45821-45828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The differences in the N-terminal domains and the C-terminal extensions of sHsps may result in their differing oligomeric assembly, size, dynamics, and functions. Deletion of the first 63 residues of the N-terminal domain of αA-crystallin leads to a drastic reduction in the size of the protein to dimers or tetramers (36Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, truncation of the first 19 residues of the N-terminal domain of αA-crystallin does not alter the size significantly; the rate of subunit exchange also does not change significantly (37Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Besides the α-crystallin domain, there are two notable regions (or motifs) that are conserved, especially among the mammalian sHsps: one in the N-terminal domain, RLFDQXFG, and another in the C-terminal extension, the IX(I/V) motif (33de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, the structural and functional significance of these regions is not understood. We therefore set out to investigate the role of the SRLFDQFFG sequence in the structure and chaperone-like activity of αA- and αB-crystallins by creating mutants that lack this sequence (αAΔ20-28 and αBΔ21-29; for simplicity termed αAdel- and αBdel-crystallin henceforth). Our results demonstrate that deletion of this sequence results in significant decrease in the oligomeric size and stability toward urea-induced denaturation, indicating that this sequence is one of the determinants of the quaternary structure of α-crystallins and contributes to the structural stability. Both the deletion mutants exhibit severalfold increased chaperone-like activity compared with that of αA- and αB-crystallin. Our results show that this region also contributes to the dynamics of subunit assembly as the αAdel-crystallin exhibits a significantly increased rate of subunit exchange compared with the wild type protein as monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Materials—pET-21a(+), T7 promoter and terminator primers were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), pBS(II)SK was from Stratagene, and insulin and bis-ANS were from Sigma. Sephacryl HR-300 was purchased from AP-Biotech. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories (Mumbai, India). Fluorescence probes used in FRET experiments, namely the disodium salt of 4-acetamido-4′-((iodoacetyl)amino)stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AIAS) and dipotassium salt of lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LYI), were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Creating Mutant αAdel- and αBdel-crystallin—Recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallin genes were cloned in pET-21a(+) as described earlier (28Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These constructs were used as templates to generate the deletion mutants using PCR. For αAdel-crystallin, two independent PCRs were performed using T7 promoter primer and the mutagenic primer 5′-GGGGTAGAAGGGCCCC-3′ as one primer pair and 5′-GAGGGCCTTTTTGAGTATG-3′ and T7 terminator primer as the second primer pair. Fragments of 137 and 588 bp generated in the PCR were digested using NdeI and HindIII, respectively, and cloned in the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET-21a(+) expression vector via a three-point ligation. The same strategy was employed for αBdel-crystallin using T7 promoter primer and 5′-GGGGGAGTGGAAAGGAAA-3′ and 5′-GAGCACCTGTTGGAGTCT-3′ and the T7 terminator primer to generate 140- and 532-bp fragments, respectively. These fragments were also three-point ligated into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET-21a(+) expression vector. These constructs were verified by sequencing using a 3700 ABI automated DNA sequencer. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—The wild type and the mutant recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. All the purification processes were performed using 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA with 0.02% sodium azide (TNE). Bacterial cells were lysed in TNE buffer using lysozyme and then sonicated to shear the genomic DNA. The purification procedure for the wild type and mutant αA- and αB-crystallin was essentially as described by Sun et al. (4Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant proteins precipitated with 30-50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The protein pellet was dissolved in TNE buffer and loaded on to a Sephacryl HR-300 gel filtration column (1.8 × 130 cm). The fractions containing α-crystallin were pooled and subjected to ion exchange chromatography using Mono Q. The purified proteins were dialyzed against the TNE buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purity of the wild type and deletion mutant proteins was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to be homogeneous. The concentrations of the protein samples were determined by the method described by Pace et al. (38Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Chaperone Assays—The chaperone-like activity of the wild type and mutant proteins was studied using DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. Insulin (0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl in the absence or the presence of chaperones (at the different concentrations mentioned in the figure legends to obtain different chaperone to target protein ratios) was incubated at 37 °C. Aggregation was initiated by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. The aggregation of the target protein was monitored as right angle light scattering using a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The samples were placed in the thermostated cuvette holder, and light scattering was measured as a function of time by setting the excitation and emission monochromators at 465 nm with the excitation and emission band passes set at 3 nm. Fluorescence Studies—All fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission band passes set at 5 and 3 nm, respectively. All spectra were recorded in corrected spectrum mode. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the wild type and the mutant α-crystallins (0.15 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl were recorded by exciting the sample with 295-nm light. Urea-induced denaturation of the wild type and deletion mutants of α-crystallin was studied by monitoring the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence. Proteins at 0.2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) in the presence of various concentrations of urea were incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 2 h, and the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of these samples was recorded with the excitation and emission band passes of 2.5 nm using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. To study binding of the hydrophobic probe, bis-ANS, 15 μl of 0.8 mm methanolic solution of bis-ANS was added to 1.2 ml of protein sample (as described above), and the samples incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded from 400 to 600 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 390 nm. Circular Dichroism Studies—Near- and far-UV CD spectra of the wild type and the mutant α-crystallins were recorded using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Experiments were performed with 1.0 mg/ml protein in TNE buffer using a 1-cm path length cell for the near-UV region and a 0.01-cm path length cell for far-UV region. All spectra reported are the average of five accumulations and are blank corrected. Sedimentation through Glycerol Gradient—Glycerol gradient centrifugation was carried out essentially as described by Lambert et al. (39Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). αA- or αB-crystallin and the deletion mutants (1 mg) in TNE buffer (pH 7.4) were loaded on top of a 12-ml linear gradient of glycerol (10-40%) made in the same buffer. The tubes were centrifuged for 18 h at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.3 ml) were withdrawn from the top using a Haake-Buchler Auto Densi-Flow IIC gradient former/remover, and optical density at 280 nm of the fractions was measured using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) were used as standards for estimating the molecular masses of the α-crystallin samples. Dynamic Light Scattering Studies—The hydrodynamic radii of the wild type and the mutant α-crystallins were measured by dynamic light scattering measurements using a DynaPro MS/X Dynamic Light Scattering Instrument from Protein Solutions Inc. The protein samples were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and 50 μl of 2 mg/ml α-crystallin sample was used. The cell holder was thermostated at 22 °C. Measurements were made at a fixed angle of 90° using an incident laser beam of 830 nm. Twenty measurements were made with an acquisition time of 10 s for each measurement at the sensitivity of 10%. The data were analyzed using graphical size analysis software, Dynamics, provided with the instrument. Subunit Exchange Studies—The cysteine residues in αA- and αAdel-crystallin were covalently labeled with the fluorescence probes, AIAS and LYI, separately by incubating the protein samples (1 mg/ml) in 20 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.9) containing 100 mm NaCl with a 250 μm concentration of the probes at 37 °C for 18 h. The unlabeled probes were removed by passing the samples through a desalting column (PD10), eluted using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. The void volume fractions containing the labeled protein were pooled, and their concentrations were determined. Subunit exchange experiments were performed by mixing the AIAS-labeled protein and the LYI-labeled protein at equal concentration (total protein concentration was 0.7 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT and incubating at the indicated temperatures in a Julabo thermostated water bath. 20 μl of sample was withdrawn at different time intervals and diluted to 0.4 ml with the same buffer, and the fluorescence spectrum was recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi F4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the excitation wavelength of 332 nm in corrected spectrum mode. The excitation and emission band passes were set 5 nm each. Earlier studies indicated that the N-terminal region and the α-crystallin domains are involved in subunit interactions (40Feil I.K. Malfois M. Hendle J. van Der Zandt H. Svergun D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 41Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear which specific sequence(s) in the N-terminal domain is crucial for the quaternary structure of α-crystallins. In order to identify the peptide regions that might be involved in the subunit interactions, we have earlier screened proteolytic fragments of α-crystallin for possible interaction with the α-crystallin heteroaggregate (42Datta S.A. Ph.D. thesis. Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India2000Google Scholar). One of the fragments that showed significant interaction is a 27-residue peptide from the N-terminal region. Further analysis showed that this fragment contains RLFDQXFG, a well conserved motif in the N-terminal region, among the mammalian sHsps (33de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Conservation of this motif in many sHsps (Fig. 1A) suggests that it plays a specific role in the structure and function of these proteins. This motif, SRLFDQFFG, is identical in both αA- and αB-crystallin. Sequence-based structural prediction with different algorithms shows that this sequence has some propensity to form a helical structure (Fig. 1B). The helical wheel analysis on the side chain disposition of the residues in the sequence shows that the putative helical segment can exhibit amphipathic character (Fig. 1C). It is important to note that an analogous sequence (residues 7-11) in wheat Hsp16.9, SNVFD, has been found to make contact with residues Trp48 and Arg109-Phe110 in the “α-crystallin domain” inter- and intramolecularly (43van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It is possible that the corresponding SRLFDQXFG motif in αA- and αB-crystallin may have such intra- and intermolecular interactions. Thus, this region in αA- and αB-crystallin may be an important determinant of structure and function. In order to investigate the role of this conserved motif, we have created deletion mutants of αA- and αB-crystallin, which lack the sequence SRLFDQFFG, αAdel- or αBdel-crystallin, and studied the structure and chaperone-like activity with respect to their wild type counterparts. We have compared the tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the wild type proteins and deletion mutants of αA- and αB-crystallin and found that the spectra of both αAdel- and αBdel-crystallin differ only marginally from those of the respective wild type proteins (data not shown). This result shows that the microenvironment of the tryptophan residues of αA- and αB-crystallin does not get altered significantly upon deletion of the sequence SRLFDQFFG. However, this result does not rule out the possibility of tertiary structural alterations in other parts of the molecules. Fig. 2A shows that the near-UV CD spectra of αA- and αAdel-crystallin do not overlap with each other and differ in the region between 270 and 300 nm. The difference between near-UV CD spectra of αB- and αBdel-crystallin is more pronounced (Fig. 2B). Drastic changes are observed in the region between 270 and 290 nm. The effect of the deletion of the specific conserved sequence, SRLFDQFFG, on the secondary structure of the proteins has been investigated by far-UV CD spectra. In Fig. 2, panels C and D compare the far-UV CD spectra of the mutant and the wild type αA- and αB-crystallin, respectively. α-Crystallins exhibit CD spectra indicative of mainly β-sheet structure with minor content of helical structure (44Liang J.N. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 45Li L.K. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 19: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, sequence-based prediction shows that the deleted specific sequence shows some propensity to form helical structure. It is therefore expected that deletion of this sequence would result in decreased helical content, and since helical structure contributes more toward the observed ellipticity, the far-UV CD spectra of the deletion mutants should exhibit decreased ellipticity. However, the far-UV CD spectra of both αAdel- and αBdel-crystallin show increased ellipticity compared with that of the wild type proteins. This result suggests induction of some secondary structural elements in some regions of the sequence, which could probably arise due to packing alterations upon deletion of the specific sequence. As mentioned earlier, the N-terminal region and the “α-crystallin domain” are involved in subunit interactions (40Feil I.K. Malfois M. Hendle J. van Der Zandt H. Svergun D.I. J. Biol.

It is governed both by the nature of the host receptors used and the ligands exposed on the bacteria. The outermost molecules of the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis were extracted by a mechanical treatment and found to specifically and dose dependently inhibit the phagocytosis of both M. smegmatis and the opportunistic pathogen M. kansasii by human macrophages derived from monocytes. The inhibitory activity was attributed to surface lipids because it is extracted by chloroform and reduced by alkaline hydrolysis but not by protease treatment. Fractionation of surface lipids by adsorption chromatography indicated that the major inhibitory compounds consisted of phospholipids and glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses, combined with chemical degradation methods, demonstrated the existence of a novel family of GPLs that consists of a core composed of the long-chain tripeptidyl amino-alcohol with a di-O-acetyl-6-deoxytalosyl unit substituting the allo-threoninyl residue and a 2-succinyl-3,4-di-O-CH3-rhamnosyl unit linked to the alaninol end of the molecules. These compounds, as well as diglycosylated GPLs at the alaninol end and de-O-acylated GPLs, but not the non-serovar-specific di-O-acetylated GPLs, inhibited the phagocytosis of M. smegmatis and M. avium by human macrophages at a few nanomolar concentration without affecting the rate of zymosan internalization. At micromolar concentrations, the native GPLs also inhibit the uptake of both M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii. De-O-acylation experiments established the critical roles of both the succinyl and acetyl substituents. Collectively, these data provide evidence that surface-exposed mycobacterial glycoconjugates are efficient competitors of the interaction between macrophages and mycobacteria and, as such, could represent pharmacological tools for the control of mycobacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2022821237,"Cells expressing high levels of the BCL-XL anti-apoptotic protein are preferentially killed by the mitochondrial inhibitor antimycin A (AA). Computational modeling predicts a binding site for AA in the extended hydrophobic groove on BCL-XL, previously identified as an interface for dimerization to BAX and related proapoptotic proteins. Here, we identify BCL-XL hydrophobic groove mutants with normal cellular anti-apoptotic function but suppressed sensitivity to AA. The LD50 of AA for cells expressing BCL-XL mutants directly correlates with the measured in vitro dissociation constants for AA binding. These results indicate that BCL-XL is a principal target mediating AA cytotoxicity. Cells expressing high levels of the BCL-XL anti-apoptotic protein are preferentially killed by the mitochondrial inhibitor antimycin A (AA). Computational modeling predicts a binding site for AA in the extended hydrophobic groove on BCL-XL, previously identified as an interface for dimerization to BAX and related proapoptotic proteins.

The LD50 of AA for cells expressing BCL-XL mutants directly correlates with the measured in vitro dissociation constants for AA binding. These results indicate that BCL-XL is a principal target mediating AA cytotoxicity. The BCL-2 family proteins are key positive and negative regulators of apoptosis. Biochemical and subcellular fractionation studies localize the anti-apoptotic members, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, at outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM) 1The abbreviations used are: OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; AA, antimycin A; 2-OMeAA, 2-methoxy antimycin A; BH, Bcl-2 homology; STS, staurosporine; RMSD, root mean square difference; WT, wild-type; Me2SO, dimethylsulfoxide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and, to a lesser extent, at endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes. Pro-apoptotic factors either reside at the OMM or as soluble cytosolic proteins, as with BAX, BID, and BAD. Following an apoptotic signal, these factors are translocated to mitochondria. BCL-2 and BCL-XL cancel out the activity of pro-apoptotic members at the OMM, at least partly through direct interactions (1.Minn A.J. Kettlun C.S. Liang H. Kelekar A. Vander H.M. Chang B.S. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 632-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins consist of all α-helical protein folds involving one or more conserved BCL-2-homology domains (BH1-4). Although all four BH domains are necessary for the proper functioning of BCL-2 and BCL-XL, the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic members are themselves sufficient for apoptosis induction (2.Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). BH3 domains from pro-apoptotic BH proteins also make heterodimer contacts with related anti-apoptotic partners. The structure of the complex of a soluble BCL-XL protein (BCL-XLΔC) and BAK BH3 peptide from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed peptide bound to a hydrophobic groove bounded by the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of BCL-XL (3.Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to nullify pro-apoptotic binding partners, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members may maintain cell survival through regulation of ion and metabolite gradients across mitochondrial membranes. BCL-XL and BCL-2 form pores in synthetic lipid vesicles and membranes. Interestingly, this intrinsic pore-forming activity is inhibited by a bound BAK BH3 peptide (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It remains an unresolved question whether BCL-XL and BCL-2 affect OMM permeability directly or through interactions with other known mitochondrial channels. For example, BCL-XL may promote osmotic homeostasis by maintaining the voltage-dependent anion channel in an open state, allowing transit of metabolites across the OMM (5.Van der Heiden M.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19414-19419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). BCL-XL also interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator, the most abundant protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane and a major component of the permeability transition pore complex (8.Brenner C. Cadiou H. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Xie Z. Leber B. Andrews D. Duclohier H. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that AA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport at complex III, selectively kills murine hepatocyte cell lines that over-express BCL-XL or BCL-2 (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 9.Kim K.M. Giedt C.D. Basanez G.

Mitochondrial electron transport inhibition is not correlated with differential killing of BCL-XL-expressing cells, as 2-methoxy AA (2-OMeAA) has similar effects despite a 1000-fold reduction in electron transport inhibition. Rather, a direct effect of AA on BCL-XL function(s) was proposed, based on fluorescent binding assays showing stoichiometric interaction of AA and BCL-XL(ΔC). Computational modeling using the BCLXL(ΔC) NMR structure (3.Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) predicted a binding site for AA along the long axis of the hydrophobic groove (Fig. 1). Finally, dose-dependent inhibition of BCL-XL(ΔC) pores in synthetic liposomes is observed with either AA or 2-OMeAA. To validate BCL-XL as an important target for 2-OMeAA cytotoxicity, we generated a series of mutant BCL-XL proteins with single amino acid substitutions at predicted contact sites for AA. Analysis of cells expressing mutant BCL-XL proteins confirms the specificity of 2-OMeAA as a BCL-XL inhibitor. In addition, these data provide a detailed mapping of the AA/BCL-XL binding interface. Materials—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Antimycin A1 stocks were prepared in dimethylsulphoxide (Me2SO) and concentrations determined using a molar absorption coefficient of 4.79 mm-1cm-1 at 320 nm. Peptide corresponding to the BH3 domain of BAK (72-GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR-87) was synthesized by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center core facility. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated BAK BH3 peptide was synthesized by American Peptide Company and purified to >95% by high performance liquid chromatography. Molecular weights were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. 2-OMeAA1 was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—BclxL mutants were derived from pSFFV-BclxL-WT (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) using the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. Briefly, mutagenic primers spanning each target site were used to amplify fragments containing the desired mutations. Residual wild-type template was then removed by digesting with the methylation-dependent endonuclease, DpnI. For recombinant expression, BclxLΔ22 lacking the COOH-terminal membrane anchor sequence was generated by PCR. PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET22b(+) (Novagen). All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell Transfection—TAMH cells were transfected by Lipofectin (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) as previously described (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For analysis of BCL-XL expression, 20 μg of cell protein (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) was separated by 20% SDS-PAGE and transferred (electrophoretic) to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection of BCL-XL was carried out using rabbit anti-BCL-XL antibody and Protein A/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (BD Transduction Laboratories), followed by chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Viability Assays—Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in 96-well plates followed by addition of 100 μl of 2× AA1 or staurosporine (STS) solution in complete medium. Cell viability was determined spectrophotometrically after 24 h treatment as the ratio of reduced and oxidized Alamar Blue (BIOSOURCE) at 570 and 600 nm, respectively. All results were normalized against Me2SO controls. Similar results were obtained using sulforhodamine B assays for total cell protein (data not shown). LD50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using Prism software (Graphpad). Recombinant BCL-XL Purification—A pET22b (Novagen) vector coding for BCL-XL (ΔC), was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells that carried pUBS520 (encoding human Arg tRNA) and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 30 °C. The cells were resuspended 1:5 (w/v) in PEB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-ME, 5mm imidazole, and 1% (v/v) glycerol), and stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by pulse sonication, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with PEB buffer. The column was washed with 40 mm imidazole, eluted with 200 mm imidazole, and the protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C overnight. The dialyzed protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and fractionated on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing BCL-XL(ΔC) protein were pooled, exchanged into low-salt buffer (same as for previous dialysis buffer, except 50 mm NaCl), and loaded onto a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted from the column with increasing NaCl gradient, pooled, and concentrated. Purity was >99% as determined by silver staining. BCL-XL(ΔC) protein concentrations in 6 m guanidine HCl were determined from 280 nm absorbance using extinction coefficients of 41940 m-1cm-1 for WT, E92L, A142L, and F146L, and 47630 m-1cm-1 for F97W BCL-XL(ΔC) proteins. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Fluorescence anisotropies of AA1 and FITC-labeled BAK BH-3 peptide were measured using a Fluoromax-3 spectrometer equipped with autopolarizers (Jobin Yvon/Spex). All reagents were prepared in 0.2 μm-filtered phosphate-buffered saline with fresh 1 mm dithiothreitol. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 420 nm for AA1, and 480 and 520 nm for FITC-labeled BAK BH3 peptide, respectively. Slit widths were set at 10 nm for both excitation and emission. AA1 (200 nm) or BH3 peptide (25 nm) were equilibrated with different concentrations of BCL-XL(ΔC) for at least 1 h at room temperature. Each data point represents the mean of three independent measurements. Fluorescence anisotropy values were converted to fraction of ligand bound (fB) and expressed on a semi-log plot with non-linear curve fitting (10.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 308-309Google Scholar). Membrane Pore Assays—Large unilamellar vesicles composed of 60% dioleoyl phophatidylcholine and 40% dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol were prepared by the extrusion method of Mayer et al. (11.Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Lipid stocks, in chloroform, were mixed and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The lipid was resuspended by vortexing for 30 min in a solution of 40 mm calcein (Molecular Probes), 25 mm KCl, and 10 mm KOAc, pH 5.0. After 10 freeze-thaw cycles, the lipid suspension was extruded through two 0.1 μm pore diameter Nucleopore filters. Non-entrapped dye was removed by passage over a Sephadex G10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid concentration was measured using the ammonium ferrothiocyanate method (12.Stewart J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). For pore assays, recombinant BCL-XL(ΔC) (500 nm) was added to large unilamellar vesicles (60 μm lipid concentration) in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm KOAc, pH 5.0, and fluorescence measured (490 nm excitation, 520 nm emission) with a Fluoromax-3 spectrophotometer. Peptide was incubated with BCL-XL(ΔC) 5 min prior to mixing with liposomes. AA was added to liposomes 1 min before adding BCL-XL(ΔC) protein. Samples for kinetic assays were analyzed in a thermostatted cuvette at 37 °C with constant stirring. Dose responses were measured in black quartz microplates (Hellma) at room temperature. Calcein release was expressed as percentage of maximum release with detergent lysis (0.1% Triton X-100). Pore inhibition was calculated using cumulative dye release normalized to results obtained in absence of inhibitors, and the IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression analysis. Crystallographic Studies—Purified WT and mutant BCL-XL(ΔC) proteins were concentrated to 1 mm and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C. The mother liquor consisted of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1.9 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in mother liquor plus 30% trehalose (Sigma) for 1 min. Data sets were collected at 100 K with a Rigaku x-ray generator (100 mA and 50 kV) and a Raxis IV image plate. DENZO and SCALE-PACK (13.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Charles W. Carter J. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 307-326Google Scholar) were used to process the diffraction data. The program EPMR (14.Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Biol. Crystall. D. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) was used to find a molecular replacement solution using the BCL-XLwt structure (Protein Data Bank code 1MAZ) as a starting model. The space group for BCL-XLwt and all mutant proteins was determined to be P21212. A free R set (15.Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) of 10% was set aside using the CCP4 program FreeRflag. The Xfit 4.0 program from the Xtalview suite (16.McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) was used to visualize and modify the structure. The CNS (17.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Glore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.L.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar) program package was used for model refinement and simulated annealing composite omit 2Fo-Fc maps were used to guide model rebuilding. The stereochemical properties of all structures were examined by PROCHECK (18.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequent structural alignments, analysis, and figures were done with Swiss PDB viewer (19.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9584) Google Scholar), with pictures rendered using POVRay (www.povray.org). Mutational Modeling Studies—As previously described in Tzung et al. (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the NMR structure of the BAK BH3 peptide-bound conformation of BCL-XL (Protein Data Base code 1BXL) was used as a DOCK target model for AA1 binding. The optimized binding model was used to generate molecular contacts between AA1 and BCL-XL. Mutant BCL-XL proteins were modeled on 1BXL using Xfit, and the stereochemical environment of the mutated residue was optimized using CNS. The binding model of AA1 was re-inserted into the mutated 1BXL structure. Contact distances, root mean square differences (RMSD) and cavities were calculated using the Swiss PDB viewer. Consideration of valid contacts between any two atoms is based on Singh and Thornton (20.Singh J. Thorton J.M. Atlas of Protein Side-chain Interactions. I and II. IRL, Oxford1992Google Scholar), 2Ref. 20.Singh J. Thorton J.M. Atlas of Protein Side-chain Interactions. I and II. IRL, Oxford1992Google Scholar based on interactive database www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/sidechains. although given the inherent error in our models a close contact between any two atoms would be 2.5 Å or less. The numbering system for BCL-XL mutants is based on 1MAZ. Mutations at the BCL-XL Hydrophobic Groove Reduce Cellular Sensitivity to Antimycin—A series of point mutations were introduced to alter specific residues in the BCL-XL hydrophobic groove contact with AA from the docking model. The following single amino acid substitutions were made in human BCL-XL: E92L, F97W, A142L, and F146L. We obtained stable transfectants of TAMH murine hepatocytes for each of the mutated BclxL plasmids as well as wild-type BclxL. Mutant BCL-XL (BCL-XLmu) and wild-type proteins (BCL-XLwt) were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2a). To assess the effect of mutations on BCL-XL function, we tested TAMH/BCL-XLmu cells for survival during STS treatment. Dose-response curves show that each of the BCL-XLmu proteins produced equivalent levels of protection against STS-induced cell death. LD50 values for STS with cells expressing BCL-XLmu were not significantly different from BCL-XLwt cells (LD50 = 0.58 ± 0.1 μm) (Fig. 2a and Table I). Vector-only control cells expressed low levels of endogenous BCL-XL and were significantly more sensitive to STS (LD50 = 0.11 ± 0.01 μm) than any of the BCL-XLwt or BCL-XLmu cell lines (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2b).Table ISummary of AA1 activity on WT and mutant BCL-XL proteins Asterisks denote significant differences between mutant and wild-type values as determined by Student's t test analysis of data. * indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01.

In contrast to the results with STS, AA sensitivity varied substantially among the BCL-XLmu cell lines. Compared with BCLXLwt cells (LD50 = 0.47 ± 0.1 μm), the E92L and F97W BCL-XLmu cells had reduced sensitivity to AA (LD50 1.72 ± 0.3 μm and 5.12 ± 0.9 μm, respectively), whereas the A142L and F146L BCL-XLmu cells were completely insensitive to AA (Fig. 2c and Table I). AA-insensitive BCL-XL Mutants Have Lower Binding Affinity for AA—Recombinant BCL-XLmu(ΔC) and wild-type proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity, gel filtration, and anion-exchange column chromatography. Direct quantitative measurements of AA1 binding to BCL-XL(ΔC) proteins were obtained from fluorescence anisotropy under equilibrium conditions. Binding constants were calculated using non-linear regression analysis (Table I). AA1 has much weaker binding affinity with the F97W, A142L, and F146L mutants (Kd = 17.56 ± 5.2 μm, 41.77 ± 21.4 μm, and 20.04 ± 9.4 μm, respectively) than with BCL-XLwt(ΔC) protein (2.36 ± 1.41 μm) (Fig. 3a). The binding affinity of AA1 with the E92L mutant (Kd = 5.06 ± 0.86 μm) is reduced 2-3-fold relative to BCL-XLwt. Notably, the ranking of in vitro AA1 binding affinities for the BCL-XLmu(ΔC) proteins is in register with the in vivo sensitivities to AA. The non-peptide BCL-XL inhibitors, BH3I-1 and -2, interact with Phe-97 and Ala-142 in the BCL-XL hydrophobic pocket by NMR chemical shift perturbation (21.Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 22.Lugovskoy A.A. Degterev A.I. Fahmy A.F. Zhou P. Gross J.D. Yuan J. Wagner G. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We determined that BH3I-1 competes with AA1 for BCL-XL (ΔC) binding (Fig. 3c). The Ki for BH3I-1 displacement of AA bound to BCL-XL (ΔC) is 1.874 ± 0.617 μm, similar to that reported for displacing BH3 peptide by Degterev et al. (21.Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We also determined the effects of the hydrophobic groove mutations on binding of BAK BH3 domain peptides. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conducted using a FITC-labeled 16-residue BAK BH3-peptide. The F97W, A142L, and F146L mutations resulted in substantially diminished BH3 peptide binding compared with BCL-XLwt(ΔC) (Fig. 3b and Table I). Interestingly, the relative affinities of BAK BH3 peptide with the BCL-XL(ΔC) proteins (BCL-XLwt > E92L > F97W ∼ F146L > A142L) paralleled those determined for AA. Pore-forming Activities of Mutant BCL-XL Proteins—Synthetic lipid vesicles were loaded with the self-quenching fluorescent dye, calcein, to measure membrane pore formation by recombinant BCL-XL(ΔC) proteins. Addition of AA1, 2-OMeAA1, or the BAK BH3 peptide inhibited BCL-XL poreforming activity, whereas a modified antimycin bearing a bulky phenacyl substituent, a mutated BAK peptide (L78A) with low BCL-XL affinity, and BH3I-1 had no effect (Fig. 4a). The mutant versions of BCL-XL(ΔC) had similar pore-forming properties as BCL-XLwt(ΔC) (Fig. 4b). We tested the sensitivity of BCL-XLmu(ΔC) pores to AA1 and to BAK BH3 peptide under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 4, c and d) and performed non-linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves to obtain IC50 values (Table I). Although the clustering of AA1 IC50 values in the liposome assay is tighter than observed for the binding affinities of AA1 using soluble BCLXL(ΔC), the same ordering of responses is obtained: WT > E92L > F97W ∼ F146L > A142L. The BAK BH3 peptide IC50 values also exhibit the same ordering observed for the binding affinities obtained from the equilibrium binding assay. Preservation of Tertiary Fold with Mutant BCL-XL Proteins—The structures of BCL-XLwt(ΔC) (WT) and the four BCLXLmu (ΔC) proteins, E92L, F97W, A142L, and F146L, were solved by x-ray crystallography. Overall, the mutations produced only local effects on the WT structure. Fig. 5 shows an α-carbon overlay of WT with the mutant structures. The RMSD of the BCL-XL mutants ranged from 0.17 to 0.49 Å (Cα atoms). E92L—In the docking model, the backbone carbonyl of Glu-92 contacts the O33 atom of AA1, whereas the side chain projects outside the hydrophobic groove with no close ligand contacts. The structure of E92L BCL-XL(ΔC) at 2.1Å compared with BCLXLwt(ΔC) shows no main chain movement and only a minor displacement between the Leu and Glu side chains. The hydrogen bonds bridging Gln-88 and Asn-198 are missing, weakening interactions between the BH3 α-helical domain and the COOH-terminal region of BCL-XL(ΔC). Overall, the structure is very similar to WT, with a Cα RMSD of 0.17 Å, and an all-atom RMSD of 0.40 Å. F97W—The Phe-97 residue lies in close proximity to the dilactone ring of AA1 in the docking model. Thus, the greater bulk of a Trp side chain in this position is expected to cause a steric clash with bound AA1. The structure of F97W BCLXL(ΔC) was solved to 2.7 Å. The F97W substitution does not significantly disrupt the backbone structure (overall RMSD Cα of 0.30 Å, F97W RMSD of 0.29 Å). However, to compensate for the bulkier Trp side chain, Phe-101 rotates about χ2 ∼80 degrees. The maximal backbone displacement for F97W BCL-XL(ΔC) occurs in this region, with residues 101 through 106 having an RMSD Cα of 0.67, although this displacement is significantly less than in the structure of a BCL-XL/BH3 peptide complex (Protein Data Bank code 1BXL). Thus, the steric effects of Trp-97 on AA1 affinity should be predominant. A142L—The A142 residue is positioned adjacent to Phe-97 in the hydrophobic groove. The docking model for AA1 predicts a significant steric clash between the dilactone ring of AA1 and the Leu-142 side chain. The structure of A142L BCL-XL(ΔC) was solved to 2.2 Å resolution. The A142L BCL-XL(ΔC) structure is very similar to BCL-XLwt, with a RMSD (Cα) of 0.44 Å. The bulkier leucine side chain causes a compensatory chain of movement of the Phe-97 and Tyr-101 side chains. Furthermore, repositioning of the Tyr-101 backbone promotes alternative orientations of Ala-104 and Phe-105, which flip from higher energy positive backbone ϕ/Ψ angles to lower energy negative ϕ/Ψ angles (Fig. 5). Despite the movement of the Phe-105 main chain, the side chain orientation is conserved with BCLXLwt(ΔC). Because Ala-104 and Phe-105 also have negative ϕ/Ψ angles in the BH3 peptide/BCL-XL structure, the binding pocket in the ligand-bound conformation of A142 BCL-XL(ΔC) should be preserved without significant structural changes. F146L—Unlike the other BCL-XL mutations considered here, the docking model predicts a loss of van der Waals contacts to the alkyl chain of AA1 with the F146L substitution. The F146L BCL-XL (ΔC) structure was solved to 2.2 Å. The F146L structure shows an overall RMSD (Cα) of 0.49 Å. There is little displacement of the F146L residue compared with BCL-XLwt(ΔC). The aliphatic and aromatic side chains of the α3 helix and neighboring residues to F146L adopt wild-type orientations with the exception of the rotation of Lys-108 about χ2. As with the A142L BCL-XL(ΔC) structure, residues A104 and F105 convert from positive to negative ϕ/Ψ angles. In addition, the R103 backbone has now adopted a positive ϕ/Ψ configuration in F146L BCL-XL (Fig. 5). Notably, the average B-factors across all structures, including BCL-XLwt(ΔC), for residues 101-105 in the α3 helix are about twice that of the rest of the molecule. Thus, the alterations in backbone configuration at residues 103-105 in the BCL-XLmu proteins may reflect an inherent flexibility of this region. The F146L BCL-XL structure also demonstrates enlargement of an interior cavity abutted by Phe-146, which may reduce the overall stability of the protein (23.Baldwin E. Xu J. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 542-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24.Xu J. Baase W.A. Baldwin E. Matthews B.W. Prot. Sci. 1998; 7: 158-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In BCL-XLwt(ΔC), this cavity has a calculated area of 34 Å2, which increases to 54 Å2 in the F146L mutant structure. Previous work (4.Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 9.Kim K.M. Giedt C.D. Basanez G. O'Neill J.W. Hill J.J. Han Y.H. Tzung S.P. Zimmerberg J. Hockenbery D.M. Zhang K.Y. Biochem. 2001; 40: 4911-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL rendered cells hypersensitive to AA. AA binds directly to BCL-XL(ΔC) in competition with BH3 peptide ligands that occupy the hydrophobic groove, consistent with the identification of this interface as the likely AA binding site by molecular modeling. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to validate BCL-XL as a direct target for AA and map the BCL-XL binding site for AA in greater detail. Three out of four mutations in the BCL-XL hydrophobic groove (F97W, A142L, and F146L) eliminated or strongly attenuated the ability of BCL-XL to sensitize TAMH cell to AA1 treatment. Each of the mutants had nearly wild-type antiapoptotic activity with staurosporine treatment, discounting loss of protein function as an explanation for the resistance to AA1. However, we demonstrated reduced binding affinities of AA1 with the BCL-XLmu(ΔC) proteins, with a good correlation between binding constant and in vivo sensitivity to AA1. The BCL-XL mutations were designed for local perturbations on ligand-protein geometry. The crystal structures of the BCLXL(ΔC) mutants demonstrate retention of the tertiary protein fold, allowing interpretation of the binding data in terms of the molecular docking model. Our docking model for AA1 utilized the structure of BCL-XL(ΔC) bound to BAK BH3 peptide. Compared with the overall shift between ligand-bound and free BCL-XL conformations (Cα RMSD = 2.8 Å), there is minimal displacement of the residues predicted to be AA1 contacts in these structures (Cα RMSD for Phe-97, Ala-142, and Phe-146 = 1.3 Å) (Fig. 6a). The relative AA1 binding affinities of the BCL-XLmu(ΔC) proteins are as follows: WT > E92L > F97W ≈ F146L > A142L. Incorporating these single mutations into the AA1 docking model allowed us to predict their effects on AA1 binding. Both F97W and A142L mutations are modeled to produce steric hindrances to the docked AA1. In the former case, the increased bulkiness of the tryptophan side chain makes close contacts (∼2.6 Å) to the dilactone ring of AA1 (Fig. 6b), whereas the A142L substitution creates a significant steric clash to the AA1 dilactone ring (Fig. 6c). The 8-fold and 20-fold increases in the Kd of AA1 binding for F97W and A142L BCL-XLmu(ΔC), respectively, compared with BCL-XLwt(ΔC), are compatible with these predictions. To form a stable complex, significant compensatory movements of the BCL-XL binding pockets or AA1 from the starting docking model must occur. The phenyl group at Phe-146 is oriented perpendicularly to the hexyl-chain of AA1 in the docking model (Fig. 6d). This predicted interaction consists of van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions between the partial negative charges of the phenyl ring and partial positive charge of the terminal methyl group (C27). Substitution of leucine for phenylalanine removes both types of contacts with AA, accounting for the ∼10-fold decrease in AA1 affinity with this mutant protein. Overall, the ligand-bound structure models based on the BCLXLmu (ΔC) crystal structures provide reasonable interpretations for the measured AA1 binding constants. The E92L mutation was not expected to alter AA binding based on the docking model, as it is located at the periphery of the binding pocket and contributes only a carbonyl oxygen contact with AA1. Thus the 2-3-fold reduction of AA1 binding affinity with the E92L mutation provides an estimate of the general effects on binding for mutations at partially buried residues. The mild reduction in affinity may be due to some destabilization of the BCL-XL tertiary structure by the loss of two salt bridges. The anti-apoptotic activities of BCL-XL and BCL-2 act through and are regulated by associations with pro-apoptotic proteins. The BCL-XLmu proteins retained normal anti-apoptotic activity despite substantially weakened binding to the pro-apoptotic BH3 peptide. BCL-XL binding affinities for BH3 peptides depend on hydrophobic interactions at the floor of the cleft with several conserved non-polar residues (Val-74, Leu-78, and Ile-81) in the peptides. Modeling studies of the BAK BH3 peptide to the BCL-XL mutants (not shown) suggest that the F146L substitution weakens interactions with BAK Val-74, whereas the F97W mutation would need to be moderately displaced to avoid a clash with the side chain of BAK Leu-78. However, BCL-XL A142L requires a much larger adjustment to avoid a clash between the backbone of BAK Leu-78 and the BCL-XL Leu-142 side chain. Overall, these results suggest that the mutant phenotypes discussed here are more compatible with the pro-apoptotic binding partner exerting negative control over the anti-apoptotic function of BCL-XL, rather than vice versa. However, we have tested only a single pro-apoptotic BH3 domain (BAK). For example, BCL-XL and BCL-2 proteins with mutations preventing binding to BAK nevertheless strongly interacted with the BH3 only BAD protein in a previous report (25.Ottilie S. Diaz J.L. Horne W. Chang J. Wang Y. Wilson G. Chang S. Weeks S. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30866-30872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic groove mutations did not affect the poreforming ability of purified BCL-XL(ΔC) in synthetic liposomes, suggesting that this property is endowed by the global protein fold and packing geometry of BCL-XL(ΔC). AA1 inhibited pore formation of mutant and wild-type proteins with similar IC50 values. The insensitivity of this assay for discriminating mutants with different AA binding affinities implies AA1 interacts differently with soluble versus membrane-inserted BCLXL(ΔC). Using dansylated lipid in fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, we determined that AA1 does not interfere with the insertion of BCL-XL into lipid membranes, whereas BAK BH3 inhibits full membrane insertion of BCLXL. 3M. K. Manion, unpublished data. This finding explains why the distribution of BAK BH3 IC50 values for the BCL-XL mutant series reflects the range of affinities for soluble BCL-XL protein, because pore inhibition takes place at a pre-insertion step. The conserved ordering of mutant protein activities in AA binding and pore assays (i.e. WT > E92L > F97W ≈ F146L > A142L) argues for similarities in the soluble and membrane-inserted binding interfaces. The AA1-BCL-XL(ΔC) interaction in a lipid environment appears to be significantly less constrained by the BCL-XL mutations considered here compared with the soluble form of the protein. Our previous conclusion that AA selectively kills BCL-XL-expressing cells by directly targeting BCL-XL is convincingly reinforced by the mutational studies reported here. The single amino acid mutations produced minor shifts in the binding pocket geometry, allowing a high degree of confidence in extrapolating from crystal structures to the ligand-bound protein conformation. The principal basis for the AA resistance of the mutant BCL-XL proteins appears to be lower binding affinity, as reflected by the strong correlation between in vitro binding constants and cytotoxicity. In aggregate, these results agree with the starting molecular model of how AA1 binds to the BCL-XL hydrophobic groove. This information will aid in optimizing this BCL-XL inhibitor and better understanding of its molecular action.

https://openalex.org/W1997407816,"Recent studies have identified a limited number of cellular receptors that can stimulate an alternative NF-κB activation pathway that depends upon the inducible processing of NF-κB2 p100 to p52. Here it is shown that the latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 of Epstein-Barr virus can trigger this signaling pathway in both B cells and epithelial cells. LMP1-induced p100 processing, which is mediated by the proteasome and is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis, results in the nuclear translocation of p52·RelB dimers. Previous studies have established that LMP1 also stimulates the canonical NF-κB-signaling pathway that triggers phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. Interestingly, LMP1 activation of these two NF-κB pathways is shown here to require distinct regions of the LMP1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Thus, C-terminal-activating region 1 is required for maximal triggering of p100 processing but is largely dispensable for stimulation of IκBα phosphorylation. In contrast, C-terminal-activating region 2 is critical for maximal LMP1 triggering of IκBα phosphorylation and up-regulation of p100 levels but does not contribute to activation of p100 processing. Because p100 deletion mutants that constitutively produce p52 oncogenically transform fibroblasts in vitro, it is likely that stimulation of p100 processing by LMP1 will play an important role in its transforming function.

EBV is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is also implicated in the etiology of both epithelial (nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and lymphoid malignancies (Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease). Infection of primary human B lymphocytes in vitro with EBV leads to their immortalization and the establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Latent membrane protein (LMP) 1 is one of five latent genes shown to be essential for EBV-induced transformation of B cells (4Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP1 is required for both LCL establishment and continued proliferation (4Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J.

The transforming potential of LMP1 has been confirmed both in vitro in fibroblast transformation assays (7Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) and in vivo in transgenic mice (8Kulwichit W. Edwards R.H. Davenport E.M. Baskar J.F. Godfrey V. Raab-Traub N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Significantly, LMP1 is expressed in the majority of EBV-associated human malignancies (1Rickinson A.B.

LMP1 is an integral membrane protein with six hydrophobic transmembrane domains that mediate its constitutive oligomerization and targeting to plasma membrane lipid rafts (9Hatzivassiliou E. Mosalios G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Constitutive oligomerization allows LMP1 to function as a ligand-independent receptor and is essential for its transforming potential in both fibroblasts and B cells. The 200-amino acid cytoplasmic C terminus of LMP1 is also required for cell transformation (10Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This contains two subdomains, termed C-terminal-activating regions (CTARs) 1 and 2, which act as docking sites for complexes of signaling proteins that trigger activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and activator protein-1 (10Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is absolutely required to block apoptosis of EBV-transformed LCLs (11Cahir-McFarland E.D. Davidson D.M. Schauer S.L. Duong J. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6055-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and is also required for LMP1 transformation of fibroblasts (12He Z. Xin B. Yang X.C.C L. C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1845-1848PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express five NF-κB proteins: RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 p50, and NF-κB2 p52, which combine to form homo- and heterodimers that regulate genes involved in immune responses, apoptosis, and development (13Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). NF-κB dimers are retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins (IκBs), which includes IκBα. Activation of the canonical NF-κB-signaling pathway by agonists such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and interleukin 1 induces IκBα phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteolysis by the proteasome. NF-κB dimers, which are predominantly p50-RelA heterodimers, are thereby released to translocate into the nucleus and modulate gene expression. Signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα is mediated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises two catalytic subunits, IKK1 (IKKα) and IKK2 (IKKβ), and a structural subunit NEMO (IKKγ) (14Sylla B.S. Hung S.C. Davidson D.M. Hatzivassiliou E. Malinin N.L. Wallach D. Gilmore T.D. Kieff E. Mosalios G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic studies indicate that IKK2 is essential for IκBα phosphorylation triggered by TNFα or interleukin 1, whereas IKK1 is largely dispensable (15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Recently, an “alternative” NF-κB activation pathway has been described (16Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This pathway triggers proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-κB2 precursor p100 to produce p52. In contrast to the canonical NF-κB pathway, which is triggered by multiple different stimuli (15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar), only three cellular receptors have so far been shown to stimulate p100 processing; namely, B cell-activating factor receptor (17Claudio E.

Receptor activation of this pathway is critically dependent on the mitogen-activated protein 3-kinase NIK and IKK1 (21Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y.

Functionally, LMP1 resembles an activated CD40 receptor, with both molecules promoting B cell survival and proliferation and regulating a highly overlapping spectrum of activation markers (23Mosialos G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of CD40 can compensate for the lack of LMP1 expression and promote short term growth of EBV-transformed LCLs (6Kilger E. Kieser A. Baumann M. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO. 1998; 17: 1700-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Zimber-Strobl U. Kempkes B. Marschall G. Zeidler R. van Kooten C. Banchereau J. Bornkamm G.W. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7070-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is firmly established that LMP1 activates the canonical NF-κB pathway that regulates IκBα proteolysis (9Hatzivassiliou E. Mosalios G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study evidence is presented that in B cells and 293 epithelial cells LMP1 also induces NF-κB2 p100 processing to p52, similar to CD40 (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P.

Endogenous human p100/p52 was detected in Western blots using a commercial anti-p100 mAb (UBI 05-361). Anti-mouse p100N and anti-human p100N were used for detection of murine p100/p52 and immunoprecipitation of human p100/p52, respectively (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J.

Polyclonal antiserum to human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV) Tax was obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference reagent program. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Biomol Research Labs, 20 μm) and cycloheximide (Sigma; 10 μg/ml) were added 15-30 min before stimulation with anti-CD2 mAb and goat anti-mouse Ig antibody. Recombinant TNFα (20 ng/ml) was obtained from R & D Systems. Cells—The Ramos tetracycline-regulated transactivator (tTA) and Ramos tTA-LMP1 cell lines have been described previously (38Henriquez N.V. Floettmann E. Salmon M. Rowe M. Rickinson A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3298-3307PubMed Google Scholar). Ramos tTA-LMP1 cells are stably transfected with two vectors; pJEF3 encoding a constitutively expressed tTA and pJEF6neo, in which LMP1 is cloned downstream of a promoter containing tTA binding sites. The Ramos tTA cell line is transfected only with pJEF3 vector. Ramos tTA-LMP1 and Ramos tTA cells were cultured in a complete medium comprising RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 units/ml), 300 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Roche Applied Science). For Ramos tTA-LMP1 cells, 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was also included in the culture medium to ensure retention of pJEF6neo-LMP1 vector. To induce LMP1 expression, cells were extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then recultured for the indicated times in complete medium without added tetracycline. BL41 cells and their B95.8 EBV-infected derivative BL41+B95 cells were cultured as described previously (39Rowe M. Rooney C.M. Edwards C.F. Lenoir G.M. Rickinson A.B. Int. J.

Protein Analyses—293 cells (5 × 105 cells/60-mm Nunc tissue culture dish) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Amounts of plasmids used are indicated in the figure legends. Cells transfected with vectors encoding CD2-LMP 192 or tCD2 were stimulated as described in the figure legends. Whole cell lysates were prepared using buffer A (43Beinke S. Belich M.P. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24162-24168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which was supplemented with 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS (RIPA buffer). p100 ubiquitination experiments were performed as previously described (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Equal protein loading of whole cell lysates was confirmed by Western blotting for tubulin. Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was performed as described (44Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut-Lavon I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation efficiency and protein loading were controlled by Western blotting for cytoplasmic (tubulin) and nuclear (SAM68) markers. To facilitate NF-κB subunit detection in Western blots, ∼5-fold more cell equivalents of nuclear extract (10-25 μg) was loaded relative to cytoplasmic extract (30 μg). For immunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were diluted in buffer A (43Beinke S. Belich M.P. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24162-24168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and adjusted to 10% (v/v) glycerol and 150 mm NaCl before incubation with anti-p100N antibody. NF-κB Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs and antibody supershifting were performed as described (44Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut-Lavon I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the NF-κB binding site in the mouse immunoglobulin enhancer (Promega) was used to detect NF-κB complexes. LMP1 Induces NF-κB2 p52 Production in Transfected 293 Epithelial Cells—It has previously been reported that LMP1 expression in epithelial cells is associated with increases in p100 and p52 levels (45Paine E. Scheinman R.I. Baldwin A.S. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear from this study whether other EBV-encoded latent proteins can also induce such changes. To address this question, LMP1, LMP2A, EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA LP (Fig. 1A), and EBNA 3C (data not shown) were individually expressed in 293 epithelial cells. Western blotting of cell lysates indicated that none of the EBNA proteins or LMP2A had any effect on endogenous p100/p52 levels compared with empty vector (EV) control. In contrast, LMP1 expression stimulated a dramatic increase in steady state levels of p52 together with a more modest increase in p100. Therefore, of the panel of latent proteins tested, LMP1 was unique in its ability to increase p52 levels. Previous studies have indicated that signaling from the LMP1 cytoplasmic tail can be induced by cross-linking of chimeric molecules comprising tCD2 fused to the C-terminal 192 amino acids of LMP1 (CD2-LMP 192; Ref. 25Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CD2-LMP 192, transiently expressed in 293 cells, induced an increase in endogenous p52 levels after 3-6 h of extensive cross-linking with anti-CD2 mAb, whereas p100 levels were largely unaffected (Fig. 1B). The time course of the p52 increase was similar to that previously observed with cross-linked CD40 (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and was markedly slower than IκBα proteolysis induced by CD2-LMP 192, which was detectable at 30 min. (Fig. 1B). Cross-linked tCD2 failed to induce any alteration in p52 levels, whereas tCD2 fused to full-length wild type LMP1 (CD2-LMP1), which signals constitutively (25Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), increased p52 levels without anti-CD2 mAb cross-linking. These data suggest that stimulation of p52 levels by the LMP1 requires aggregation of its cytoplasmic tail. LMP1 Induces p52 as a Consequence of Proteasome-mediated p100 Proteolysis—To determine whether NF-κB-dependent gene expression is required for LMP1-induced p52 production, 293 cells were co-transfected with LMP1 vector together with an expression vector encoding a super-repressor mutant of IκBα (IκBαSS/AA), which blocks NF-κB activation (31Roff M. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Jacque J.-M. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7844-7850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), or EV. Expression of IκBαSS/AA on its own reduced the basal levels of endogenous p100 expression compared with EV alone and blocked the ability of LMP1 to increase the steady state levels of p100. However, LMP1 still clearly induced p52 levels when co-expressed with IκBαSS/AA while concomitantly reducing levels of p100 (Fig. 2A). Thus, LMP1 induces p52 production independently of NF-κB activation. To investigate the role of the proteasome in LMP1-mediated p52 production, 293 cells were transfected with a vector encoding CD2-LMP 192 to facilitate analysis of the acute up-regulation of p52 by LMP1. Increases in p52 induced by cross-linked CD2-LMP 192 were blocked by pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 (Fig. 2B) or N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (data not shown), demonstrating a requirement for proteasome activity for LMP1 induction of p52. Protein ubiquitination is often a prerequisite for proteasome action. Therefore, experiments were conducted to determine whether LMP1 induced the ubiquitination of p100. 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-p100 and HA-ubiquitin together with LMP1 or EV. LMP1-induced polyubiquitination of Myc-p100 was clearly demonstrated by the appearance of high molecular weight bands in Western blots of immunoprecipitated p100 probed for HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 2C). NIK expression also induced Myc-p100 ubiquitination (Fig. 2C), as reported previously (22Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Thus, proteasome-mediated production of p52 induced by LMP1 involves p100 ubiquitination. Furthermore, the observation that LMP induces p52 levels concomitantly with decreases in p100 levels when NF-κB activity is blocked (Fig. 2A) strongly suggests that LMP1 induces p52 production via proteasome-mediated proteolysis of p100. Two motifs in p100 have been previously shown to be required for CD40-induced processing of p100 to p52 (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); namely the glycine-rich region (GRR; residues 346-377) (46Heusch M. Lin L. Geleiunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and two serines (Ser-866 and Ser-870) in the C-terminal PEST region of p100 that are thought be phosphorylated by IKK1 (21Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the GRR and serines 866/870 are important in LMP1-triggered p52 production, 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding LMP1 or EV and either wild type Myc-p100, Myc-p100ΔGRR, or Myc-p100S866A,S870A. LMP1 co-transfection with wild type Myc-p100 significantly increased Myc-p52 levels compared with EV control (Fig. 2D). However, LMP1 failed to induce Myc-p52 from either Myc-p100ΔGRR or Myc-p100S866A,S870A (Fig. 2D). Therefore, both the GRR and serines 866 and 870 in the PEST region of p100 are required for LMP1-induced p52 production from p100. These results further support the conclusion that LMP1 induces p52 as a consequence of p100 processing. LMP1 Induction of p52 Requires Protein Synthesis—Both CD40 (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and B cell-activating factor receptor (17Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) have a requirement for de novo protein synthesis to trigger p100 processing. The requirement for protein synthesis in CD2-LMP1 192-induced p52 production, which occurs over several hours (Fig. 1B), was therefore investigated. 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding CD2-LMP 192 and cycloheximide was added 30 min before CD2-LMP 192 cross-linking with anti-CD2 mAb. Cycloheximide treatment inhibited p52 production induced by cross-linked CD2-LMP 192 (Fig. 2B). Cycloheximide also blocked CD2-LMP 192 induction of p52 when added simultaneously with anti-CD2 mAb but not when added 2 h after CD2 cross-linking (data not shown). These results, which show a striking similarity to those reported for CD40 (20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), demonstrate that de novo protein synthesis is required during the first 2 h of cross-linked CD2-LMP 192 signaling to induce p100 processing efficiently. LMP1 Induces the Nuclear Translocation of p52 and RelB in 293 Epithelial Cells—p100 is the major IκB for RelB in the cell (47Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1405-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, one predicted outcome of LMP1-mediated p100 processing is the nuclear translocation of p52·RelB complexes. To initially investigate this, cytoplasmic/nuclear fractions were prepared from 293 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding CD2-LMP 192 or tCD2, stimulated with anti-CD2 mAb, or left unstimulated. Efficient separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was demonstrated for this (Fig. 3A) and subsequent experiments by Western blotting for cytoplasmic (tubulin) and nuclear (SAM68) markers. In unstimulated or control tCD2-transfected cells, very little endogenous p52 or RelB was detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig 3A). Cross-linking of CD2-LMP 192 for 30 min resulted in a small increase in nuclear p52 but had no effect on nuclear RelB levels. This small increase in nuclear p52 at 30 min is likely to be due to the release of pre-existing p52 bound to small IκBs, including IκBα (Fig. 1B; Ref. 20Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G.P. Huhse B. Belich M.P. Janzen J. Holman M. Klaus G.G.B. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, marked increases in both nuclear p52 and RelB were detected after 6 h of cross-linking of CD2-LMP 192, although cytoplasmic RelB levels were unaffected. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts with anti-p100N antibody demonstrated that the translocated nuclear p52 and RelB are associated with one another"

We have now defined a critical amino acid residue within a small helical module of Hst1 that confers relative resistance to splitomicin. Parallel cell-based screens of 100 splitomicin analogues led to the identification of compounds that exhibit a higher degree of selectivity toward Sir2 or Hst1. A series of compounds based on a splitomicin derivative, dehydrosplitomicin (compound 2), effectively phenocopied a yeast strain that lacked Hst1 deacetylase while having no effect on the silencing activities of Sir2. In addition, we identified a compound with improved selectivity for Sir2. Selectivity was affirmed using whole-genome DNA microarray analysis.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has five Sir2-like proteins: Sir2p, Hst1p (homologue of Sir two), Hst2p, Hst3p, and Hst4p (homologues of Sir two) (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E.

These two enzymes, however, play distinct cellular roles, since they are directed to different chromatin regions by specificity factors. Sir2p, which is found in two separate multiprotein complexes, is critical for transcriptional silencing of large chromosomal domains at three loci: telomeres, the silent mating-type loci (HMR and HML), and the ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA (reviewed in Ref. 22Moazed D.

Little is known about cellular functions of other NAD+-dependent deacetylases in yeast. Hst2p is a cytoplasmic enzyme that accounts for the majority of NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity in a whole-cell lysate (5Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J.

Hst3p and Hst4p are highly related enzymes that perform overlapping functions in telomeric silencing and maintenance of genome integrity (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).Small-molecule enzyme inhibitors are powerful tools for dissecting the functional roles of enzymes in vivo and represent a major class of drugs used in humans. However, since individual enzymes almost universally coexist with highly related members of enzyme families, with different members often having distinct biological functions, the utility of enzyme inhibitors as drugs or biological tools is critically dependent on specificity of the inhibitors. Whereas cell-free enzyme inhibition assays continue to be useful for assessing the specificity of inhibitors, we and others have employed DNA microarrays in whole-cell assays to determine the in vivo specificity of small-molecule inhibitors for their targets (27Gray N.S.

We have found that splitomicin (1; 1,2-dihydro-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3-one) is active against Sir2p and to a lesser extent Hst1p, while having no inhibitory activity against Hst2p, Hst3p, or Hst4p (32Bedalov A.

Similar to the original approach that led to the identification of splitomicin (1) (32Bedalov A. Gatbonton T. Irvine W.P. Gottschling D.E. Simon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), iterative phenotypic screens were carried out to identify inhibitors with desired selectivity for Sir2p or Hst1p, in which properties of compounds were selected based on their ability to phenocopy sir2 or hst1 deletion mutant strain in yeast. Using the isogenic yeast strains, we were able to identify structural features necessary for specificity by comparing activity against the two deacetylases. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve high selectivity for inhibition of Sir2p or Hst1p and that cell-based assays are a useful approach for identification and evaluation of selective inhibitors of NAD+-dependent deacetylases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling—Yeast Sir2p and Hst1p were modeled based on the human SIRT2p structure using the SwissModel server (33Finnin M.S.

PCR was performed with oligonucleotides graHst1F and graHst1R and Pfu-Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The sequences of the oligonucleotides are available in Table II of the supplemental material. To generate the gapped pRS415 SIR2, a BglII restriction site was introduced between nucleotides 959 and 964 (amino acids 320–322) of SIR2 with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides FsilBgl and RsilBgl. The resulting plasmid was digested with BglII at nucleotides 823–828 (amino acids 275–276) and 959–964 (amino acids 320–322). Cells containing plasmids repaired by homologous recombination between the fragment from HST1 and the gapped vector were selected by plating transformation mixtures onto SC medium lacking leucine, resulting in the SIR2-HST1 chimera. The K285R/D290E, Y298L/N299D, and M302L/H303Q SIR2 mutants were generated utilizing QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides F285/290 and R285/290, F298/299 and R298/299, or F302/303 and R302/303, respectively.

A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Although Hst1p is highly homologous to Sir2p in this 50-amino acid region (92% similarity, 86% identity) (Fig. 1B), it displays relative resistance to splitomicin (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (32Bedalov A. Gatbonton T. Irvine W.P. Gottschling D.E. Simon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To better understand the basis for this resistance, we prepared a model of Sir2p or Hst1p bound to the inhibitor based on the crystal structure of human SIRT2p (33Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and found seven nonconserved amino acid residues surrounding the binding site (Fig. 1C). We hypothesized that engineering these seven residues of Hst1p in the Sir2p scaffold structure would give rise to resistance similar to that of Hst1p. The Sir2-Hst1 chimeric protein was initially tested for its ability to complement a telomeric silencing defect of a sir2 deletion mutant strain (sir2Δ) marked at the left arm of chromosome VII with a URA3 reporter gene (43Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Silencing of the telomeric URA3 reporter was judged by the ability of cells to grow on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Silencing in the sir2Δ strain was fully complemented by the expression of the chimeric protein (SIR2-HST1 chimera) (Fig. 2A). We next compared the antisilencing effects of splitomicin (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) in strains containing the wild-type (SIR2) and the SIR2-HST1 chimera. Splitomicin (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) impaired the growth of the SIR2 strain at 5 μm on medium containing 5-FOA, indicating a loss of silencing (Fig. 2B). However, the SIR2-HST1 chimera strain grew 5–25-fold better than the SIR2 strain on 5-FOA with 5 μm splitomicin (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). This result suggests that unique residues within the small helical module of Hst1p confer resistance to the antisilencing effects of splitomicin (1Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To identify the responsible residues, a series of SIR2 mutants were constructed in which two residues at a time were changed to the cognate residues in HST1 (SIR2-K285R/D290E, SIR2-Y298L/N299D and SIR2-M302L/H303Q) (Fig. 1, B and C). Silencing was at the wild-type levels with the three mutant alleles in the absence of splitomicin (1) (Fig. 2A). However, only SIR2-Y298L/N299D conferred resistance to the inhibitory effect of splitomicin (1). The SIR2-Y298L/N299D allele showed an equivalent degree of resistance to SIR2-Y298N, which had been independently identified as a splitomicin (1)-resistant allele in our prior study (32Bedalov A. Gatbonton T. Irvine W.P. Gottschling D.E. Simon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, SIR2-Y298L/N299D and SIR2-Y298N conferred about 5-fold resistance to splitomicin (1) relative to the SIR2-HST1 chimera, suggesting that other mutations in the chimera (i.e. K285R, D290E, M302L, and H303Q) counteract the splitomicin (1) resistance effect of the Y298L mutation. Indeed, SIR2-K285R/D290E and SIR2-M302/H303Q conferred slight sensitivity to splitomicin (1) relative to the wild-type SIR2 (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These results suggest that a probable key residue for the relative resistance of Hst1p toward splitomicin (1) is leucine 244, which corresponds to tyrosine 298 of Sir2p.Fig. 1Model of splitomicin (compound 1) with yeast Sir2p or Hst1p.A, the crystal structure of human SIRT2p (33Finnin M.S.

https://openalex.org/W2072687189,"Dimerization of several G protein-coupled receptors has recently been described, but little is known about its clinical and functional relevance. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are structurally related gastrointestinal and neuronal peptides whose functions are mediated by two structurally related receptors in this superfamily, the type A and B CCK receptors. We previously demonstrated spontaneous homodimerization of type A CCK receptors and the dissociation of those complexes by agonist occupation (Cheng, Z. J., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48040-48047). Here, for the first time, we also demonstrate spontaneous homodimerization of type B CCK receptors, as well as heterodimerization of that receptor with the type A CCK receptor. Unlike type A CCK receptor dimers, the homodimerization of type B CCK receptors was not affected by ligand occupation. However, although heterodimers of type A and B CCK receptors bound natural agonists normally, they exhibited unusual functional and regulatory characteristics. Such complexes demonstrated enhanced agonist-stimulated cellular signaling and delayed agonist-induced receptor internalization. As a likely consequence, agonist-stimulated cell growth was markedly enhanced in cells simultaneously expressing both of these receptors. Our results provide the first evidence that heterodimerization of G protein-coupled receptors can form a more “powerful” signaling unit, which has potential clinical significance in promoting cell growth. Dimerization of several G protein-coupled receptors has recently been described, but little is known about its clinical and functional relevance. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are structurally related gastrointestinal and neuronal peptides whose functions are mediated by two structurally related receptors in this superfamily, the type A and B CCK receptors. We previously demonstrated spontaneous homodimerization of type A CCK receptors and the dissociation of those complexes by agonist occupation (Cheng, Z. J., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48040-48047). Here, for the first time, we also demonstrate spontaneous homodimerization of type B CCK receptors, as well as heterodimerization of that receptor with the type A CCK receptor. Unlike type A CCK receptor dimers, the homodimerization of type B CCK receptors was not affected by ligand occupation. However, although heterodimers of type A and B CCK receptors bound natural agonists normally, they exhibited unusual functional and regulatory characteristics. Such complexes demonstrated enhanced agonist-stimulated cellular signaling and delayed agonist-induced receptor internalization. As a likely consequence, agonist-stimulated cell growth was markedly enhanced in cells simultaneously expressing both of these receptors. Our results provide the first evidence that heterodimerization of G protein-coupled receptors can form a more “powerful” signaling unit, which has potential clinical significance in promoting cell growth. G protein-coupled receptors represent the largest and most diverse superfamily of transmembrane receptors and mediate the effects of a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. It is now well established that, like single transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), these heptahelical receptors can form oligomeric complexes in the plasma membrane (3Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J.

In addition to homodimerization, heterodimerization can occur with some structurally related receptors in this superfamily (8White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A.

This has been implicated in the effects on ligand binding and acute effects on cellular signaling (8White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 9Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 12Pfeiffer M.

Formation of heterodimers of nonfunctional B1 and B2 γ-aminobutyric acid receptors have been shown to be necessary for binding and complete functional activity of native ligands (10Kuner R. Kohr G. Grunewald S. Eisenhardt G. Bach A. Kornau H.C. Science. 1999; 283: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Dimeric complexes of fully functional opioid receptors have been shown to alter their selectivity, displaying decreased affinities for highly selective agonists and enhanced affinities for nonselective agonists (9Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Dimerization between somatostatin receptors has also been found to alter the pharmacology and signaling of individual receptors (12Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14027-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the relevance of receptor dimerization to longer term effects, such as cell growth. Gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCKcholecystokininG-17gastrin-17BRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferRluRenilla luciferaseYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininCHOChinese hamster ovaryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. are gastrointestinal and neuronal peptides with important regulatory roles in the digestive tract and nervous system, including both acute and more chronic trophic effects (14Baldwin G.S. J. Gastroent. Hepatol. 1995; 10: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Todisco A. J. Gastroent. 2000; 35: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These functions are mediated by two receptors, the type A and type B CCK receptors, both belonging to the class I family of G protein-coupled receptors and exhibiting 48% structural homology with each other (17Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.M. Buell G. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Kopin A.S. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Miller L.J. Lu M.

These two receptors can be distinguished on the basis of their structural specificity, with both recognizing gastrin and CCK but with each having markedly distinct sensitivities to the state of tyrosine sulfation of those peptides. cholecystokinin gastrin-17 bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Renilla luciferase yellow fluorescent protein hemagglutinin Chinese hamster ovary high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate. Although additional subtypes of CCK receptors have been predicted to exist, based on the complexity of the pharmacology and physiology of gastrin and CCK in vivo, only these two CCK receptor cDNAs have thus far been identified. It is possible that receptor oligomerization contributes to the pharmacology that has been observed and may even play a role in cell growth. We recently utilized bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and immunoprecipitation to demonstrate that type A CCK receptors can exist as homodimers in living cells, with these complexes dissociated by agonist binding (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To date there have been no reports of the ability of type B CCK receptors to dimerize or the possibility of the type A and B CCK receptors to form heterodimeric complexes. Indeed, using the same biophysical techniques, our current study demonstrated homodimerization of type B CCK receptors, as well as heterodimerization of this receptor with type A CCK receptors when co-expressed in cells. Of note, unlike the type A receptors (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), oligomerization of the type B CCK receptors was not affected by agonist binding. Further functional studies showed that heterodimers of CCK receptors display new functional and regulatory properties affecting nonpeptidyl ligand binding and agonist-induced calcium signaling and receptor trafficking that were distinct from those of individual receptors. Of note, we found that heterodimer-expressing cells displayed significantly increased agonist-stimulated cell growth. These results support the formation of a novel receptor signaling unit by dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors and has potentially important functional implications. cDNA Constructs for Receptor Expression Studies—The human type A and type B CCK receptor cDNA constructs were prepared as we have described (17Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.M. Buell G. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Ding W.Q. Kuntz S.M. Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 947-952PubMed Google Scholar). A series of epitope-tagged forms of these receptors were prepared. Type B CCK receptor constructs having an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the amino terminus and type A CCK receptor constructs having a FLAG epitope tag at its amino terminus were prepared using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). CCK receptor constructs having Renilla luciferase (Rlu) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused at the carboxyl-terminal ends of these respective receptors were also prepared. For this, the same mutagenesis method was used to insert an XhoI site just before the receptor stop codon. The Rlu and YFP constructs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using templates representing pRL-CMV-Rlu (Promega) or pEYFP-N1 (Invitrogen), respectively. The amplified products were ligated in frame into XhoI/XbaI sites of the receptor-bearing constructs. All of the sequences were verified by direct DNA sequencing. For controls, β2-adrenergic receptor constructs (β2-adrenergic receptor-Rlu and β2-adrenergic receptor-YFP) were generously provided by Dr. Michel Bouvier (11Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Transient and Stable Receptor Expression Systems—Transient receptor expression was achieved in COS-1 cells. These were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 0.75× 106 cells/plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone II (Hyclone) 20 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using the DEAE-dextran method with 3 μg of cDNA of each construct/plate (17Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.M. Buell G. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The levels of CCK receptor expression were monitored by radioligand binding assay and Western blot analysis. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were used for stable receptor expression. Cells stably expressing epitope-tagged human type A and B CCK receptors were prepared in manner analogous to that we previously described (20Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4236-4244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), with HA-tagged type B CCK receptor cDNA in a neomycin-selectable vector and FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptor cDNA in a zeocin-selectable vector, and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 or 0.5 mg/ml zeocin, respectively (Invitrogen). Clones of each cell line having similar levels of receptor expression (the ratio of expression of type B to type A CCK receptors was ∼1.5) were selected by radioligand binding assays (described below) and Western blotting. To prepare the cell line that co-expressed type B and type A CCK receptors, the cell line stably expressing the HA-tagged type B CCK receptors (CHO-CCKBR) were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptor. The cells were selected using both G418 and zeocin. Western blotting was used again to ensure that the expression level of FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptors in the dual receptor expressing cells (CHO-CCKAR&CCKBR) was similar to that in the cell line expressing FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptors alone (CHO-CCKAR). Thus, three stable cell lines expressing type B CCK receptors, type A CCK receptors, or both were established and selected for further studies. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed in enriched plasma membranes prepared from receptor-bearing cells, as we previously reported (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, the membranes from receptor-bearing CHO cells (∼50 μg of total protein) were solubilized in NuPAGE sample buffer and had the component proteins separated by electrophoresis on a 4-12% gradient NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). These were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of HA-tagged type B CCK receptors or FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptors on the Western blot were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), respectively. Synthesis of Fluorescent Probe for the Type B CCK Receptor—The nonsulfated CCK analogue was derivatized with rhodamine by reacting it with 5,6-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine succinimide. The peptide was dissolved in dimethylformamide, neutralized with N,N-di-isopropylethylamine, and reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of the activated rhodamine for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by reversed-phase HPLC, and when it was complete, excess unreacted fluorophore was quenched with diethylaminopropyl amine. The nonsulfated CCK analogue (Rho-nsCCK) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a C-18 column, and it was characterized and quantified by amino acid analysis. CCK Receptor Binding and Biological Activity Studies—CCK receptor binding studies were performed in enriched plasma membranes prepared from receptor-bearing cells, as we have described (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4236-4244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For competition binding studies, membranes containing 10 μg of protein were incubated with a constant amount of the CCK-like radioligand, 125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26-33] (1-5 pm), in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ligand (ranging from 0 to 0.1 μm). The incubations were performed for 60 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), using receptor-binding filter mats. Bound radioligand was quantified in a γ spectrometer, with nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.1 μm competing unlabeled CCK, representing less than 15% of total binding. The data were analyzed using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting program of Munson and Rodbard, LIGAND (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar), and were graphed using Prism software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Intracellular calcium responses to CCK or gastrin were determined in receptor-bearing CHO cells using a well characterized assay (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cells were lifted with nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in Ham's F-12 medium at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by washing with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium. In each assay, ∼2 million cells were stimulated with varied concentrations of CCK or gastrin at 37 °C, with fluorescence quantified in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer. To test the possible effects of antagonists, the cells were pretreated by varied concentrations of antagonist 120 s before treatment with a constant concentration (10-8m) of agonists. Excitation was performed at 340 and 380 nm, and emissions were determined at 520 nm, with calcium concentrations calculated from the ratios (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peak intracellular calcium transients were utilized to determine the concentration dependence of the biological responses. Bioluminescence and Fluorescence Assays—Bioluminescence and fluorescence measurements were performed with approximately one million transfected COS cells in a 1-ml cuvette using a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ). For the bioluminescence assay, the cell-permeant substrate of Renilla luciferase, coelenterazine (Packard Bioscience), was added to the cell suspension to yield a final concentration of 5 μm. The bioluminescence emission was immediately monitored in the spectrum between 400 and 600 nm. To assay YFP fluorescence, the cells were excited at 480 nm, and emission was scanned from 500 to 580 nm. BRET assays were performed as we previously described (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the COS cells were detached using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma), and the cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium. The cells were then resuspended in the same medium and were treated with the appropriate concentrations of ligands at 37 °C for 5 min or for the noted period of time. Subsequently, the cells were transferred into the cuvette, coelenterazine was added, and data reflecting light emitted between 400 and 600 nm was acquired. Consistent with our previous work (1Cheng Z.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E.C. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the BRET ratio was defined as [(emission at 510-590) - (emission at 440-500) × Cf]/(emission at 440-500), where Cf corresponds to (emission at 510-590)/(emission at 440-500) for the CCKR-Rlu construct expressed alone in analogous experiments. Receptor Trafficking Studies—Confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope using a Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. For single labeling experiments, cells expressing HA-tagged type B CCK receptors and/or FLAG-tagged type A CCK receptors were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates. They were washed twice with cold PBS and were labeled with 1 nm Rho-nsCCK for 1 h at 4 °C. The coverslips were rinsed and incubated in PBS at 37 °C for the time points indicated, followed by 2% paraformaldehyde fixation. The coverslips were then washed and mounted on slides. The subcellular distribution of type B CCK receptors was determined using single-line excitation at 568 nm. For dual labeling experiments, the cells on coverslips were labeled with 1 nm Rho-nsCCK and anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. After rinsing, the coverslips were incubated in PBS at 37 °C for 0 or 30 min, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated second antibody in PBS with 0.02% saponin and 10% goat serum at room temperature for 30 min. The distribution of type A and B CCK receptors was detected using dual line switching excitation (488 nm for FITC, 568 nm for rhodamine) and emission (515-540 nm FITC, 590-610 nm rhodamine) filter sets. Cell Proliferation Assays—The cells expressing type A and/or type B CCK receptors were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well into 96-well dishes in Ham's F-12 with 10% Fetal Clone II and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were treated with varied concentrations of gastrin or CCK for 6 days, or with 10-8m gastrin or CCK for times indicated in serum-free medium. The medium was changed every other day, and the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were incubated with the CellTiter reagent for 2 h, and the plates were then read at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. We performed standard curves in each cell line to show that there were linear responses between cell number and absorbance at 490 nm. The incubation of culture medium with the CellTiter reagent was used as background absorbance. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed using Student's t test for comparison of independent samples. Preparation of Cells Expressing Tagged Receptor Constructs and Type B CCK Receptor Probe—Each of the CCK receptor constructs incorporating epitope tags was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of them was synthesized in the cell and transported normally to the cell surface. Fig. 1 shows representative Western blots from cells expressing the receptor constructs individually or together, using anti-HA antibody or anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. As expected by the strategies we used to establish the stable cell lines, the cells transfected with both receptor cDNA constructs expressed levels of type B CCK receptors similar to that transfected with type B CCK receptor cDNA construct alone and levels of type A CCK receptors similar to that transfected with type A CCK receptor cDNA construct alone. A new fluorescent nonsulfated CCK analogue (Rho-nsCCK) was developed and characterized to track type B CCK receptors. It bound to the type B CCK receptor with the same affinity as gastrin and stimulated a similar calcium response in such cells to natural hormone, while recognizing the type A CCK receptor with very low affinity (Table I). Consistent with these data, this probe specifically stained only cells expressing type B CCK receptors. It was useful to help demonstrate co-localization of the type B and type A CCK receptors within the plasma membrane of CHO-CCKAR&CCKBR cells (Fig. 1).Table ICharacterization of stable CHO cell lines expressing type A, type B, and both types of CCK receptorsCCK, BmaxIC50CCKG-17Rho-nsCCKL-364,718L-365,260pmol/mg proteinn mCHO-CCKAR1.4 ± 0.25.4 ± 1.5>103>1034.3 ± 1.2328 ± 114CHO-CCKBR2.5 ± 0.84.1 ± 1.028 ± 657 ± 4413 ± 1215 ± 1CHO-CCKAR&CCKBR4.2 ± 1.07.9 ± 1.642 ± 723 ± 8494 ± 14085 ± 51 Open table in a new tab Binding Characterization of CCK Receptor-bearing Cells— Functional characterization of the receptor constructs expressed transiently in COS cells revealed that CCK bound to these receptors specifically and saturably with high affinity similar to that for wild type CCK receptors (data not shown). This provided adequate support to proceed with the establishment of stable cell lines expressing these constructs in CHO cells. The densities of receptors on the cell surface in the stable cell lines are shown in Table I. The cell lines utilized in the comparisons had numbers of type A and type B CCK receptors that were within 1.8-fold of each other. Both CCK and gastrin were used to compete with the CCK-like radioligand, 125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26-33] (nonselective ligand that binds with high affinity to both type A and type B CCK receptors) in membranes from the cells expressing type B, type A, or both types of CCK receptors (Table I). As previously reported, type B CCK receptors have high affinities for both CCK and gastrin, whereas type A CCK receptors have a high affinity for CCK and a low affinity for gastrin. The nonpeptidyl antagonists L-364,718 and L-365,260 were also utilized in competition binding assays, utilizing the same radioligand (Table I). In contrast, cells expressing both type A and type B CCK receptors (type B-type A CCK receptor heterodimers) acted more like type B CCK receptors in their agonist binding properties, with high affinities for both agonists (Table I). In control experiments, the 1:1 mixture of membranes from two different cell lines individually expressing type A and type B CCK receptors were tested in the binding assay, and the binding affinities were compared with those of membranes from cells simultaneously expressing both receptors. Although its affinity for CCK was similar to that of heterodimers, its affinity for gastrin was clearly distinguishable from that of these heterodimers (IC50 value for heterodimers was 20 nm, whereas that for 1:1 mixture of membranes from type B and type A CCK receptor-expressing cells was 3 nm). Of particular interest, the type B-type A CCK receptor heterodimers exhibited decreased affinity for the nonpeptidyl ligands representing the type A CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 and the type B CCK receptor antagonist L-365,260 (Table I). L-364,718 had a 100-fold lower affinity for the heterodimer complex than for type A CCK receptors, whereas L-365,260 had a 5-fold lower affinity for the heterodimer complex than for type B CCK receptors. Thus, the formation of complexes was able to nullify the high affinity benzodiazepine binding activities of the individual receptors. Biological Characterization of CCK Receptor-bearing Cells— CCK elicited similar intracellular calcium responses at all epitope-tagged receptor constructs compared with the analogous wild type receptor construct expressed in the same type of cell (Table II). No significant differences were observed for the maximal intracellular calcium responses between the tagged CCK receptor constructs and wild type CCK receptor (p < 0.05).Table IICharacterization of tagged CCK receptor constructs used in BRET studiesCCK binding KIBmaxCCK activity EC50pmol/mgn mCCKAR0.36 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.2CCKAR-Rlu1.10 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.9CCKAR-YFP0.53 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.11.8 ± 1.0CCKBR0.81 ± 0.010.9 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1CCKBR-Rlu1.90 ± 0.90.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1CCKBR-YFP2.40 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab We also examined the effects of heterodimerization of type A and type B CCK receptors on th"

We used rat islet-specific oligonucleotide arrays (Metabolex Rat Islet Genechips) to identify genes that are coordinately regulated by high glucose and free fatty acids (FFA). Exposure of rat islets to FFA (125 μm for 2 days) or glucose (27 mm for 4 days) reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 70 ± 5 and 40 ± 4%, respectively, relative to control-cultured islets. These treatments also substantially reduced the insulin content of the islets. Islet Genechips analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of cAMP response element modulator (CREM)-17X and inducible cAMP early repressor were significantly increased in both 27 mm glucose- and FFA-treated islets. Removing FFA or high glucose from the culture medium restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the mRNA levels of the two CREM repressors to normal. Northern blot analysis revealed a 5-fold increase in the abundance of CREM-17X mRNA and a concomitant 50% reduction in the insulin mRNA in FFA-treated islets. Transient transfection of the insulin-secreting βHC9 cells with CREM-17X suppressed rat insulin promoter activity by nearly 50%. Overexpression of CREM-17X in intact islets via adenovirus infection decreased islet insulin mRNA levels and insulin content and resulted in a significant decrease in glucose- or KCl-induced insulin secretion. Taken together, these data suggest that up-regulation of CREM repressors by either FFA or high glucose exacerbates β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes by suppressing insulin gene transcription.

Taken together, these data suggest that up-regulation of CREM repressors by either FFA or high glucose exacerbates β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes by suppressing insulin gene transcription. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a progressive loss of β-cell function throughout the course of the disease (1Porte Jr., D. Kahn S.E.

There is a loss of first phase insulin secretion in early stages, followed by a decreasing maximal capacity of glucose to stimulate and potentiate insulin secretion. A significant proportion of the patients eventually develop major β-cell failure requiring supplements of exogenous insulin. None of the current remedies, sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin, alone or in combination) appear to halt or reverse such a progressive loss of β-cell function/mass in type 2 diabetics (3United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of thiazolidinediones, which may have some subtle beneficial effects on β-cell function in certain patients (4Juhl C.B.

Over the past decade, studies in animals and man have suggested that long term hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia from the diabetic milieu contribute to the deterioration of β-cell function and lead to the concepts of β-cell glucose toxicity (5Leahy J.L. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and lipotoxicity (6Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

It is noteworthy that islets treated with high glucose and FFA share multiple pathophysiological features, such as increased basal and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), increased activity of hexokinase, and reduced glucose oxidation (7Zhou Y.P.

At the level of gene expression, excessively elevated glucose or FFA down-regulates several important β-cell genes including pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1), glucose transporter-2, glucokinase, and insulin (11Gremlich S.

The similarities between glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity and the coordinated changes of multiple genes imply that some of the same master transcription factors are involved in both pathological processes. We have recently developed custom islet-specific Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays (Metabolex Islet Genechips) that can simultaneously detect at least 90-95% of the genes and their splice variants expressed in pancreatic islets. The rat Islet Genechips, a set of three arrays, contain 22,787 probe sets representing ∼12,000 known genes or expressed sequence tags present in an adult rat islet cDNA library. In this study we used the rat Islet Genechips to examine changes in the expression of β-cell transcription factors in long term high glucose- and FFA-treated rat islets. We found that the expression of two repressive forms of the cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM), CREM-17X, and the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER-1) (16Inada A. Someya Y. Yamada Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21095-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were significantly increased in both models. Overexpression of CREM-17X in insulin-secreting cells directly suppresses the transcriptional activation of the insulin gene promoter (RIP) and GSIS. Overexpression of CREM repressors therefore may represent a common mediator of islet lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity in type 2 diabetes. Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets were isolated from fed 9-12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlen, Indianapolis, IN) by collagenase digestion in conjunction with Ficoll gradient separation as previously described (17Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). The islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mm glucose) before experimental treatment. Treatment of Islets and Experimental Design—Islets were exposed to either 27 mm glucose for 4-8 days or 125 μm FFA (a 1:1 mixture of palmitate and oleate) for 2-4 days during tissue culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Additionally, a recovery group that was first treated with glucose or FFA and then cultured another 2-4 days in regular medium was included in both studies (Table I). These treatments were compared with islets cultured at 11 mm glucose alone (glucose study) or with 0.5% ethanol (FFA study) for the same time period.Table IExperimental conditions used for insulin secretion and Islet Genechip studiesGroupsCulture conditionsGlucose studyControl8 days at 11 mm glucoseG27-4d4 days at 11 mm → 4 days at 27 mmG27-8d8 days at 27 mmG27-rec4 days at 27 mm → 4 days at 11 mm glucoseFFA studyControl4 days without FFAFFA-48h2 days without FFA → 2 days 125 μm FFAFFA-96h4 days 125 μm FFAFFA-rec2 days 125 μm FFA → 2 days without FFA Open table in a new tab GSIS and Islet Insulin Content—GSIS was determined by the 1-h static incubation of islets in Krebs-Ringers' bicarbonate medium at 37 °C as described (18Zhou Y.P. Berggren P.O. Grill V. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Kreb-Ringer's bicarbonate medium contains 143.5 mm Na+, 5.8 mm K+, 2.5 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 124.1 mm Cl-, 1.2 mm PO43-, 1.2 mm SO42+, 25 mm CO32-, and 10 mm Hepes, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm glucose (pH 7.4). Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by radioimmunoassay with a commercial kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Islet insulin content was measured in islet homogenate after acid ethanol (0.18 mm HCl in 70% ethanol) extraction. Aliquots of the islet homogenates were also used for islet DNA quantification using SYBR® green I nucleic acid gel stain reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Metabolex Islet Genechips and RNA Hybridization—Custom rat islet-specific Affymetrix Genechips (Metabolex Islet Genechips) were used in RNA hybridization experiments with Affymetrix standard protocol for chip hybridization (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA extracted from 200-300 islets with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA (Superscript Choice System; Invitrogen), followed by an in vitro transcription reaction to yield biotin-labeled cRNA. Ten μg of cRNA was used to hybridize each individual chip. The Affymetrix Genechip Analysis Suite (version 3.2) was used to convert the image signal of each probe set to an average difference (AD) value. The AD value is the mean of fluorescence intensity differences between the 20 pairs of perfectly matched and mismatched features (probes). The expression levels of each gene or expressed sequence tag in control and glucose- or FFA-treated islets were measured as the means of the AD values from the three to five replicate samples for each group. Northern Blot and Taqman Quantitative PCR—RNA blot analysis of CREM-17X and insulin was performed with an Ambion Northern blot kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) by following the manufacturer's instructions. The same blot was also probed for β-actin to correct for sample loading and transferring efficiency. The intensity of the hybridization signal with each probe was quantified with a Storm™ PhosphorImager scanner (Molecular Dynamics). The mRNA levels of NeuroD1, PDX-1, and insulin were quantified by real time PCR using the SYBR® green I dye and an ABI Prism 7700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were normalized to β-actin level in each sample. The sequences of the gene-specific primers were as follows: NeuroD1, 5′-TGGCTGGCTGCTTGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGCATGTCCGGATTCTG-3′ (antisense); PDX-1, 5′-AAAAGACCCGAGCTTCTGA AAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGACCTGGCGGTTCAC-3′); insulin, 5′-CTGCCCAGGCTTTTGTCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCACACACCAGGTACAGAGC-3′ (antisense); β-actin, 5′-CGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACAGCCTGGATGGCTACGT-3′ (antisense). The fold changes were calculated by using the comparative threshold cycle method. Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—The RIP-βGal reporter vector was made by replacing the CMV promoter of the pcDNA3.1/Hygro/lacZ DNA (Invitrogen) with a 0.7-kb fragment of the rat insulin II promoter (-695 to 1 of the insulin gene) (20Hanahan D. Nature. 1985; 315: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of CREM-17X was subcloned into the pcDNA4 vector (Invitrogen). The insulin-secreting βHC9 cells were cultured in DMEM (25 mm glucose) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as described previously (21Liang Y. Bai G. Doliba N. Buettger C. Wang L. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E846-E857PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of the βHC9 cells with RIP-βGal and CREM17X or empty pcDNA4 vectors (at 1:2 ratio) were carried out with the DMRIE reagent (Invitrogen). Cellular βGal activity was measured 48 h later with Gal-F β-galactosidase detection kit (Sigma). Adenovirus-mediated Overexpression of CREM-17X in Islets—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) alone (Ad-eGFP, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone) or CREM-17X plus eGFP (Ad-CREM17X) was generated using the AdEasy system as described (22He T. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T. Yu J. Kinzer K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). Batches of 50 freshly isolated rat islets were exposed to 50 × 106 plaque-forming units of the virus in 1.5 ml of Adeno infection medium (RPMI1640 medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) for 1.5 h. The islets were then cultured for 4 days before being used for GSIS, islet insulin content assays. Pilot study with the Ad-eGFP control virus demonstrated that this protocol of infection induced GFP expression (visualized under fluorescence microscope with filter set of excitation of 385 nm and emission of 465 nm) in ∼85% of islet cells, and the virus infection itself did not affect GSIS. For the islet perifusion study, the islets were exposed to the viruses in Adeno infection medium for 16 h and then cultured in regular RPMI medium for another 48 h. An extra group of islets were treated with 125 μm FFA in regular medium as described earlier in this section to serve as positive controls. After the viral infection or FFA exposure (64 h in total), the islets (25 of each) were perifused with Kreb-Ringer's bicarbonate medium in parallel mini-chamber, as previously described (23Sturis J. Pugh W. Tang J. Ostrega D. Polonsky J.S. Polonsky K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E250-E259PubMed Google Scholar), to measure insulin secretory responses to glucose and 30 mm KCl. Similarly treated islets were also subjected to Taqman quantitative PCR analysis for insulin mRNA levels. Statistical Analysis—All of the data were expressed as the means ± S.E. A Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups. Insulin Secretion and Islet Insulin Content in High Glucose or FFA-treated Rat Islets—Exposing rat islets to 27 mm glucose (G27) for 4 days increased the basal insulin secretion at 2 mm glucose by 3-fold (6.4 ± 0.3 versus 2.3 ± 0.2 ng/5 islets/h, p < 0.01) and decreased insulin secretory responses to 20 mm glucose by 40% (51 ± 4.8 versus 73 ± 9.7 ng/5 islets/h, n = 4, p < 0.05) relative to control cultured islets (Fig. 1A). The insulin content in G27-treated islets was reduced by 35% (31 ± 4 versus 48 ± 5 ng/islet, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). The changes of insulin secretion and insulin content in G27-treated islets were completely reversed by the 4-day recovery culture at 11 mm glucose. When expressed as a percentage of islet insulin content released during the 1-h incubation (Fig. 1C), the basal secretion in G27-treated islets increased by 5-fold, whereas GSIS was comparable with that of control (32 ± 3% in G27-treated islets versus 30 ± 4.2% in control islets). These results indicate that GSIS and islet insulin content were reduced comparably in G27-treated islets. GSIS in islets exposed to 125 μm FFA for 48 or 96 h was reduced by 70-80% (11 ± 2 and 8 ± 1.2 versus 38 ± 4 ng/5 islets/h, n = 3, p < 0.01), along with a 50-60% reduction in islet insulin content. An additional 48-h culture of the islets in medium without FFA restored GSIS and insulin content to ∼80% of the values of islets never exposed to FFA (Fig. 1, D and E). The percentage of insulin content secreted at basal levels (2 mm glucose) was again significantly higher in FFA-treated islets than control. Unlike G27-treated islets, the fractional insulin secretion stimulated by 20 mm glucose was also markedly reduced in FFA-treated islets (Fig. 1F). These results for insulin secretion and insulin content in glucose- and FFA-treated rat islets are largely consistent with the previous studies of others and us (7Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 8Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Björklund A. Grill V.

Expression Levels of Major Islet Transcription Factors in Glucose and FFA-treated Islets—Insulin gene expression and the maintenance of normal islet function in adult islets depend on the action of a complex network of transcription factors (24Edlund H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 25Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential role of these factors in the induction of glucose toxicity and lipotoxicity, we examined changes in the expression of islet transcription factors in G27- and FFA-treated islets. The Islet Genechip study showed that the expression of PDX-1 and NeuroD1/Beta2 were significantly suppressed in FFA-treated islets (Fig. 2A). Quantitative PCR measurement confirmed the reductions of PDX-1 and NeuroD1/BETA2 mRNA in FFA-treated rat islets (Fig. 2C, n = 2 for each). No significant reduction of PDX-1 and NeuroD1 was found in G27-treated islets by the Genechip (Fig. 2B) and Taqman PCR study (Fig. 2C). Other transcription factors that were found not changed in the chip experiments were Nkx6.1, PAX6, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α, HNF-3β, HNF-3γ, Hes-2, Hes-3, Islet-brain 1, neurogenin-3, and Pan-1. The rat Islet Genechips were unable to detect cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, Hes-1, HNF-1β, HNF-3α, HNF-4α, and MASH1 (data not shown), perhaps because of either low expression level or a lack of sensitivity of these probes. Overexpression of CREM Repressors in FFA- and Glucose-treated Islets—The most striking change in the expression of transcription factors in G27- or FFA-treated islets was the up-regulation of CREM-17X and ICER-1, two repressor forms of CREM. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of CREM-17X and ICER-1 was increased by 3-5-fold in both FFA- and G27-treated islets relative to control cultured islets. The up-regulation of CREM repressors was also the most prominent change observed across the entire DNA array. Of all probe sets representing ∼12,000 known genes on the rat Islet Genechips, only 15 of them were changed significantly (p < 0.05, 12 up, 3 down) in all islet groups with reduced GSIS (cultured with G27 for 4 or 8 days and FFA for 2 or 4 days) and restored to normal in islets that had gone through the recovery culture. Notably, 3 of the 12 increased probe sets represent CREM-17X or ICER-1 (Table II).Table IIGenes changed reversibly in both 27 mm glucose-and FFA-treated isletsProbe set on arrayGene nameNCBI numberDown-regulated genesMBXRATISL09987IP3 receptor subtype 3L06096MBXRATISL09989Insulin receptor-related receptorM90661RNTSXTestis-specific geneX99797Up-regulated genesMBXRATISL09656Brain creatine kinaseM14400MBXRATISL11824ICER-IS66024MBXRATISL11825ICER-IS66024MBXRATISL10690CREM-17X (CREMΔC-G)Z15158MBXRATISL11656Gene 33 polypeptideX07266MBXRATISL11657Gene 33 polypeptideX07266MBXRATISL10759Glutamic acid decarboxylase-67X57573MBXRATISL18113MAP kinase phosphataseAF013144MBXRATISL10704Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseX97772 Open table in a new tab The changes in the gene expression of CREM-17X and ICER-1 were tightly coupled with the islet function. Thus, withdrawal of G27 and FFA from the culture medium restored both GSIS and the AD values of ICER-1 and CREM-17X to normal levels (Fig. 3). The changes in the expression of CREM-17X and ICER-1 are apparently specific to treatment by G27 or FFA, because no change in the expression of β-actin and GAPDH tiled on the chips was seen in either of the treatment groups (data not shown). Overexpression of CREM Impairs Insulin Gene Transcription and GSIS—To evaluate the potential roles of overexpression of CREM repressors in high glucose- and FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction, we examined insulin mRNA levels in FFA-treated islets and the effects of CREM-17X overexpression on rat insulin promoter activation and GSIS. Northern blot analysis revealed a 5-fold increase in the abundance of CREM-17X mRNA in FFA-treated islets compared with control islets. More importantly, the same blot also showed a 50% reduction of insulin mRNA level in FFA-treated islets (Fig. 4). Removing FFA from the culture medium largely restored the mRNA levels of CREM-17X and insulin to normal. To investigate the effect of CREM repressors on insulin gene transcription, βHC9 cells, a mouse insulin secreting β-cell line, were transiently co-transfected with RIP-βGal and CREM-17X. The ectopically expressed RIP retained ample glucose responsiveness in βHC9 cells. Thus, increasing glucose concentrations from 0.1 to 25 mm during the 48-h culture after the transfection enhanced RIP activity (measured by βGal expression driven by the promoter) nearly 3-fold when it was co-transfected with a second empty vector (Fig. 5A). However, co-expression of CREM-17X in the cells inhibited the activation of RIP by glucose, especially at the level of 25 mm glucose (by 44 ± 5%, p < 0.05, n = 4; Fig. 5B). The effects of CREM overexpression on insulin secretion and islet insulin content were investigated by infecting intact rat islets with an adenovirus expressing CREM-17X (Ad-CREM17X) followed by GSIS assay 2-4 days after the infection. The infection by the Ad-CREM17X virus of islets was confirmed by visualizing GFP expression under a fluorescence microscope (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5C, infecting the islets with the Ad-eGFP control virus did not affect insulin secretion. When measured in a static incubation, GSIS in AdCREM17X-infected islets was ∼35% lower than that in Ad-eGFP-treated islets (313 ± 20 versus 463 ± 41 pg/ng·DNA/h, n = 3, p < 0.05). The adenovirus-mediated CREM-17X expression in islet cells also reduced islet insulin content by ∼30% (2.3 ± 0.2 versus 3.5 ± 0.2 ng/ng DNA, n = 3, p < 0.01; Fig. 5D). The suppression of insulin secretion by CREM-17X overexpression was also documented in islet perifusion experiments performed 64 h after the viral infection. The reduction of GSIS in Ad-CREM17X-infected islets occurred mainly in the first phase of the insulin secretion process (Fig. 5E). Thus, the average insulin secretion during the first 5 min of glucose stimulation was reduced by 50% (1.4 ± o.4 versus 2.8 ± 0.5 ng/25 islets/min, p < 0.01, n = 3) in Ad-CREM17X-infected islets relative to Ad-eGFP-infected islets, whereas the second phase secretion (between the 6th and 20th min of glucose stimulation) was not significantly different between the two groups of islets (1.3 ± 0.08 in the Ad-CREM17X and 1.5 ± 0.15 ng/25 islets/min in Ad-eGFP islets). Noticeably, the decrease of GSIS in FFA-treated islets was seen in both first phase (by 33%, average insulin secretion 1.9 ± 0.2 ng/25 islets/min) and more profoundly the second phase (by 50%, 0.7 ± 0.03 ng/25 islets/min). Furthermore, the insulin secretory responses to the glucose-independent membrane depolarization induced directly by 30 mm KCl was also significantly reduced in Ad-CREM17X- and FFA-treated islets (Fig. 5E). A similar conclusion could be reached when the area under the curve was used as a measurement of insulin secretion in these experimental conditions. To investigate to what extent the impaired insulin secretion in CREM-17X overexpressing islets was linked to the expression of insulin gene, we went on to measure the insulin mRNA levels in AdCREM17X-treated islets by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5F, the relative abundance of insulin mRNA in AdCREM17X-infected islets was ∼60% lower than that of Ad-eGFP-infected islets. The 64-h exposure to FFA caused a 50% reduction in insulin mRNA levels in this study. The genes responsible for islet glucose toxicity and lipotoxicity are yet to be discovered. The results of the present study demonstrate that the overexpression of ICER-1 and CREM-17X are the most prominent changes in high glucose- or FFA-treated rat islets and are tightly associated with the changes of GSIS. Exposing rat islets to G27 for 4-8 days or 125 μm FFA for 2-4 days resulted in a significant reduction of GSIS and a 3-5-fold increase in the mRNA levels of ICER-1 and CREM-17X. Removing high glucose and FFA from the culture medium restored GSIS and the expression levels of the two CREM repressors to normal. CREM is a member of the ATF/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein family of transcription factors that controls the expression of multiple genes in neuroendocrine cells including insulin. Pancreatic β-cells express multiple forms of CREM originating from alternative splicing or the use of an intronic promoter (16Inada A. Someya Y. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Kubota A. Ban N. Watanabe R.

Kuroe A. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ICER-1 and CREM-17X are apparently the major isoforms of CREM in primary rat islet cells (26Inada A. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Kubota A. Yasuda K. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both ICER-1 and CREM-17X lack the two glutamate-enriched domains and therefore act as transcriptional repressors. CREM-17X is indistinguishable from a CREM isoform identified earlier called CREMΔC-G (27Walker W.H. Sanborn B.M. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to the tight coupling of overexpression of CREM-17X/ICER-1 with the reduction of insulin secretion, several lines of evidence in this study further support the notion that CREM repressors may play important roles in β-cell dysfunction. First, Northern blot analysis confirmed that increased CREM-17X is associated with reduced expression of the insulin gene in FFA-treated islets. A previous study has shown that the expression of CREM-17X and ICER-1 are increased in the islets of the Goto-Kakizaki rats (26Inada A. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Kubota A. Yasuda K. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, none of the other islet transcription factors examined by our Genechip experiments were changed in both models of glucose toxicity and lipotoxicity or disturbed to the magnitude of CREM-17X/ICER-1. Third, transient transfection of βHC9 cells with CREM-17X significantly inhibited the activation of RIP by glucose. Most importantly, adenovirus-mediated expression of CREM-17X in rat islets significantly inhibited GSIS and reduced islet insulin content and insulin mRNA levels. The reduction of insulin gene transcription and/or insulin production is probably the main mechanism for the decrease of insulin content in Ad-CREM17X-infected islets, because basal insulin secretion in these islets is reduced rather than increased as seen in G27- or FFA-treated islets. The virally mediated overexpression of CREM-17X in rat islets mimics some important characteristics of the β-cell dysfunction induced by long term high glucose and FFA. Like high glucose and FFA, the adenovirally mediated overexpression of CREM-17X significantly reduced islet insulin content and GSIS. Both CREM-17X overexpression and long term FFA exposure reduced islet insulin mRNA levels. High glucose treatment did not suppress islet insulin mRNA relative to normal glucose, but given the increased demand for insulin caused by high glucose, transcriptional inhibition by CREM would reduce the capacity of the β-cell to replenish secreted insulin. Nevertheless, CREM overexpression does not explain all of the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia observed in this study. The overexpression of CREM-17X did not change the basal insulin secretion at 2 mm glucose, whereas high glucose and FFA both increased basal insulin secretion. Also, FFA inhibited both the first phase and second phase of insulin secretion in an in vitro islet perifusion system, whereas CREM-17X overexpression mainly suppressed the first phase of secretion, indicating the involvement of more than one mechanism for FFA inhibition of GSIS. These differences may suggest that suppressing insulin gene transcription is not the only mechanism by which CREM-17X exerts its negative effects on insulin secretion. Further studies are needed to determine whether CREM regulates the transcription of other genes pivotal to the regulation of insulin secretion in β-cell. There are certainly other genes that are important for the development of both β-cell glucose toxicity and lipotoxicity. It is important to clarify that the present study is focused only on the transcription factors that are potentially important for both high glucose-induced (glucose toxicity) and FFA-induced (lipotoxicity) β-cell dysfunction. Genes that are changed by only one of the treatments are not considered in this study. We did not see any differences in the expression level of PDX-1 or other homeobox factors between high glucose and control treated islets in our chip studies, although others have shown that high glucose reduces PDX-1 expression in human (10Marshak S. Leibowitz G. Bertuzzi F. Socci C. Kaiser N. Gross D.J. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and rat islets (13Seufert J. Weir G.C.

The reason we saw only a limited number of gene expression charges in this study is not known at this point. One possibility is that we used 11 mm glucose as control in our culture system. Although this concentration of glucose is traditionally viewed as most favorable (therefore “physiological”) to rodent islets when cultured in RPMI 640 medium (19Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Klöppel G. Pipeleers D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 28Ling Z. Kiekens R. Mahler T. Schuit F.C. Pipeleers-Marichal M. Sener A. Kloppel G. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is much higher than the normal blood glucose level of rodent. Therefore it is possible that we are, in this study, actually comparing “hyperglycemia” with “super-hyperglycemia” or “hyperglycemia” with “hyperglycemia with FFA.” There are other genes showing expression changes similar to CREM following the exposure to elevated glucose and FFA. Some of them may also contribute to β-cell dysfunction associated with long term treatment with high glucose and FFA. Further exploration of the importance of these genes is beyond the scope of this report. Also, it has to be mentioned that the actual number of genes that fall into this category may well exceed what we present here. This has relevance to the limitation in the sensitivity of the Genechip technology and to the degree of the “translation” of the rat transcriptome. As more genes are functionally characterized in the future, we will know the nature of those unknown genes (or expressed sequence tags) that show similar patterns of expression. Having said this, the present study represents a substantive global survey of the known islet expressed genes, and the fact that we have found only a handful of genes that are coordinately changed in two distinct but apparently related models of β-cell dysfunction suggests that these genes are significant contributors to a common pathological mechanism. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that high concentrations of both glucose and FFA up-regulate the expression of ICER-1 and CREM-17X in parallel to the reversible suppression of GSIS. Overexpression of CREM repressors in pancreatic β-cells clearly inhibit insulin gene transcription and insulin secretion. These results suggest that transcriptional repression by CREM variants may contribute to the loss of β-cell function in type 2 diabetes by inhibiting insulin gene transcription.

We mutated putative cation coordinating amino acids in transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 of rat Na,K-ATPase: Asp776 (Gln, Asp, Ala), Glu779 (Asp, Gln, Ala), Asp804 (Glu, Asn, Ala), and Asp808 (Glu, Asn, Ala). Electrogenic cation transport properties of these 12 mutants were analyzed in two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments on Xenopus laevis oocytes by measuring the voltage dependence of K+-stimulated stationary currents and pre-steady-state currents under electrogenic Na+/Na+ exchange conditions. Whereas mutants D804N, D804A, and D808A hardly showed any Na+/K+ pump currents, the other constructs could be classified according to the [K+] and voltage dependence of their stationary currents; mutants N776A and E779Q behaved similarly to the wild-type enzyme. Mutants E779D, E779A, D808E, and D808N had in common a decreased apparent affinity for extracellular K+. Mutants N776Q, N776D, and D804E showed large deviations from the wild-type behavior; the currents generated by mutant N776D showed weaker voltage dependence, and the current-voltage curves of mutants N776Q and D804E exhibited a negative slope. The apparent rate constants determined from transient Na+/Na+ exchange currents are rather voltage-independent and at potentials above -60 mV faster than the wild type. Thus, the characteristic voltage-dependent increase of the rate constants at hyperpolarizing potentials is almost absent in these mutants. Accordingly, dislocating the carboxamide or carboxyl group of Asn776 and Asp804, respectively, decreases the extracellular Na+ affinity.

The Na,K-ATPase transports in each reaction cycle three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell at the expense of one molecule of ATP. As is characteristic for P-type ATPases, the Na,K-ATPase, upon intracellular binding of Na+ in the E1 conformation, gets intermediately phosphorylated by ATP (forming E1P(Na+)3; see Fig. 1). After a conformational change to E2P, Na+ is extracellularly released. Subsequently, K+ can bind extracellularly and stimulates dephosphorylation. Upon a conformational change back to E1, K+ is intracellularly released. In order to bring about sequential translocation of Na+ and K+ ions in the sense of a ping-pong mechanism (1Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1000: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sachs J.R. J. Physiol. 1980; 302: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the ion pump has to obey strict cation specificity of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reaction (3Jencks W.P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 145-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The binding affinities for individual cation species change during the exposure of the binding sites from intra- to extracellular, which occurs during the E1P → E2P conformational change (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Jørgensen P.L.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Several putative cation-coordinating amino acids of the Na,K-ATPase were identified by mutagenesis studies (5Kaplan J.H. Annu.

These residues are identical or very similar to those described earlier by MacLennan et al. (7MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA pump), and their involvement in cation binding is confirmed by homology modeling with the three-dimensional structure of the SERCA pump (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). However, their influence on electrogenic cation transport and related cation affinities is largely ambiguous. The observation that the Na,K-ATPase generates an outward membrane current by extrusion of one net positive charge during each reaction cycle was made decades ago (9Thomas R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1972; 52: 563-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The voltage and cation dependence of stationary pump currents have been investigated in numerous electrophysiological studies on the enzyme from native cell preparations (e.g. rodent heart cells (10Nakao M.

Furthermore, extensive work has been carried out on the study of transient currents that can be induced by voltage jumps under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions (10Nakao M. Gadsby D.C.

J. 1994; 66: 912-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There is general agreement that the major charge-translocating event occurs during the Na+ branch of the transport cycle, which is rate-limited by the E1P ↔ E2P conformational change (23Holmgren M. Wagg J. Bezanilla F. Rakowski R.F. De Weer P. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 2000; 403: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several studies also indicated that electrogenicity, albeit much weaker than during Na+ translocation, also occurs during the K+ branch of the reaction cycle (14Lafaire A.V. Schwarz W. J. Membr.

After expression of recombinant Na,K-ATPase in different cell types became possible, many research groups focused on the biochemical characterization of mutated Na,K-ATPase. However, only very few groups studied the consequences of these mutations on properties of electrogenic transport (17Argüello J.M. Peluffo R.D. Feng J.N. Lingrel J.B. Berlin J.R. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1509: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The substitution of Glu779 by alanine resulted in a remarkably high amplitude of electrogenic Na+/Na+ exchange current compared with K+-stimulated stationary currents and an apparent increase of the enzyme's K0.5 value for half-maximal activation of K+-induced stationary currents (18Peluffo R.D.

Although these studies provided illuminating results, time-resolved measurements of transient currents due to the E1P ↔ E2P transition under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions were not carried out, and information about the influence of other amino acids involved in cation binding is still missing. The main electrogenic events occur during Na+-dependent transport steps that are kinetically coupled to the E1P → E2P conformational change (Fig. 1) (29Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fendler et al. (30Fendler K. Grell E. Haubs M. Bamberg E.

Following pioneering experimental work by Nakao and Gadsby (10Nakao M. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 1986; 323: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a series of publications used voltage pulse experiments under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions, showing that extracellular Na+ binding/release is the major electrogenic event (15Rakowski R.F.

Analysis of transient currents yields information about the kinetics of partial reactions of the catalytic cycle. The use of X. laevis oocytes for investigation of transient currents (15Rakowski R.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 117-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) facilitates the study of Na,K-ATPase mutants, but so far this has been performed only for the N-terminally truncated enzyme (27Wang X.Y. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We measured the influence of mutations in putative cation binding amino acids on stationary and pre-steady-state currents of the Na,K-ATPase. Substitution of Glu779 and Asp808 can lead to a reduced apparent affinity for K+, and substitutions of Asn776 and Asp804 result in stationary current-voltage curves with a negative slope, which is interpreted as a large reduction of the enzyme's affinity for extracellular Na+.

The rat Na,K-ATPase β-subunit was amplified with the primers 5′-AAATATTCGCGACCATGGCCCGCGGAAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCTCAGCTCTTAACTTCAAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with NruI and KpnI and cloned into the NruI and KpnI sites from pTLN.

All introduced mutations were verified by sequencing. Expression of Na,K-ATPase in X. laevis Oocytes—X. laevis females were anesthetized with 2 g/liter tricane, and parts of ovaries were removed. Oocytes were separated by incubation for 2-3 h in modified Ringer's solution (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 9.5 mg/liter penicillin, and 10 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate) containing 1-2 mg/ml collagenase A. Prophase-arrested oocytes of stage V and VI were selected for injection of cRNA. cRNA synthesis was carried out with the SP6-mMessageMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), using HpaI-linearized plasmid DNA. For the expression of the Na,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits, oocytes were injected with 10 and 2 ng of the corresponding cRNAs. Functional expression in the plasma membrane was measured as the K+-dependent (5 mm) stationary current. It increased with increasing amounts of α-subunit cRNA until a maximum was reached at 10 ng of mRNA per oocyte (data not shown). Increasing the amount of β-subunit cRNA (1-10 ng) did not increase the expression level of the functional pump at the plasma membrane. Therefore, 10 ng of cRNA α-subunit and 2 ng of cRNA of the β-subunit were injected into X. laevis oocytes. These oocytes express an endogenous Na,K-ATPase (∼25-nA stationary current; data not shown) that can be inhibited by 10 μm ouabain (28Vasilets L.A. Takeda K. Kawamura M. Schwarz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The current generated by the heterologously expressed rat Na,K-ATPase can be readily dissociated from the endogenous pump, since the latter is rather insensitive for ouabain (33Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is due to two charged amino acids present in the first extracellular loop of the rat (recombinant) Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, whereas two neutral amino acids are present on this position in the X. laevis α-subunit (33Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The specific rat Na,K-ATPase current is therefore defined as the difference in K+-stimulated current measured in the presence of 10 μm and 10 mm ouabain. Injection of the β-subunit alone increased the ouabain-sensitive endogenous pump current, but injection of only the α-subunit could hardly increase the ouabain-insensitive current of the heterologously expressed construct (data not shown). This observation is compatible with the data of Geering and co-workers (34Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Hauptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that the endogenous β-subunit is the limiting factor for expression of the endogenous sodium pump. After the injections, the oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 16 °C in modified Ringer's solution. Preceding electrophysiological experiments, intracellular Na+ was elevated by incubation of the oocytes for about 40 min at room temperature in 110 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm sodium citrate, and 10 mm MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMBSSMES-buffered saline./Tris, pH 7.4, as described (24Rakowski R.F. Vasilets L.A. Latona J. Schwarz W. J. Membrane Biol. 1991; 121: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After the Na+ loading, oocytes were kept in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, and 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, for at least 30 min before being used in an experiment (24Rakowski R.F. Vasilets L.A. Latona J. Schwarz W. J. Membrane Biol. 1991; 121: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid MES-buffered saline. Isolation of Total and Plasma Membranes—For the isolation of total membranes, 10 oocytes were homogenized in 100 μl of buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.0)) and centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g and 4 °C. Next, membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant for 30 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. The isolation of plasma membranes was done according to Kamsteeg and Deen (35Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Essentially, oocytes were stripped from their follicle membrane and rotated in 1% colloidal silica, Ludox Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) in MES-buffered saline (MBSS; 20 mm MES, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed two times in MBSS, rotated in 0.1% polyacrylic acid (Sigma) in MBSS for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed twice in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, and 0.41 mm CaCl2). Subsequently, oocytes were homogenized in 1200 μl of HbA (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm sucrose) at 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 s at 10 × g and 4 °C, after which the top 1000 μl was removed and 1000 μl of HbA was added. This centrifugation and exchange of HbA was repeated three times (10, 20, and 40 × g). After the last centrifugation step, HbA was removed, and the plasma membranes were spun down for 30 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. The samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on SDS gels containing 10% acrylamide according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), and blotted on Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The α-subunits of Na,K-ATPase were detected with the polyclonal antibody C356-M09. This antibody was generated by immunization of a rabbit with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the Na,K-ATPase N-terminal sequence LKKEVSMDDHKLSLDELHRKYGTDLSRGLT. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were essentially performed as described by Geibel et al. (29Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 90 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, and 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4. The different K+ containing solutions were obtained by replacing NaCl by KCl. All solutions additionally contained 10 μm or 10 mm ouabain. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (22-24 °C). Determination of K0.5Values for the Stimulation of Stationary Pump Currents by K+—To determine the apparent K0.5 values for stimulation of Na+/K+ pump current by extracellular [K+], the amplitudes of stationary currents at a certain membrane potential from data as depicted in Fig. 4 were fitted by a Hill equation of the following form,Ip=[K+]n(K0.5n+[K+]n)·Ip,max(Eq. 1) where Ip represents the pump current at a given potential, Ip, max is the saturation value of the current determined from the fit, K0.5 is the half-maximal concentration for extracellular K+, and n is the Hill coefficient. Measurement of Voltage Jump-induced Pre-steady-state Currents under Na+/Na+Exchange Conditions—Transient Na,K-ATPase currents under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions were obtained as the difference between current responses to a specific voltage step in the presence of 10 μm and 10 mm ouabain. The voltage step going from the constant holding potential to a variable testing potential is referred to as “on pulse”; the term “off pulse” denotes the step back from test to holding potential. These resulting transient currents were fit by a monoexponential function starting 5 ms after the voltage jump to exclude artifacts arising from capacitive charging of the oocyte membrane. The reciprocals of the time constants resulting from these fits will be referred to as (apparent) rate constants throughout this work. Accurate determination of rate constants greater than ∼300 s-1 is difficult in voltage clamp experiments on oocytes due to the time constant for the capacitive charging of the cell membrane, which is around 1 ms. The quantity of charge moved during the transient currents was calculated as the time integral of the fitted currents, extrapolated to onset of voltage pulses. Since the rate constants of the transient currents corresponding to “on” voltage pulses to -140 and -160 mV are higher than 300 s-1 (and therefore at least in part biased by residual capacitive charging currents), the charge translocated during “on” voltage pulses is not accurately determined at these potential values (Fig. 7). For data analysis and presentation, pClamp 7 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) were used. In the cation-binding pocket of Na,K-ATPase, the amino acid residues Asn776, Glu779, Asp804, and Asp808 were each replaced by closely related amino acids or alanine residues. Asparagine 776 was replaced by glutamine, aspartic acid, and alanine; glutamic acid 779 was replaced by aspartic acid, glutamine, and alanine; aspartic acids 804 and 808 were replaced by glutamic acid, asparagine, and alanine. These 12 mutants were analyzed in X. laevis oocytes with the two-electrode voltage clamp method. The expression levels in the total membranes and plasma membranes were analyzed by isolating these membrane fractions and comparing the expression levels of the mutants with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2). The expression of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit without the β-subunit seems very low, and it is not present at the plasma membrane. This is due to the degradation of unassembled α-subunit (37Beguin P. Hasler U. Staub O. Geering K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1657-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the total membranes, the expression levels of all mutants are comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme. All enzymes (except the α-subunit alone) are present at the plasma membrane, but the quantities of D804E and D804A seem to be lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The expression of all other mutants is comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme. Functional expression of the wild-type or mutated rat Na,K-ATPase constructs in the plasma membrane of oocytes was determined from the difference in K+-dependent (5 mm) stationary currents measured in presence of 10 μm and 10 mm ouabain. Since the current generated by the heterologously expressed rat Na,K-ATPase is rather insensitive for ouabain (33Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this serves to eliminate the contribution of the endogenous oocyte pump. When the current voltage relation of the wild-type rat Na,K-ATPase was studied, the extracellular addition of 5 mm K+ generated a maximum current at a potential of -20 mV (183 ± 26 nA, n = 18; see Fig. 3). Whereas the ATPase activity of most mutants has been well described (4Jørgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 5Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), little is known about electrogenic transport properties of these mutants. We therefore measured ouabain-sensitive K+-stimulated currents in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments (Fig. 3). At 5 mm K+ and -20 mV holding potential, the stationary currents of mutants N776Q and N776A were comparable with wild-type; mutants N776D, E779Q, E779A, and D808E produced slightly lower currents; and mutants E779D, D804E, and D808N produced significantly lower currents than the wild-type enzyme. In mutants D804N, D804A, and D808A, electrogenic cation transport was severely impaired. The voltage dependence of the stationary currents (I-V curves) of the wild-type rat Na,K-ATPase and the active mutants were investigated at different K+ concentrations. The current in the absence of K+ was subtracted from those in the presence of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5, 5, and 15 mm K+ (Fig. 4) at different membrane potentials (from -160 to +40 mV). Due to the occurrence of time-dependent outward currents of unknown origin at positive potentials and 15 mm K+ stationary Na,K-ATPase, current amplitudes could not reliably be determined under these conditions and are therefore not presented. The currents of the wild-type enzyme increased both with increasing K+ concentrations and the membrane potential. At more positive membrane potentials, the currents decreased again, forming a bell-shaped curve, which was shifted to more positive membrane potentials with increasing K+ concentrations, as expected from other publications (12Sagar A. Rakowski R.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 869-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Lafaire A.V. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 91: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Rakowski R.F. Vasilets L.A. Latona J. Schwarz W. J. Membrane Biol. 1991; 121: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane potential at which the current of a certain mutant is maximal depends on the cation concentrations and has to be interpreted considering the specific affinities for these cation species (see “Discussion”). Most mutants possess a I-V relationship that is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The N776Q and D804E mutants, however, show I-V curves with negative slope at any K+ concentration tested (Fig. 4). Mutant N776D exhibited weaker voltage dependence than the wild-type enzyme at potentials below 0 mV. The apparent K0.5 value for stimulation of Na+/K+ pump current by extracellular K+ was determined from the voltage dependence of stationary currents at different [K+] (see “Materials and Methods”). The (voltage-dependent) K0.5 of the wild-type enzyme had a minimum of 0.8 mm at -40 mV and increased to 1.4 mm (at +40 mV) and 2.3 mm (at -160 mV), respectively (Fig. 5). Some mutants hardly showed pump currents at K+ concentrations below 1.5 mm. These mutants (E779D, E779A, D808E, and D808N) had an elevated apparent K0.5 for K+ (Table I). M"

However, the effect of 2-DG on protein glycosylation and related signal pathways has not been investigated in depth. In HeLa, an HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma line, 2-DG treatment down-regulates human papillomavirus early gene transcription. This down-regulation was also achieved by low glucose supply or hypoxia, suggesting that this is a response commonly modulated by cellular glucose or energy level. We investigated how 2-DG and low glucose affect transcriptional activity. Human papillomavirus gene transcription was only marginally affected by the inhibition of ATP synthesis or the supplementation of pyruvate to 2-DG-treated cells, suggesting that poor ATP generation is involved only to a limited extent. 2-DG treatment also inhibited activation of p21 WAF1 promoter, which is controlled by p53 and/or Sp1. In a reporter assay using p21 WAF1 promoter constructs, 2-DG exerted a strong inhibitory effect on Sp1 activity. DNA binding activity of Sp1 in 2-DG-treated HeLa cells was intact, whereas it was severely impaired in cells incubated in a low glucose medium or in hypoxic condition. Unexpectedly, Sp1 was heavily modified with GlcNAc in 2-DG-treated cells, which is at least partially attributed to the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity. Our results suggest that 2-DG, like low glucose or hypoxic condition, down-regulates Sp1 activity, but through hyper-GlcNAcylation instead of hypo-GlcNAcylation. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG), a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue, blocks glycolysis at the phosphohexose isomerase step and has been frequently used as a glucose starvation mimetic in studies of a wide variety of physiological dysfuctions.

For most tumor cells and some rapidly proliferating cells, poor blood supply would impose an environmental stress such as nutritional starvation and hypoxia, which evidently leads to apoptotic or necrotic death of cells (1Sutherland R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Glucose deprivation-induced ATP depletion stimulates the mitochondrial death pathway cascade, which involves the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release (2Malhotra R.

Also, in glucose-deprived cells, the level of prooxidants, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, increases probably as a result of the metabolic shift to oxidative phosphorylation, and this triggers signal transduction pathways involving the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase that leads to apoptotic cell death (6Blackburn R.V.

Both hypoxia and hypoglycemia induce HIF-1α in most cells in an effort to restore oxygen homeostatsis by stimulating glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis but also induce G1 arrest (8Goda N.

In addition, because glucose is a key source for sugar moieties in glycoproteins, glucose deprivation also blocks the completion of protein modification and thereby affects various aspects of cell physiology and biochemical activities mediated by glycoproteins. Furthermore, accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of proteins misfolded because of poor glycosylation (unfolded protein response or glucose-regulated stress) is known to induce apoptotic cell death and so-called glucose-regulated proteins such as Grp78 and Grp94, probably as a cellular defense response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (reviewed in Ref. 10Amy Lee Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). A variety of glycoprotein linkages have been discovered to form between 13 different sugar molecules and 8 amino acids on proteins (reviewed in Ref. 11Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Among them, three types of protein glycosylations are most widely distributed and well characterized. N-Linked glycosylation is transfer of oligosaccharides to asparagine residues en bloc in endoplasmic reticulum, and O-linked glycosylation is transfer of a small number of glucose, galactose, or N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues in succession during transport through Golgi network. Another form of O-linked protein glycosylation occurs in a variety of proteins including nuclear pore complex proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 12Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and 13Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). These proteins are modified by a single monosaccharide, GlcNAc, at serine or threonine residues. This O-GlcNAc modification (O-GlcNAcylation) is catalyzed by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase; OGT) 1The abbreviations used are: OGTUDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase)2-DG2-deoxyglucoseHPVhuman papillomavirusURRupstream regulatory regionO-GlcNAcaseN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidaseSTZstreptozotocinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRTreverse transcriptionTTFAthenoyltrifluoroacetone.

UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate of this enzyme, is synthesized from glucose via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (15McClain D.A. J. Diabet. Complications. 2002; 16: 72-80Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The availability of UDP-GlcNAc correlates with the glycosylation levels of many intracellular proteins and the transcriptional levels of some genes (16Boehmelt G. Wakeham A. Elia A. Sasaki T.

Because many transcription factors are modified by O-GlcNAc (17Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), it is likely that O-GlcNAcylation of certain transcription factors could regulate gene expression in response to glucose flux.

Cancer. 1998; 76: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene transcription was shown to be suppressed in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and its derivative cells by the treatment of 2-DG, and it was postulated that high glucose availability is indispensable for both high glycolysis rate of cervical cancer cells and the maintenance of the carcinogenic state by continued expression of HPV oncoproteins. However, the molecular mechanism by which 2-DG treatment caused down-regulation of HPV gene expression was not investigated. There might be several different routes through which 2-DG causes repression of HPV gene expression: inhibition of glycolysis and ATP production, interference in protein glycosylation and the resulting endoplasmic reticulum stress, and attenuation of activities of certain transcription factors through alterations in its O-GlcNAcylation level. Transcription of HPV early genes is controlled by a region of HPV DNA called the upstream regulatory region (URR), which contains numerous sequence elements that interact with cellular and viral transcription factors (see Ref. 34Ishiji T. J. Dermatol. 2000; 27: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar for a recent review). Using HPV URR as a model, we investigated how 2-DG and hypoxia affect gene transcription. In our study, not only HPV URR but also p21 WAF1 promoter activities were severely suppressed by 2-DG treatment. Through investigation on the possible regulatory events associated with the glucose-linked modulation of HPV URR and p21 WAF1 transcription, we found that Sp1 activity is inhibited and that its glycosylation status is severely altered by the treatment of 2-DG. Our results suggest that Sp1, through O-GlcNAcylation, functions as a molecular switch that modulates both host and viral gene transcription in response to cellular nutritional status. Our study also suggests that hypoxia and low glucose also affect Sp1 activity but through mechanisms different from that of 2-DG. Cell Culture—Cervical carcinoma cell lines positive for HPV DNA, HeLa (HPV 18), and CaSki (HPV 16); a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line, H460; and a rat cell line, PC12, were all incubated in normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose. All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hypoxic incubation condition was established with an ambient oxygen concentration of 0.01% (using a controlled incubator with CO2/O2 monitoring and CO2/N2 gas sources). For 2-DG treatment, the cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 45 mm 2-DG (Sigma). For low glucose treatment, the cells were incubated in DMEM (without glucose; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm glucose. To measure cellular ATP levels, 2 × 105 HeLa cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and applied to an ATP Somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. The luminescence emitted from the ATP-dependent luciferase reaction was monitored in a luminometer and used as the relative ATP level in test cells. Western Analyses—The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pelleted, and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm PMSF and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After 20 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and supernatant was saved. The protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. 30 or 50 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) in 12.5 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine transfer buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.1% SDS. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) incubated in 5% milk-TBST buffer containing antibody to either p53 (DO-1; Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA), p21 WAF1 (C-19, HRP; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), E2F1 (KH95; Santa Cruz), c-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz), MDM2 (Ab-1; Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), Bax1 (N-20; Santa Cruz), Sp1 (Upstate USA, Charlottesville, VA), O-GlcNAc (RL2; Affinity Bioreagents, Bolden, CO), phosphothreonine (Sigma), or HPV16 E7 or HPV18 E7 protein (both kindly provided by Dr. In Gyu Kim) (35Jeon J.H. Cho S.Y. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kwon J.C. Choi K.H. Kim I.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The filters were washed with TBST buffer and incubated with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using Lumi-LightPLUS (Roche Applied Science). RT-PCR—After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 5 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 1/40 volume of synthesized cDNA was applied to PCR. The cDNAs for all tested genes were amplified using the following sets of primers: 5′-GCGCAGATCTATGGCGCGCTTTGAGG-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTCTTAGGTCCATGCATA-3′ for HPV18 E6; 5′-ATGTTTCAGGACCCACAGGAGCGA-3′ and 5′-TTACAGCTGGGTTTCTCTACGTG-3′ for HPV16 E6; 5′-ATGGAGACAGCATGCGAACGT-3′ and 5′-TTGCTTAACTCCTGCA-3′ for BPV E2; 5′-CGGGCTATCGAACTACAACCA-3′ and 5′-CCCATATTAGAGTAGGCATCAGCAAAG-3′ for OGT; 5′-AAGGCTCCAGAAATGGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GATGGAGACTTGGGCATGAG-3′ for O-GlcNAcase; and 5′-GTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG-3′ for β-actin. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—HeLa cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg/well of pGL2-0.3 plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. J. Y. Lee, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea) by using GeneCarry Transfection reagent (GoodGene, Seoul, Korea). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 45 mm 2-DG for 24 h and lysed. The extracts were applied to luciferase activity by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized based on protein concentrations. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 25 min. After centrifugation, the cells were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cell pellets were incubated in nuclear protein isolation buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. In binding reactions, radiolabeled probe for Sp1 binding from HPV18 URR (AGGGAGTAACCGAAAACGGT) and 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in binding buffer (4 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 22 °C. In supershift experiments, nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody for 30 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of the probe. In competition experiments, a 300-fold higher amount of unlabeled probe was incubated with binding mixture containing radiolabeled probe. The reaction products were resolved in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at 4 °C. The gel was dried and applied to autoradiography. A known Sp1-binding sequence in HPV18 URR (5′-AGGGAGTAACCGAAAACGGT-3′) was used for the DNA probe. The single-stranded oligomers were annealed by incubation in 80 °C for 5 min followed by cooling down slowly to room temperature and labeled by using a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [32P]dGTP (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” Equal amounts of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Sp1 antibody, followed by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times in nuclear protein isolation buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), boiled, and spun down. The supernatants were applied to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Quantitation of the band signals on film (from three independent experiments) was carried out by Gel-Pro analyzer version 3.1 (Media Cybernetics). In Vitro O-GlcNAcase Assay—PC12 cells were collected in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. After homogenization by using 26-gauge needle, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as O-GlcNAcase-rich cytosols. The cell lysate was incubated first with each chemical (STZ, 2-DG, and glucose) for 30 min at room temperature, and then assay buffer (50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 50 mmN-acetyl galactosamine, 2 mmp- nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminide) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 m sodium carbonate. Color development was measured spectophotometrically at 400 nm. To compare O-GlcNAcase activity levels in 2-DG or mock-treated HeLa cells, the cells were lysed in 1/10 volume of the buffer, and 40-μg protein samples were applied to the assay as described above. Repression of HPV Early Gene Expression by 2-DG Treatment, Hypoxia, or Low Glucose Stress in Cervical Carcinoma Cells—Previously, 2-DG treatment was reported to down-regulate HPV early gene expression in HPV18-positive HeLa cells (33Maehama T. Patzelt A. Lengert M. Hutter K.J. Kanazawa K. Hausen H. Rosl F. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results of RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that 45 mm 2-DG caused a marked reduction in the levels of HPV16 E6/E7 transcripts and proteins in HPV16-positive CaSki cells as well (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests that 2-DG acts through modulation on a common factor that plays a critical role in activation of URR of a variety of HPV types. Fig. 1 also shows that HPV gene expression in HeLa cells is down-regulated by hypoxia or low glucose supply (1 mm) as well (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that HPV transcription may be modulated by the cellular energy or glucose level. During a 24-h incubation period, approximately one-fourth of cells in the culture treated with 2-DG or low glucose underwent either apoptotic or necrotic death, and the remaining cells were viable but growth-arrested. Meanwhile, hypoxic cells remained growth-arrested during first 24 h but underwent extensive apoptosis afterward (data not shown). Effect of Inhibition in ATP Generation on HPV Early Gene Expression—In 2-DG-treated cells, the ATP level is severely reduced (33Maehama T. Patzelt A. Lengert M. Hutter K.J. Kanazawa K. Hausen H. Rosl F. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether the reduced ATP level exerts an inhibitory effect on HPV URR was determined by testing whether a direct inhibition of ATP generation down-regulates HPV UPP. HeLa cells were treated with a complex II inhibitor, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA; 100 μm) (5Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), or a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor, sodium azide (NaN3; 1 mm) (36Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.-L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTFA treatment caused a 30% reduction of cellular ATP level (Fig. 2B). 2-DG treatment also caused a 33% reduction. Despite this similar degree of repression in ATP levels, there was no significant reduction in HPV E7 protein level in TTFA-treated cells, whereas it was almost extinct in 2-DG-treated cells (Fig. 2A, lane 4 versus lane 2), and in NaN3-treated cells, where cellular ATP synthesis was almost abolished (7.3% of untreated cells), the HPV E7 level was reduced but still maintained by nearly 40% of that in untreated cells (lane 3). (This is a significantly high level considering a global decrease in cellular protein levels upon NaN3 treatment.) These results suggest that a decrease in ATP synthesis may cause some reduction in HPV gene transcription, but its effect is only marginal. This was confirmed by an RT-PCR experiment, in which the HPV E6 mRNA level in TTFA-treated cells was only moderately reduced (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of 2-DG on HPV gene expression may in a small part be attributed to a low ATP level but for the most part originates from mechanisms not related to ATP status. Effect of 2-DG on p21 WAF1 Promoter Activity—2-DG-induced inhibition of E6/E7 expression caused up-regulation of p53 (Ref. 32Lane M.A. Ingram D.K. Roth G.S. J. Anti-aging Med. 1998; 1: 327-337Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar and Fig. 3, A and B). This is most likely through increased stability of p53 resulting from depletion of E6 protein, which induces ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of p53 (37Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the level of E2F1 protein and its activity as determined by c-Myc expression level were reduced upon 2-DG treatment (Fig. 3A), most likely because of the depletion of E7, which has been shown to activate E2F1 either directly (38Hwang S.G. Lee D. Kim J. Seo T. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2923-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or through inactivation of Rb (39Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the status of these factors is as expected in HeLa cells where E6/E7 proteins were depleted. Similar changes have been induced in HeLa cells where E6/E7 genes were repressed by the expression of BPV E2, which blocks transcription of HPV early promoter (Refs. 40Hwang E.S. Riese D. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 41Hwang E.S. Naeger L.K. DiMaio D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 795-803PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3C). Depletion of E6 and E7 in HeLa cells transduced with BPV E2 lead to an increase in the steady state level of p53 followed by an induction of p21 WAF1, a p53 response gene (Fig. 3C, lane 2). In contrast, the p21 WAF1 was not induced in 2-DG-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). This is not because p53 is transcriptionally inactive because MDM2 and Bax1, other p53 response genes, were up-regulated in parallel to the increase of p53 level (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that certain element(s) present in the upstream of p21 WAF1 gene is not properly responding to p53. This assumption was further supported by the results in Fig. 3 (D and E). Treatment of sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (42Schlake T. Klehr-Wirth D. Yoshida M. Beppu T. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4197-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), induces p21 WAF1 independently of p53 (43Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This indeed is the case in HeLa cells as shown in Fig. 3D (lane 3), but treatment of cells with 2-DG reduced this effect of butyrate (lane 4). Therefore, 2-DG represses a p21 WAF1 promoter activity that is independent of p53. In a separate experiment, doxorubicin treatment of H460 cells, a lung carcinoma line with a wild-type p53, induced p53 and accordingly p21 WAF1 (Fig. 3E, lane 3). However, 2-DG treatment abolished the effect of p53 on p21 WAF1 expression without affecting the level of p53 (lane 4). Therefore, 2-DG represses p53-dependent p21 WAF1 promoter activity as well. Overall, these results suggest that a transcription factor that functions either by itself or in cooperation with p53 in activation of p21 WAF1 promoter is affected by 2-DG treatment. Sp1 Activity Is Repressed by 2-DG Treatment—In addition to p53, Sp1 plays a critical role in activation of p21 WAF1 promoter (44Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In fact, the effect of sodium butyrate on p21 WAF1 transcription is through modulation of the availability of Sp1 to its binding sites within the proximal region of the promoter (43Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are sequence elements in the promoter proximal region of HPV URR that bind with Sp1 and regulate HPV early gene transcription in Sp1-dependent manner (45Gloss B. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5577-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We tested whether Sp1 and the Sp1 sites in p21 WAF1 upstream respond to 2-DG by transfecting HeLa cells with a reporter construct derived from the upstream region of the p21 WAF1 promoter. The plasmid lacks a distal region of p21 WAF1 upstream that contains p53-binding sites but has the"

In TEM-1 and SHV-1, the common class A β-lactamases, alterations at Ser-130 confer resistance to inactivation by the β-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam. By using site-saturation mutagenesis, we sought to determine the amino acid substitutions at Ser-130 in SHV-1 β-lactamase that result in resistance to these inhibitors. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that ampicillin and ampicillin/clavulanic acid resistance was observed only for the S130G β-lactamase expressed in Escherichia coli. Kinetic analysis of the S130G β-lactamase demonstrated a significant elevation in apparent Km and a reduction in kcat/Km for ampicillin. Marked increases in the dissociation constant for the preacylation complex, KI, of clavulanic acid (SHV-1, 0.14 μm; S130G, 46.5 μm) and tazobactam (SHV-1, 0.07 μm; S130G, 4.2 μm) were observed. In contrast, the kinacts of S130G and SHV-1 differed by only 17% for clavulanic acid and 40% for tazobactam. Progressive inactivation studies showed that the inhibitor to enzyme ratios required to inactivate SHV-1 and S130G were similar. Our observations demonstrate that enzymatic activity is preserved despite amino acid substitutions that significantly alter the apparent affinity of the active site for β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors.

These results underscore the mechanistic versatility of class A β-lactamases and have implications for the design of novel β-lactamase inhibitors. β-Lactamase inhibition is an important strategy to combat the escalating problem of β-lactam resistance mediated by bacterial β-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6). Combined with a β-lactam antibiotic, β-lactamase inhibitors preserve and expand the utility of the partner antibiotic and offer a greater spectrum of microbiological activity. At present, three β-lactamase inhibitors are available for clinical use: clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam. Combined with a β-lactam antibiotic (e.g. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, and piperacillin/tazobactam), these inhibitors serve as essential therapeutic agents in the treatment of life-threatening infections (1Gorbach S.L.

Investigations examining clinical isolates, using PCR and site-directed mutagenesis of blaTEM-1 and blaSHV-1, demonstrated that single amino acid substitutions at positions 69 (Met → Ile, Met → Leu, Met → Val), 130 (Ser → Gly), 244 (Arg → Ser, Arg → Cys, Arg → His, and Arg → Gly), 275 (Arg → Leu), and 276 (Asn → Asp) are the primary alterations that confer resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (7Vakulenko S.B.

High resolution atomic structures of the inhibitor resistant β-lactamases have also advanced our understanding of this phenotype. The x-ray structure of the clavulanic acid resistant N276D variant of TEM-1 β-lactamase revealed a significant movement of Asp-276: the substitution of Asp for Asn displaces three helices (helix 1, helix 10, and helix 11) in the TEM structure (10Swaren P. Golemi D. Cabantous S. Bulychev A. Maveyraud L. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9570-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional analysis of the M69L TEM β-lactamase shows that subtle molecular dynamic changes can also lead to resistance to clavulanic acid (11Meroueh S.O. Roblin P. Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Zhang Y. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9422-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most recently, the movement of Ser-130 in the inhibitor resistant TEM-30 (R244S), TEM-32 (M69I/M182T), and TEM-34 (M69V) β-lactamases has been elucidated (12Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is particularly noteworthy that, among the inhibitor-resistant class A β-lactamases, the S130G substitution in TEM and SHV involves the conserved motif Ser-130/Asp-131/Asn-132, the “SDN” loop. Ser-130 and Asn-132 are hydrogen-bonded to the catalytically important Lys-73 in the active site. This observation challenged our understanding of the role of Gly at the 130 position in inhibitor-resistant variants of the SHV and TEM β-lactamases (e.g. SHV-10 and TEM-59) (5Prinarakis E.E. Miriagou V. Tzelepi E. Gazouli M. Tzouvelekis L.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 838-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bermudes H. Jude F. Chaibi E.B. Arpin C. Bebear C. Labia R. Quentin C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exploring the consequences of amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, we show that the apparent affinity of the active site is greatly reduced for substrates and inhibitors. In contrast, S130G and SHV-1 β-lactamases are inactivated at nearly the same rate. Our hypothesis, based on a molecular model, is that movement of a catalytic water molecule may potentially serve the same role as the hydroxyl group of Ser-130 in substrate binding and catalysis. These results have implications for the future design of β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors.

Plasmid DNA was obtained from Epicurean coli™ XL1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen) cells using Wizard™ Purification kits (Promega, Madison, WI).

Determination of Steady-state Expression Using an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—By using a polyclonal anti-SHV antibody, a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was employed to assess steady-state expression levels (16Hujer A.M.

The ELISA plates were read at λ = 492 nm and OD values of the samples were compared with an internal standard curve using the SHV-1 β-lactamase. β-Lactamase Purification—SHV-1, S130G, and S130T β-lactamases were purified to homogeneity from E. coli DH10B cells according to a method employing preparative isoelectric focusing (8Hujer A.M.

Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Fisher) to visualize β-lactamases. Protein concentrations were determined with Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetics—Kinetic constants of the SHV-1, S130G and S130T β-lactamases were determined by continuous assays at room temperature, 25 °C, using an Agilent™ 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Each experiment was performed in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Measurements were obtained using ampicillin (Δϵ235 = –900 M–1cm–1), piperacillin (Δϵ232 = –5300 M–1 cm–1), cephalothin (Δϵ262 = –7660 M–1 cm–1), and nitrocefin (Δϵ 482 = 17400 M–1 cm–1) (BD Biosciences). The kinetic experiments and analyses were patterned after the methods of Imtiaz et al. (17Imtiaz U. Billings E.M. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and will be described briefly below. The kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, were obtained with non-linear least squares fit of the data (Michaelis-Menten equation) using Enzfitter™ (Sigma):v=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) A direct competition assay was performed to determine the dissociation constant for the preacylation complex, KI, of the inhibitors (clavulanic acid and tazobactam). We used a final concentration of 100 μm nitrocefin as the indicator substrate and 7 nm SHV-1 β-lactamase or 31 nm S130G β-lactamase in these determinations. The data were analyzed according to Equation 2 to account for the affinity of nitrocefin for the SHV-1 β-lactamase:KI=KIapp/(1+[S]/(Kmnitrocefin)(Eq. 2) The first-order rate constant for enzyme and inhibitor complex being inactivated, kinact was measured directly by monitoring the reaction time courses in the presence of inactivators. A fixed concentration of enzyme, nitrocefin, and increasing nm concentrations of inactivator, I, were used in each assay. The kobs for inactivation was determined graphically as the reciprocal of the ordinate of the intersection of the straight lines obtained from the initial, v0, and final, vf, steady-state velocities. The kobs was calculated from the relationship kobs = 1/t. Each kobs was plotted versus I and fit to Equation 3 to determine kinact:kobs=kinact[I]/(KI+[I])(Eq. 3) The second-order rate constant, kinact /KI (the rate constant for reaction of free enzyme with free inhibitor to give inactive enzyme) was determined by the fit of kobs to Equation 3. The partitioning of the initial enzyme inhibitor complex between hydrolysis and enzyme inactivation, i.e. the turnover number (tn = kcat/kinact) was obtained in the following manner. First, we incubated increasing amounts of inhibitor (clavulanic acid or tazobactam) with a fixed concentration of SHV-1 or S130G β-lactamase in a total volume of 100 μl of 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature. After 24 h, an aliquot (10 μl) was removed from the mixture and the steady-state velocity was measured and compared with a control sample with no inhibitor added. The proportion of clavulanic acid or tazobactam relative to SHV-1 or S130G that resulted in 90% inactivation after 24 h was used to determine the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme in a 90-min experiment. We reacted 1.6 μm SHV-1 and 25 μm S130G with 60 μm and 1 mm clavulanic acid, respectively, in a final volume of 200 μl. Similarly, we reacted 1.6 μm SHV-1 and 25 μm S130G with 7.75 μm and 125 μm of tazobactam, respectively. From these mixtures, a set aliquot was removed at designated time points, and steady-state velocities were measured. The contributions of amino acid substitutions to the relative change in Gibbs free energy of the transition state with substrates and inhibitors were determined by using Equations 4 and 5 (18Lin S.

Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Site-saturation and site-directed mutagenesis to obtain all 19 amino acid substitutions at the 130 position in SHV-1 was successfully performed, and the most common codons used were selected (8Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of each mutant blaSHV was first determined in E. coli™ XL1 Blue cells and confirmed in E. coli DH10B cells. Antibiotic Susceptibility—The effects of each amino acid substitution at the 130 position in the SHV β-lactamase expressed in E. coli DH10B are summarized in Table I (also Fig. 1 and Table I in “Supplemental Material”). Only the S130G and S130T β-lactamases expressed in E. coli were ampicillin resistant (MICs ≥ 32 μg/ml). Resistance to ampicillin/clavulanic acid was demonstrated by the E. coli DH10B strain with the S130G β-lactamase. None of the variant β-lactamases expressed in E. coli conferred more resistance than SHV-1 against ampicillin/tazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam.Table IMICS (μg/ml) for representative antibiotics against E. coli DH10B with SHV-1, S130G, S130T, and S130X β-lactamasesAntibioticSHV-1S130GS130TS130XaX, other amino acid substitutions.Ampicillin1600025032<8.0Piperacillin20002000250≤64Ampicillin/clavulanic acid50/450/1650/0.06≤50/0.06Piperacillin/tazobactam250/32250/32250/32≤64/8a X, other amino acid substitutions. Open table in a new tab β-Lactamase Expression Levels—To investigate whether increased relative amounts of β-lactamase produced were responsible for the observed MICs, we assayed β-lactamase expression levels in the constructs using a polyclonal antibody in an ELISA format (16Hujer A.M.

Except for S130D, all variants produced less β-lactamase than the wild-type enzyme, particularly the S130G β-lactamase (11% relative to SHV-1 β-lactamase). Hence, increased quantities of S130G enzyme were not responsible for the resistance to ampicillin/clavulanic acid. Kinetic Parameters of SHV-1 and S130G β-Lactamases—The steady-state kinetic parameters are reported in Table II. Large increases in Km were demonstrated by S130G β-lactamase for nitrocefin (700 μm, 140-fold increase). For the S130G β-lactamase the kcat values were reduced for ampicillin and nitrocefin. The kcat/Km ratios clearly show that the S130G mutation markedly reduced catalytic efficiency. Compared with SHV-1 β-lactamase, S130G is 3.6% as efficient catalyzing ampicillin and 0.14% as efficient hydrolyzing nitrocefin (Table III).Table IIKinetic parametersKmkcatkcat/KmSHV-1S130GS130TSHV-1S130GS130TSHV-1S130GS130Tμms-1μm-1 s-1Ampicillin124 ± 27290 ± 53NDaND, not determined; NM, not measurable.2417 ± 214200 ± 13ND19.5 ± 2.50.7 ± 0.16NDNitrocefin5 ± 0.9700 ± 788 ± 2142 ± 430 ± 0.2155 ± 828.4 ± 4.30.04 ± 0.0011.8 ± 0.05Piperacillin91 ± 1089 ± 5ND86 ± 162 ± 1.4ND0.95 ± 0.090.7 ± 0.02NDCephaloridine53 ± 10NM73 ± 7150 ± 13NM444 ± 172.83 ± 0.28ND6.1 ± 0.9a ND, not determined; NM, not measurable.

For tazobactam, the difference in KI was also significantly elevated (KI = 0.07 μm for SHV-1 versus 4.2 μm for S130G; 60-fold increase). The difference in first-order rate constants for inactivation, kinacts, was within 17% for clavulanic acid and 40% for tazobactam (Table IV). The second-order rate constants, kinact/KI, demonstrate a larger difference between SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamase, the increase in KI being responsible for this.Table IVInhibitor kineticsClavulanic acidTazobactamKIaDeterminations within 25%.kinactbDeterminations within 7%.kinact/KItnkcatKIaDeterminations within 25%.kinactbDeterminations within 7%.kinact/KItnkcatμms-1s-1 μm-1s-1μms-1s-1 μm-1s-1SHV-10.140.0300.21401.20.070.11.450.5S130G46.50.02500.0005401.04.20.060.01450.3a Determinations within 25%.b Determinations within 7%. Open table in a new tab In the time-dependent inactivation experiments, the ratio of I/E required to reduce activity by 90% (tn) was equal for SHV-1 and S130G at 24 h (clavulanic acid, 40/1; tazobactam, 5/1). At 20 min, the period corresponding to the dividing time of E. coli, the activity of S130G was reduced 55% by clavulanic acid; SHV-1 β-lactamase activity was reduced > 90% (Fig. 2). In contrast, by 15 min, SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases were inactivated > 80% by tazobactam. The kcats indicate that both SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases hydrolyze clavulanic acid and tazobactam (Table IV). Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling calculations indicate that the S130G β-lactamase is not significantly different in overall energy when compared with SHV-1, despite the loss of a key H-bonding residue in the active site. We do not observe other side chains close enough to assume the role of Ser-130 (22Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the catalytic water moves 2.37 Å nearer to the Lys-73:HZ2 atom. Additionally, there is movement of the important Lys-73 residue (0.5 Å for 73: HZ2) toward the catalytic Ser-70. The changes in active-site relationships as a result of the S130G substitution are shown in Fig. 3. These data show that the S130G amino acid substitution is essential for resistance to ampicillin/clavulanic acid in SHV β-lactamase. The major effect of the S130G mutation on apparent Km and KI emphasizes the precise topological role of this amino acid (17Imtiaz U. Billings E.M. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A direct consequence of the Ser → Gly substitution is reflected by the amount of S130G versus SHV-1 inhibited in 20 min, the time required for E. coli cell division. The time-dependent inactivation of S130G by tazobactam occurred more rapidly than with clavulanic acid. The magnitude of the KI elevation combined with the rates of inactivation for tazobactam was not enough to result in an elevation of ampicillin/tazobactam (data not shown) or piperacillin/tazobactam MICs. This has been noted previously with laboratory isolates that produce larger amounts of β-lactamase than clinical strains. In addition to these findings, two important observations of the kinetic behavior of SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases with clavulanic acid and tazobactam deserve emphasis: S130G and SHV-1 β-lactamases are inactivated by clavulanic acid at similar rates, and hydrolysis rates are comparable. Analogous results were obtained with tazobactam. These data indicate that the S130G β-lactamase, as a clinically important β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor-resistant enzyme, maintains the fundamental hydrolytic mechanism common to all β-lactamases (12Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From our model (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that an active-site water molecule may relocate to a region nearer to the Lys-73 residue. The water molecule may also function with Lys-73 in a coordinated proton shuttle and may substitute for the Ser-130 in protonating the β-lactam nitrogen (26Imtiaz U. Billings E.M. Knox J.R. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5728-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Raquet X. Dubus A. Monnaie D. Knox J.R. Frere J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structures of the inhibitor resistant TEM-30 (R244S) and TEM-84 (N276D), the relocation of a conserved water plays a crucial role in the binding affinity of inhibitors (10Swaren P. Golemi D. Cabantous S. Bulychev A. Maveyraud L. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9570-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The molecular modeling studies of the E166N amino acid substitution of TEM-1 β-lactamase revealed the movement of a catalytic water molecule was essential in modification of the substrate profile (28Guillaume G. Vanhove M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Ledent P. Jamin M. Joris B. Frere J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, movement of a water molecule in the active site of S130G may be an important process that preserves catalytic activity. The mechanism by which S130G is inhibited by clavulanic acid or tazobactam challenges our understanding of the catalytic pathway to inactivation. By using the x-ray structure of SHV-1 inhibited by tazobactam as a guide, we hypothesize that after acylation of S130G by clavulanic acid 1, the reactive imine 2 is formed (Fig. 4). The imine rearranges to form the cis- and trans-enamine 3, 4. This stable intermediate could account for the inhibition observed in our experiments and would occur in both the variant and wild-type enzymes. The absence of the side chain of Ser-130 would deprive this enzyme of the hydroxyl group that acts as the necessary nucleophile required in the final irreversible inactivation step (6Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, formation of the cross-linking or bridging species (vinyl ether), and the Ser-130 bound carboxylic acid moiety would not be possible in the S130G β-lactamase. However, nucleophilic attack by an active-site water molecule could yield the aldehyde 5 or hydrate aldehyde 6. This also may also lead to inhibition. Lastly, the aldehyde 5 or hydrate aldehyde 6 could undergo hydrolysis and regenerate the active enzyme 7 (22Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the imine 2 could be directly hydrolyzed to yield the aldehyde 5 and hydrate aldehyde 6. This pathway is entirely consistent with that proposed for the inhibitor-resistant TEM-33 (M69L) and N276D-substituted enzymes (10Swaren P. Golemi D. Cabantous S. Bulychev A. Maveyraud L. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9570-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Meroueh S.O. Roblin P. Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Zhang Y. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9422-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our kinetic data for tazobactam and clavulanic acid suggest that the rate that each intermediate is formed and the number of branch points differ for each inhibitor. Experiments are in progress attempting to define the predominate pathway for clavulanic acid and tazobactam in inhibitor-resistant SHV enzymes. The design of future β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitors should take into account that alterations in the oxyanion hole and free movement of water molecules in the active site will permit more than one pathway to catalysis and inhibition. A deeper appreciation of these alternative mechanisms may avert the unwelcome emergence of even more resistant β-lactam bacteria because of excessive β-lactam use.

A heterogeneous mixture of products was obtained, and it was not established whether the covalent bond formation was catalyzed or spontaneous. Here, we show that coexpression from plasmids of a variant of cytochrome b562 containing a CXXCH heme-binding motif with the E. coli cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) proteins results in an essentially homogeneous product that is a correctly matured c-type cytochrome. Formation of the holocytochrome was accompanied by substantial production of its apo form, in which, for the protein as isolated, there is a disulfide bond between the two cysteines in the CXXCH motif. Following addition of heme to reduced CXXCH apoprotein, spontaneous covalent addition of heme to polypeptide occurred in vitro. Strikingly, the spectral properties were very similar to those of the material obtained from cells in which presumed uncatalyzed addition of heme (i.e. in the absence of Ccm) had been observed. The major product from uncatalyzed heme attachment was an incorrectly matured cytochrome with the heme rotated by 180° relative to its normal orientation. The contrast between Ccm-dependent and Ccm-independent covalent attachment of heme indicates that the Ccm apparatus presents heme to the protein only in the orientation that results in formation of the correct product and also that heme does not become covalently attached to the apocytochrome b562 CXXCH variant without being handled by the Ccm system in the periplasm. The CXXCH variant of cytochrome b562 was also expressed in E. coli strains deficient in the periplasmic reductant DsbD or oxidant DsbA. In the DsbA- strain under aerobic conditions, c-type cytochromes were made abundantly and correctly when the Ccm proteins were expressed. This contrasts with previous reports indicating that DsbA is essential for cytochrome c biogenesis in E. coli.

The contrast between Ccm-dependent and Ccm-independent covalent attachment of heme indicates that the Ccm apparatus presents heme to the protein only in the orientation that results in formation of the correct product and also that heme does not become covalently attached to the apocytochrome b562 CXXCH variant without being handled by the Ccm system in the periplasm. The CXXCH variant of cytochrome b562 was also expressed in E. coli strains deficient in the periplasmic reductant DsbD or oxidant DsbA. In the DsbA- strain under aerobic conditions, c-type cytochromes were made abundantly and correctly when the Ccm proteins were expressed. This contrasts with previous reports indicating that DsbA is essential for cytochrome c biogenesis in E. coli. Cytochrome b562 is a hemoprotein expressed in the periplasm of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (1Itagaki E. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3687-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is the only b-type cytochrome (a complex of protein and heme in which the heme is not attached covalently to the polypeptide) known to occur naturally in that compartment of the E. coli cell. Cytochrome b562 has a four α-helix bundle structure (2Hamada K. Bethge P.H. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The other periplasmic cytochromes in E. coli are of the c-type, i.e. they contain heme covalently attached to polypeptide through thioether bonds between the vinyl groups of heme and the cysteine sulfurs of a CXXCH peptide motif (6Thöny-Meyer L.

A disulfide bond is commonly thought to form between the cysteines of the c-type cytochrome CXXCH heme-binding motif, and this has been shown to occur in vitro in the apoproteins of several monoheme cytochromes c (12Daltrop O.

The Dsb and Ccm systems are believed to work in series during cytochrome c biogenesis such that as the unfolded apocytochrome is exported to the periplasm, it is first oxidized by DsbA (whose oxidant is DsbB). The apocytochrome disulfide bond must be reduced before heme can be attached, and this reduction is achieved by CcmG and/or CcmH, which is, in turn, reduced by the transmembrane protein DsbD, whose electron donor is TrxA (Refs. 14Metheringham R.

It has been shown that E. coli cytochrome b562 can be altered by site-directed mutagenesis such that it will form c-type cytochromes in the periplasm (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In cytochrome b562, a histidine at position 102 is the proximal ligand to the heme iron; an analogous histidine is a virtually universal feature of both b-and c-type cytochromes. Barker et al. (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) constructed R98C, Y101C, and R98C/Y101C variants of b562, resulting in CXXXH, XXXCH, and CXXCH heme-binding motifs respectively. Each of these proteins could be detected in the periplasm of E. coli as covalent complexes of apoprotein and heme. The R98C/Y101C variant did not form as a homogeneous c-type cytochrome product, but rather as two major and two minor products. From these studies, it was unclear whether the covalent attachment of heme was catalyzed or spontaneous. For each variant, large amounts of apoprotein were also detected (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When those previous experiments (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were conducted, little was known about the cytochrome c biogenesis apparatus used by E. coli. Subsequent work identified the Ccm system (CcmABCDEFGH) (17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 18Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is expressed physiologically only under certain anaerobic growth conditions. However, these gene products, overexpressed constitutively from a plasmid lacking anaerobic control elements, are now widely used for overproduction of c-type cytochromes when coexpressed with a cytochrome c gene (17Arslan E.

The Ccm apparatus has been shown to process cytochromes c from diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins (e.g. Refs. 17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar and 19Sanders C. Lill H. Biochim. Biophys.

In light of these recent data, we have investigated the action of the Ccm system on the R98C/Y101C (CXXCH) variant of E. coli cytochrome b562. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the Ccm system in conjunction with an “artificial” cytochrome c. Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of mutations in the Dsb system with respect to production of this cytochrome in the E. coli periplasm. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—E. coli strain JCB387 (22Hussain H. Grove J. Griffiths L. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Micro. 1994; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used in all experiments unless stated. Other E. coli strains used had mutations in the genes for the periplasmic disulfideoxidizing and disulfide-reducing proteins DsbA and DsbD; these strains were JCB3510 (dsbA-) (23Metheringham R. Griffiths L. Crooke H. Forsythe S. Cole J. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), JCB571 (dsbA-) (24Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and JCB606 (dsbD-) (14Metheringham R. Tyson K.L. Crooke H. Missiakas D. Raina S. Cole J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 95-102PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sambongi Y. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Note that JCB387, JCB606, and JCB3510 are isogenic; all were the kind gift of Professor Jeff Cole (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom). JCB571 was the gift of Professor James Bardwell (University of Michigan). Plasmids for wild-type E. coli cytochrome b562 and the R98C/Y101C (CXXCH heme-binding motif) variant were as described (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmid pKPD1, encoding the gene for Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c550, was as described by Sambongi and Ferguson (26Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As required, cells were also transformed with plasmid pEC86 (17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), encoding the E. coli ccm genes (ccmABCDEFGH). Transformants were initially grown on LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin in each case plus 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol when pEC86 was cotransformed and 25 μg/ml kanamycin for the dsbA- strains). Single colonies were picked into 500 ml of 2× TY medium containing 16 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in 2.5-liter flasks. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 20–24 h before harvesting. Cell Fractionation and Biochemical Methods—Periplasmic fractions were obtained from cells using the procedures described previously (27Allen J.W.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33559-33563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cytochrome content was determined by recording the absorption spectra of the crude or purified periplasmic fractions. E. coli produces small amounts of endogenous c-type cytochromes in the periplasm under our growth conditions (see, for example, Ref. 27Allen J.W.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33559-33563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To provide reference data to correct for the level of this background cytochrome expression, E. coli JCB387 cells were transformed and grown with pTZ19r (an ampicillin resistance-conferring cloning vector; Fermentas) and pEC86. These cells were fractionated, and the absorbances of the periplasmic fractions (normalized in relation to volume and wet cell weight and averaged from several cultures) were taken to represent “typical” endogenous (background) cytochrome expression levels. This cytochrome yield cannot be expressed directly because it represents a mixture of components with different (and in some cases, undetermined) extinction coefficients. However, the endogenous cytochrome production can be expressed in terms of absorbance (which is directly proportional to the concentrations of the species present). The absorbance of the periplasmic fraction from such cells (prepared using our routine growth and fractionation procedures) was 0.026 A units (mean average for the maximum at 418 nm, S.D. of 0.004 A units)/g of cells (wet weight). When yields of periplasmic exogenous cytochromes are expressed in this work, this endogenous cytochrome absorbance has been subtracted from the actual observed absorbance to determine the expression level. Apo- and holocytochromes b562 R98C/Y101C were purified on a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences XK26/20 with a resin bed volume of 70 ml). Chromatography was conducted at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 9 ml/min, and 7-ml fractions were collected. Apocytochrome b562 R98C/Y101C clearly separated from the holocytochrome following this chromatographic step. Apocytochrome-containing fractions were identified from their absorption spectra following addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) and heme and were nearly pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The spectrophotometrically purest holocytochrome fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (XK26/20), which was eluted with a 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer and under the same conditions. After this step, holocytochrome b562 R98C/Y101C was essentially pure. Wild-type cytochrome b562 was purified using a protocol modified from that of Nikkila et al. (28Nikkila H. Gennis R.B. Sligar S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crude periplasmic extract from fractionated E. coli cells containing the cytochrome was taken to pH 4.55 with concentrated phosphoric acid, stirred on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The cytochrome-containing solution was then adjusted to pH 8.0 and purified on DEAE-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns as described above for the R98C/Y101C variant. Wild-type apocytochrome b562 was prepared by extraction of heme from the holoprotein with imidazole using the procedure described by Tomlinson and Ferguson (29Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hemin (Fe-protoporphyrin IX-Cl) was added to protein solutions from a stock solution in Me2SO. NMR spectra were collected as described previously (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Rice J.K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13627-13635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer or a Bruker Avance 700 spectrometer. The NMR methods used with the different instruments were similar, except that WATERGATE sequences were used on the 700-MHz instrument to remove the residual water signal. All spectra were acquired at 300 K. Data processing was as described previously (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Rice J.K. Fearnley I.M. Barker P.D.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13627-13635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), except that it was performed using XWINNMR (Bruker). All samples were between 0.4 and 1 mm protein in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer in D2O, pH* 6.6, and 0.5 m KCl. Where appropriate, the proteins were reduced by addition of sodium dithionite to ∼5 mm from anaerobic stock solutions in the same buffer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass Bio-Q II-2S triple quadrupole atmospheric pressure instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Samples were introduced via a loop injector as a solution (20 pmol/μl in 1:1 water/acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Data were analyzed using the maximum entropy-based component of the MassLynx suite of software (Micromass) (32Rai D.K. Griffiths W.J. Landin B. Wild B.J. Alvelius G. Green B.N. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1978-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) was used according to Riddles et al. (33Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Formation of the R98C/Y101C Variant of E. coli Cytochrome b562with and without Expression of the Ccm Proteins—E. coli strain JCB387 was transformed with a plasmid encoding the R98C/Y101C variant of cytochrome b562 (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which has the CXXCH heme-binding motif that is the general characteristic of cytochromes c. This construct includes the natural signal sequence of cytochrome b562, which directs the apoprotein to the periplasm, where both wild-type b562 and all Gram-negative bacterial cytochromes c are naturally assembled. Cells were cotransformed with plasmid pEC86, which encodes the E. coli ccm genes (17Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). They were grown aerobically (which represses expression of the endogenous E. coli Ccm proteins and also production of the endogenous c-type cytochromes) (34Iobbi-Nivol C. Crooke H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Hussain H. Pommier J. Mejean V. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and periplasmic fractions were prepared. The absorption spectrum of the dithionite-treated periplasmic extract from these cells had resolved peaks characteristic of a low spin, six-coordinate cytochrome. The absorbance in the Soret band region (normalized in relation to fraction volume and wet cell weight), was 5–30-fold in excess of that in control (background expression) experiments (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of these controls). The α-band of the dominant observed cytochrome was at 556 nm (Fig. 1 and Table I). This value is red-shifted relative to most cytochromes c (e.g. Refs. 35Pettigrew G.W. Moore G R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar and 36Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar), but is blue-shifted by 6 nm relative to the α-band observed for wild-type cytochrome b562 at 562 nm. Such a shift to higher energy is consistent with saturation of the heme vinyl groups and hence covalent attachment of heme to polypeptide. Cytochrome c556, which shares the same fold and heme coordination as cytochrome b562, but is a natural c-type cytochrome (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Moore G.R. McClune G.J. Clayden N.J. Williams R.J.P. Alsaadi B.M. Angstrom J. Ambler R.P. van Beeumen J. Tempst P. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Kamen M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123 (R. J. P.): 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), also has its α-band at 556 nm. The other main absorption peaks in the spectrum of the dithionite-reduced periplasmic extract from cells expressing b562 R98C/Y101C in the presence of the Ccm proteins were at 526 and 421 nm (Fig. 1 and Table I). Treatment of an aliquot of a cytochrome with an alkaline pyridine solution and dithionite produces a spectrum that is highly characteristic of the nature of attachment of heme to protein (38Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the present case, the α-band of such a spectrum of the pyridine- and hydroxide-treated crude periplasmic extract was at 550 nm (Fig. 1, inset), the wavelength expected for covalent attachment of heme to protein through two thioether linkages to a CXXCH peptide motif, as found in a typical cytochrome c.Table IWavelengths of the main peaks in the absorption and pyridine hemochrome spectra of cytochromes produced in this work Values for samples from in vivo experiments were averaged over several repetitions of the experiment and rounded to the nearest 0.5 nm to account for small differences between samples and inaccuracies in the spectrophotometer.

Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab To assess the homogeneity of the product, cytochrome-containing fractions were purified from the crude periplasmic extract of cells that had expressed b562 R98C/Y101C in the presence of the Ccm proteins. The periplasmic extract was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose column (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Cytochrome-containing fractions (identified by their red color) eluted in a continuum that consisted of three parts upon spectral analysis. The first group of these fractions had absorption and pyridine hemochrome maxima characteristic of c-type cytochromes and similar to those expected for the endogenous soluble E. coli cytochrome c NrfA (39Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The second and clearly spectroscopically dominant group was the c-type cytochrome form of b562 R98C/Y101C, with its α-band absorption maximum at 556 nm and its pyridine hemochrome α-band maximum at 550 nm. The third (small) set of fractions contained a mixture of at least two species, one of which was the b562 R98C/Y101C c-type cytochrome. The absorption spectra of these later fractions were red-shifted by 1–1.5 nm, and the pyridine hemochrome spectra were red-shifted by up to 1 nm relative to the uncontaminated b562 R98C/Y101C c-type cytochrome fractions. Thus, in addition to the major b562 R98C/Y101C c-type cytochrome product, these fractions may contain some malformed (e.g. single cysteine-attached) cytochrome c and/or some b-type cytochrome from lysed cytoplasm contaminating the periplasmic cell extract, either of which would have the observed effect on the spectra. Quantitatively, our chromatographic analysis showed that at least 95% of the holocytochrome b562 R98C/Y101C produced in the presence of the Ccm proteins was in the major cytochrome-containing band (i.e. in the second group of fractions) and thus was a c-type cytochrome with spectra wholly characteristic of covalent attachment of heme to protein through two thioether bonds.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) purified “component II” of the mixture of two major and two minor products that was observed when b562 R98C/Y101C was expressed in the periplasm of E. coli under different growth conditions and with little control over the expression of the Ccm system, which had not then been identified. The purified holocytochrome was studied by NMR spectroscopy; it was shown to be homogeneous, and the heme was attached covalently to the cytochrome with the same stereochemistry as observed for all naturally occurring cytochromes c (7Barker P.D.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because the absorption spectra of component II are essentially identical to those observed in the present work for cytochrome b562 R98C/Y101C produced in the presence of the Ccm proteins, we have also analyzed the Ccm-matured holocytochrome by NMR. The main cytochrome species (accounting for >95% of the total holocytochrome b562 R98C/Y101C produced (see above)) was further purified to remove any noncytochrome contaminants. It was found by NMR to be homogeneous (i.e. a single cytochrome species) and identical in both the oxidized and reduced states to component II from the earlier work (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P. Freund S.M.V. Fearnley I.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15191-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and thus a properly matured c-type cytochrome. The chemical shifts of the heme, aromatic, and distal methionine heme ligand protons were within 0.01 ppm of those previously reported (see Supplemental Figs. S1–S3 for the NMR data). We therefore conclude that component II was holocytochrome matured by the Ccm system operating at a background level under the growth conditions that were used earlier (16Barker P.D. Nerou E.P.

The molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) regulates p56lck-dependent activation of NFκB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and modulates the expression of downstream genes that are involved in cell migration in human breast cancer cells are not well defined. In this paper, we investigated the involvement of protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck in the redox-regulated activation of NFκB following H/R in highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that H/R induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck, nuclear translocation of NFκB, NFκB-DNA binding, and transactivation of NFκB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. Transfection of these cells with wild type Lck but not with mutant Lck F394 followed by H/R induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (IκBα) and transcriptional activation of NFκB, and these are inhibited by Lck inhibitors. In vitro kinase assay demonstrated that immunoprecipitated p56lck but not Lyn or Fyn directly phosphorylate IκBα in presence of H/R. Pervanadate, H2O2, and H/R induce the interaction between Lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα, and this interaction is inhibited by Src homology 2 domain inhibitory peptide, suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα interacts with Src homology 2 domain of Lck. Luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that Lck induces NFκB-dependent urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter activity in presence of H/R. Furthermore, H/R stimulates the cell motility through secretion of uPA. To our knowledge, this is the first report that p56lck in presence of H/R regulates NFκB activation, uPA secretion, and cell motility through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and further demonstrates an important redox-regulated pathway for NFκB activation following H/R injury that is independent of IκB kinase/IκBα-mediated signaling pathways.

Tumor invasion, malignant progression, and distant metastasis depend on complex multistep processes. One prerequisite is the ability of tumor cells to initiate extracellular proteolysis, which is required for the crossing of tissue barriers, cell migration, extracellular matrix invasion, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. There is abundant experimental evidence that urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: uPAurokinase type plasminogen activatoruPARurokinase type plasminogen activator receptorLcklymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinaseH/Rhypoxia/reoxygenationFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateNFκBnuclear factor κBIκBαinhibitor of nuclear factor κBLucluciferasepVpervanadateIKKIκB kinaseTNFαtumor necrosis factor αEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatepp24-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidineemodin6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinoneTPtyrosine phosphataseSH2Src homology 2. a member of serine protease plays a major role in malignant progression and tumor metastasis (1Andreasen P.A.

Up-regulations of uPA and urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) have been described in many human tumors. High levels of uPA and uPAR in tumor tissues are associated with poor prognosis of patients with cancer of the breast, lung, head and neck, uterine, cervix, bladder, and ovary (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Onco. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar). Most tumors are characterized by low extracellular pH, glucose depletion, high lactate levels, and regions with low oxygen tensions (3Vaupel P. Kallinowski F. Okunieff P.

Lck, a member of the Src family non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, is mostly expressed in T cells and some B cells. Lck is also expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines (13Koster A.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Lck binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 and CD8 and plays an essential role in T cell activation and development (15Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl.

Lck is required for T cell receptor signaling in human Jurkat T cells and for antigen receptor-dependent cytolytic effector function in the CTLL-2 T cells (17Straus D.B. Weiss A.

Moreover, mice lacking expression of functional Lck or overexpressing an inactive form of Lck have severely disrupted thymocyte development (19Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. VanEwijk W.

Purlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Lck is a typical Src-like tyrosine kinase, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr-505, located near the carboxyl terminus (21Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Marth J.D. Cooper J.A. King C.S. Ziegler S.F. Tinker D.A. Overell R.W. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine kinase C-terminal Src kinase phosphorylates Lck and is a natural inhibitor of Lck kinase activity (23Bergmen M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In vitro, Lck undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-394 (24Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Hellstrom K.E.

Biol. 1984; 4: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the extent of phosphorylation at Tyr-394 correlates with Lck activity and appears to be required for maximum catalytic activity (26Boulet I.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Studies of oxidative stress on Src family tyrosine kinases have yielded contradictory results. Nakamura et al. (28Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3133-3139PubMed Google Scholar) reported that treatment of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes with oxidant diamide (1,1′-azobis(N,N-dimethyl formamide)) increased p56lck catalytic activity and induced phosphorylation of p56lck at both Tyr-394 and Tyr-505 residues (28Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3133-3139PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, H2O2 increased the catalytic activity of Lck in most of the cell types (29Yurchak L.K. Hardwick J.S. Amrein. K. Pierno K. Sefton B.M J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12549-12554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of Tyr-394 is apparently required for H2O2-induced activation of Lck (30Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The NFκB family consists of several members including p65, p50, RelB, and c-Rel molecules (31Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). NFκB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor usually retained in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory protein termed IκBα (33Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 34Baldwin Jr, A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar, 35Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of IκBα leads to the translocation of NFκB into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor. The phosphorylation of IκBα has been extensively studied, which results in establishment of two distinct pathways; one involves serine-threonine phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα through ubiquitination, and the other parallel and less explored pathway is through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα (36Canty T.G. Boyle E.M. Angie Farr B.S. Morgan E.N. Verrier E.D. Pohlman T.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 361-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

As compared with IKK-mediated serine phosphorylation of IκBα, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is capable of activating NFκB in the absence of proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα and the exact molecular mechanism(s) of activation of NFκB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα are not well established. The Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck is known to induce IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation and NFκB transactivation in T-lymphocyte upon pervanadate treatment (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) (37Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmenn C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Loss of tyrosine kinase p56lck in Jurkat cells abolished NFκB activation and partially suppressed and delayed phosphorylation of Tyr-42 of IκBα upon pervanadate treatment (38Livolsi A. Busuttil V. Imbert V. Abraham R.T. Peyron J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is observed in bone marrow macrophage followed by TNFα treatment and this phosphorylation requires c-Src activity (39Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrate the involvement of c-Src kinase in H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. In this study, the triple knockout cell lines (c-Src–/–, Fyn–/–, and Yes–/–) show residual IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation upon treatment with H2O2 or induction with H/R (40Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These data clearly suggest that other tyrosine kinases are involved in these processes. Because most of the studies on IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation has been carried out in hematopoietically derived T-cells, the functional significance of these on breast cancer-specific epithelial models remains unsolved. uPA is a member of the serine protease family, which induces the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin regulates cell invasion by degrading matrix proteins such as fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases (1Andreasen P.A. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Previous reports indicated that uPA plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis (1Andreasen P.A. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Onco. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways by which hypoxia/reoxygenation controls uPA secretion through activation of NFκB in breast cancer cells are not well defined. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of p56lck in the redox-mediated nuclear translocation of NFκB, NFκB-DNA binding, transactivation of NFκB, and NFκB-dependent uPA promoter activity following H/R in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. We also showed that H/R induces phosphorylation of p56lck and stimulates Lck-mediated NFκB activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. These lead to the induction of uPA secretion, and all of these ultimately control the cell motility, invasiveness, and metastatic spread of breast cancer.

Mouse monoclonal anti-Lyn antibody was from BD Biosciences. The mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody was obtained from Oncogene. 4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (pp2), 6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone (emodin), SH2 domain inhibitor peptide (Ac-Asp-Tyr(PO3H2)-Val-Pro-Met-Leu-NH2), SN-50, and SN-50M were purchased from Calbiochem.

LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. The FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Pharmingen. Boyden type cell migration chambers were obtained from Corning. All other chemicals were analytical grade. Cell Culture—The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Hypoxic Cultures—The MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells grown to 50–70% confluence were made hypoxic in evacuation chambers by intermittent application of vacuum and sparging with 95% N2, 5% CO2. Cells were analyzed at this point or maintained under hypoxic conditions in presence of 100 mm dithionate (an oxygen scavenger) at 37 °C for 0–24 h. Under these conditions, oxygen levels drop to <10 mm Hg. Cells were either harvested or reoxygenated for the indicated periods of time by replacing the medium with fresh medium and incubating the cultures in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Plasmids and DNA Transfection—Wild type Lck and mutant Lck F394 (mutated at tyrosine 394 to phenylalanine) cDNAs in an expression vector (pCEP4) were a generous gift from Dr. Bartholomew M. Sefton (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The luciferase reporter construct (pNFκB-Luc) containing five tandem repeats of the NFκB binding site was a kind gift from Dr. Rainer de Martin (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). Full-length human uPA promoter (–2062 to +27) in luciferase reporter gene plasmid pGL2 basic was a generous gift from Dr. Ute Reuning (Universitaet Muenchen, Germany). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with each of the above cDNA construct using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, cDNA (8 μg) was mixed with Plus reagent, and then cDNA Plus reagent was incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus cDNA complex was added to the cells and incubated further at 37 °C for 12 h. The control cells received LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, medium was removed, and the cells were refed with fresh medium and maintained for an additional 12 h. These transfected cells were individually or in combination used for Lck kinase assay, interaction studies between Lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα, EMSA, luciferase reporter gene assay, cell migration assay, and detection of uPA expression by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were individually induced by hypoxia for 0–24 h and reoxygenated for 90 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 solution containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA). The protein concentrations in the cleared lysates were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. The equal amount of total proteins in lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody, and half of the immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The remaining half of the samples was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Lck antibody. In separate experiments, both these cells were exposed with hypoxia for 3 h and then induced by H/R for 0–135 min. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody. The levels of phospho- and non-phospho-Lck in the immunoprecipitated samples were detected by Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibodies, respectively. As loading control, the expression of actin was analyzed by Western blot using anti-actin antibody. In other experiments, these cells were transiently transfected with wild type Lck or mutant Lck F394 in pCEP4 in presence of LipofectAMINE Plus. These cells were exposed with hypoxia for 3 h and then induced by H/R for 90 min. These transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-Lck antibody. The expression of actin was detected by Western blot using anti-actin antibody as loading control. In separate experiments, both these cells were exposed with hypoxia for 3 h and then induced by reoxygenation for 90 min. The cell lysates containing equal amount of total proteins were individually immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck, anti-Lyn, or anti-Fyn antibodies, and kinase assay was performed. Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with recombinant IκBα and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.7) containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of SDS-sample buffer. The sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. In another experiments, these cells were individually pretreated with Lck inhibitors (16 μm emodin or 4nm pp2), induced by H/R, immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody, and kinase assay was performed. In other experiments, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody and kinase assay was performed in presence of tyrosine phosphatase (TP). The other half of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-Lck, anti-Lyn, or anti-Fyn antibody. The effect of H/R on tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα was detected by exposing the cells with hypoxia for 0–24 h and reoxygenated for 90 min. The cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody. Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-IκBα antibody. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples was analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphoserine-specific IκBα antibody. As loading control, the expression of actin was analyzed by Western blot using anti-actin antibody. Similarly, the effect of reoxygenation on tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα was also analyzed by exposing the cells with hypoxia for 3 h, followed by reoxygenation for 0–135 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody, and half of the immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-IκBα antibody. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples was analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphoserine-specific IκBα antibody. The expression of actin was detected by Western blot analysis as loading control. To delineate whether PMA or TNFα regulates the serine/threonine phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in breast cancer cells, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) or TNFα (0.1 nm) for 0–135 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and cell lysates containing equal amount of total proteins were individually analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoserine IκBα antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα and anti-actin antibodies, respectively. The role of Lck on tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of IκBα was examined by transiently transfecting the cells with wild type Lck or Lck F394 in pCEP4 followed by induction with hypoxia for 3 h and reoxygenation for 90 min. These transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody, and the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα, serine-phosphorylated IκBα, and non-phosphorylated IκBα in the immunoprecipitated samples were detected by Western blot analysis using their specific antibodies as described above. The effect of Lck inhibitors (emodin or pp2) on tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of IκBα was detected by treating the cells with various concentrations of emodin (0–10 μm) or pp2 (0–4 nm). These cells were exposed with hypoxia for 3 h and reoxygenated for 90 min and lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody and the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα, serine-phosphorylated IκBα, and non-phosphorylated IκBα were analyzed by Western blot using their specific antibodies. As loading control, the expression of actin was analyzed by Western blot using anti-actin antibody. The direct interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and Lck in these cells were examined by individually treating the cells with either 250 μm pV for 20 min or 5 mm H2O2 for 20 min or by inducing with hypoxia for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for 90 min. The cell lysates containing equal amount of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody and analyzed by Western blot using anti-IκBα or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Similarly, to check the effect of SH2 domain inhibitory peptide on H/R-induced interaction between Lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα, both these cells were individually pretreated with different concentrations of this peptide (0–150 nm) and then induced by H/R as described above. These cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody, and the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα and IκBα were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-IκBα antibodies, respectively. To check whether tyrosine 394 of Lck is responsible for interaction with phosphorylated IκBα, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were individually transfected with wild type or mutant Lck F394 in presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then induced by H/R. These cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody and analyzed by Western blot using anti-IκBα or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To delineate the effect of Lck inhibitors (emodin or pp2) on these interaction, both these cells were pretreated with different concentration of emodin (0–10 μm) or pp2 (0–4 nm) and then induced by H/R as described above. These cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody and immunoblotted with anti-IκBα antibody. As loading control, the expression of actin was analyzed by Western blot using anti-actin antibody. Immunofluorescence Study—Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in monolayer on silicon-coated glass slides and then induced by hypoxia for 3 h and reoxygenated for 0–120 min. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with various concentrations of emodin (0–10 μm) or pp2 (0–4 nm) at 37 °C for 6 h and then induced by hypoxia for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for 90 min. The cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 15 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The fixed cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-NFκB, p65 antibody (1:100 dilution) at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed, mounted with coverslips, and analyzed under confocal microscopy (Zeiss). NFκB Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—The semiconfluent MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 6-well plates were individually transfected with a luciferase reporter construct (pNFκB-Luc) containing five tandem repeats of the NFκB-binding site (a generous gift from Dr. Rainer de Martin, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting the cells with pRL vector (Prom"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper and iron are cofactors of a large number of enzymes such as components of the mitochondrial respiratory system (1De Freitas J. Wintz H. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Fox T. Vulpe C. Biometals. 2003; 16: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

Fet3p, a multicopper protein, oxidizes iron prior to its transport by the iron permease Ftr1p (16Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J.

Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar). Both FET3 and FET5 are induced by iron deficiency mediated through Aft1p. Copper deficiency therefore leads to decreased Fet3p activity, decreased iron transport, and secondary iron deficiency (20Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptional effects of the absence of Mac1p. The mac1Δ represents a unique genetic model of combined copper and iron deficiency in yeast. Previous whole genome studies by Gross et al. (10Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) used constitutively active MAC1up1 cells (designated as Mac1up1) and identified potential direct transcriptional targets of the Mac1p. We hypothesized that detailed analysis of the compensatory response of yeast to Mac1p absence would complement and extend these studies and provide further insight into the inter-relationship of copper and iron metabolism in yeast. In addition, our reanalysis as described below of the original Mac1up1 data (deposited in the Stanford Microarray Database) indicated caution in the interpretation of this data set. We identified genes differentially expressed in early log phase mac1Δ as compared with wild type BY4743 through application of an outlier identification method recently developed by our group (21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 22Loguinov A.V. Mian I.S. Vulpe C.D. Genome Biol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). We confirmed selected results through miniarray and quantitative PCR methods. We applied a promoter analysis algorithm, LogicMOTIF, developed by us to identify promoter elements that discriminate between up- and down-regulated genes. Finally we individually phenotyped yeast mutants disrupted in differentially expressed genes and revealed novel genes involved in copper and/or iron homeostasis. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derived from BY4741 and BY4743 and were obtained from Research Genetics. For microarray experiments yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose). For analysis of metal content, cells were grown on synthetic defined (SD) 1The abbreviation used is: ! SDsynthetic defined. medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, amino acids) lacking iron and containing 1 μm CuSO4. For phenotype assay, yeast cells were grown overnight in YPD or SD and diluted to A600 = 1 in 1 ml of water. Serial dilutions were made (A600 = 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001), and 5 μl of each dilution were plated on YPD, YPG (yeast extract/peptone containing 3% glycerol), YPG supplemented with 1 mm FeCl4, and YPG supplemented with 1 mm CuSO4, SD, SD + 100 μm bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (Sigma), a Fe(II) chelator, and SD + 100 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (Sigma), a Cu(I)-specific chelator. synthetic defined. Microarray Procedures—Total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol procedure. 2See www.microarrays.org. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by using Oligotex resin from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A)+ using RNA Super-Script II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer in the presence of aminoallyl-labeled dUTP. cDNA was labeled by incubation with or Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes (Amersham Biosciences). The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA were mixed and hybridized to a yeast cDNA microarray containing 6218 yeast open reading frames (Berkeley yeast consortium and College of Natural Resources genomic facility, University of California, Berkeley). Scanning of microarrays and quantification of signals were performed using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000) and GenePix software, Version 3.01 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The ratio of signal intensity from both wild type and mac1Δ mutant were normalized by total median intensity, and differentially expressed genes were identified as described below. Miniarray Procedures—cDNA was synthesized from total yeast RNA and purified using a standard protocol. Selected open reading frames were amplified with primers (Invitrogen) designed to amplify ∼300 base pairs unique for each gene. Purified PCR products were quantified using PicoGreen® dye fluorescence. Each open reading frame diluted in 3× SSC was spotted six times onto a lysine-coated slide at four different concentrations (80, 40, 20, and 10 ng/μl) using a custom-built arrayer. Sheared genomic DNA (180 ng/μl), yeast total cDNA, a mixture of 800 randomly chosen yeast open reading frames (70 ng/μl), a mixture of 800 randomly chosen PCR products (70 ng/μl), and poly(A) (1280 ng/μl) were used as normalization controls. λ DNA and 3× SSC were used as negative controls. The probe preparation and hybridization were performed as described above. Four different concentrations (80, 40, 20, and 10 ng/μl) of DNA spots on the miniarray chip were probed,and the concentration that gave the maximal signal intensity for each dye was chosen for the further analysis: 80 ng/μl for AFT1, AKR1, CCC2, NCP1, YFR055W, YHR045W, and YLR047C; 40 ng/μl for ACO1, CCP1, HAP4, MAC1, YOR383C, and YTP1; and 20 ng/μl for DIN7, FET3, LEU1, MRS4, YLR205C, and YRO2. Statistical Analysis—We have recently developed a novel approach to identify differentially expressed genes between the two mRNA samples based on identification of outliers as candidate differentially expressed genes (see the Supplement for more details) (21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 22Loguinov A.V. Mian I.S. Vulpe C.D. Genome Biol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The majority of data points after appropriate normalization lie in the vicinity of the line of equivalence in the scatter plot of log2(Cy5) versus log2(Cy3) intensity values. Other data points, outliers, lie outside the vicinity of the line of equivalence and are considered to be data points of greatest interest since they correspond to genes having noticeably different hybridization intensity. We apply robust scatter plot smoothers to quantify and take into account the distortion of the data set by heteroscedasticity (if any). We consider outliers from this analysis to represent candidate differentially expressed genes. We assign a confidence (p value) for each outlier by calculating simultaneous prediction confidence intervals. Promoter Analysis—We developed a hybrid method, LogicMOTIF, 3S. Keles, M. van der Laan, and C. Vulpe, manuscript submitted. for the purpose of identifying regulatory motifs with the highest discriminative power among the given groups of genes. This method utilizes fast enumerative motif-finding methods that apply to a group of potentially co-regulated genes (24van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and the logic regression methodology of Kooperberg et al. (25Kooperberg C. Ruczinski I. LeBlanc M.L. Hsu L. Genet. Epidemiol. 2001; 21: S626-S631Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The key idea is to first identify potential motifs in each of the up- and down-regulated gene groups separately and then build a classifier based on these potential motifs to discriminate between the two groups. As a classifier, we use boolean expressions of the motif occurrences, and such a classifier can be built by logic regression. The main strengths of our method are that the final model built includes the most discriminative motifs of the up- and down-regulated genes, and this model is able to capture the interactions among the individual motifs. Such interactions can be used to infer synergetic and antagonistic combinations of several motifs. Quantitative PCR—Primers specific to the genes of interest were selected using the web-based software PRIMER3 4Available at www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi and sequence information obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Database. Primers were designed to yield ∼300-base pair products for the following genes: AFT1, CCAAGACAAGTCTTCGACCA and CGCCGATGTTATTGTGGTTA; FET3, CACGGACGGTCAATATGAAG and TCCAAAAGTACTCGAAACG; PCA1, ACTCTTTACGGGCAGATGCT and GAACTCCAATCGTTGCTTGA; ERG3, GGAAATCAAGTTGGCAGTCA and TGGCAAGAATCAATGGGTAGA; YTP1, GGATACACGAGGCCAGAAAT and CCAGTTCCTCCAGCTAATCC; and MRS4, GAAGACCGCACTGAGTGGTA and ACTTATCCCACCGCAAAGAC. Primers were designed to yield a 199-base pair product (Invitrogen) for 18 S rRNA, TGATGCCCTTAGACGTTCTG and GTACAAAAGGGCAGGGACGTA. Total RNA isolated from BY4741 and BY4741 mac1Δ and BY4742 aft1Δ grown to early log phase was reverse-transcribed with StrataScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and random primers (Invitrogen) using the Stratagene ProSTAR First-Strand reverse transcription-PCR system. 5See www.stratagene.com/manual/200420.pdf. The duplex PCR mixture contained primers for the gene of interest and primers for the control 18 S rRNA. DNA was amplified with an initial 5-min incubation at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. 20 μl of the reaction mixture were removed at cycles 28, 30, and 32. A sample of each aliquot was run on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light to determine the linear range of DNA amplification for each product. An aliquot in the linear range of the DNA amplification for each product was then run on an 8% acrylamide gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The intensity of the bands was quantified using ChemiImager 4400 software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Each target band was normalized by dividing by the intensity of 18 S rRNA band. Metal Content Analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma—Diploid yeast (BY4743 derivatives) cultures were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mm EDTA and twice with metal-free water. Cell pellets were digested in 1 ml of 3% nitric acid (HNO3) at 98 °C overnight. After digestion, the samples were diluted to 5 ml with ultra-pure water and analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences inductively coupled plasma-atomic absorption spectrometer to determine the metal content (27Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All samples were measured three times, and the experiments were repeated three times. The data are expressed as nanograms of metal/107 cells (A600 = 1). Reanalysis of MAC1up Microarray Data—We obtained the original hybridization data (experiments 8881 and 8902) from the Stanford Microarray Database for the two hybridizations of MAC1up1 cells described previously by Gross et al. (10Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We carried out normalization and data analysis as described under “Materials and Methods” and in the Supplement. In both experiments, an evaluation of a scatter plot of log2(Cy3) versus log2(Cy5) revealed a prominent finger-like pattern in the high intensity areas above the line of equivalence (see Supplemental Fig. 1) calling into question the validity of identified up-regulated genes in these experiments. In addition there are regular patterns in the low intensity areas in these experiments perhaps related to subtraction of “background” hybridization. Consequently there is poor reproducibility of candidate differentially expressed genes between these two experiments (see Supplemental Table 1). As an alternative to the use of the MAC1up strain, we examined gene expression in yeast lacking Mac1p. Identification of Candidate Differentially Expressed Genes in mac1Δ—We used yeast cDNA microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles in early log phase of the haploid mac1Δ mutant to the wild type parental strain in three independent experiments. We also reanalyzed a publicly available data set of a similar experiment (26Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett H.A. Coffey E. Dai H. He Y.D. Kidd M.J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, we identified 97 genes using our outlier identification method (see “Materials and Methods” and the Supplement for details) that were differentially expressed at p < 0.1 in at least three of the four experiments.Table IDifferentially expressed genes in the mac1Δ mutant Presented are the results from the analysis of three independent experiments. Up-regulated genes are indicated in red, and down-regulated genes are indicated in green. Different levels of average differential expression (log2 scale) are indicated by corresponding shades of green or red expression (refer to the color index). Aft1p-regulated genes are in bold. Mac1p-regulated genes are indicated in italic. Transcription factors are shown with a double asterisk (**). Gene functions are described according to the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base, and the cellular role is described according to the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) Data Base. Open table in a new tab Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Genes in the mac1Δ Mutant—We used multiple replicate miniarray analysis in combination with quantitative PCR to confirm the differential expression of genes (Fig. 1, A and B) We selected 11 up- and eight down-regulated genes showing high (ACO1, LEU1, and YRO2), medium (AKR1, CCP1, FET3, HAP4, MAC1, NCP1, and YHR045W), and low (CCC2, DIN7, MRS4, AFT1, YFR055W, YLR047C, YLR205C, YOR383C, and YTP1) hybridization signal intensity. Custom miniarrays containing 24 replicates of each gene were used for four comparative hybridizations between early log mac1Δ and control cells by using independently prepared probes from the same RNA preparation used for microarray experiments (more details on the miniarrays are presented in Supplemental Fig. 3). We confirmed differential expression of each of the 18 genes (Fig. 1A, MAC1 is not shown). AFT1p targets such as FET3, CCC2, and YOR383C (FIT3) were confirmed as up-regulated in mac1Δ mutant. MRS4, AKR1, YLR047C, DIN7, NCP1, YTP1, and YLR205C were also confirmed as induced. Representative down-regulated genes including ACO1, CCP1, HAP4, LEU1, YFR055W, YHR045W, and YRO2 were confirmed as down-regulated in the mac1Δ strain. These results suggest that our microarray analysis reliably identified differentially expressed genes throughout the range of expression levels. As a further test of our methods, we also assayed expression by quantitative PCR of selected genes in mac1Δ, aft1Δ, and wild type cells (Fig. 1B). The mac1Δ strain was used to confirm the expression of selected genes in response to the absence of Mac1p. 18 S amplification was used to normalize expression levels between samples. The FET3 gene was also used as a control since it is regulated by both Aft1p and its homologue Aft2p in yeast (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We confirmed increased expression of FET3, AFT1, MRS4, and PCA1 in the mac1Δ mutant. Expression of Genes Encoding Proteins Involved in Copper and Iron Homeostasis—Twenty-five genes encoding proteins previously shown to be involved in copper and iron metabolism in yeast are differentially expressed in the mac1Δ mutant (Table I and Fig. 2). A previously identified Mac1p target, YFR055W, encoding a protein of unknown function, was down-regulated in the mac1Δ mutant. Similarly, FRE1, a gene regulated both by Mac1p and by Aft1p, is down-regulated in the mac1Δ mutant (27Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol.

Of the members of the iron regulon, only the vacuolar iron transporter FTH1 and FRE6 were not up-regulated. Down-regulation of Genes Encoding Iron- and Copper-containing Proteins—While genes encoding iron-containing proteins involved in iron metabolism (mainly the FRE genes) were up-regulated in mac1Δ mutant, multiple genes encoding Fe-S cluster-containing proteins were down-regulated in mac1Δ mutant (see Supplemental Fig. 5). These include LYS4, LEU1, and ACO1 encoding homoaconitase, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, and aconitase, respectively, and YJL200C of unknown function. In addition, copper- and/or iron-containing components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain such as CYC1 (cytochrome c isoform), SDH3 (succinate dehydrogenase 3), SDH4 (succinate dehydrogenase 4), and CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase). CTT1 (cytosolic catalase) and HEM15 (ferroche-latase) were down-regulated. Aft1p Regulatory Sequence Is a Discriminatory Motif of the Up-regulated Genes in mac1Δ—We looked for motifs in the upstream region of differentially expressed genes that discriminate between the genes that are up-regulated and the genes that are down-regulated using the LogicMOTIF algorithm (described under “Materials and Methods”). Using this approach, we determined that the sequence TGCACCSW corresponding to the Aft1p consensus sequence (Fig. 3A) was the most discriminating motif between the up- and down-regulated genes. In addition to known Aft1p targets (see Supplemental Fig. 4), PCA1 YTP1, YHL035C, YLR126C and YBR047W (Fig. 3B) contained one or more Aft1p binding motifs in the promoter region of these genes between nucleotide positions -233 and -85 relative to the start codon. Interestingly the eight most highly regulated genes in our data set all contain the Aft1p regulatory motif (Table I and Fig. 3, and see Supplemental Fig. 4). Phenotypic Analysis of Genes Regulated in mac1Δ Mutant—To confirm the role in metal metabolism of genes that were differentially expressed in the mac1Δ mutant, we tested the ability of 35 null mutants disrupted in selected genes (see Supplemental Fig. 6 for the complete list) to grow in different copper and iron conditions. Growth of the diploid mutants was tested in copper deficiency, iron deficiency, copper overload, and iron overload, and on a non-fermentable carbon source. No mutant displayed increased sensitivity to copper or iron overload (data not shown), but as shown in Fig. 4A, four mutants, akr1Δ, mrs4Δ, yhr045wΔ, and ylr047cΔ were unable to grow in iron deficiency. In addition, mrs4Δ, yhr045wΔ, and ylr047cΔ were respiratory deficient, but their phenotype was not rescued by the addition of 1 mm copper or iron into the growth medium (data not shown). Measurement of total intracellular copper and iron content in these four mutants revealed that three of them, namely akr1Δ, mrs4Δ, and yhr045wΔ accumulate iron at twice the level of wild type cells (Fig. 4B). The copper content was not altered in these same mutants except for akr1Δ, which showed a slight increase in its intracellular copper concentration. Two of the mutants (mrs4Δ and yhr045wΔ) showed double the zinc content of wild type, and the akr1Δ mutant showed a 4-fold increase in zinc content (see Supplemental Fig. 8). Phenotype assays have revealed that 22 of the 35 mutants screened were unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol (see Supplemental Fig. 6). To test whether the lack of growth was directly linked to disturbances in iron and copper homeostasis, we tested whether addition of copper and iron in the YPG medium would rescue the petite phenotype in these strains. Only one mutant, ssu1Δ, was rescued by addition of iron and copper (Fig. 4A). mac1Δ, a Model to Study Copper and Iron Deficiency in Yeast—We used whole genome microarray analysis and selected representative confirmatory gene expression studies to identify differentially expressed genes in the mac1Δ mutant compared with the wild type. Gene expression provided unexpected insights into the complex regulatory and metabolic rearrangements resulting from copper and iron deficiency. Our results show that a large proportion of the genes induced in mac1 null are involved in iron and copper metabolism. As expected, the absence of the Mac1 protein results in down-regulation of all the Mac1p targets including the high affinity copper transporter CTR1. Similarly we noted up-regulation of an array of genes involved in copper and iron uptake and transport indicative of copper and secondary iron deficiency. ARN1, ARN2, ARN3, ARN4, FIT1, FIT2, FIT3, and FRE2 are the top eight of the differentially expressed genes, and they all have the Aft1p/Aft2p consensus sequences in their upst"
https://openalex.org/W1995399581,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has proved an important model system for cross-species comparative studies of many fundamental processes in the eukaryotic cell, such as cell cycle control and DNA replication. The RNA polymerase II transcription machinery is, however, still relatively poorly understood in S. pombe, partially due to the absence of a reconstituted in vitro transcription system. We have now purified S. pombe RNA polymerase II and its general initiation factors TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH to near homogeneity. These factors enable RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription from the S. pombe alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (adh1p) when combined with Saccharomyces cerevisiae TATA-binding protein. We use our reconstituted system to examine effects of Mediator on basal transcription in vitro. S. pombe Mediator exists in two distinct forms, a free form, which contains the spSrb8, spTrap240, spSrb10, and spSrb11 subunits, and a smaller form, which lacks these four subunits and associates with RNA polymerase II to form a holoenzyme. We find that spSrb8/spTrap240/spSrb10/spSrb11 containing Mediator repress basal transcription, whereas Mediator lacking these subunits has a stimulatory effect on transcription. Our findings thus demonstrate that the spSrb8/spTrap240/spSrb10/spSrb11 subcomplex governs the ability of Mediator to stimulate or repress basal transcription in vitro.

The structure and function of Schizosaccharomyces pombe pol II has been investigated in great detail. The enzyme is composed of 12 subunits, Rpb1 to Rpb12, similar to what has been described for the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells (2Sakurai H. Mitsuzawa H. Kimura M. Ishihama A. Mol.

Biochemical analysis of the enzyme has revealed the presence of several distinct subcomplexes and has proved important in the analysis of the recently published x-ray crystallography structure of S. cerevisiae pol II (4Kimura M.

Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Previous characterization of S. pombe TFIIH has only concerned a specific subcomplex of this transcription factor, containing the Mcs6, Mcs2, and Pmh1 gene products (6Hermand D. Westerling T.

These proteins correspond to the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7), cyclin H, and Mat1, in mammalian TFIIH. Cdk7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II upon initiation of transcription (7Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D.

Interestingly, Cdk7 is also the mammalian cdk-activating kinase (Cak): the kinase needed for the activating phosphorylation of other cyclin-dependent kinases (10Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O.

A similar situation also appears to exist in S. pombe, where the trimeric Mcs6-Mcs2-Pmh1 complex also possesses CAK activity (6Hermand D. Westerling T. Pihlak A. Thuret J.Y. Vallenius T. Tiainen M.

The Mediator complex is essential for basal and regulated expression of nearly all pol II-dependent genes in S. cerevisiae (14Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar): one smaller core Mediator in complex with pol II and one larger form of Mediator, devoid of pol II, but containing the spSrb8, spTrap240, spSrb10, and spSrb11 proteins. Homologues to these four proteins are found in certain S. cerevisiae and human Mediator preparations and they are collectively referred to as the Srb8-11 module (13Samuelsen C. Baraznenok V. Spahr H.

The SRB11 and SRB10 genes encode cyclin C and the cyclin C-dependent kinase, respectively (17Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and genetic analysis indicates that the Srb8-11 module is involved in the negative regulation of a small subset of genes during exponential growth (13Samuelsen C.

Why Mediator exists in two different forms and what differential roles these complexes have in transcriptional regulation are still unclear. Genetic Manipulations—The S. pombe strains used in this work are: L972 (h-), Mp12 (h-ade6-M210) and Mp13 (h+ade6-M216), TP33 (h- Δsptrap240::G418R); TP46 (h-ade6-M216 spmed7+::TAP); and TP68 (h+ade6-M216 sptrap240+::TAP). The TAP-Pmh1 strain (h+pmh1::pmh1-TAP kanR ade6-210 ura4-D18 leu1-32 his3-D1) was constructed as described previously (19Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L.

We amplified a DNA fragment encoding S. pombe TFIIB from cDNA kindly provided by Jacques E. Remacle (University of Leuven, Belgium) and cloned it in-frame with a C-terminal His6-tag in the vector pET21b (Stratagene). We also amplified DNA fragments encoding for the subunits of spTFIIF (spTfg1, spTfg2, spTfg3) and spTFIIE (spToa1, spToa2). During PCR a His6-tag was introduced at the C terminus of spTfg2, spToa1, and spToa2. The PCR products were cloned into the vector pBacPAK9 (Clontech). We prepared Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viruses recombinant for the individual proteins as described in the BacPAK manual (Clontech). Protein Purification and Identification—RNA pol II holoenzyme was purified from a TAP-spMed7 strain in which spTrap240+ had been deleted. spSrb8-11/Mediator and the pol II holoenzymeΔspTrap240 were purified as described previously (13Samuelsen C.

We purified core TFIIH from a strain containing a C-terminal TAP-tag on sptfb2+, following previously published protocols (13Samuelsen C. Baraznenok V. Spahr H. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S.

We grew 20 liters of S. pombe to mid-log phase in YES medium (20Alfa C. Fajntes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments in Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2 g/liter adenine. Cells were collected by centrifugation (JA-10, 6,000 rpm, 5 min, +4 °C), washed once with ice-cold water, and suspended in 0.5 ml of 3 × lysis buffer (0.3 m Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 0.15 m potassium acetate, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3× protease inhibitors) per g of cell pellet. Cells were lysed by bead beating (BeadBeater, Stratech Scientific Ltd.) using 25 cycles, 30 s of beating, and 90 s of rest. We cleared the supernatant by centrifugation (JA-10, 9,000 rpm, 25 min, +4 °C), added 1/9 volume of 5 m KAc and stirred for 15 min. We next added 0.2% (v/v) polyethyleneimine and stirred for an additional 30 min. After ultracentrifugation (Ti45, 42,000 rpm, 90 min, +4 °C), the supernatant was dialyzed against IPP150 overnight, added to 1 ml of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated by rotation for 2 h at +4 °C. The beads were collected by sedimentation, loaded into a column, and washed with 30 ml of IPP150 followed by 10 ml of TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris chloride (pH 8.0), 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). We eluted TFIIH by addition of 500 units of TEV protease in 1.5 ml TEV cleavage buffer and incubation for 2 h at +16 °C. We added 3 ml of calmodulin binding buffer and 3 μl of 1 m CaCl/ml of eluate and loaded the mixture on a 1-ml calmodulin column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was rotated for 2 h at +4 °C and washed with 30 ml of IPP150 Calmodulin binding buffer. Core TFIIH was eluted by rotation at +4 °C for 1 h in IPP150 calmodulin elution buffer with 500 mm NaCl. TFIIK (TAP-Pmh1) was purified as core TFIIH but eluted with calmodulin elution buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. We also used an alternative, less stringent protocol to monitor for additional proteins, which interacted only weakly with TFIIK. In the alternative protocol we decreased the Nonidet P-40 concentration from 0.1% to 0.01% throughout the purification procedure and furthermore decreased the buffer volumes used to wash the IgG-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose columns to 5 column volumes. For RNA pol II purification, 972h- cells were grown and collected as described for purification of core TFIIH. Cells were dissolved in 3× pol lysis buffer (300 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, 3× protease inhibitors). We lysed the cells by bead beating (25 cycles, 30 s of beating, and 90 s of rest) and cleared the supernatant by centrifugation (JA-10, 9,000 rpm, 25 min, +4 °C). We added 0.05 volume of 4 m ammonium sulfate to the supernatant and stirred for 15 min. We next added 0.2% (v/v) polyethyleneimine and stirred for an additional 30 min. After ultracentrifugation (Ti45, 25,000 rpm, 15 min, +4 °C), an equal volume of 4 m ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant at a speed of 10 ml/min, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min. After ultracentrifugation (Ti45, 25,000 rpm, 15 min, +4 °C) the pellet was dissolved in buffer D-0 (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1× protein inhibitors; the number after the hyphen indicates the ammonium sulfate concentration in molar units) until a 1:200 dilution gave below 400 microsiemens on the conductivity meter. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (JA-17, 13,000 rpm, 30 min, +4 °C) and loaded onto an 8WG16 antibody-Sepharose column (CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience) coupled to antibody at 2 mg/ml), which had been equilibrated with Buffer D-0.4. The column was washed with 25 column volumes of buffer D-0.25 and subsequently moved to room temperature. Half a column volume of elution buffer was added (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mm ammonium sulfate, 50% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1× protein inhibitors) and left to incubate for 15 min. More elution buffer was added, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected until no more pol II appeared to be eluting as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Recombinant His6-TFIIB was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP cells (Stratagene) and purified over Ni2+-NTA fast flow (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A-0.1 (25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) overnight. The dialyzed material was applied to a Mono S 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated in buffer A-0.1. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A-0.1, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (15 ml) of buffer A-0.1 to A-1.0. A peak of essentially pure protein eluted around 0.5 m KAc. For purification of TFIIF we co-infected Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses expressing spTfg1, spTfg2, and spTfg3 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus. Cells were collected 72 h after infection by centrifugation (JA-10, 3,500 rpm 10 min, 4 °C), washed with ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged as before. Cells were dissolved in 10 ml of buffer B-0 (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen indicates the sodium chloride concentration in molar units) and incubated on ice for 20 min followed by lysis using a Dounce homogenizer (15 ml) 15 times. After rotation in 10 ml of buffer B-1.6 for 45 min at +4 °C broken cells were ultracentrifuged (TLA 100.3, 45,000 rpm, 45 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was loaded on 1 ml Ni2+-NTA fast flow (Qiagen) and purified according the manufacturer's recommendations. The peak of TFIIF was dialyzed against buffer Q-0.1 (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) overnight. The dialyzed material was loaded on a Mono Q 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) which had been equilibrated in buffer Q-0.1. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer Q-0.1 and eluted by a linear gradient (15 ml) of buffer Q-0.1 to Q-1.5. Essentially pure TFIIF eluted at about 900 mm KAc. For purification of TFIIE we co-infected Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses expressing Toa1 and Toa2 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus. We purified TFIIF following the same protocol as for TFIIE but with the following modifications. The peak of TFIIE from Ni2+-NTA fast flow column was dialyzed against buffer C-0.1 (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) overnight. The dialyzed material was loaded on a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated in buffer C-0.1. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer C-0.1 and eluted by a linear gradient (15 ml) of buffer C-0.1 to C-1.5. Essentially pure TFIIE eluted at about 0.8 m KAc. Purification of S. cerevisiae TBP was as described previously (21Buratowski S. Hahn S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Nature. 1988; 334: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins in this report, by MALDI-TOF analysis of in-gel digested proteins was essentially as described previously (12Spahr H. Samuelsen C.O. Baraznenok V. Ernest I. Huylebroeck D. Remacle J.E. Samuelsson T. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11985-11990Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Transcription assays were performed as described previously (22Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23383-23387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In the G-less casette assay, 2× transcription mix contained 37 mm Hepes (7.5), 110 mm potassium acetate, 0.7 mm adenosine triphosphate, 0.7 mm cytidine triphosphate, 5 μm uridine triphosphate (UTP), 0.5 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium sulfate, 3.7 mm EDTA, and 15 units of RNAguard™ RNase inhibitor (porcine). Protein degradation by proteinase K was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. We used a template with the S. pombe alcohol dehydrogenase promoter upstream of a G-less casette (23Flanagan P.M. Kelleher III, R.J. Tschochner H. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CTD Phosphorylation—S. pombe pol II (100 ng) was incubated with TFIIK and core-TFIIH as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. The reactions were performed in 15 μl of 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 110 mm potassium acetate, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 10 μm ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 23 °C, followed by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography. We wanted to examine the influence of the spSrb8-11 complex on basal transcription in vitro. To this end we needed to purify a defined Mediator complex, lacking the spSrb10 cyklin-dependent kinase. We used a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag on spMed7 and purified Mediator from a yeast strain carrying a deletion of sptrap240+. The Δsptrap240 Mediator was purified in complex with pol II, forming a holoenzyme (holoenzymeΔsptrap240). The absence of Srb10 from the holoenzymeΔtrap240 was verified with silver staining and a CTD kinase assay (Fig 1, A and B). For comparison we used the defined spSrb8-11/Mediator complex, which we had isolated previously (13Samuelsen C. Baraznenok V. Spahr H. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Evidently the spTrap240 subunit is necessary for the association of the spSrb10 cyklin-dependent kinase with the Mediator complex. We next wanted to examine the influence of the spSrb8-11 complex on basal transcription in vitro. Since no in vitro system had been established for S. pombe, we first set out to purify the necessary transcription factors. TFIIF from different eukaryotes contains two highly conserved subunits, Tfg1 and Tfg2. In S. cerevisiae a third subunit, Tfg3, has been shown to associate with TFIIF but was lost during later steps of purification (24Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Homologues to these three proteins are also found in S. pombe, and upon co-expression in insect cells they generate a stable, heterotrimeric TFIIF, which could be purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2, A and B). We noted that large amounts of spTfg1 and spTfg2 precipitated during purification, suggesting that spTfg3 may be needed to generate a soluble complex (Fig. 2A). In fact, we failed to obtain any soluble TFIIF, when only spTfg1 and spTfg2 was co-expressed in insect cells (data not shown). We next purified S. pombe RNA pol II using an anti-CTD monoclonal antibody column and generated a basically homogenous material (Fig. 2C). We identified the subunits of pol II using MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting, and our results were in perfect agreement with the subunit analysis reported previously (data not shown) (2Sakurai H. Mitsuzawa H. Kimura M. Ishihama A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7511-7518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotic cells, TFIIH contains nine subunits (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To urify S. pombe TFIIH, we introduced a TAP-tag on the C terminus of Pmh1. Purification on IgGSepharose and Ca2+/calmodulin-Sepharose generated a trimeric complex (Fig. 3A). The individual subunits were identified with MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting as Mcs2, Mcs6, and Pmh1 (Table I). A similar subcomplex of TFIIH has also been identified in S. cerevisiae and denoted TFIIK (7Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Notably absent in our purified complex were the subunits of core TFIIH. In an attempt to isolate the holo-form form of TFIIH (core + TFIIK), we used an alternative protocol, in which we decreased the Nonidet P-40 detergent concentrations during the TAP purification (see “Materials and Methods”). In these preparations we could identify substoichiometric amounts of Rad15 the S. pombe homologue to the S. cerevisiae Rad3 helicase (Fig. 3B) (26Murray J.M. Doe C.L. Schenk P. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). No other components of TFIIH was, however, found in the TAP-Pmh1 preparations, suggesting that TFIIH may be a less stable complex in S. pombe than what has been described in S. cerevisiae and human cells (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To purify the S. pombe core-TFIIH complex, we fused a TAP-tag to the C-terminal part of spTfb2. TAP purification generated a five-subunit complex, which was characterized with MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting as Ercc3sp, spTfb1, spTfb2, spSsl1, and spTfb4 (Fig. 3B). The MALDI-TOF fingerprinting data of the identified TFIIH subunits are summarized in Table I. We tested the ability of TFIIK to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of pol II in the presence and absence of core TFIIH (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation was detected in both cases, although the level was slightly lower in the presence of core TFIIH.Table IProteins in TFIIHProteinS. cerevisiae homologueNumber of peaksSequence coverageTheoretical massGene name (Sanger center)ahttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/.%kDaPmh1Tfb3133837SPBC776.18cMcs6Kin28103339SPBC19F8.07Mcs2Ccl151438SPBP16F5.02Rad15Rad371188SPAC1D4.12Ercc3spSsl291992SPAC17A5.06spTfb1Tfb1112955SPAC16E8.11cspTfb2Tfb2133251SPBC13G1.13spSsl1Ssl161645SPCC1682.07spTfb4Tfb462534SPBC30B4.07ca http://www.sanger.ac.uk/. Open table in a new tab We identified the SPAC16E8.16 gene as a putative S. pombe TFIIB homologue. The gene product was fused in-frame with a C-terminal His6-tag, expressed in E. coli, and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 4A). TFIIE contains two subunits in S. cerevisiae, which are encoded by the TOA1 and TOA2 genes. We identified two highly conserved homologues to these genes in S. pombe, which upon co-expression in insect cells generated dimeric TFIIE, which could be purified to homogeneity over Ni2+-agarose and DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. 4B). We next set out to reconstitute transcription in vitro. We used negatively supercoiled templates with either the adenovirus major late promoter or the S. pombe adh1+ promoter (adh1p) followed by a G-less cassette. Addition of all the factors did indeed generate strong, promoter specific transcription from the endogenous S. pombe promoter (Fig. 5A). Lower levels of in vitro transcription could also be observed from the adenovirus major late promoter construct (data not shown). To test the activity of each individual transcription factor we performed a dropout transcription assay where one factor at the time was left out (Fig. 5A). We found that transcription was completely abolished if TBP, TFIIB, pol II, or TFIIE were omitted. In the absence of TFIIF we could observe a low level of transcription (2% relative the complete reaction), probably due to small amounts of TFIIF contaminating the purified pol II. Our reactions were less dependent on TFIIH, which had a 3-fold stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In agreement with our observation, TFIIH is not needed for transcription of certain promoters on negatively supercoiled templates in mammalian in vitro transcription systems (27Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 29Kotova I. Chabes A.L. Segerman B. Flodell S. Thelander L. Bjorklund S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4527-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, our S. pombe in vitro transcription system appears to be more dependent on TFIIE than the human system (27Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), since we can observe no transcription in the absence of this factor. We next tested the effects of holoenzymeΔspTrap240 and spSrb8-11/Mediator on basal transcription (Fig. 5B). We found that Mediator devoid of spSrb8-11 had a significant stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing spSrb8-11 had a strong negative effect, diminishing the basal levels of transcription up to 5-fold. The stimulation of basal transcription observed for holoenzymeΔspTrap240 is not merely an effect of adding more pol II, since the addition of free pol II to the same concentrations as found in the holoenzymeΔspTrap240 preparation at best had a modest (1.2-fold) stimulatory effect on the transcription reaction (data not shown). Neither do we believe that the inhibitory effect associated with spSrb8-11/Mediator is due to any contaminating factor. When we do repeated elutions of Srb8-11/Mediator at the Ca2+/calmodulin-Sepharose purification step, we find that the levels of inhibition observed in our in vitro transcription system correlates well with the relative amounts of Mediator and spSrb10 associated CTD-kinase activity found in the individual eluted fractions (Fig. 5C). Cross-species comparisons between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae have been successfully used in the characterization of the eukaryotic cell cycle. We have initiated a project aimed at a comparative analyzes of regulated pol II transcription in these two yeast species. Here we report on the reconstitution of a highly purified in vitro system for S. pombe pol II transcription. The purified S. pombe TFIIF contains three subunits, in contrast to metazoan TFIIF, which only contains two subunits. In S. cerevisiae this additional third subunit, Tfg3/Taf30/Anc1, appears only weakly associated with TFIIF, since it does not stay associated with the protein complex during gel filtration (24Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Tfg3/Taf30/Anc1 protein has also been identified as a member of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (30Cairns B.R. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3308-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as well as TFIID (24Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the tfg3-S. cerevisiae strain, however, demonstrate that Tfg3 is not essential for many of the tasks associated with these complexes (24Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our finding that spTfg3 is absolutely required for reconstitution of S. pombe TFIIF in recombinant form could suggest that the protein rather play a role as an assembly factor of multiprotein complexes. We recently reported that Mediator in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe exists in at least two specific forms (13Samuelsen C. Baraznenok V. Spahr H. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The smaller of these forms is the core Mediator, which may interact with pol II and form a holoenzyme. Another larger form, which contains four additional Mediator subunits, spSrb8, spTrap240, spSrb10, spSrb11, is always isolated devoid of pol II. These proteins collectively form the Srb8-11 module, which was recently isolated in free form (31Borggrefe T. Davis R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44202-44207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that Mediator isolated from a sptrap240- deletion strain also lacks spSrb10. Apparently spTrap240 acts as an anchor for the other components of the module. Our isolation of these two well defined forms of Mediator also allows us to compare their effects on basal transcription in vitro. We find that core Mediator has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription, whereas the spSrb8-11-containing Mediator has an inhibitory effect. This observation could lend support to our previous speculation that the key role of spSrb8-11 may be to repress Mediator function prior to transcriptional activation (13Samuelsen C. Baraznenok V. Spahr H. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another possible role for the spSrb8-11 submodule is in global down-regulation of transcription upon entry into stationary phase. Specific growth factors and the availability of essential nutrients, control eukaryotic cell proliferation. If either of these signals is lacking, cells may enter into a specialized non-dividing resting state, known as stationary phase or G0, characterized by a considerable down-regulation of transcription and protein synthesis (32Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, subunits of the Srb8-11 have been shown essential for establishing stationary phase in S. cerevisiae (33Chang Y.W. Howard S.C. Budovskaya Y.V. Rine J. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 157: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the main role of the spSrb8-11 module is to down-regulate transcription upon entry into stationary phase and that the in vitro data presented here reconstitute this specific event."
https://openalex.org/W2009267595,"The mouse skin model of carcinogenesis has been instrumental in our appreciation of the multistage nature of carcinogenesis. In this system, tumor promotion is a critical step in the generation of tumors and is usually achieved by treatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Although it is generally assumed that protein kinase C (PKC) is the sole receptor for TPA in this system, we sought to evaluate whether non-PKC pathways could also contribute to the effects of phorbol esters in skin. We documented expression of the high affinity non-PKC phorbol ester receptor and Ras activator RasGRP1 in mouse primary keratinocytes. Overexpression of RasGRP1 in keratinocytes increased the level of active GTP-loaded Ras. TPA treatment further elevated this Ras activation in a PKC-independent manner and induced the translocation and down-regulation of RasGRP1. Overexpression of RasGRP1 in keratinocytes also caused apoptosis. Finally, induction of keratinocyte differentiation by elevation of extracellular calcium suppressed expression of endogenous RasGRP1, whereas overexpression of RasGRP1 inhibited expression of the differentiation markers keratins 1 and 10 induced by high calcium in the medium. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RasGRP1 is an additional diacylglycerol/phorbol ester receptor in epidermal keratinocytes and suggest that activation of this novel receptor may contribute to some of the phorbol ester- and Ras-mediated effects in mouse epidermis.

Carcinogenesis is a multistage process that reflects the cooperation between oncogenic mutations and epigenetic mechanisms that alter cellular homeostasis. Understanding the mechanism governing this cooperation is therefore of great importance, as it may identify molecular targets that can be used for interrupting tumor development before malignant progression occurs. One of the experimental models that has been instrumental in investigating the stages of cancer formation is the induction of tumors in mouse skin. In this model, a carcinogen initiates cells by introducing a mutation in a ras gene, and the initiated population expands under treatment with phorbol esters, non-genotoxic compounds with tumor-promoting activities. Although phorbol esters are the prototypes of tumor promoters in skin, the nature of their interaction with Ras signaling in tumor promotion remains to be determined. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePKCprotein kinase CRasGRPRas guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteinHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMOPCmineral oil-induced plasmacytomaMEMEagle's minimal essential mediumRTreverse transcriptionPBSphosphate-buffered salineAdadenovirusMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasePARPpoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. is the classic mouse skin tumor promoter (1Boutwell R.K.

When cultures of basal proliferating epidermal keratinocytes are exposed to this agent, their growth is arrested, and they undergo a process of differentiation (3Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 4Yuspa S.H. Ben T. Hennings H. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, initiated cells that harbor a mutant ras gene are resistant to the differentiation effects of TPA (5Hennings H. Michael D. Lichti U. Yuspa S.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Yuspa S.H. Morgan D. Lichti U. Spangler E.F. Michael D. Kilkenny A. Hennings H. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vivo, the consequence of heterogeneity of response is tumor promotion: the clones of the carcinogen-altered cells are selected and expanded because they resist the induction of terminal differentiation and are stimulated to proliferate (7Yuspa S.H. Hennings H. Lichti U. J. Supramol. Struct. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 17: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Historically, protein kinase C (PKC) has been considered responsible for the phorbol ester effects (8Marks F. Gschwendt M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The role of some of the PKC isoforms in the tumor-promoting actions of phorbol esters has been recently assessed using transgenic animals. PKCδ overexpression in the epidermis induces resistance to tumor promotion by TPA (9Reddig P.J. Dreckschmidt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5710-5718PubMed Google Scholar). PKCα increases cutaneous inflammation, but has no effect on tumor promotion (10Wang H.Q. Smart R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3497-3506PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCϵ, which appears to be oncogenic in a variety of cell types (11Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perletti G.P. Folini M. Lin H.C. Mischak H. Piccinini F. Tashjian Jr., A.H.

Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 595-602PubMed Google Scholar). One emerging question is whether other receptors for phorbol esters contribute to tumor promotion in skin. There are at least three different families of non-PKC phorbol ester receptors: the chimerins (14Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Munc13 (15Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N.

Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). All of these receptors can respond to phorbol esters with sensitivities similar to PKC (15Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M.

The chimerins are GTPase-activating proteins for Rac, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements (14Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although chimerin is present in a variety of tissues (19Yuan S. Miller D.W. Barnett G.H. Hahn J.F. Williams B.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3456-3461PubMed Google Scholar), expression in the epidermis has not been demonstrated. The Munc13 family comprises mammalian proteins that participate in synaptic transmission and that are expressed in brain (15Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J.

Finally, RasGRP1 is a phorbol ester receptor that functions as an activator of Ras (16Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C.

The two functional characteristics of RasGRP1, the ability to bind to phorbol esters and to modulate Ras activity, make RasGRP1 an attractive candidate for an additional target of the phorbol esters in skin that could directly link phorbol ester signaling with Ras signaling and the tumorigenic process. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate protein kinase C Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma Eagle's minimal essential medium reverse transcription phosphate-buffered saline adenovirus mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. In this study, we report that primary mouse keratinocytes express RasGRP1 and that this receptor mediates Ras activation and can translocate and be down-regulated in response to phorbol ester treatment. Moreover, calcium-induced differentiation suppresses the levels of RasGRP1 in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas overexpression of RasGRP1 in epidermal cells inhibits the expression of markers of differentiation and causes cell death, effects that may be mediated by activation of Ras. In summary, our findings indicate that RasGRP1 is an additional diacylglycerol/phorbol ester receptor in epidermal keratinocytes and suggest that activation of this novel receptor may contribute to some of the phorbol ester- and Ras-mediated effects in mouse skin. Vectors and Reagents—DNAs encoding rat RasGRP1 tagged with either hemagglutinin (HA) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags were prepared by standard molecular biology procedures and used to generate recombinant adenoviruses with the Transpose-AD system (Qbiogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant adenoviruses for expression of bacterial β-galactosidase (LacZ) or the GFP protein were obtained from Qbiogene. A plasmid utilized in transfections for expression of RasGRP1 as a GFP fusion protein was generated by subcloning the rat RasGRP1 cDNA N-terminal to GFP using the NheI site of the pQBI25 plasmid (Qbiogene). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-RasGRP1 (m199), anti-PKCα (H-7), anti-PKCδ (C-17), and anti-HA (H-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-mouse keratin 1 and anti-mouse keratin 10 (Covance Research Products); anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK) polyclonal, anti-p44/42 MAPK (ERK) polyclonal, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Cell Signaling); anti-actin and anti-MOPC21 IgG (Sigma); anti-Ras (clone Ras10) and anti-phospho-Ser338 Raf-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); and anti-RasGRP1 polyclonal (J32; custom antibody). Primary Keratinocyte Cultures and Infection—Primary cultures of normal mouse keratinocytes were prepared from newborn mice (2–3 days old) by the trypsin flotation procedure (22Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, skins were floated, dermis down, in 0.25% trypsin at 4 °C overnight. Afterward, the epidermis was separated mechanically from the dermis in S-MEM-high calcium medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1.2 mm calcium), chopped, and centrifuged. The pellet was washed twice, and the keratinocytes were resuspended in S-MEM-high calcium medium, followed by filtration through a cell strainer to remove cell debris. Cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/60-mm Petri dish and incubated overnight at 36 °C, after which the medium was changed to S-MEM-low calcium medium (0.04 mm) to maintain the cells under basal proliferating conditions. Keratinocytes were used within 5–6 days after plating. Adenoviral infection was done on keratinocytes plated on 60-mm dishes. The volume of the medium in the dishes was reduced to 1 ml, and adenoviruses were added to the dishes at the appropriate multiplicity of infection, followed by a 4-h incubation at 36 °C. After incubation, 3 ml of S-MEM-low calcium medium was added, and the dishes were incubated for an additional 24–72-h period depending on the experiment. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Cultures of primary keratinocytes were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using the high pure isolation kit from Roche Applied Science, treated with DNase, and used for a two-step RT-PCR using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The first reaction step was performed using 1 μg of total RNA and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer. For the amplification reaction (PCR step), specific primers for mouse RasGRP1 (5′-primer, aaa gat ctg ctc cat gac ccc gaa gaa g; and 3′-primer, gac atc cca gta aac ccg tct gca gat tc) or the mouse ornithine decarboxylase control (5′-primer, cac gct tgc agt caa cat cat tgc caa aa; and 3′-primer, cat tga tcc tag cag aag cac agg ctg) were used. To test for DNA contamination, the RT-PCR beads were heated at 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase prior to initiating the RT reaction. RT-PCR with the OCD primers also served as a control for DNA contamination, as the PCR product resulting from genomic amplification should be 1237 nucleotides versus the 530-nucleotide product that originated from mRNA. Preparation and Staining of Keratinocytes—Primary keratinocytes seeded on Permanox slide chambers were fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 10 min. For staining with the m199 monoclonal antibody, blocking was performed utilizing the Vector M.O.M. kit (Vector Labs, Inc.). An 8% solution of bovine serum albumin was utilized as the blocking agent when using the J32 primary polyclonal antibody. The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Staining of actin fibers was done using Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Primary keratinocytes were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and one tablet of Mini-Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Samples for immunoblotting were prepared in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, 2 mg of total lysate protein was incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A/G-Agarose beads in the cold. The immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. After boiling, 50–100 μg of lysate protein was loaded onto acrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was done on nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature and chemiluminescence detection using SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce). When fractionation was performed, cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl supplemented with protease inhibitors and then sonicated for 8 s to cause lysis. Soluble or cytosolic fractions were prepared from aliquots of 60 μl of total lysates by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as the “soluble” fractions. GTP-loaded Ras Pull-down Assay—Levels of GTP-loaded Ras were measured using glutathione S-transferase/Raf-1 Ras-binding domain as a probe in an affinity precipitation or pull-down assay as described previously (23Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, primary keratinocytes were serum-starved (0.1% fetal bovine serum) overnight, treated with TPA or vehicle, and harvested on ice in magnesium lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and one tablet of Mini-Complete protease inhibitors). Lysates were rotated at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation. Lysate protein (300 μg) was incubated with glutathione S-transferase/Raf-1 Ras-binding domain conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h with rotation in the cold. The affinity complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and run on 15% acrylamide gels. Aliquots of the total lysates were run in parallel as a control of the “input” of total Ras in the pull-down assay. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes; immunostaining was performed using anti-pan Ras antibody (clone Ras10). Flow Cytometry—Primary keratinocytes were trypsinized for 5 min, centrifuged, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and then fixed in 5 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol. After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were centrifuged, washed twice with PBS, and rehydrated in the last wash with PBS by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation, the keratinocytes were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of PBS containing 1 μg/ml RNase A, followed by an additional 15-min incubation at room temperature with 1 ml of a 3 μm propidium iodide solution containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% IGEPAL. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan apparatus. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Staining—Detection of externalization of phosphatidylserine in apoptotic cells was done using the Vibrant apoptosis assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) according to the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, keratinocytes were plated on Permanox chamber slides; infected with AdLacZ or AdRasGRP1 for 48 h, and then washed with cold PBS, followed by one wash with 1× annexin binding buffer. Slides were incubated with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and 2 μl of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide in 200 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 200 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer and then observed under a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate filters. Expression of RasGRP1 in Primary Keratinocytes—To study the expression of RasGRP1 in skin, we used primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes. Mouse keratinocytes are the target cells in chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. Cells were cultured for 3–6 days, and total cellular RNA was isolated, treated with DNase to eliminate genomic DNA contamination, and then utilized for RT-PCR using specific primers for mouse RasGRP1. As shown in Fig. 1A, the results revealed a transcript of ∼600 bp (expected size of 578 bp). The product was excised from the gel, purified, and sequenced to confirm identity to the published sequence for mouse RasGRP1. To confirm expression of RasGRP1 at the protein level, we performed immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody that has reactivity toward mouse RasGRP1 (m199). This antibody recognized two bands with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, which most likely reflect post-translational modifications. Similar doublets were also observed in lysates from T-cells of mouse origin (24Puente L.G. Stone J.C. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6865-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These bands were not detected when immunoprecipitation was performed with an irrelevant mouse isotype IgG1 (Fig. 1B, second lane). Immunofluorescence studies using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against RasGRP1 yielded a consistent image for the subcellular distribution of this protein in keratinocytes, which corresponded to cytoplasmic distribution with strong perinuclear localization (Fig. 2). As expected, cells ectopically expressing the GFP fusion protein of RasGRP1 (RasGRP1-GFP) showed a localization pattern for the GRP protein similar to that for the native protein (Fig. 2e). RasGRP1 Activates Ras in Response to Phorbol Ester Treatment in Keratinocytes—Previous studies including our own have demonstrated that RasGRP1 is a high affinity receptor for phorbol esters both in vitro and in vivo (16Ebinu J.O.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 840-846PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). If phorbol esters like TPA activate RasGRP1 in keratinocytes, RasGRP1 is expected to activate its substrate, Ras. We first examined the ability of the phorbol ester TPA to induce Ras activation in mouse keratinocytes under control conditions. To do this, we measured the level of active GTP-loaded Ras using the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 as a probe in an affinity precipitation (pull-down) assay. In primary keratinocytes, a 15-min treatment with 1 μm TPA elevated the GTP-loaded Ras levels 3–4 times over the control levels observed in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). To test whether the activation was dependent on PKC, we pretreated the cells with the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X before the addition of TPA. We have previously used similar concentrations of this inhibitor to successfully abrogate PKC activation in keratinocytes (26Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, activation of Ras by TPA was independent of PKC. When RasGRP1 was overexpressed in the keratinocytes by infection with a recombinant adenovirus (AdRasGRP1), GTP-loaded Ras levels increased 3-fold over control levels observed in cells infected with AdLacZ. This activation was further increased by a 15-min exposure to TPA (1 μm) (Fig. 3, C and D), consistent with the hypothesis that RasGRP1 responds as a phorbol ester receptor in mouse epidermal cells. TPA Induces Translocation and Down-regulation of RasGRP1 in Keratinocytes—The preceding results indicate that RasGRP1 activated Ras in keratinocytes in response to phorbol ester treatment. We then investigated whether phorbol ester treatment could cause redistribution of RasGRP1. As shown in Fig. 2, RasGRP1 showed a cytosolic distribution and perinuclear localization in resting keratinocytes. A 15-min treatment with TPA induced a dose-dependent decrease in the RasGRP1 levels in the soluble (cytosolic) fraction (Fig. 4A), suggesting translocation of RasGRP1 to particulate compartments of the cell. To determine the localization of the translocated RasGRP1, we examined its cellular distribution in response to TPA by confocal microscopy in live mouse keratinocytes expressing the RasGRP1-GFP fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, 1 μm TPA translocated RasGRP1-GFP to the plasma membrane of the keratinocytes during a 15-min treatment. This result confirms that RasGRP1 is able to redistribute in response to phorbol esters in mouse keratinocytes and indicates translocation to the membrane upon short-term exposure to TPA. Additionally, when mouse epidermal cells were exposed to TPA for 24 h, the level of endogenous RasGRP1 was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4C), suggesting that RasGRP1, like some members of the PKC family such as PKCδ and PKCα, is down-regulated in this system in response to phorbol ester treatment. RasGRP1 Overexpression Induces Apoptosis—To gain insight into the role of RasGRP1 in keratinocyte biology, we used recombinant AdRasGRP1-HA to overexpress C-terminally HA epitope-tagged rat RasGRP1. With this approach, >90% of the cells were infected. Fig. 5A shows the levels of expression of the recombinant protein after a 48-h infection at different multiplicities of infection. The tagged rat RasGRP1 protein migrated slightly slower than the endogenous mouse RasGRP1 protein, probably because of the presence of the HA tag. We noticed that the levels of endogenous RasGRP1 were lower in infected cells compared with control keratinocytes. This was evident not only for the RasGRP1-HA overexpressor, but also in keratinocytes infected with the AdLacZ control vector, although to a much lesser extent. Although normal mouse keratinocytes in low Ca2+ medium (0.04 mm) showed characteristics of basal cell morphology, infection with AdRasGRP1 caused significant rounding and detachment of the cells (Fig. 5B). When mouse keratinocytes were analyzed by staining with phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton, we observed that ectopic expression of RasGPR1 caused the disappearance of actin stress fibers (Fig. 5C). To assess whether these changes were causing apoptosis, we monitored three parameters that are associated with the apoptotic process: cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP, externalization of phosphatidylserine (annexin V binding), and DNA fragmentation (hypodiploid DNA or sub-G1 peak). As shown in Fig. 5A, RasGRP1 overexpression resulted in increased cleavage of PARP, indicating caspase activation. Furthermore, by labeling with annexin V and propidium iodide, we observed an increase in both early apoptosis (binding of annexin V to the plasma membrane with no propidium iodide staining of the nucleus) and late apoptosis (annexin V and propidium iodide staining) after 48 h of infection with AdRasGRP1 (Fig. 5D). In contrast, cell cultures infected with the control adenovirus (AdLacZ) displayed a considerably lower number of cells staining positive for annexin V and/or propidium iodide (Fig. 5D). DNA content analysis of the cell population attached to the dishes at 48 h post-infection showed that the hypodiploid peak (sub-G1), which corresponds to cells with fragmented DNA due to apoptotic degradation, was significantly higher in cells overexpressing RasGRP1 (15.29 ± 2.12%, n = 3) compared with control (LacZ) cells (0.35 ± 0.19%, n = 3) (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results confirm that RasGRP1 overexpression induces apoptosis in primary keratinocytes. Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK Cascade in Response to RasGRP1 and TPA—Activation of Ras in the epidermis selectively activates the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade (27Dajee M. Tarutani M. Deng H. Cai T. Khavari P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Tarutani M. Cai T. Dajee M. Khavari P.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 319-323PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that RasGRP1 overexpression caused a significant increase in the levels of active Ras in primary keratinocytes (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, the level of active phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK was significantly elevated in primary keratinocytes infected with AdRasGPR1 (Fig. 6A). No changes were observed in the total amount of ERK protein (Fig. 6A), indicating that the increment in phospho-ERK was the result of phosphorylation and not of up-regulation of ERK levels in the cells. When cells overexpressing RasGRP1 were treated with 1 μm TPA for a short period of time (15 min), a further and robust increase in ERK phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 6B). However, this increase was sensitive to PKC inhibition by GF109203X treatment. To investigate this, we examined the effect of TPA on Raf-1, the first step in the cascade downstream of Ras activation. Raf-1 was analyzed by measuring the level of phospho-Ser388, a phosphorylation that is absolutely required for activation of Raf-1 and that closely coincides with Raf-1 kinase activity (29Mason C.S.

https://openalex.org/W1996893183,"β-Alanine synthase (βAS) is the final enzyme of the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway, which is responsible for the breakdown of pyrimidine bases, including several anticancer drugs. In eukaryotes, βASs belong to two subfamilies, which exhibit a low degree of sequence similarity. We determined the structure of βAS from Saccharomyces kluyveri to a resolution of 2.7 Å. The subunit of the homodimeric enzyme consists of two domains: a larger catalytic domain with a dizinc metal center, which represents the active site of βAS, and a smaller domain mediating the majority of the intersubunit contacts. Both domains exhibit a mixed α/β-topology. Surprisingly, the observed high structural homology to a family of dizinc-dependent exopeptidases suggests that these two enzyme groups have a common origin. Alterations in the ligand composition of the metal-binding site can be explained as adjustments to the catalysis of a different reaction, the hydrolysis of an N-carbamyl bond by βAS compared with the hydrolysis of a peptide bond by exopeptidases. In contrast, there is no resemblance to the three-dimensional structure of the functionally closely related N-carbamyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolases. Based on comparative structural analysis and observed deviations in the backbone conformations of the eight copies of the subunit in the asymmetric unit, we suggest that conformational changes occur during each catalytic cycle. β-Alanine synthase (βAS) is the final enzyme of the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway, which is responsible for the breakdown of pyrimidine bases, including several anticancer drugs.

In most living organisms, the degradation of uracil and thymine is achieved by the three-step reaction sequence of the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway. The first and rate-limiting enzyme is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NADP+), EC 1.3.1.2), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of uracil and thymine to the corresponding dihydropyrimidines (Scheme 1). In the second step, dihydropyrimidinase (EC 3.5.2.2) generates N-carbamyl-β-alanine and N-carbamyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively, via reversible hydrolytic cleavage of the dihydropyrimidine ring. β-Alanine synthase (βAS 1The abbreviations used are: βASβ-alanine synthaseSkβASS. kluyveri β-alanine synthaseDCaseN-carbamyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolaseSeMetselenomethionineMES4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acidSGAPS. griseus aminopeptidaseAPAPA. proteolytica aminopeptidaseCPG2carboxypeptidase G2 (Pseudomonas sp.)PepTpeptidase T (S. typhimurium)PepVpeptidase V (L. delbrueckii).1The abbreviations used are: βASβ-alanine synthaseSkβASS. kluyveri β-alanine synthaseDCaseN-carbamyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolaseSeMetselenomethionineMES4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acidSGAPS. griseus aminopeptidaseAPAPA. proteolytica aminopeptidaseCPG2carboxypeptidase G2 (Pseudomonas sp.)PepTpeptidase T (S. typhimurium)PepVpeptidase V (L. delbrueckii).; N-carbamoyl-β-alanine amidohydrolase and β-ureidopropionase, EC 3.5.1.6), catalyzes the third and final step: the hydrolysis of the N-carbamylated β-amino acids to β-alanine or aminoisobutyrate under the release of carbon dioxide and ammonia (1Wasternack C.

The key role of the pyrimidine catabolic pathway is the regulation of the pyrimidine pool in the cell and thus the maintenance of a balanced supply of precursors for nucleic acid synthesis. This pathway is also the main clearance route for cytotoxic pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, which are widely used for the treatment of a variety of common tumors such as colorectal, head/neck, and breast cancer (2Heggie G.D. Sommadossi J.P. Cross D.S. Huster W.J. Diasio R.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2203-2206PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes of the pyrimidine catabolic pathway have therefore a considerable influence on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these anti-tumor agents (3Milano G. Etienne M.-C. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 2295-2297PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the pathway provides the cell with β-alanine, which is an essential component of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and hence of coenzyme A and acyl carrier protein (4Cronan Jr., J.E. Littel K.J. Jackowski S. ).J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of pantothenic acid occurs in bacteria, yeast, and plants, whereas animals obtain it through their diet. Nevertheless, β-alanine biosynthesis is also of critical importance in animal tissue. Because it is widely distributed in the central nervous system of vertebrates and is a structural analog of γ-amino-n-butyric acid and glycine, major inhibitory neurotransmitters (5Enna S.J. Gallagher J.P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1983; 24: 181-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), β-alanine itself has been suggested to be involved in synaptic transmissions. Recent studies showed that β-alanine activates the same system of receptors on the membranes of rat sacral dorsal commissural nuclei as glycine (6Wang D.-S. Zhu H.-L. Li J.-S. Int. J. Neurosci. 2003; 113: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In humans, abnormal β-alanine production is associated with neural dysfunction, seizures, and death (7van Gennip A.H. Abeling N.G.G.M. Vreken P. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reductive degradation of uracil and thymine represents the major pathway providing β-alanine in plants and filamentous fungi and the sole source of β-alanine in mammalian tissues (8Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas microorganisms produce it mostly via direct α-decarboxylation of l-aspartate (9Williamson J.M. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8074-8082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). βAS is an amidohydrolase that acts on an N-carbamylated β-amino acid substrate. Based on the comparison of the primary structures and sequence phylogenetic analysis of βASs and related amidohydrolases, these enzymes can be assigned to one of three subfamilies (10Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of eukaryotic βASs belong to one subfamily, with pairwise sequence identities as low as 55%. βAS from the yeast Saccharomyces kluyveri (SkβAS) shares only a limited sequence similarity with these enzymes, but is instead closely related to bacterial N-carbamyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolases (30-40% sequence identity), which belong to the second subfamily. Although the involvement of the bacterial enzymes in pyrimidine catabolism is questionable because many of these enzymes cannot use N-carbamyl-β-alanine as substrate, genetic studies have clearly shown that SkβAS represents the final enzyme in the pyrimidine degradation pathway. A yeast βAS mutant was no longer able to grow on N-carbamyl-β-alanine as the sole nitrogen source (10Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gojković Z. Paracchini S. Piskur J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 431: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a functional pyrimidine degradation pathway makes S. kluyveri exceptional among the Saccharomyces species. The third subfamily of amidohydrolases consists of bacterial and archaebacterial N-carbamyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolases (DCases), with a pairwise sequence identity as low as 20%. With the recent determination of the crystal structures of the DCases from two Agrobacterium species, this subfamily has thus far been the only one for which structural models are available (12Nakai T.

Biol. 2001; 306: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hydrolytic reactions similar to that catalyzed by βAS frequently involve a divalent metal ion. Metal analyses performed for the rat and maize enzymes suggested that both contain Zn2+ ions (14Kvalnes-Krick K.L. Traut T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5686-5693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Walsh T.A. Green S.B. Larrinua I.M. Schmitzer P.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetic studies demonstrated that rat βAS is an allosteric enzyme with positive cooperativity toward the substrate N-carbamyl-β-alanine, which triggers a change in the oligomeric state from homohexamer to homododecamer, whereas the presence of the reaction product β-alanine induces the dissociation into inactive trimers (16Matthews M.M. Traut T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7232-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two characterized plant βASs exist as homodecamers at pH 7, with subunit molecular masses comparable with those of the mammalian enzymes (43-45 kDa) (15Walsh T.A. Green S.B. Larrinua I.M. Schmitzer P.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, SkβAS is a homodimer, and kinetic studies do not support an allosteric regulation of the enzyme. Analysis of its metal-binding capabilities remain inconclusive. 2S. Lundgren, Z. Gojković, J. Piškur, and D. Dobritzsch, unpublished data.2S. Lundgren, Z. Gojković, J. Piškur, and D. Dobritzsch, unpublished data. Here, we report the crystal structure of recombinant SkβAS determined to 2.7-Å resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. The structure reveals a binuclear zinc center representing the active site of the enzyme. The overall fold is not related to that of bacterial DCases of the third subfamily of amidohydrolases, but to a family of dizinc-dependent exopeptidases. Purification and Crystallization—The overexpression and purification of native and selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted SkβASs were carried out as described (10Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dobritzsch D. Gojković Z. Andersen B. Piskur J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1267-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Crystals of both proteins were obtained at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Briefly, a 6-μl drop of an equal volume of the protein solution (4.0-4.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) and of the reservoir solution was equilibrated against 1 ml of either 0.88 m trisodium citrate, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0), and 5% (v/v) dioxane or 1.0 m trisodium citrate, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), and 5% (v/v) dioxane. The crystals appeared after 5-7 days and belonged to space group P21. Crystals of native SkβAS showed cell parameters of a = 117.2 Å, b = 77.1 Å, c = 225.5 Å, and β = 95.0°, with eight molecules in the asymmetric unit. SeMet-substituted SkβAS crystals exhibited a ∼4-fold smaller unit cell (a = 61.0 Å, b = 77.9 Å, c = 110.1 Å, and β = 97.2°), with only two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data Collection and Phasing—Prior to data collection, all crystals of SkβAS were flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. A cryoprotectant was not required. Native data were collected to 2.7-Å resolution on beamline ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using an ADSC Q4R CCD detector. A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was performed on a single crystal of SeMet-substituted SkβAS. A fluorescence spectrum was recorded, and data for multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing were collected to 2.8-Å resolution at beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at three different wavelengths: λ1 = 0.9792 Å and λ2 = 0.9794 Å near the SeK edge to maximize the anomalous f ″ and dispersive f′ signals, respectively, and λ3 = 0.9393 Å as a remote data set. All data sets were processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA of the CCP4 suite of programs (18Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). Structure factors were derived from the reflection intensities with the program TRUNCATE (18Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). Details for the data collection and processing are given in Table I. Using only the peak data, 15 of the possible 16 selenium positions were automatically determined with the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), and an initial electron density map and a partial C-α trace model were obtained after statistical density modification implemented in the program RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). All three data sets were combined and scaled using SCALEIT (18Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) prior to the refinement of the heavy atom positions, occupancies, and temperature factors with SHARP (21de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). The phasing statistics are given in Table I. The anomalous residual map calculated after the first refinement cycle revealed the position of the sixteenth selenium in the asymmetric unit, which was included in the refinement. The resulting electron density map was further improved by density modification and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging using DM (22Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The protein model for SeMet-substituted SkβAS was built with the graphics program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and the first cycle of rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and positional and temperature factor refinement was performed with the program CNS (24Brünger A.T.

Cycles of manual corrections of the model and TLS and restrained maximum likelihood refinement as implemented in REFMAC Version 5.0 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A total of 68 water molecules were added, and one molecule of each Tris and β-aminoisobutyrate were fitted into appropriately shaped remaining density peaks of an |Fo| - |Fc| map. Furthermore, one dithiothreitol molecule was added to the model, covalently attached via a disulfide bridge to Cys168 in chain A, as the modification became apparent in the electron density map. The values for Rcryst and Rfree after refinement were 23.3 and 28.1%, respectively.Table IData collection and refinement statistics Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.

Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that the two protomers in the asymmetric unit of SeMet-substituted SkβAS crystals are not structurally equivalent due to different angles between the domains, the following search protocol was used. First, we positioned four dimers of the dimerization domain in the asymmetric unit of the native SkβAS crystals and thereafter the eight catalytic domains. The structure of native SkβAS was refined to 2.7-Å resolution using one cycle of rigid body refinement in REFMAC Version 5.0 and then alternating cycles of model building with the program O and TLS and restrained refinement (REFMAC Version 5.0), resulting in final values of 20.8% for Rcryst and 26.6% for Rfree. The same sets of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging restraints as for the SeMet-substituted protein were applied. Both models have good stereochemistry, as determined by the program PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). There are no non-glycine residues with forbidden combinations of dihedral angles of the peptide backbone. The refinement statistics for both structures are given in Table I. Comparisons between SkβAS and structurally related aminopeptidases from Streptomyces griseus and Aeromonas proteolytica (Protein Data Bank codes 1F2O and 1CP6, respectively), carboxypeptidase G2 (code 1CG2), peptidases T and V (codes 1FNO and 1LFW, respectively), and aminopeptidase A (code 1GYT) were accomplished using the program TOP (28Lu G.

Comparison of the final models revealed that the backbone architectures of the subunits are essentially the same, and the observed differences in domain arrangement (discussed below) between the subunits of SeMet-substituted SkβAS do not exceed those observed in the crystals of native SkβAS. For this reason, the following analysis of the three-dimensional structure is based on the model for the larger unit cell, which has been refined to a slightly higher resolution. The SkβAS gene encodes a polypeptide chain of 455 amino acids. The electron density for the large cell model is continuous from residue 19 in chain D, residue 23 in chains B and E, residue 26 in chain G, and residue 18 in the remaining chains. The lack of electron density for the N-terminal stretches of amino acids can be attributed to their mobility because N-terminal sequencing of SkβAS from dissolved crystals revealed that these residues (except Met1) are present in the protein. The C-terminal tag of eight histidine residues does not adopt a defined structure and is not visible in the map. The final model also includes two Zn2+ ions/subunit and a total of 519 water molecules. The model for SeMet-substituted SkβAS also contains one molecule of Tris bound close to Arg51 on the surface of chain A and one molecule of dithiothreitol covalently attached to Cys168 near the active site of the same chain. The three-dimensional structure of the SkβAS subunit is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a. The subunit consist of two domains: a larger catalytic domain that contains all zinc- and most putative substrate-binding residues and a smaller dimerization domain. Catalytic Domain—The catalytic domain comprises residues 2-246 and 365-455 and has a mixed three-layer α/β/α-sandwich architecture. The central mixed β-sheet consists of eight strands (strand order: s1, s2, s4, s3, s5, s8, s6, s7; strands s2, s6, and s7 are antiparallel to the others) and can be divided into three parts. The first half of the sheet forms a closely packed unit with only a slight twist between the strands. The positioning of the N terminus of helix h3 between the C termini of strands s3 and s5 separates this unit from the second one, comprising strands s5 and s8, which are more twisted than the first four strands. The curvature of the β-sheet at strands s6 and s7 is even more pronounced. Only the N-terminal part of strand s6 interacts with strand s8, whereas the C-terminal part is involved in hydrogen bonds to an additional strand, strand sIII, which is oriented almost perpendicular to the second unit. The central sheet is flanked on one side by four long α-helices, whereas two shorter α-helices are packed against its opposite face. Besides four additional α-helices, the catalytic domain also contains two 310-helical segments and a β-hairpin located on the surface of the protein. Dimerization Domain—The dimerization domain (residues 247-364) is inserted between strands s6 and sIII of the catalytic domain and folds into a four-stranded antiparallel sheet flanked on one side by two long α-helices. A two-amino acid-long loop segment splits one of the strands into two (strands Ds2-1 and Ds2-2). A short 310-helix and two β-strands are the only additional secondary structure elements. There is one cis-peptide bond in the structure, between Lys304 and Pro305, which creates a sharp turn in the loop following strand Ds2-2. The interactions between the subunits in the SkβAS dimer involve van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonding and lead to 2280 Å2 (∼12%) of buried surface of the monomer. The contacts are mediated mostly via structural elements of the dimerization domain (Fig. 1b). Strands Ds2-2 of both subunits are"

Glucocorticoids, acting through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), are frequently used to treat certain malignancies and are growth inhibitive, but the relationship between GR activity and p27 status has not been explored. We have therefore examined GR-dependent transcriptional activation, receptor phosphorylation, and glucocorticoid-dependent growth inhibition in p27-deficient (p27-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We find that GR transcriptional enhancement as well as receptor phosphorylation at two putative cyclin-dependent kinase sites are elevated in p27-/- MEFs, relative to control cells. This increased GR transcriptional activation appears to be mediated through the GR N terminus, and coexpression of the GR N-terminal coactivator, DRIP150, further enhanced GR-dependent transcriptional activation. Furthermore, p27-/- MEFs are partially resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids. Thus, p27 appears to be an important element in the GR transcription and growth inhibitory responses. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is frequently inactivated in human cancers.

GR is phosphorylated in the absence of hormone, with additional phosphorylation occurring in conjunction with agonist but not antagonist binding (3Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Bodwell J.E. Munck A.

Among the phosphorylation sites that have been identified in the mouse GR N terminus, two sites at which increased phosphorylation is observed on hormone binding, Ser-212 and Ser-220, are consensus cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) sites and can be phosphorylated by Cdk in vitro (5Bodwell J.E.

These findings strongly suggest that changes in the activity of Cdk render GR differentially responsive to glucocorticoid treatment by affecting receptor phosphorylation. Cdk proteins are a family composed of a regulatory cyclin subunit associated with a catalytic kinase subunit. Regulation of Cdk activity is accomplished by subunit assembly and through proteins that activate (Cdk activators) or inhibit (Cdk inhibitors or CKI) kinase function. The prototype CKI is p27Kip1 (hereafter referred to as p27), which was first identified as a protein that bound and inhibited cyclin E-Cdk2 activity and has been shown subsequently to regulate cell cycle progression by controlling Cdk assembly and activity (11Toyoshima H.

Overexpression of p27 in cultured cells induces a G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas its ablation increases the number of cells entering S-phase and delays withdrawal from the cell cycle when mitogens are removed (15Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Mice lacking p27 grow larger than their wild-type littermates, consistent with a role of p27 in cellular proliferation (16Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M.

Many anti-mitogenic signals lead to the accumulation of p27, which in turn inhibits Cdk activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. For example, the anti-mitogenic effect of glucocorticoids in fibroblasts and certain osteosarcoma cell lines (e.g. SAOS2) is a result, in part, of an increase in the levels of CKI, including p27 (18Rogatsky I.

Because p27 controls cell division, the dysregulation of p27 has been implicated in oncogenesis (22Bloom J. Pagano M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 24Sgambato A.

Indeed, p27 is frequently inactivated in human cancers, which correlates with tumor aggressiveness and a poor prognosis (25Catzavelos C. Tsao M.S. DeBoer G. Bhattacharya N. Shepherd F.A. Slingerland J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 684-688PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tan P. Cady B. Wanner M. Worland P. Cukor B. Magi-Galluzzi C. Lavin P. Draetta G. Pagano M. Loda M.

Thus, p27 is an important regulator of Cdk activity, which affects cell cycle entry and exit as well as the phosphorylation of many substrates (potentially including GR). As glucocorticoid-dependent growth inhibition involves increased p27, we wanted to investigate the reciprocal pathway in which p27 affects GR activity. To this end we examined GR transcriptional regulation, receptor phosphorylation, and glucocorticoid-dependent growth inhibition using primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from p27-deficient mice. Murine Embryo Fibroblast (MEF) Generation and Cell Cultivation—MEFs were generated from 14-day postcoitum mouse embryos of p27-/+ heterozygote mating. Embryos were harvested, the heads and internal organs were removed, and carcasses were minced using a scalpel in a Petri dish containing fresh medium. The minced embryos were incubated with trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min, triturated through an 18-guage needle, and then placed in a 15-cm tissue culture dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 10 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Cellgro), and 2 mml-glutamine (Cellgro). Cells were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then counted and replated to a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. A portion of the primary cells was frozen and stored at -80 °C whereas other portions were split every 3 days at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. Primary cells of fewer than six passages were used in all experiments. Genotyping—To isolate total genomic DNA from mouse embryos, the head from a single mouse embryo was lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 4 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 55 °C for 14-18 h. The DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and used as a template for genotyping via PCR (16Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O.

Immunoblotting—Cell extracts from MEFs were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon paper (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 110 V for 80 min in Tris/glycine transfer buffer. The membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated in the blocking buffer with primary antibody at room temperature for 2-4 h (1:500 for the p27 mouse monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen; catalog no. 25020); 1:100 dilution of a tissue culture supernatant for the GR mouse monoclonal antibody, BuGR2 (a gift from Keith Yamamoto); and 1:1000 for the Cdk2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (a gift from Michele Pagano). The membranes were washed three times for 10 min in TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and twice in TBS. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and washed five times for 10 min in TBS/0.1% Triton X-100; this was followed by TBS, and membranes were developed with an ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—The GR monoclonal antibody, BuGR2, was used for immunoprecipitation. The antibody was prebound to protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C for 1.5 h, and washed twice with PBS to remove unbound antibody. BuGR2-coated beads were incubated with cell extracts (1 mg of total protein in lysis buffer per sample) at 4 °C for 3 h on a rocking platform, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed five times in PBS buffer and twice in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The beads were then boiled in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against total mouse GR (BuGR2) or GR phosphorylation state-specific antibodies, mGR-Ser-212-P and mGR-Ser-220-P (6Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cdk2 Activity Assay—Protein extracts were prepared from a sub-confluent 10-cm plate of wild-type and p27-/- MEFs. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 10 min, on ice, in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.8% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and incubated with 30 μl of protein A/G agarose beads prebound with rabbit anti-Cdk2 antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. One-fifth of the beads were removed and boiled in the same volume of 2× SDS sample buffer for 3 min and used to monitor the amount of Cdk2 immunoprecipitated by immunoblotting. The remaining beads were washed in buffer K (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) three times and resuspended in 30 μl of buffer K. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C after adding 8 μl of 1 mg/ml histone H1, 2.5 μl of 1 mm ATP, and 7.5 μCi of [32P]-γ-ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The samples were separated using 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE, fixed, and dried, and autoradiography was performed. Transfection of MEFs—The MEFs were seeded onto 35-mm plates (1 × 105 cells) in DMEM medium for 2 days and refed in phenol red-free DMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine 2 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using 7 μl of Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) (4 μl of Lipofectamine and 3 μl of the PLUS reagent) per 35-mm dish, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA transfected is held constant in each transfection using the corresponding empty vector. Cells were allowed to recover for 12 h and treated with 100 nm dexamethasone or an ethanol vehicle for 18 h. If no treatment was indicated, cells were harvested 18 h after transfection. Transfected cells were washed once in PBS and harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was quantified in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm DTT, using an LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) and 1 mm d-luciferin as substrate. The transcriptional activity of GR and Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (an internal control for transfection efficiency) and to protein concentration as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Wild-type and p27-/- cells were cultured with dexamethasone (100 nm) or an ethanol vehicle for 48 h. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1% fetal calf serum in PBS, and fixed by adding 5 ml of 80% ethanol (at -20 °C) to the solution with continuous vortexing. Fixed cells were pelleted and resuspended in 375 μl of 1% fetal calf serum-PBS. A 4× propidium iodide solution (200 μg of propidium iodide/ml in 38 mm sodium citrate) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml RNase A. Nuclear-emitted fluorescence was measured under a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined. p27 Status Affects GR Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation—To examine the effect of p27 on GR transcriptional activation, we transiently transfected early passage “primary” wild-type and p27-/- MEFs with a GR-responsive reporter plasmid and assessed GR transcriptional activation as a function of dexamethasone concentration. Both wild-type and p27-/-MEFs contained equivalent amounts of endogenous murine GR (Fig. 1A). Relative to the wild-type cells, the p27-/- MEFs displayed an increase of greater than 2-fold in GR transcriptional enhancement after dexamethasone stimulation (Fig. 1B). The maximum GR transcriptional response was achieved at 10-7m dexamethasone in both wild-type and p27-/- MEFs (Fig. 1B). The level of basal GR-mediated transcriptional activation was not affected by p27 expression. Thus, GR is more efficient at engaging in the interactions necessary for transcriptional activation in the p27-/- MEFs compared with wild-type cells. As expected, the total Cdk2 activity is elevated in p27-deficient cells (Fig. 2A). Because our previous results suggested that GR Ser-212 and Ser-220 were substrates for Cdk2 phosphorylation in vitro, we next examined the phosphorylation status of GR at Ser-212 and Ser-220 using GR phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (6Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous studies on human GR, the murine GR displayed a significant basal level of phosphorylation at Ser-212 but not at Ser-220 (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of both residues is increased with dexamethasone treatment, particularly at Ser-220. Significantly, a greater dexamethasone-dependent phosphorylation at both Ser-220 and Ser-212 was evident in the p27-deficient cells as compared with control MEFs expressing p27 (see Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4 in the top and middle panels). This increased GR phosphorylation is not a function of alterations in expression of the receptor between lines, because equal amounts of GR were present as determined by immunoblotting for total GR (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Furthermore, dexamethasone dependence increased phosphorylation of GR Ser-220 and Ser-212, two putative Cdk sites in p27-/- cells, correlated with increased dexamethasone-dependent transcriptional activation (Fig. 2C). To further examine the effect of p27 on GR transcriptional activation, we transiently transfected wild-type and p27-/- MEFs with GR derivatives expressing the individual activation functions and assessed GR transcriptional activation. One GR derivative contains AF-1 and the DNA binding domain from amino acids 1-525 (N525) but lacks AF-2, whereas others express either the isolated GR AF-1 region residues 106-237 linked to the Gal4-DNA binding domain or the reciprocal receptor derivative containing the GR AF-2, including the ligand-binding domain fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Fig. 3A). As was the case for the full-length receptor (Figs. 1B and 2C), the transcriptional activation of both the GR N525 and the Gal4-GR AF-1 derivatives was increased by approximately 2-fold, whereas the Gal4-GR AF-2 activity was decreased by one-half in p27-/- cells relative to the wild-type cells (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings suggest that distinct GR transcriptional regulatory functions are differentially affected by p27. Therefore, the loss of p27 could potentially increase or decrease GR response depending on the requirements for AF-1 or AF-2 at a given target gene response element. To determine whether p27 facilitates functional interactions, we transiently transfected wild-type and p27-/- MEFs with the GR AF-1 coactivator, DRIP150 (28Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Coexpression of DRIP150 should further activate AF-1, thereby increasing GR transcriptional enhancement, relative to cells not overexpressing DRIP150, and allow us to compare DRIP150 induction of GR activity in the presence and absence of p27. If p27 and the resulting alterations in GR phosphorylation were important for AF-1 interaction with DRIP150, then the absolute level of GR transcriptional activation should be greater in the p27-/-versus the wild-type cells. As shown in Fig. 4, this appears to be the case. In the p27-/- MEFs, the total GR transcriptional activity is greater when DRIP150 is overexpressed than in wild-type MEFs. The fold induction in GR transcriptional activation by DRIP150 overexpression is also slightly elevated, 1.9-fold induction by DRIP150 in p27-/- MEFs versus 1.5-fold induction by DRIP150 in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4). Thus, the absolute GR transcriptional activity is enhanced by DRIP150 overexpression in p27-deficient cells, suggesting that the loss of p27 expression facilitates the formation of a functional GR-DRIP150 complex, perhaps through alterations in GR and/or DRIP150 phosphorylation. p27-/- MEFs Are Partially Resistant to Growth Inhibitory Effects of Glucocorticoids—We next examined whether the p27 status affected glucocorticoid-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation. Previous results from our laboratory have suggested that the induction of p27 by GR is part of the growth inhibitory pathway evoked by glucocorticoids in some cell types. To test the contribution of p27 to GR-dependent growth inhibition, the cell cycle distribution of wild-type and p27-/- MEFs cultured in the presence or absence of dexamethasone for 48 h was assessed by flow cytometry. Consistent with the growth inhibitory role of p27 in the cell cycle, a greater percentage of p27-/- cells are found in S-phase, relative to wild-type cells. With glucocorticoid treatment, the percentage of cells in S-phase decreased by more than 3-fold in the wild-type MEFs but only 1.4-fold in p27-/- MEFs (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the lack of p27 renders cells partially resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of glucocorticoids. GR inhibits cell proliferation in certain cell types by increasing the levels of CKI, such as p21 and p27. Previous results from our laboratory and others have shown that GR-mediated cell cycle arrest involves enhanced expression of p21 and p27. This study suggests that p27 expression also affects GR activity. In the absence of p27, we observed increased Cdk activity, increased hormone-dependent phosphorylation of GR at Ser-212 and Ser-220 (Ser-203 and Ser-211 in the human GR numbering scheme), residues phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk, and modulation of GR hormone-dependent transcriptional activation. The GR activation domains respond to the lack of p27 differentially. AF-1 activity is increased, whereas AF-2 activity appears to be decreased in the absence of p27. Our findings support a model whereby endogenous p27 normally restricts transcriptional activity of GR AF-1 while promoting AF-2 activity such that the loss of p27 would enhance GR activation at promoters regulated by AF-1 and reduce GR response at AF-2-dependent promoters. A well studied function of GR is the induction of apoptosis, which appears to require DNA binding-dependent gene activation by the receptor (29Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thymocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing GR show increased GR activity and initiate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis at a hormone concentration that is 10-fold lower than in thymocytes from wild-type mice (30Reichardt H.M. Umland T. Bauer A. Kretz O. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9009-9017Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consequently, the strength of GR transcriptional activation can determine the degree of activation-dependent events such as thymocyte apoptosis. As GR activation appears elevated in p27-/- MEFs relative to wild-type cells, we would predict that thymocytes from p27-/- mice would be more sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, provided that the presumptive pro-apoptotic genes induced by GR are largely AF-1-dependent. However, it has been previously reported that thymocyte apoptosis induced by GR is not affected by p27 status when assayed at a superphysiological hormone concentration (1 μm dexamethasone) (16Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A. Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In light of the findings that glucocorticoid-dependent apoptosis correlates with GR activation potential and that p27 status serves to modulate the transcriptional activity of the receptor, especially at low physiological levels of hormone, it will be interesting to re-evaluate GR-induced apoptosis in p27-/- and control thymocytes. Lack of p27 also affects the ability of the receptor to inhibit cell proliferation and renders cells partially resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids. Recent reports suggest that GR activity is also modulated by the CKI p16INK (31Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In an elegant set of experiments, MEFs in which the p16 gene has been deleted exhibited increased GR activity and reduced sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of dexamethasone relative to wild-type cells, reminiscent of the effect observed in p27-/- MEFs. Thus, the status of CKI family members can have profound effects on GR transcriptional and anti-mitogenic responses. The effect of p27 on GR transcriptional enhancement, receptor phosphorylation, and susceptibility of cells to the anti-proliferative effects of dexamethasone most likely result from changes in Cdk activity. These changes may directly affect GR phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of other substrates that modulate GR transcriptional responses. This observation might have important implications for glucocorticoid treatment of certain malignancies, which may exhibit different sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects of glucocorticoids, depending on whether or not the cancer cells express p27 (32Blain S.W.

It also consists of two large cytoplasmic domains as follows: a C-terminal transmitter domain, which includes the typical sequence motifs of sensor kinases, and an N-terminal domain, which is part of the input domain (Fig. 1) (3Zimmann P.

Phosphorylated KdpE exhibits increased affinity for a 23-bp sequence upstream of the canonical -35 and -10 regions of the kdpFABC promoter and thereby triggers kdpFABC expression (6Sugiura A.

Short versions of KdpD have been found in cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. (13Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T.

It is still unclear whether these short KdpD proteins function alone or whether they interact with the transmitter domain of another sensor kinase. Such an interaction is conceivable, because it has been shown that the separately produced N-terminal domain of KdpD (KdpD/1-395) is able to complement the N-terminal truncated derivative KdpD/Δ12-395 in vivo and in vitro (11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a chimeric Anabaena/E. coli KdpD protein (Anacoli KdpD) comprising the N-terminal domain of Anabaena KdpD and the C-terminal domain plus the four transmembrane domains of E. coli KdpD functionally interacts with E. coli KdpE and activates kdpFABC expression in E. coli (14Ballal A.D. Heermann R. Jung K. Gassel M. Apte K. Altendorf K. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), underlining the similarity of the N-terminal domains among different bacteria and their importance for the correct function of KdpD. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of E. coli KdpD alone causes semi-constitutive expression of the kdpFABC operon. Furthermore, the first evidence is provided that the N-terminal domain of KdpD stabilizes the binding of KdpE∼P to the DNA. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP, 125I-labeled protein A, [α-32P]UTP, 32Pi, E. coli RNA polymerase, RNA guard RNase inhibitor, and RNase-free nucleotides ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

E. coli strain RH001 was obtained by transducing appropriate P1 phage lysate (19Leder P. Tiemeier D. Enquist L.

In plasmid pBD and pBD3, kdpD or its derivatives were cloned into pBAD18 or pBAD33 (22Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar), respectively, and expression is in both cases under control of the arabinose promoter (5Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K.

Acta. 1998; 1372: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In plasmid pBD/1-395 and pBD3/1-395, three stop codons were inserted at the corresponding site of the kdpD gene, so that only the first 395 amino acids of KdpD are produced (11Heermann R.

Plasmid pBD/1-395/G37A,K38A,T39C 3Amino acid replacements are designated as follows: the one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the residue in the wild-type KdpD or KdpE, respectively. The second letter denotes the amino acid replacement at this position. encodes KdpD/1-395, in which the ATP-binding site is inactivated by amino acid replacements (11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBD/H673Q encodes the KdpD derivative with the inactivated phosphorylation site (KdpD/H673Q) (5Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1415: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In plasmid pPV2, the kdpDE operon is under control of the lac promoter (1Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pPV2/1-395 and pPV2/1-395/D52N were obtained by digestion of plasmid pPV5-3/1-395 (11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with restriction enzymes NsiI and StuI, and the purified fragment was then ligated to similarly treated vector pPV2 or pPV2/D52N (see below), respectively. To obtain a KdpE derivative with an N-terminal 10His tag, the kdpE gene was amplified by synthetic oligonucleotide primers and cloned into vector pET16b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) using the NdeI site, resulting in plasmid pEE, where 10His-kdpE is under control of the T7 promoter. All PCR-generated DNA fragments were verified by sequencing through the ligation junctions in double-stranded plasmid DNA. Plasmid pSM5 encodes the kdpFABC operon. 4K. Altendorf, unpublished data. Plasmid pNK2883 harboring a short version of the transposon Tn10 was used for transposon mutagenesis (24Kleckner N. Bender J. Gottesman S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-specific Site-directed Mutagenesis—Introduction of a codon change corresponding to the replacement of Asp-52 against Asn in KdpE was achieved by PCR using the overlap extension method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). The PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified from the gel, digested with restriction endonucleases ClaI and XmaI, and then ligated to similar treated vector pPV2 (1Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pPV2/D52N. The mutation was verified by sequencing through the ligation junctions in double-stranded plasmid DNA. Determination of kdpFABC Expression—In vivo signal transduction was probed with strains of E. coli HAK006, RH001, and RH003 transformed with the plasmids described. Cells were grown in TY medium (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract) supplemented with NaCl and sucrose as indicated (26Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or minimal media containing the indicated K+ concentrations (27Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-exponential growth phase and harvested by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activity given in Miller units was determined as described (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). Alternatively, expression of kdpFABC was determined in E. coli strains lacking the Trk K+ transport system (E. coli TKV2208, E. coli TKV2209, and E. coli RH004) by quantitative Western blot analysis of the amount of produced KdpFABC complex. These strains were grown at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered minimal medium (27Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 115 mm K+ until the mid-exponential phase, diluted in prewarmed medium of lower K+ concentration, and harvested after 30 min. Then cells were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Quantification of KdpFABC was basically performed following the protocol developed for lactose permease (30Sun J. Wu J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were then blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h. Anti-KdpB antibody was added at a final dilution of 1:5000, and incubation was continued for 1 h. After washing with buffer A, 125I-labeled protein A was added at a final dilution of 1:5000, and incubation was continued for 1 h. After washing thoroughly, the membrane was exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen. Known amounts of purified KdpFABC complex were used to obtain a standard curve. The amount of KdpFABC complex was then quantified using the PhosphorImager SI system by comparison to the standard curve. Cell Fractionation and Preparation of Inverted Membrane Vesicles—E. coli strain TKR2000 transformed with plasmid pPV5-3/1-395(His6) (11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS transformed with plasmid pEE (this study) was grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 1% (w/v) KCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at an A600 nm of ∼1.0 and disrupted by passage through a Ribi cell fractionator at 20,000 pounds/square inch, 5-10 °C, under a constant stream of nitrogen. After removal of intact cells and cell debris (9,000 × g, 10 min), membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 160,000 × g for 60 min. Membrane vesicles were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until use at -80 °C. In case of cells containing KdpE, the cytoplasm was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Purification of KdpD/1-395(6His) and 10His-KdpE—Solubilization, purification, and reconstitution into E. coli phospholipids of KdpD/1-395(6His) was carried out as described before (7Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because KdpD/1-395(6His) is a membrane-attached polypeptide (11Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it was solubilized by detergent and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes using the same protocol as for integral membrane proteins. However, only the outside-located KdpD/1-395(6His) mattered in these experiments. Purification of 10His-KdpE was carried out in buffer E (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 80 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole). Protein was bound batchwise to the resin, which had been equilibrated with buffer E, by incubation of the cytoplasmic proteins and the Ni2+-NTA resin at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein-resin complex was then packed into a column, and unbound protein was removed by washing with buffer E. Bound 10His-KdpE was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 100 mm. Before use, 10His-KdpE was dialyzed against buffer E without KCl and imidazole. Alternatively, KdpE was purified following a method described before (12Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transposon Mutagenesis and Selection of the Mutants—For transposon mutagenesis, E. coli HAK006 was transformed with plasmids pBD3/1-395 and pNK2883. The mutagenesis was carried out in KML complex medium by incubation of the cells at room temperature for 48 h, initiating the transposition. Then the cells were plated on KML medium supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). The expression of the reporter gene lacZ was used as a measure for kdpFABC expression. White colonies (no kdpFABC expression) were isolated and again tested for β-galactosidase activity (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). To make sure that the mutants contain only one transposon, P1 lysates were prepared (19Leder P. Tiemeier D. Enquist L. Science. 1972; 196: 175-177Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and transduced in E. coli HAK006/pBD3/1-395. The loss of plasmid pNK2883 was verified by a negative selection on ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Then the mutants were cured from plasmid pBD3/1-395 by negative selection on chloramphenicol. In Vitro Transcription Experiments—In vitro transcription experiments were done similarly as described (31Wright J.S. Olekhonovich I.N. Touchie G. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6279-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in buffer TXN (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol) in a total volume of 20 μl. To obtain phosphorylated KdpE, purified protein was incubated with 50 mm acetyl phosphate and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h. The PstI/SacI fragment from the plasmid pSM5, containing the kdpFABC promoter/operator region, was used as template. KdpE or KdpE∼P, respectively, was incubated with the DNA template in the presence or absence of reconstituted KdpD/1-395(6His) in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 5 μl of E. coli RNA polymerase (0.5 units) was added. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, heparin, and RNase inhibitor were added in a volume of 5 μl, so the final concentrations are as follows: 1 nm DNA template, 30 nm KdpE or KdpE∼P, 30 nm KdpD/1-395(6His), 50 μg/ml heparin, 200 μm ATP, 200 μm CTP, 200 μm GTP, and 40 μm [α-32P]UTP (10 Ci/mmol). RNase inhibitor was used as recommended by Amersham Biosciences. The reaction was stopped after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C by addition of 5 μl of 5× concentrated stop solution (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 7 m urea, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.5% (w/v) xylene cyanol). Then samples were subjected to a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA). After the run, the gel was dried and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen. The amount of produced RNA was detected using the PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of [32P]Acetyl Phosphate and Phosphorylation of KdpE— Synthesis and determination of [32P]acetyl phosphate was carried out as described before (32Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of purified KdpE (0.2 mg/ml) was carried out in buffer TNaM (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) with 40 mm [32P]acetyl phosphate (8-14 mCi/mmol). The probes were incubated at 30 °C; samples were taken at indicated time points, and the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to 12.5% SDS gels, and after the run, the gels were dried and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen. Phosphorylated proteins were detected and quantified using the PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For mobility shift assays, double-stranded DNA fragments comprising the KdpE-binding site (6Sugiura A. Nakashima K. Tanaka K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Sugiura A. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 356-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were used. These were obtained by annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides. The upper strand sequence (from 5′ to 3′) has the following sequence: 5′-CATTTTTATACTTTTTTTACACCCCGCCCG-3′. After dephosphorylation of the double-stranded DNA with alkaline phosphatase (10 units), phosphorylation was carried out with polynucleotide kinase (10 units) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNA was then purified using the nucleotide removal kit. Binding assays were done with 100 nm DNA and 0-4.5 μm purified KdpE∼P in TNaM buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. KdpD/1-395(6His) (2.5 μm final concentration) in 15 μl of purification buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside), or just purification buffer was added. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 3 μl of sucrose dye solution (50% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue; 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol] was added, and samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. After the run, the gel was dried and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen, and the amount of KdpE∼P-bound DNA was detected using the PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Co-elution of KdpD/1-395 and 10His-KdpE from Ni2+-NTA-Agarose— For co-elution experiments, Ni2+-NTA magnetic agarose beads were used. First, magnetic beads (25 μl of suspension) were washed with 500 μl of distilled water in a 2-ml reaction tube and subsequently collected using a “12-tube magnet.” Then the beads were equilibrated with buffer E (see above), and 100 μl of cytoplasmic fraction containing 10His-KdpE was added (total protein concentration 15 mg/ml). As a control, 100 μl of cytoplasmic fraction containing 10His-OmpR (34Jung K. Hamann K. Revermann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40896-40902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added. The mixture was incubated under gentle movement at 4 °C for 30 min. In parallel, membrane vesicles containing KdpD/1-395 were solubilized with 0.2% (w/v) n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside by stirring on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C at 264,000 × g in a Beckman centrifuge for 30 min. Then 1.6 ml of the supernatant (5 mg/ml total protein concentration) containing KdpD/1-395 was added to Ni2+-NTA-bound 10His-KdpE or 10His-OmpR, respectively, so that the final ratio of each response regulator to KdpD/1-395 was about 1:8. Samples were incubated under gentle movement at room temperature for 150 min before the magnetic beads were collected with the magnet. The beads were washed with 500 μl of buffer E containing 0.04% (w/v) n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. Proteins bound to the beads were then eluted with 25 μl of buffer E containing 0.04% (w/v) n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside and 250 mm imidazole. Beads were removed by the magnet, and the eluted proteins were detected in an immunoblot with antibodies directed against the His tag as well as against KdpD. Analytical Procedures—Protein was assayed by a modified Lowry method (35Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Influence of KdpD/1-395 on the Expression of kdpFABC— The story started with a control experiment in which cells producing the N-terminal domain of KdpD (KdpD/1-395) and KdpE were tested for kdpFABC expression. Surprisingly, high kdpFABC expression levels were detected at any K+ concentration tested. In d"
https://openalex.org/W1963561403,"Aquifex aeolicus, an organism that flourishes at 95 °C, is one of the most thermophilic eubacteria thus far described. The A. aeolicus pyrB gene encoding aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity chromatography to a homogeneous form that could be crystallized. Chemical cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography showed that the protein was a homotrimer of 34-kDa catalytic chains. The activity of A. aeolicus ATCase increased dramatically with increasing temperature due to an increase in kcat with little change in the Km for the substrates, carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate. The Km for both substrates was 30-40-fold lower than the corresponding values for the homologous E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit. Although rapidly degraded at high temperature, the carbamoyl phosphate generated in situ by A. aeolicus carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) was channeled to ATCase. The transient time for carbamoyl aspartate formation was 26 s, compared with the much longer transient times observed when A. aeolicus CPSase was coupled to E. coli ATCase. Several other approaches provided strong evidence for channeling and transient complex formation between A. aeolicus ATCase and CPSase. The high affinity for substrates combined with channeling ensures the efficient transfer of carbamoyl phosphate from the active site of CPSase to that of ATCase, thus preserving it from degradation and preventing the formation of toxic cyanate. Aquifex aeolicus, an organism that flourishes at 95 °C, is one of the most thermophilic eubacteria thus far described. The A. aeolicus pyrB gene encoding aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity chromatography to a homogeneous form that could be crystallized. Chemical cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography showed that the protein was a homotrimer of 34-kDa catalytic chains. The activity of A. aeolicus ATCase increased dramatically with increasing temperature due to an increase in kcat with little change in the Km for the substrates, carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate. The Km for both substrates was 30-40-fold lower than the corresponding values for the homologous E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit. Although rapidly degraded at high temperature, the carbamoyl phosphate generated in situ by A. aeolicus carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) was channeled to ATCase. The transient time for carbamoyl aspartate formation was 26 s, compared with the much longer transient times observed when A. aeolicus CPSase was coupled to E. coli ATCase. Several other approaches provided strong evidence for channeling and transient complex formation between A. aeolicus ATCase and CPSase. The high affinity for substrates combined with channeling ensures the efficient transfer of carbamoyl phosphate from the active site of CPSase to that of ATCase, thus preserving it from degradation and preventing the formation of toxic cyanate. Aquifex aeolicus, one of the most hyperthermophilic eubacteria thus far discovered, is classified as a hydrogen-oxidizing, microaerophilic, obligate chemolithoautotroph (1Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). This marine organism is related to the filamentous bacteria isolated from the hot springs in Yellowstone near the turn of the last century (2Reysenbach L. Wickham G.S. Pace N.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Setchell W.A. Science. 1993; 17: 934-937Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One intriguing question is how unstable metabolites are preserved from thermal degradation in A. aeolicus and other hyperthermophiles. For example, carbamoyl phosphate, a key intermediate in both pyrimidine and arginine biosynthetic pathways, has a half-life of less than 2 s at 100 °C and decomposes to toxic cyanate, a promiscuous alkylating agent (4Allen C. Jones M. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Van de Casteele M. Demarez M. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. Pierarnd A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1177-1183Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, carbamoyl phosphate is used as a substrate, along with aspartate, for the formation of carbamoyl aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase 1The abbreviations used are: ATCaseaspartate transcarbamoylaseCPSasecarbamoyl phosphate synthetaseTEAtriethanolaminePALAN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartateAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: ATCaseaspartate transcarbamoylaseCPSasecarbamoyl phosphate synthetaseTEAtriethanolaminePALAN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartateAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate.; EC 2.1.3.2).Carbamoylphosphate+aspartate→carbamoylaspartate+PiReaction1Reaction 1 Whereas ATCase is a ubiquitous enzyme and the reaction catalyzed is the same in all organisms, this family of proteins is remarkably polymorphic. Bacterial ATCases have been classified into 1) Class A, 480-kDa duodecamers consisting of two catalytic trimers and six subunits that are either dihydroorotase (Thermus aquaticus (6Van de Casteele M. Chen P. Roovers M. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the third enzyme in the pathway, or inactive dihydroorotase homologues (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCase (7Schurr M.J. Vickrey J.F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24490-24498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)); 2) Class B, 310-kDa duodecamers consisting of two catalytic trimers and three regulatory dimers that bind allosteric effectors (e.g. Escherichia coli ATCase (9Wiley D.C. Lipscomb W.N. Nature. 1968; 218: 1119-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)); and 3) Class C, unregulated 100-kDa catalytic trimers (e.g. Bacillus subtilis (10Brabson J.S. Maurizi M.R. Switzer R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)). The core catalytic subunit is common to all known ATCases, because the active sites are composed of residues contributed by adjacent subunits within the trimer (11Lipscomb W.N. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1994; 68: 67-151PubMed Google Scholar).Two possibilities can be envisioned that could account for the preservation of carbamoyl phosphate at elevated temperatures in A. aeolicus and other hyperthermophiles. The hyperthermophilic ATCase may have an unusually high affinity for carbamoyl phosphate and high kcat, so that once formed in the reaction catalyzed by CPSase, it is rapidly converted to stable carbamoyl aspartate. Alternately, ATCase and CPSase may form a complex that allows the direct transfer or channeling of carbamoyl phosphate between active sites, thus sequestering the intermediate and preventing it from escaping into the cellular milieu. Channeling of metabolic intermediates can occur via intramolecular tunnels that serve as a conduit between proteins catalyzing sequential steps in a metabolic pathway. Structural studies have shown that these tunnels exist in several biosynthetic enzymes including tryptophan synthetase (12Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase subunits (13Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the subunits of 5-phosphoryl 1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase (14Kim J. Krahn J. Tomchick D. Smith J. Zlakin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (15Chaudhuri B.N. Lange S.C. Myers R.S. Chittur S.V. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Structure. 2001; 9: 987-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In these cases, the channeling is absolute in the sense that the intermediate generated in situ is used exclusively in the biosynthetic reaction. A more common, but less well understood, channeling mechanism involves the transfer of the intermediates between enzymes that do not form a stable stoichiometric complex (16Orosz F. Ovadi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 915: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This type of channeling is thought to occur in many metabolic pathways (17Agius L. Sherratt H.S.A. Agins L. Sherr S.A. Channeling in Intermediary Metabolism. IX, Portland Press, London1997Google Scholar, 18Ovadi J. Cell Architecture and Metabolic Channeling. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1995: 1093-1105Google Scholar), and although the physical association of the enzymes, a prerequisite for intermediate transfer, is short lived or transient, the efficiency of intermediate transfer can be quite high in these systems.We report here the cloning, expression, and crystallization of A. aeolicus ATCase and a series of criteria to assess intermediate channeling between weakly associated partners. The kinetic properties and channeling studies suggest that the enzyme is particularly well adapted for the efficient utilization of carbamoyl phosphate at elevated temperatures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene; DNA ligase was from Invitrogen; aspartate, carbamoyl phosphate, carbamoyl aspartate, antipyrine, diacetyl monoxime, triethoanolamine (TEA), spectinomycin, pyridoxal phosphate, and sodium borohydride were from Sigma; dimethyl suberimidate was from Pierce; [14C]carbamoyl phosphate (7 μCi/μmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; and N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) was provided by Drs. V. Narayanan and L. Kedda of the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Institutes of Health (Silver Spring, MD).Strains and Plasmids—A. aeolicus chromosomal DNA was a generous gift from Drs. Karl O. Stetter and Robert Huber (Regensburg University). The E. coli strains used were DH5α from Invitrogen and BL21(DE3) (19Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar) from Stratagene. The pRSETB, a His tag expression vector (Invitrogen), was used for the construction of the pAApyrB clone described below. Cotransformation with pSJS1240 vector, which contains the genes coding for AUA isoleucyl tRNA and AGA seryl tRNA representing two rare codons in E. coli (20Kim R. Sandler J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A. Kim S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was used to increase the level of expression of the recombinant proteins.Cloning and Expression of A. aeolicus ATCase—The A. aeolicus pyrB gene was obtained by PCR amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase, 100 pmol of each primer, and 180 ng of A. aeolicus chromosomal DNA as a template. The primers, 5′-CGTTAAAATTAATCAGGGATGAGGAGCTTGATAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGAATATTAATTTCGCTAGGTCCATAAGAATTTG-3′ were complementary to the 5′ and 3′ end of the pyrB gene, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI/BglII sites of pRSETB. For expression, the recombinant plasmid pAApyrB was cotransformed with pSJS1240 into BL21(DE3). The transformants were grown at 37 °C for 18 h in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin.Purification of the A. aeolicus ATCase—The ATCase was expressed as a fusion protein with a 3-kDa His tag polypeptide appended to the amino end of the enzyme. The cells harvested from a 100-ml culture were resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and disrupted by sonication for 30 s in an ice/water bath a total of six times. The cell extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Ni2+-ProBond column (Invitrogen) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl (TN buffer). The column was washed with 20 ml of the same buffer. The A. aeolicus ATCase was eluted with successive 1-ml aliquots of increasing concentrations of imidazole up to 400 mm in TN buffer. The fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Fractions containing pure A. aeolicus ATCase were applied to a Nick Spin Column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, to eliminate NaCl and imidazole from the buffer. A. aeolicus CPSase was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (22Ahuja A. Purcarea C. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45694-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—ATCase activity was measured by the colorimetric method previously described (23Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). When assayed at 37 °C, the reaction contained 1 mm aspartate, 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate, 1-11 μg of the purified enzyme, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in a total volume of 0.3 ml. For routine assays at 75 °C, the concentration of aspartate was increased to 2 mm. The incubation time was 10 min at 37 °C or 1 min at 75 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 ml of the antipyrine/diacetyl monoxime reagent. Substrate saturation curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation or to an equation that incorporates a term for substrate inhibition, v = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S] + [S]2/Ki), where Ki is the substrate inhibition constant.Measurement of Carbamoyl Phosphate Stability—The stability of carbamoyl phosphate and its degradation to cyanate was measured using previously described methods (4Allen C. Jones M. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Carbamoyl phosphate 14C (86,939 dpm/μmol) at a concentration of 10 mm was incubated at 75 °C. Samples (0.5 ml) were withdrawn periodically, chilled on ice, and analyzed by 1) the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 m ammonium chloride and incubating at 100 °C for 5 min to convert both carbamoyl phosphate and cyanate to urea (25Crokaert R. Schram E. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1958; 40: 1093PubMed Google Scholar) or by 2) the addition of 100 μl of 200 mm aspartate and an excess of E. coli ATCase (38 μg) and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min to quantitatively convert residual carbamoyl phosphate to carbamoyl aspartate. The difference in the counts obtained by these two methods represents the cyanate formed by degradation of carbamoyl phosphate. A parallel experiment was conducted in which 20 mm aspartate was also included in the reaction mixture prior to incubation at 75 °C. Samples were acidified by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, dried at 90 °C, and counted to determine whether acid-stable carbamoyl aspartate was formed spontaneously at elevated temperature.Transient Time Measurements—The treatment devised by Easterby (26Easterby J.S. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for coupled enzyme catalyzed reactions was extended to take into consideration the degradation of carbamoyl phosphate at elevated temperature by assuming that the partitioning between ATCase and thermal degradation is directly proportional to the rate of decomposition of carbamoyl phosphate (kd) and to the reciprocal transient time 1/τ for the transfer of carbamoyl phosphate generated in situ by CPSase to the active site of the ATCase domain. The concentrations of carbamoyl aspartate ([CAsp]) and cyanate as a function of time (t) are given by the expressions,[CAsp]=τ-1τ-1+kdVo(t+τe-t/τ+τ)(Eq. 1) [Cyanate]=kdτ-1+kdVo(t+τe-kdt+kd)(Eq. 2) where Vo is the rate of formation of carbamoyl phosphate in μmol/min measured or calculated from the Vmax and the concentration of CPSase; τ is the transient time defined by Easterby (26Easterby J.S. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as equal to Km/V, the Km of ATCase for carbamoyl phosphate, and the velocity of the ATCase (V) calculated from the Vmax and the concentration of the enzyme; and kd is the first order rate constant for the thermal degradation of carbamoyl phosphate determined experimentally.Size Exclusion Chromatography—The molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was determined by size exclusion chromatography (27Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 343-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) on a 1 × 50-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in the presence or absence of 100 mm NaCl. 1 ml of A. aeolicus ATCase at a concentration of 3 mg/ml was applied to the column. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.32 ml/min, and 1.1-ml fractions were collected.Chemical Cross-linking—A reaction mixture containing 35 μg of A. aeolicus ATCase, 10 mm dimethyl suberimidate (28Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and 100 mm TEA, pH 8.5, in a final volume of 40 μl, was incubated at room temperature and quenched at the designated times by the addition of 4 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Preparation of the Pyridoxal Derivative of A. aeolicus ATCase—The reaction mixture consisted of 0.9 mg of A. aeolicus ATCase (0.44 mg/ml) and 4 mg of pyridoxal phosphate in 2 ml of 50 mm TEA, pH 8. After reacting 15 min at room temperature, the derivative was reduced with 70 mg of sodium borohydride (100-fold molar excess). The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C.Sequence Analysis and Molecular Modeling—Sequence comparison and multiple alignment were performed using the GAP and Pileup programs of the GCG software package (29Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7655) Google Scholar). The homology modeling software package MODELLER was used to calculate the structures of the models (30Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The template protein of known structure was the E. coli ATCase (Protein Data Bank codes 6AT1 and 1D09) (31Stevens R.C. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7691-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins. 1999; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Internal consistency checks in the MODELLER4 software package and the program PROCHECK were used to assess the quality of the model.RESULTSIdentification and Sequence Analysis of A. aeolicus ATCase— A Blast search of the recently sequenced A. aeolicus genome revealed an open reading frame that was homologous to the E. coli ATCase catalytic chain, whereas no gene encoding a protein homologous to the E. coli ATCase regulatory chain was identified.With a molecular mass of 34 kDa, A. aeolicus ATCase is shorter by 20 residues than the homologous E. coli catalytic chain. Alignment of the A. aeolicus ATCase with the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 1A) and with the catalytic chains of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa (not shown) indicated that there was 31-41% sequence identity among the four proteins.The tertiary structure of the A. aeolicus ATCase was modeled (Fig. 1B) using the x-ray structure of the E. coli ATCase catalytic trimer as a template. Both the T-state structure (Protein Data Bank code 6AT1) and R-state (Protein Data Bank code 1D09) structure with the bound bisubstrate analog, PALA, were used as tertiary templates, and gave comparable model structures. The α-carbons of the models and of E. coli ATCase were for the most part superimposed with an root mean square deviation of 0.93 and 0.92 Å, for the R and T model structures, respectively. Major deviations in the backbone occur only in regions near major insertions and deletions (ranging from 2 to 12 residues). The active site is among the most highly conserved regions of the molecule. The backbone of the A. aeolicus protein is virtually superimposed on the template structure in this region, and all of the residues involved in substrate binding are conserved. The residues that constitute the interface between the subunits in the E. coli ATCase trimer were for the most part conserved, suggesting that the A. aeolicus ATCase is also trimeric. Thus, the tertiary fold, the oligomeric structure, and the catalytic mechanism probably resemble those of mesophilic ATCases.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of A. aeolicus ATCase— The pyrB gene, encoding A. aeolicus ATCase, was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pRSETB expression vector. This vector appends a His tag to the amino end of the recombinant protein to facilitate purification. The resulting construct, pAApyrB, was cotransformed with the pSJS1240 into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). The soluble protein was expressed at high levels, 40 mg/liter of culture, and could be purified (Fig. 2A) in a single step by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The specific activity of the purified protein, 1,200 μmol/h/mg at 37 °C, increased to 8,000 μmol/h/mg when assayed at 75 °C. Pyramidal crystals (Fig. 2B) of the homogenous protein were obtained by the hanging drop method, paving the way for future x-ray diffraction studies. The ATCase crystals diffract to less than 2 Å.Fig. 2Purification, crystallization, and cross-linking of A. aeolicus ATCase.A, ATCase purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cell-free extract (Ext) was obtained from a 100-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pAApyrB. There was a significant amount of ATCase in the insoluble fraction obtained by high speed centrifugation (Pel). The soluble fraction was applied to a Ni2+ affinity column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The column was washed with 1-ml aliquots of TN buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) containing 100 mm imidazole (lanes 1-3), and the recombinant protein was eluted with TN buffer containing 200 mm imidazole (lanes 4-6) and 400 mm imidazole (lane 7). A series of standard proteins of known molecular mass (Invitrogen) were also run on the gel (Std). B, A. aeolicus ATCase crystals (0.15-mm maximum dimension) of the purified protein were obtained by the hanging drop method using 0.75 m sodium potassium tartrate in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7, as the precipitating agent. C, the time course of the cross-linking reaction was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified ATCase (35 μg) in 100 mm TEA, 100 mm NaCl, was reacted with 10 mm dimethyl suberimidate at 23 °C, and samples were taken for analysis at 0 min (lane 1), 5 min (lane 2), 10 min (lane 3), and 15 min (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subunit Structure—The molecular mass of the recombinant protein determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 37 kDa. When the 3-kDa His tag segment is taken into consideration, the recombinant A. aeolicus ATCase had a molecular mass of 34 kDa, in good agreement with the mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (33,557 Da). The size of the molecule under nondenaturing conditions was determined by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking. Chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (not shown) gave a single species with a molecular mass of 112,800 ± 3,100 Da, indicating that the A. aeolicus ATCase is a trimer. This result was confirmed by chemical cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate. The time course of the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 2C) showed a gradual disappearance of the monomer and the sequential formation of the dimer and then the trimer. Thus, A. aeolicus ATCase is a homotrimer composed of three 34-kDa catalytic chains.Thermostability of A. aeolicus ATCase—The stability of A. aeolicus ATCase (Fig. 3A) was measured by incubating the protein at various temperatures for 5 min and assaying the catalytic activity at 37 °C. The enzyme was found to be very stable up to a temperature of 80 °C, at which point there was a precipitous decline in activity. The temperature at which the protein was 50% inactivated was 87 °C. In another experiment (Fig. 3B), the A. aeolicus enzyme was incubated at 85 °C, and samples were periodically withdrawn for assay. There was a slow exponential inactivation of the protein with a first order rate constant of 0.020 ± 0.004 min-1, corresponding to a half-life of 34.7 min. Since some of the kinetic experiments described below employed E. coli ATCase as a control, its thermostability was also measured. At 70 °C, E. coli ATCase was found to be initially quite stable. However, after 10 min, the catalytic activity began to decrease with a first order rate constant of 0.28 min-1 (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Thermostability of A. aeolicus ATCase.A, purified A. aeolicus ATCase was incubated at the indicated temperatures at a concentration of 0.13 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 5 min. The samples were then chilled on ice, and the residual enzymatic activity was assayed at 37 °C. B, A. aeolicus (•) and E. coli (○) ATCase in the same buffer were incubated at 85 and 70 °C, respectively, and samples were withdrawn at the indicated time intervals, cooled, and assayed at 37 °C. The first order rate constant for thermal inactivation of the A. aeolicus enzyme was calculated from a least squares fit of the curve to a monoexponential equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Carbamoyl Phosphate Stability—As a prelude to the steady state kinetic studies, the stability of carbamoyl phosphate at elevated temperature was measured. Carbamoyl phosphate degradation is not a major concern when assaying mesophilic enzymes at ambient temperature where the substrate is relatively stable (t = 169 min) (4Allen C. Jones M. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, previous studies indicated that at 96 °C, near the growth optimum of A. aeolicus, carbamoyl phosphate has a half-life of only 2 s (5Van de Casteele M. Demarez M. Legrain C. Glansdorff N. Pierarnd A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1177-1183Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A temperature of 75 °C was chosen as a compromise for measuring both carbamoyl phosphate degradation and cyanate formation. Carbamoyl phosphate was found to decrease exponentially (Fig. 4A) with a first order rate constant of 0.76 ± 0.05 min-1, whereas the rate of formation of cyanate was 0.74 ± 0.05 min-1. The agreement between these values is consistent with the degradation of carbamoyl phosphate to cyanate.Fig. 4Carbamoyl phosphate stability and the CPSase ATCase coupled reaction.A, thermal decomposition of carbamoyl phosphate. The rate of decomposition was measured by incubating [14C]carbamoyl phosphate (7 μCi/μmol) at a concentration of 10 mm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 70 °C. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated times and added to an assay mixture containing 20 mm aspartate and a large excess (38 μg/ml) of E. coli ATCase to convert carbamoyl phosphate to acid-stable [14C]carbamoyl aspartate. A second sample was withdrawn and reacted with NH4Cl to convert the cyanate formed by carbamoyl phosphate degradation to urea. The samples were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and counted. The first order rate constants for carbamoyl phosphate degradation (•) and cyanate formation (○) were determined by least squares fit of the respective curves to a monoexponential equation. B, effect of carbamoyl phosphate degradation on the coupled reaction. A simulation of the effect of carbamoyl phosphate degradation on the CPSase-ATCase coupled reaction was calculated using a modified Easterby equation that incorporates a term for the degradation of carbamoyl phosphate. For the simulations, values of Vo of 20 μm/min and τ = 1 min were assumed. The calculated curves show the rate of formation of carbamoyl aspartate from carbamoyl phosphate generated by CPSase in the absence of degradation (kd = 0, solid line), the rate of carbamoyl aspartate formation assuming the carbamoyl phosphate is degraded with the observed first order rate constant of 0.74 min-1 (dashed line), and the rate of formation of cyanate from carbamoyl phosphate degradation (dashed and dotted line). C, transient time measurement. The time-dependent formation of carbamoyl aspartate in the coupled CPSase-ATCase reaction was measured at 70 °C. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm14C-labeled sodium bicarbonate, 30 mm ATP, 32 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm aspartate, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 13 μg of A. aeolicus CPSase in a total volume of 0.5 ml. For the reaction in which A. aeolicus CPSase was coupled to A. aeolicus ATCase, 4.2 μg of ATCase was used. The formation of carbamoyl aspartate (•; solid line) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experimental transient time (τ) for the A. aeolicus CPSase-ATCase (26 s) was determined by extrapolating the steady state rate of product formation to the x axis.

MIS induced IRF-1 expression in the mammary glands of mice in vivo and in breast cancer cells in vitro and stimulation of IRF-1 by MIS was dependent on activation of the NFκB pathway. In the rat mammary gland, IRF-1 expression gradually decreased during pregnancy and lactation but increased at involution. In breast cancer, the IRF-1 protein was absent in 13% of tumors tested compared with matched normal glands. Consistent with its growth suppressive activity, expression of IRF-1 in breast cancer cells induced apoptosis. Treatment of breast cancer cells with MIS and interferon γ (IFN-γ) co-stimulated IRF-1 and CEACAM1 expression and synergistic induction of CEACAM1 by a combination of MIS and IFN-γ was impaired by antisense IRF-1 expression. Furthermore, a combination of IFN-γ and MIS inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells to a greater extent than either one alone. Both reagents alone significantly decreased the fraction of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, an effect not enhanced when they were used in combination. However, MIS promoted IFN-γ-induced apoptosis demonstrating a functional interaction between these two classes of signaling molecules in regulation of breast cancer cell growth.

In the male embryo, MIS causes regression of the Mullerian duct, the anlagen of the Fallopian tubes, uterus, and the upper vagina (1Teixeira J. Maheswaran S. Donahoe P.K. Endocrinol. Rev. 2001; 22: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, a postnatal role for MIS in males and females has yet to be clearly defined. MIS receptor mRNA in the mammary gland significantly diminishes during puberty when the ductal system branches and invades the adipose stroma and during the expansive growth at pregnancy and lactation, but is upregulated during involution, a time of regression and apoptosis (2Hoshiya Y.

The inverse correlation between MIS type II receptor expression and various stages of mammary growth suggests that MIS-mediated signaling may exert an inhibitory effect on mammary gland growth. Consistent with this concept, MIS inhibited the growth of both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and -negative breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (4Segev D.L. Ha T.U.

Type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferons are a family of antiviral cytokines that exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-proliferative effects (5Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.

Immunopharmacol. 1999; 21: 79-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Intralesional injections of IFN-α and IFN-γ into breast cancer patients with skin recurrences resulted in either complete or partial regression of the skin lesions but was associated with clinical toxicity in all patients (23Habif D.V. Ozzello L. De Rosa C.M. Cantell K. Lattes R. Cancer Invest. 1995; 13: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus identification of molecules that enhance the antitumor effects of IFN-γ may render it effective at lower doses, reduce clinical toxicity associated with high concentrations of the drug, and expand their therapeutic applications. IFN-γ-induced growth inhibition requires coordinate expression of specific genes. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is robustly induced by both type I and type II interferons. In addition to its important role in innate and adaptive immunity (24Ogasawara K. Hida S. Azimi N. Tagaya Y. Sato T. Yokochi-Fukuda T. Waldmann T.A. Taniguchi T. Taki S. Nature. 1998; 391: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), IRF-1 also plays a role in regulating the growth of different mammalian cell lines (25Romeo G. Fiorucci G. Chiantore M.V. Percario Z.A. Vannucchi S. Affabris E. J. Interferon. Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Different aspects of the tumor suppressor function of IRF-1 may be explained, at least in part, by the observation that it induces several growth regulatory genes including those with anti-proliferative activity such as IFNα/β, p21, and the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule) (25Romeo G. Fiorucci G. Chiantore M.V. Percario Z.A. Vannucchi S. Affabris E. J. Interferon. Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using DNA microarrays to profile gene expression, we identified that treatment of breast cancer cells with MIS strongly induces the expression of IRF-1. Since interferons also strongly induce IRF-1 (15Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), we tested whether intersection of MIS and IFN-γ signaling pathways would result in enhanced expression of downstream target genes and increased antiproliferative activity against breast cancer cells. In this report, we demonstrate that members of the TGFβ superfamily including MIS induce IRF-1 expression in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells with characteristics of normal cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with MIS and IFN-γ led to synergistic induction of CEACAM-1 through an IRF-1-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, a combination of MIS and IFN-γ led to a greater degree of growth inhibition compared with either agent alone due to enhanced apoptosis rather than a combinatorial effect on cell cycle progression. Cell Culture and MTT Assays—Human breast cancer cell lines T47D and MDA-MB-468 were grown in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 10% female fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A was grown in mammary epithelial growth medium (MEGM, Clonetics) supplemented with 100 ng/ml of cholera toxin (Calbiochem). Human recombinant MIS (26Ragin R.C. Donahoe P.K. Kenneally M.K. Ahmad M.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was collected from growth media of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human MIS gene and purified as described (26Ragin R.C. Donahoe P.K. Kenneally M.K. Ahmad M.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IFN-γ was purchased from Sigma and IFN-β and activin A were from R&D systems, Inc. TGFβ was a kind gift from Dr. Anita Roberts. Estimation of cell growth was based on the colorimetric reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), to a purple formazan by viable cells. The MDA-MB-468 cell suspension (3000 cells/well) was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. MIS, IFN-γ, or both were added to the wells once on day 0 at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The number of viable cells was estimated by adding 30 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Following 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the stain was eluted into 200 μl of Me2SO. The optical densities were quantified at a test wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm on a multiwell spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test. T47D cells expressing antisense IRF-1 mRNA were generated by co-transfecting 0.5 μg of hygromycin resistance plasmid and 10 μg of pCDNA 3.1 expressing the IRF-1 transcript in the antisense orientation. Cells were maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml of hygromycin (Roche Applied Science), and clones expressing antisense IRF-1 were identified by Northern blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Expression of protein in cells was analyzed by Western blot using the rabbit anti-IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit antiphospho-STAT1, and rabbit anti-STAT1 (Cell Signaling) antibodies according to the protocol described (27Ha T.U. Segev D.L. Barbie D. Masiakos P.T. Tran T.T. Dombkowski D. Glander M. Clarke T.R. Lorenzo H.K. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37101-37109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions from T47D cells were isolated according to the protocol described below. NFκB and STAT Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—T47D cells were grown to 70% confluence and treated with indicated concentrations of rhMIS or IFN-γ. Cells were harvested in cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml TKM 10:10:1 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2) and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cytoplasmic fraction was stored frozen for Western blot analysis of STAT proteins. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C, and proteins were extracted in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 350 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 3 μg of protein were used in 25-μl binding reactions containing 10 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 70 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4% glycerol. NFκB (Promega), and SIE (Stat Inducing Element; Geneka) oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with 32P and DNA protein complexes were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Supershift experiments were performed by adding 1 μg of rabbit anti-p65 or p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies to the binding reactions. Animals and MIS Treatment—All animals were cared for and experiments were performed under AAALAS approved guidelines using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board-Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) was used for anesthesia. To study the effect of rhMIS on the mammary gland, adult female C3H mice (8-week-old; average weight 25 grams) were obtained from the Edwin L. Steele Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Each animal was injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of rhMIS or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle control). Breast tissue was harvested bilaterally from each animal for RNA isolation. Blood was drawn from the animals at the time of tissue harvest to determine the circulating level of rhMIS using MIS-ELISA. IRF-1 expression analysis in the rat breast during perinatal morphogenesis was done using Sprague-Dawley rats. To analyze expression during lactation and involution, after the pups were born (postdelivery), some animals were housed with the pups (lactating) while others were weaned 2 days after lactation (weaned). RNA Analysis—Total RNA from T47 cells treated with MIS for 0 and 1 h was isolated using RNA STAT-60 and sent to the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for profiling gene expression using HG-U95Av2 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) containing ∼12,500 full-length annotated genes together with additional probe sets designed to represent EST sequences. The EST clones to detect the expression of IRF-1 and CEACAM1 were purchased from Incyte Genomics Inc. For Northern blot analysis, equal amounts of RNA were separated on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with either IRF-1 or CEACAM1. Cell Cycle Analysis and Apoptosis Assays—The cell cycle distribution of untreated and MIS and IFN-γ-treated cultures was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells were detached with PBS/EDTA, fixed in 95% ethanol and treated with propidium iodide and RNase A. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. To measure the apoptosis, cells treated with MIS and IFN-γ were immunostained with a FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, counterstained with DAPI and analyzed by FACS. The effect of IRF-1 on apoptosis, was analyzed by transiently transfecting cells in logarithmic growth phase with either the empty vector (4 μg) or IRF-1 (4 μg), along with a plasmid encoding the cell surface marker CD20 (1 μg) as described in (28van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and stained for CD20 and annexin V. Apoptosis in CD20-positive cells was determined by FACS analysis. Immunohistochemical Analysis of IRF-1—Twenty-three cases of human breast carcinoma with adjacent uninvolved breast parenchyma were selected from the files of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Pathology Department according to protocols approved by the Human Research Committee at MGH. These included 13 poorly differentiated (histologic grade 3/3), 5 moderately differentiated (grade 2/3) and 3 well-differentiated (grade 1/3) ductal adenocarcinomas. Patient age ranged from 34 to 81 years at the time of the procedure. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections according to standard procedures. Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase. After the sections had been microwaved in a 10 mm citrate buffer solution at 100 watts for 25 min, they were incubated with 2% normal goat serum for 30 min to block any nonspecific protein binding. The sections were incubated with rabbit antibodies against IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight at a 1:400 dilution. After incubation with biotinylated antibody and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin, the staining was developed by reaction with 3. 3′-diamino benzidine for 5 min (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative staining of tumor was determined only in the presence of stained uninvolved glands on the same sections. Tumors were considered IRF-1-negative if no signal was detectable in >95% of the tumor. Members of the TGFβ Family Induce IRF-1 Expression— Affinity-purified recombinant human MIS (35 nm) induced IRF-1 expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive T47D and ER-negative MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Western blot analysis of proteins harvested from T47D cells using an anti-IRF-1 antibody demonstrated the induction of IRF-1 protein by MIS (Fig. 1A, lower left panel). The specificity of IRF-1 induction by MIS was tested by treating cells with heat inactivated MIS or with the affinity-purified noncleavable, biologically inactive form of rhMIS (L9, 35 nm) that does not induce the regression of the Mullerian duct in organ culture assays (29Kurian M.S. de la Cuesta R.S. Waneck G.L. MacLaughlin D.T. Manganaro T.F. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 343-349PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibit the growth of T47D cells (4Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, lower right panel). MIS-mediated induction of IRF-1 mRNA was also observed in MCF10A cells (Fig. 1B, left panel), a non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line with normal karyotype derived from a patient with fibrocystic breast disease (30Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both activin and TGFβ induced IRF-1 in MCF10A cells (Fig. 1B, right panels). Thus IRF-1 expression in mammary epithelial cells may be under the regulation of multiple members of the TGFβ family including MIS. We next determined whether exposure of mammary glands to exogenous rhMIS would result in the induction of IRF-1 in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of rhMIS into mice induced IRF-1 expression in the mammary glands compared with PBS-injected controls (Fig. 1C). The serum rhMIS levels averaged 2–4 μg/ml in the animals as measured by ELISA (26Ragin R.C. Donahoe P.K. Kenneally M.K. Ahmad M.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Expression of IRF-1 in the Rat Mammary Gland and in Human Breast Cancer—Expression analysis of IRF1 in the mammary glands of virgin, pregnant, lactating, and weaned rats demonstrated that IRF-1 mRNA was detectable in the virgin animals but gradually declined during pregnancy (G5-G21) and reached a nadir at late pregnancy (G17-G21) and lactation (PD0-PD10: lactating). Expression rebounded in the mammary glands of weaned rats (PD3-PD10: weaned) and reached the level observed in virgin animals 3 days after removal of pups (Fig. 2A, upper and lower panels). Immunostaining with an anti-IRF-1 antibody demonstrated that IRF-1 was expressed predominantly in the epithelial cells of the ducts and lobules of the mammary gland. Expression pattern of the IRF-1 protein coincided with that of the IRF-1 mRNA; expression was detectable in the mammary glands of virgin and early pregnant (G5) animals but not during late pregnancy (G21) or in the lactating glands (Fig. 2B, upper and lower panels). No signal was detected when sections were stained with either affinity-purified rabbit immunoglobulins or with anti-IRF-1 antibody preincubated with the cognate peptide (data not shown). Since IRF-1 expression in the mammary epithelial cells decreased during pregnancy, a time at which the cells undergo massive proliferation, we wished to determine whether expression of the IRF-1 protein would be lower in breast tumor tissue compared with matched normal glands. We immunostained 23 tumors of various histologic grades with an anti-IRF-1 antibody. Expression of IRF-1 was absent in three tumors but present in the adjacent normal uninvolved ducts and lobules (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Two of these were of poorly differentiated histologic grade, and one tumor was moderately differentiated. In seven patients, staining for IRF-1 was patchy and limited to 20–80% of the tumor tissue (data not shown). In the other 13 patients expression of IRF-1 was detectable in both the tumor and the surrounding normal tissue (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Since these results suggest a growth suppressive effect for IRF-1 in breast cancer, we analyzed whether IRF-1 could induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-468 cells in logarithmic growth phase were transiently transfected with a construct, which encodes for the IRF-1 protein, and a plasmid encoding the cell surface marker CD20 as described by Ref. 28van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar. Vector-transfected cells were used as controls. Cells were fixed 72 h after transfection and stained for CD20 expression. Annexin V staining of CD20-positive cells demonstrated that expression of IRF-1 in breast cancer cells led to a ∼3.5-fold and 5-fold increase in cells in early and late stages of apoptosis, respectively, compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). MIS and Interferon Co-stimulate IRF-1—Since IRF-1 is strongly induced by interferons (15Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) and MIS, we tested the effect of IFN-γ on MIS-mediated induction of IRF-1 expression. IFN-γ induced IRF-1 expression in T47D cells and simultaneous addition of MIS and IFN-γ further increased the induction of the IRF-1 mRNA in both T47D and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3A). We had previously demonstrated that MIS induces the DNA binding activity of NFκB protein complexes in human mammary epithelial cells, breast cancer cells and in the normal breast in vivo (3Segev D.L. Hoshiya Y. Stephen A.E. Hoshiya M. Tran T.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol.

In order to determine the molecular mechanism by which MIS induces IRF-1 expression in breast cancer cells, gel shift assays were performed using NFκB or STAT-inducing element (SIE) oligonucleotides containing the relevant DNA binding consensus sequences (Fig. 3B). As reported previously (3Segev D.L. Hoshiya Y. Stephen A.E. Hoshiya M. Tran T.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol.

Binding to the SIE DNA sequence was not observed suggesting that MIS does not evoke STAT DNA binding in these cells. IFN-γ however induced SIE DNA binding activity but did not activate the DNA binding activity of NFκB. Antibody supershift experiments demonstrated that the STAT-DNA protein complex induced by IFN-γ contained the STAT-1 protein but not STAT-3 or STAT-5α. In agreement with these results, Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of MIS and IFN-γ-treated T47D cells demonstrated that unlike IFN-γ, MIS did not induce phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (Fig. 3C). In order to determine whether activation of the NFκB signaling cascade by MIS was responsible for the induction of IRF-1 mRNA, we generated T47D cell clones which express the dominant negative inhibitor of IκB (IκBα-DN). In the rat IκBα-DN transgene used in these experiments, two serine residues at positions 32 and 36 are replaced by alanines. Hence the resulting IκBα-DN protein cannot be phosphorylated in response to activation signals. Thus it functions as a super repressor of NFκB activation (31Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Two T47D cell clones expressing the IκBα-DN transgene were identified by the lack of NFκB activation following MIS treatment (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Induction of IRF-1 by MIS was greatly reduced in the two clones harboring IκBα-DN compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Thus MIS-induced IRF-1 requires activation of NFκB DNA binding activity. We next tested whether co-stimulation of IRF-1 by MIS and IFN-γ would be impaired in cells expressing IκBα-DN. Northern blot analysis of IκBα-DN-expressing cells treated with MIS, IFN-γ or both demonstrated that expression of IκBα-DN did not interfere with IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 expression. The stimulation of IRF-1 mRNA by a combination of MIS and IFN-γ was equivalent to that induced by IFN-γ alone since IRF-1 induction by MIS was impaired in these cells (Fig. 3E). Thus it is likely that co-stimulation of IRF-1 by MIS and IFN-γ in breast cancer cells is mediated through activation of NFκB and STAT pathways, respectively. Co-stimulation of IRF-1 was also observed when breast cancer cells were treated with a combination of MIS and IFN-β, a class I interferon (Fig. 3F).

Next, the pyrrolidine ring is oxidized by 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase, which acts strictly stereo-specific on the l-enantiomer. Surprisingly, l-nicotine also induces the synthesis of a 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine-specific oxidase in the bacteria. Genes of nicotine-degrading enzymes are located on the catabolic plasmid pAO1. The pAO1 sequence revealed that the 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase gene is flanked by two open reading frames with a similarity to amino acid permeases and a divergently transcribed open reading frame with a similarity to proteins of the tetracycline repressor TetR family. Reverse transcription PCR and primer extension analysis of RNA transcripts isolated from A. nicotinovorans pAO1 indicated that the 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase gene represents a transcriptional unit. DNA electromobility shift assays established that the purified TetR-similar protein represents the 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase gene repressor HdnoR and binds to the 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase gene operator with a Kd of 21 nm.

In vivo analysis of 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase gene transcripts from bacteria grown with l- and d-nicotine confirmed this conclusion.

Hoppe-Seyler's Z..Physiol. Chem. 1961; 323: 236-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The main alkaloid produced by the tobacco plant is l-nicotine and, in the presence of this compound, the bacteria produce a nicotine dehydrogenase that hydroxylates C6 of the pyridine ring of nicotine (3Gloger M.

When chemically synthesized d-nicotine was added to A. nicotinovorans pAO1 cultures, the same enzyme activities were induced. The induction of both stereo-specific enzymes, 6HLNO and 6HDNO, by either l- or d-nicotine was a long standing puzzle (3Gloger M. Decker K. Z. Naturforsch. 1969; 24: 1016-1025Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It could be explained by the presence of an l-nicotine racemase, which produces the d-enantiomer. However, there was no evidence found for the presence of an l-nicotine racemase (3Gloger M. Decker K. Z. Naturforsch. 1969; 24: 1016-1025Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Decker K. Bleeg H.

Genes of nicotine-degrading enzymes are situated on the catabolic plasmid pAO1 (9Brandsch R. Decker K. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 138: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been shown before that a protein present in A. nicotinovorans pAO1 extracts binds to an operator site consisting of two inverted repeats, namely IR1, covering the 6hdno promoter region, and IR2, situated upstream from the 6hdno promoter (10Bernauer H Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the protein of the transcriptional regulator remained elusive and had not been identified. Recently, the position on pAO1 of genes of enzymes involved in nicotine catabolism by A. nicotinovorans has been determined (11Baitsch D. Sandu C. Brandsch R. Igloi G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5262-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The gene of 6HDNO was not part of this gene cluster. The sequence of pAO1 (12Igloi G.L. Brandsch R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1976-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) revealed that 6hdno is positioned in close proximity to two open reading frames, ORF111 and ORF113, with high similarity to amino acid permeases, and to ORF114, with similarity to transcriptional regulators of the TetR family (PROSITE accession code PS01081; Refs. 13Orth P.

In this work we performed a transcriptional analysis of the 6hdno gene cluster and present evidence that 6hdno represents a transcriptional unit. We cloned and expressed the DNA carrying ORF114, purified the TetR-similar transcriptional regulator, and show that it represents the 6hdno repressor. Evidence is presented that 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine and 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine act as inducers of 6hdno expression. Induction of 6hdno expression by both the l- and the d-nicotine enantiomer can be explained by the poor discrimination by HdnoR between 6-hydroxy-l- and 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine. Growth of A. nicotinovorans pAO1 and Preparation of Bacterial Extracts—A. nicotinovorans pAO1 was grown at 30 °C on citrate medium supplemented with trace elements and a vitamin solution (2Eberwein H. Gries F.A. Decker K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z..Physiol. Chem. 1961; 323: 236-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For enzyme assays and Western blots, the cultures were induced with 0.05% of different nicotine derivatives for 3 h at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets harvested from 100-ml cultures were re-suspended in 3 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mg/ml lysozyme. After 1 h of incubation on ice, the suspensions were passed three times through a French pressure cell at 132 megapascals, and the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. For total RNA isolation, a 5-ml A. nicotinovorans pAO1 culture, grown overnight in citrate medium at 30 °C, was induced with 0.05% of l-nicotine, d-nicotine, 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine, or 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine, and growth was continued for 3 h. The cultures were then frozen in liquid nitrogen to stabilize the RNA, melted again, and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, re-suspended in 100 μl of 14 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated at 28 °C for 3 h. The suspension was used for RNA isolation following the protocol of the supplier of the RNA isolation kit. Total RNA Isolation—RNA was isolated from bacteria pre-treated as described above with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Contaminating DNA was digested by “on column” DNase I treatment as described by the supplier. A second round of DNase I digestion was performed to remove traces of DNA as follows. 3 μg of RNA was incubated in a 15-μl assay with three units of RNase-free DNase I in buffer supplied with the kit for 1 h at 30 °C. The DNase I was inactivated by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and incubation at 65 °C for 15 min. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA with avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase (20 units/μg RNA; Amersham Biosciences) and a mixture of random hexanucleotides in the presence of 1 unit of RNasin (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 10 μl. Reverse transcription was started by a cycle of 10 min at 25 °C, followed by a second cycle of 1 h at 42 °C and the inactivation of the enzyme at 70 °C for 15 min. 1 μl (1:10) of the cDNA was used as the template in PCR reactions with primers specific for different transcripts (Table I). 6hdno transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA prepared from A. nicotinovorans pAO1 cultures induced with l- and d-nicotine enantiomers. The PCR program was as follows: 50 °C for 31min; 95 °C for 15 min; (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1min, and 72 °C 1min 20 s) × 35; and 72 °C at 10 min.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimerSequenceLength of DNA (bp)Fragment1Forward 5′-cgtttgcgacccctcccg-3′228Fragment IReverse 5′-cctcggtggtggcattcacc-3′2Forward 5′-ctcgaggagccggtttggcc-3′535Fragment IIReverse 5′-cgtcttcgagagagtgatcacc-3′3Forward 5′-cgtcaaactggagatcgagg-3′194Fragment IIIReverse 5′-gtccaaacccagaagtcgtc-3′4Forward 5′-cctcggtggtggcattcacc-3′1193Fragment IVReverse 5′-gcaaagaagccagagacagag-3′5Forward 5′-gtgcattgtgcttgccgtggt-3′197Fragment VReverse 5′-gcaaagaagccagagacagag-3′6Forward 5′-cgtctgaaaccatctggg-3′208Fragment VIReverse 5′-cctaagaacgatagccagcg-3′7Forward 5′-ctcgaggagccgtttggcca-3′205Fragment 5′ to ORF 111Reverse 5′-gctgcaaagggcgggcgatct-3′8Forward 5′-gacaaagagcgatgtgttccg-3′105Fragment 5′ to 6hdno carrying IR1Reverse 5′-cgtcttcgagagagtgatcacc-3′9Forward 5′-gcaaggaatcgccatagacgg-3′191Fragment 5′ to 6hdno carrying IR1 + IR2Reverse 5′-cgtcttcgagagagtgatcacc-3′10Forward 5′-gcaaggaatcgccatagacgg-3′107Fragment carrying IR2Reverse 5′-cggaacacatcgctctttgtc-3′11Forward 5′-cgagggatcttgaaacagc-3′531Fragment 5′ to ORF 113Reverse 5′-ggactcagacataggtatcacc-3′12Forward 5′-gggcaaggatccaagttgcg-3′662hdnoR (ORF114)Reverse 5′-cccaatagtctcgagcgaagaaagacg-3′135′-cccccattgacatggacagctgtccatgtatcaatagggtg-3′41Double stranded oligo carrying IR15′-gggggtaactgtacctgtcgacaggtacatagttatcccac-3′145′-gctggctctcagaagaagaaacttg-3′25Primer extension analysis15Forward 5′-gctggctctcagaagaagaaacttg-3′307Fragment VIIReverse 5′-gtagcgaatgctgcagttatagag-3′16Forward 5′-gctggctctcagaagaagaaacttg-3′112Fragment VIIIReverse 5′-tctcgcagtcgatcaccatct-3′17Forward 5′-gctggctctcagaagaagaaacttg-3′137Fragment IXReverse 5′-gtagacgaaaaggcacttt-3′18Forward 5′-gctggctctcagaagaagaaacttg-3′189Fragment XReverse 5′-ccttcgggatgctaatgagtc-3′ Open table in a new tab Primer Extension Analysis—A. nicotinovorans pAO1 total RNA was extracted as described above. 10 pmol of primer 14 were 32P-5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 10 min at 37 °C. The kinase was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 2 min. The concentration of the labeled primer was brought to 100 fmol/μl, and 1 μl of primer was hybridized with 5-10 μg total RNA for 20 min at 58 °C. The annealed primer was extended for 30 min at 42 °C using the avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The extension products were ethanol precipitated, resuspended in formamide dye (Promega), and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. DNA fragment VII was amplified using primers 15 (Table I) and sequenced with the primer employed in the primer extension reaction. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Recombinant DNA Work—The DNA carrying ORF114 was amplified by PCR with primers 12 (Table I) carrying a BamHI and a XhoI restriction site, respectively. The restricted fragments were ligated into the BamHI-XhoI-digested pH6EX3 (15Berthold H. Scanarini M. Abney C.C. Frorath B. Northemann W. ..Protein. Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the aid of the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Diagnostics), and the DNA was transformed into transformation-competent Escherichia coli XL-1 blue prepared with the Roti-Transform kit according to the instructions of the supplier (Roth, Bruchsal, Germany). Overexpression and Purification of HdnoR—An overnight culture of E. coli XL-1 blue harboring the pH6EX3-hdnoR was diluted 10 times in LB medium, supplemented with 50 μg/μl ampicillin, and induced for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and lysed by sonication at 4 °C in a Branson sonifier J17V (scale adjustment 1). The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was used to purify the His6-HdnoR protein on Talon-Sepharose (Clontech). The protein was eluted at 0.5 m imidazole in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl and revealed a single band in SDS-PAGE. The HdnoR protein fractions were concentrated by 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation and centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min. The protein pellet was re-suspended in 10 mm Tris 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, and the concentration of the protein was adjusted to 0.1 μg/μl in the same buffer. Aliquots of protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept until use at -70 °C. For electromobility shift assays (EMSAs), the protein was diluted at the required concentration as indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7.Fig. 4The ORF114 protein is the transcriptional regulator of the 6HDNO gene (HdnoR).Panel A, schematic representation of the 5′6hdno region.

Brown M.H. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Skurray R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7102-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by acetone precipitation, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electromobility Shift Assay—Protein DNA-binding assays were performed according to Ref.17Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar. DNA fragments employed in the EMSA were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Table I and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the Ready-to-Go T4 polynucleotide kinase kit (Amersham Biosciences). Binding of HdnoR to DNA was carried out in 25 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.3 ng DNA and various amounts of HdnoR in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, loading buffer was added to a final concentration of 10% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue, and the mixture was immediately applied to a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE buffer at a constant current of 30 mA for 1.5 h. After drying, the gel was developed by incubation with a phosphorimaging plate. The effect of potential inducers on HdnoR DNA binding was tested by pre-incubation of the protein for 2 min with nicotine derivatives dissolved in H2O prior to adding the radiolabeled DNA. Incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature before the sample was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel as described above. Western Blotting—Cell extracts of A. nicotinovorans pAO1 induced with l- and d-nicotine enantiomers were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Germany). Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit against A. nicotinovorans pAO1 6HDNO were used to detect the presence of the protein in a second antibody-bound, peroxidase-mediated color reaction. Enzyme Assays—Extracts of noninduced, or l- or d-nicotine-induced A. nicotinovorans pAO1 grown on a citrate medium were prepared as described above, and 6HDNO activity was determined in the cleared lysates as outlined in Ref. 18Brühmüller M. Möhler H. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Organization and Transcriptional Analysis of the 6HDNO Gene Region of pAO1—The 6HDNO gene of pAO1 is flanked by two ORFs, ORF111 and ORF113 (GenBank™ accession number AJ507836, 12), both with similarity to amino acid permeases. ORF111 is positioned 550 bp upstream of and divergently oriented to 6hdno, and ORF113 is positioned 505 bp downstream of 6hdno and oriented into the same direction (Fig. 2A). 81 bp downstream of ORF113 and in the opposite orientation is ORF114, with a similarity to transcriptional repressors of the TetR family. An analysis of transcripts generated from this DNA region was performed to establish whether 6hdno and the hypothetical gene of ORF113 form a transcriptional unit. RNA was isolated from A. nicotinovorans pAO1 grown in the presence of l-nicotine, DNase I-treated, and reverse transcribed into cDNA with the aid of a random hexanucleotide. The cDNA was then employed in PCR with specific primers (Table I) derived from regions I to VI, as indicated in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B shows the results. Lanes marked M show a 1-kb DNA ladder as the molecular weight marker. Lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 show the PCR products obtained with pAO1 DNA as template and primers amplifying fragments I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively. This PCR control was positive with all primer pairs. Lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 show the results of the negative control PCR with RNA as template, which were all negative and are proof that the RNA samples did not contain DNA. Lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 show the PCR results with cDNA as template. Only primer pairs derived from coding regions of the ORFs amplified the expected DNA fragments in the PCR. No amplification product was obtained with primers devised to amplify region II of Fig. 2A, as was expected for an intergenic region. The absence of a PCR product with cDNA as template and primers devised to amplify region IV of Fig. 2A supports the conclusion that 6hdno and the gene carrying ORF113 do not form a transcriptional unit. The transcriptional analysis also indicated that the genes of this pAO1 region are expressed in the presence of l-nicotine. PCR assays performed with cDNA derived from RNA prepared from A. nicotinovorans pAO1 grown without nicotine gave no amplification products (data not shown). Transcripts corresponding to ORF114 could be detected in the absence of nicotine at a level corresponding to that shown in lane 18 of Fig. 2B (data not shown), an indication that the gene of this hypothetical transcriptional regulator was constitutively expressed. Expression and Purification of the ORF114 Protein—The hypothetical protein of ORF114, with a predicted molecular weight of 21,934, typical of TetR family repressors (PROSITE accession code PS01081), contains a predicted helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif at its N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) and shows the highest similarity to hypothetical repressor proteins from Streptomyces coelicolor (21.1 kDa protein EbrA, 26% identity in 167 amino acids, AN Q9X9V5), Actinosynnema pretiosum (transcriptional regulator Asm29, 24% identity in 197 amino acids, AN Q8KUH9), and the regulatory protein AcrR from Proteus mirabilis (21% identity in 195 amino acids, AN Q8VPB0). The DNA carrying ORF114 was inserted into pH6EX3 and expressed in E. coli as a His6-tagged protein. Thus, a fusion protein was generated with the N-terminal amino acid sequence MSPIHHHHHHLVPRGSKL, with L corresponding to the UUG translation start of ORF114. The protein was purified, and the formation of dimers was determined by cross-linking with formaldehyde. Fig. 3B shows the purified protein (lane 2) and the cross-link product migrating at the size of a homodimer (lane 3). The purified protein was tested for DNA binding activity in EMSA with DNA fragments a, b, and c shown in Fig. 2A. Only fragment b, which caries the 6hdno promoter, gave a band shift in the presence of the protein (Fig. 3C). The specificity of the protein-DNA complex formed was evaluated in EMSA in the presence of competing unlabeled fragment b and salmon sperm DNA, respectively (Fig. 3D). Only the unlabeled fragment b competed with the labeled fragment for DNA binding, but not the unspecific salmon sperm DNA. Thus, ORF114 represents the gene of the transcriptional regulator of the 6HDNO gene, and the protein was named the 6hdno repressor (HdnoR) accordingly. Interaction of HdnoR with IR1 and IR2 of the 6hdno Operator DNA—A schematic representation of the 5′-DNA region of 6hdno is presented in Fig. 4A. The transcriptional start site (+1), situated 51 nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon UUG, and the -10 and -35 elements of the 6hdno promoter were established previously (20Recchi C. Sclavi B. Rauzier J. Gicquel B. Reyrat J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33763-33773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two inverted repeats, IR1 and IR2, were shown by DNase I protection assays to be the recognition sites of a DNA-binding protein present in crude extracts and (NH4)2SO4 fractions of A. nicotinovorans (10Bernauer H Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This DNA-binding protein was present in nicotine-noninduced and -induced bacterial extracts but did not react to the presence of l-nicotine when tested in vitro in an EMSA. When a DNA-fragment of 191 bp (Table I) carrying the two inverted repeats was employed in EMSA with purified HdnoR, the protein did bind concentration-dependently, first to one site (middle band in Fig. 4B, 10 nm) and then to both sites (Fig. 4B, 20 nm), an indication that binding of HdnoR to one site may stimulate binding of the protein to the second site and that binding of HdnoR to both sites was co-operative (10Bernauer H Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Titration of the 105-bp DNA encompassing IR1 and the 107 bp DNA fragment encompassing IR2, respectively, with HdnoR (Fig. 4, C and D) allowed the determination of a Kd (50% binding of HdnoR to its recognition sequence) of ∼20 nm for the protein-DNA interaction at IR1 and IR2, respectively. When a 41-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide (Table I, number 13) with the 37-bp sequence of IR1 at its center was tested in EMSA for HdnoR-binding, the same results as with the 105-bp fragment (Fig. 4C) were obtained (not shown). Determination of the Transcriptional Start Site of the Gene Carrying ORF111—6hdno and the divergently transcribed permease-similar gene could form a regulatory unit controlled by HdnoR with two promoters positioned, each on one of the complementary DNA strands. The 6hdno promoter is part of IR1, with the -35 region TTGACA followed 16 nucleotides downstream by the -10 region TATCAAT (Fig. 4A and Ref. 19Mauch L. Bichler V. Brandsch R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first six nucleotides of IR2 (Fig. 4A) read on the complementary strand TTGTCA, which represents a reasonable -35 region, and are followed 17 nucleotides downstream by the sequence AATGAT, a possible -10 region. Therefore the transcriptional start site of the gene carrying ORF111 was determined by primer extension analysis. It revealed one strong signal as a potential transcriptional start site (Fig. 5) 85 bp upstream of the proposed translation start site of ORF111 (12Igloi G.L. Brandsch R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1976-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Weaker signals corresponding to shorter primer extension products may represent cDNAs generated from processed RNA molecules or premature termination products of the reverse transcriptase reaction. The strong termination signal of the primer extension reaction may represent a genuine transcriptional start site, because secondary structure predictions of a hypothetical RNA transcript upstream and downstream from the proposed transcriptional start site showed neither hairpin loop structures, which may act as potential stop sites for the reverse transcriptase, nor an unusually high GC content of the sequence. The palindrome sequence 5′-CTCCCCGGGAG (Fig. 5, panel A), which may represent a potential binding site for a transcriptional regulator, is positioned 6 bp upstream of the proposed -35 promoter region. The primer extension analysis was corroborated by the results of RT-PCR reactions performed with primer pairs covering the proposed 5′-end of the RNA transcript (Fig. 5, panel A) and primer pairs with one of the primers downstream of the +1 transcriptional start site (Fig. 5, panel A). Only primer 14, in combination with primer 16, gave an amplification product in RT-PCR (Fig. 5, panel C). The Effect of Nicotine Derivatives on HdnoR Binding to IR1—The interaction of the protein with IR1, which covers the 6hdno promoter, was tested by EMSA in the presence of various nicotine-derived compounds (Fig. 6A). Only 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine and 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine prevented HdnoR from binding to the IR1 DNA (Fig. 6B). The effect of 6-hydroxy-d-, 6-hydroxy-l-, and l-nicotine on HdnoR/DNA complex formation was analyzed into greater detail at 20 nm HdnoR, which gave half-maximal binding to IR1 (Fig. 7, panels A-C). Both 6-hydroxy-nicotine enantiomers prevented DNA-protein complex formation at μm concentrations, with complete inhibition at 50 μm 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine and 100 μm 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine, respectively. A thousand-fold higher l-nicotine concentration was required to elicit a similar effect. Thus, 6-hydroxy-nicotine may be regarded as the compound active in 6hdno induction, with the d-enantiomer being twice as potent as the l-enantiomer. The Effect of l-Nicotine, d-Nicotine, and 6-Hydroxy-l-nicotine in Vivo on 6HDNO Activity, Protein Level, and 6hdno Transcripts—A. nicotinovorans pAO1 cultures were grown in the presence of 0.05% l-nicotine, d-nicotine, or 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine, respectively, and 6HDNO activity in the bacterial extracts was determined. The highest specific activity was found in cultures grown with 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine, and the lowest was found in cultures grown in the presence of l-nicotine (Fig. 8A). The enzyme activity levels correlated with the observed 6hdno transcript levels, which were lower in l-nicotine-grown bacteria and higher in 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine- and d-nicotine-grown bacteria (Fig. 8B), and with the 6HDNO protein levels on Western blots (Fig. 8C). The experimental data presented in this paper demonstrate that the protein encoded by ORF114 of pAO1 represents the transcriptional repressor of 6hdno. The HdnoR protein shows all the characteristics of a repressor of the TetR family. Its predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa, the predicted helix-turn-helix motif at the initial third of the protein, and the formation of dimers are typical for these regulatory proteins. The DNA sequence of IR1 and IR2 protected by the protein was determined by S1mapping previously with a (NH4)2SO4 fraction prepared from A. nicotinovorans pAO1 (10Bernauer H Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we identified the gene of this protein and purified the repressor. HdnoR binds to the same IR1 and IR2 DNA sequences as the protein shown to be present in extracts of A. nicotinovorans pAO1, and, thus, we conclude that HdnoR is identical with this protein. The absence of an effect of l-nicotine in EMSA with IR1 and IR2 in the presence of an A. nicotinovorans pAO1 (NH4)2SO4 fraction containing the transcriptional regulator, which has been reported previously (10Bernauer H Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), may be explained by the finding that, in EMSA solely, the 6-hydroxy-nicotine derivatives acted as inducers. Expression of hdnoR seemed to be constitutive, because specific transcripts could be detected in both noninduced and nicotine-induced bacteria. This finding supports the conclusion that the gene codes for a repressor. There are no HdnoR binding sites present on the DNA upstream of the repressor gene. Therefore, the repressor seems not to auto-regulate the transcription of its gene. Inspection of the 5′-regions of the ndh, kdh, and dhph (11Baitsch D. Sandu C. Brandsch R. Igloi G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5262-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) genes revealed no HdnoR binding site. A search for the core palindrome sequence of IR1 and IR2 revealed no additional consensus sequences on the pAO1 DNA. Apparently, there is a complex regulation of genes involved in nicotine utilization, and one may assume that there are additional transcription factors in charge of regulating expression of the ndh-6hlno, kdh and dhph operons. HdnoR is the first nicotine-responsive transcriptional regulator of genes belonging to the pAO1-encoded nicotine regulon that has been characterized. The repressor discriminates poorly between 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine and 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine as inducers, which explains the surprising finding, made many years ago, that a strictly stereo-specific 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase is induced by l-nicotine (3Gloger M. Decker K. Z. Naturforsch. 1969; 24: 1016-1025Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Decker K. Bleeg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 105: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the effect of various nicotine derivatives on the formation of the HdnoR-DNA complex, one may conclude that the l- or d-position of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine is not as important for binding to the repressor as is the presence of the hydroxyl group at C6 of the pyridine ring. l- and d-nicotine, N-methyl-myosmine, 6-and 2-amino-l-nicotine, or 6-hydroxy-pyridine did not prevent HdnoR DNA binding. Because 6-hydroxy-pyridine had no effect, the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine seems to be required for its interaction with HdnoR. 6hdno is not co-transcribed with the permease-similar gene located downstream of it but appears to represent a transcriptional unit by itself. However, the genes of the two permeases appear to belong to a nicotine regulon, because transcripts of both of these genes can be detected only in nicotine-induced bacteria. 6hdno and the divergently transcribed permease gene may form a functional unit, with the permease responsible for uptake of the compound that serves as substrate for the enzyme 6HDNO. However, as suggested by the primer extension analysis and the RT-PCR results, they seem not to form a transcriptional unit regulated by HdnoR. There are no hints yet available as to the function of these hypothetical permeases. It is tempting to assume a role in the transport of nicotine or nicotine derivatives in and/or out of the bacterial cell. Efforts to inactivate the permease genes in A. nicotinovorans pAO1 by homologous recombination with an antibiotic cassette have, to date, failed, as did the heterologous expression of the permease genes in E. coli. A. nicotinovorans pAO1 contains promoters resembling, in principle, σ70E. coli promoters. The 6hdno promoter situated at IR1 exhibits a consensus -35 TTGACA sequence separated by 16 bp from the sequence TATCAAT, which is very similar to the consensus -10 sequence TATAAT, with one Cys residue inserted (Fig. 4, panel A). Whether the proposed promoter (Fig. 5, panel A), which resembles the 6hdno promoter, is indeed the promoter of the permease gene has to be proven in functional tests by fusion with an indicator gene. The accumulation of C residues at promoter sites, as suggested here for pAO1 promoters, has been observed in the case of other bacteria with a high GC content, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (20Recchi C. Sclavi B. Rauzier J. Gicquel B. Reyrat J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33763-33773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consensus sequences typical for promoters regulated by alternative σ factors have not been detected by inspection of the intergenic regions of the 6hdno and permease genes. The expression pattern of 6hdno in vivo in the presence of l-, d-, or 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine may be explained by the interaction of the HdnoR protein with these nicotine derivatives. l-nicotine induces the expression of both ndh and 6hlno, and, thus, l-nicotine is turned over into N-methlyaminopropyl(6-hydroxy-pyridil-3)ketone, giving no time to 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine to accumulate and interact with HdnoR. This results in a low level of 6hdno expression. When turnover of l-nicotine slows down, possibly because of feedback inhibition of the pathway enzymes by end products, more 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine may accumulate, resulting in a delayed increase of 6hdno expression as has been observed in A. nicotinovorans pAO1 cultures grown with l-nicotine (3Gloger M. Decker K. Z. Naturforsch. 1969; 24: 1016-1025Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Decker K. Bleeg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 105: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of d-nicotine, d-nicotine is turned over into 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine by NDH, which does not discriminate between the l- and d-nicotine enantiomers (3Gloger M. Decker K. Z. Naturforsch. 1969; 24: 1016-1025Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Decker K. Bleeg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 105: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine formed, however, is no substrate for 6HLNO. Therefore, 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine accumulates, leading to a higher expression of 6hdno. From the results presented in this study, one may assume that 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine represents the natural inducer of 6hdno expression. However, the question remains. Is d-nicotine found in nature? There are reports that l-nornicotine, a side product of nicotine biosynthesis by the tobacco plant, was racemized into the d-enantiomer in leaves of the plant (21Kisaki T. Tamaki E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 92: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that, during cigarette smoking, l-nicotine is racemized into its enantiomer (22Nwosu C.G. Crooks P.A. Xenobiotica. 1988; 18: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Possibly, d-nicotine or d-nornicotine is formed during the decay of the tobacco plant in the soil. In this case, 6HDNO would be an essential enzyme, required for the biodegradation of these compounds, and regulation of the expression of its gene by HdnoR and 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine may reflect this fact. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the natural inducer of 6hdno and the natural substrate of 6HDNO is a molecule that just resembles 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine."

Much evidence reveals that the cytotoxicity of these platinum compounds is related to their ability to attack cellular DNA. Platinum agents react with the N-7 atoms of the purine bases, forming 1,2-intrastrand and 1,3-intrastrand cross-links as the major adducts. These DNA adducts inhibit essential cellular processes including transcription and trigger cell death. The detailed mechanism by which the platinum drugs selectively kill cancer cells is a subject of continued study in our laboratory and many others. A better understanding of cellular responses to platinum-DNA lesions is being sought to develop more effective cancer therapies through the optimization of platinum-DNA chemistry in the context of biochemical responses to the cytotoxic lesions. cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane)oxalatoplatinum(II) cis-diammine(1,1′-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) elongation complex RNA polymerase cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link cisplatin 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) cross-link [Pt(dach)Cl2] 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link [Pt(dach)Cl2] 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) cross-link 1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane nucleotide(s).

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To date, however, little is known about the properties of stalled RNA polymerase at the site of platinum damage. In the present study, we employed site-specifically platinated DNA templates immobilized on a solid support in order to analyze the effects of defined platinum lesions on transcription and to isolate and study the stalled elongation complexes. Cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) and 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) cross-links strongly block T7 RNA polymerase. Promoter-independent transcription on immobilized DNA templates allowed for the investigation of the exact stop sites of RNA polymerase at a platinum lesion under many different conditions. In addition to cisplatin, [Pt(dach)Cl2], which forms the same adducts as oxaliplatin on our synthetic DNA probes, was examined to understand the influence of the spectator ligand on transcription inhibition (Fig. 1). We also investigated the transcription system whereby another polymerase trails the polymerase stalled at a site of platinum damage. Finally, the ability of RNA polymerase to resume transcription after being arrested at a platinum-DNA lesion was examined by chemically removing the platinum adduct. Materials—Histidine-tagged T7 RNA polymerase was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells carrying plasmid pBH161 (kindly provided by W. T. McAllister) and purified as described (20He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cisplatin was obtained from Johnson-Matthey. The [Pt(dach)Cl2] compound was prepared as previously described (21Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, and Dynabeads M280 streptavidin was from DYNAL. MagneHis nickel particles and RNasin (RNase inhibitor) were obtained from Promega. Construction of Site Specifically Platinated DNA Templates—Platinated oligonucleotides containing cisplatin and [Pt(dach)Cl2] intrastrand cross-links were synthesized as reported previously (21Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A 145-bp DNA template (T7 145) containing a T7 promoter and a site-specific platinum lesion was prepared by enzymatic ligation of five synthetic oligonucleotide fragments and a sixth containing a platinum intrastrand cross-link (Fig. 1B). 5′-Phosphorylated DNA fragments were annealed, ligated, and gel-purified as described previously (22Wang D. Hara R. Singh G. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6747-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The platinum damage site was located in the template strand of the duplex DNA probe, and a biotin moiety was placed at the 3′-end of fragment T7 T50. For promoter-independent transcription, an 86-bp DNA probe with a 9-nucleotide (nt) 3′-overhang carrying a platinum intrastrand cross-link was prepared by ligating four oligonucleotides (Fig. 1C). RNA8 was purchased from Dharmacon. Complete sequences of all DNA and RNA oligonucleotides are supplied as supplemental material. Promoter-dependent in Vitro Transcription—The biotin-labeled DNA templates (T7 145; Fig. 1B) were immobilized onto Dynabeads following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Immobilized DNA templates were pre-equilibrated with the transcription buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, and 10 mm NaCl). Transcription by T7 RNA polymerase was carried out by incubating ∼5 nm DNA template with an equimolar amount of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 unit/μlof the RNase inhibitor RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.12 mm ATP, 0.12 mm GTP, 5 μm UTP, and 1 μm [α-32P]UTP in transcription buffer at room temperature for 5 min. The transcription elongation complex pauses after the synthesis of a 14-nt RNA transcript (EC14; Fig. 1B) due to the lack of CTP in the reaction solution. Magnetic beads containing transcription complexes were separated from the solution by placing reaction tubes in a magnetic rack (DYNAL). The supernatant solution was removed by aspiration with a pipette. The transcription elongation complex was washed with cold transcription buffer three times and used for the next transcription steps. Single round transcription assays were performed without magnetic separation of elongation complexes from the reaction solution. NTPs (1 mm final concentration) and 2 μg of heparin were added into the transcription solution containing the paused elongation complex (EC14) formed by 0.12 mm ATP, 0.12 mm GTP, 5 μm UTP, and 1 μm [α-32P]UTP. Transcribed RNAs were ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on 6% urea polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Promoter-independent in Vitro Transcription—A 5′-phosphorylated PI T50 deoxyoligonucleotide was annealed with RNA8, labeled with32P at the 5′-end, by heating at 50 °C and cooling slowly to room temperature (Fig. 1C). An 8-pmol portion of this annealed probe was mixed with an equimolar quantity of T7 RNA polymerase in a total volume of 20 μl of the transcription buffer described above. Following a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, ∼200 pmol of PI C59 was added to the binding solution, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. This artificial mimic of an elongation complex containing the 8-nt RNA segment (EC RNA8) was extended by 6 nt to form a more stable complex containing a 14-nt RNA segment (EC RNA14) by incubation with 10 μm ATP and GTP. EC RNA14 was isolated from excess probe and NTP by immobilization onto MagneHis nickel beads, which bind the histidine tag of T7 RNA polymerase (Fig. 1C). Approximately 3 pmol of EC RNA14 was obtained by this method. Next, a 2-pmol quantity of the 86-bp DNA probe containing a specific platinum cross-link was added to the immobilized RNA14 (1-pmol) elongation complex in 10 μl of transcription buffer containing T4 DNA ligase (2.5 units), 0.5 mm ATP, and 1% polyethylene glycol 8000. The ligation reaction was carried out at 12 °C for 1 h. The resulting EC RNA14 complexes on the 145-bp DNA probe (PI 145; Fig. 1C) were washed extensively, and transcription buffer containing the indicated concentrations of NTP was added to initiate transcription elongation. Multiround in Vitro Transcription—Promoter-dependent transcription was performed in vitro as discussed above. Elongation complexes paused 14 nt from the start site (EC14) were isolated from the reaction solution (Fig. 1B). Upon the addition of NTPs, isolated elongation complexes proceeded and then stalled at the site of platination. Approximately 2 pmol of additional T7 RNA polymerase was added to 1 pmol of the immobilized DNA template containing these stalled elongation complexes. Following this new round of transcription for 5 min, the magnetic beads were separated from the reaction mixture. RNA transcripts from both the beads and the supernatant solution were isolated and analyzed. Platinum Removal by Cyanide Ion Treatment—Separated elongation complexes EC14 were obtained following promoter-dependent transcription on 145-bp DNA templates containing the GG dach adduct. T7 RNA polymerases stalled at the damage sites were prepared by the addition of 100 μm NTP. An additional elongation complex was prepared at a position (EC40; Fig. 1B) 40 nt from the start site by adding only ATP, CTP, and GTP. EC14, EC40, and the stalled polymerases were washed with cold transcription buffer three times to remove NTPs. Chemical removal of platinum adducts from each elongation complex was accomplished by treatment with 0.1 or 0.2 m NaCN in transcription buffer at 37 °C for 30 min (23Bauer W. Gonias S.L. Kam S.K. Wu K.C. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The elongation complex was removed from the NaCN solution by the magnetic beads. After washing the elongation complex with cold transcription buffer, transcription was resumed for each of the complexes by the addition of 100 μm NTPs. Promoter-dependent in Vitro Transcription on Platinated Templates—An immobilized 145-bp DNA probe containing a biotin moiety at the 3′-end of the template strand, a T7 promoter, and a platinum intrastrand cross-link was constructed as indicated in Fig. 1. T7 RNA polymerase was employed to investigate minimal transcription in vitro with the immobilized DNA probe. Fig. 2 shows that T7 RNA polymerase is capable of generating RNA transcripts following initiation on the immobilized DNA templates. In the absence of CTP, a transcription elongation complex comprising 14 residues of transcribed RNA transcript (5′-GAAUU AAUGG GGAU-3′) was expected to form (Fig. 1). An RNA transcript of 14 residues is produced from this reaction (Fig. 2). In addition, many short RNA transcripts containing fewer than 10 residues are produced by abortive transcription initiation. Nonspecific RNA transcripts longer than the expected 14 residues are also observed. CTP contamination in [α-32P]UTP and false transcription initiation before the start site are the most likely sources of these longer transcripts. Isolation of the transcription elongation complex on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, however, removes all of these abortive initiation products and diminishes the amount of nonspecific transcripts (compare lane 1 with lane 2). Transcription elongation is resumed by adding 0.5 mm of NTPs (lanes 3, 6, and 9), which extends the 14-residue RNA in an elongation complex to a 125-nt RNA run-off transcript along the undamaged DNA probe (lane 3). Elongation stops at both cisplatin damage sites, GG Pt and GTG Pt (lanes 6 and 9, respectively), however. T7 RNA polymerase appears to stall at several positions in the vicinity of the platinum adducts (lanes 6 and 9). Transcription Bypass through Platinum Binding Sites—Single-round transcription was performed by heparin treatment without magnetic separation of the elongation complexes (EC14). These elongation complexes, as well as EC14 products isolated by the magnetic bead methodology for comparison, were subjected to a second round of elongation to investigate bypass through the platinum lesions. In these two different transcription systems, DNA templates containing [Pt(dach)Cl2] 1,2- and 1,3-intrastrand cross-links were employed together with probes containing the analogous cisplatin cross-links. As revealed in Fig. 3, the bands for run-off transcripts in single-round transcription (lanes S) are more intense compared with those for transcription from isolated EC14 complexes (lanes B). The relative abilities of the individual adducts to inhibit T7 RNA polymerase, however, are unchanged by the two different experimental procedures. GTG dach, with a sterically larger spectator ligand, most strongly blocks T7 RNA polymerase. The polymerase bypasses GG dach adducts most efficiently, however, despite the bulky ligand. Overall, platinum 1,3-d(GpTpG) adducts block the polymerase more efficiently than 1,2-d(GpG) adducts. Promoter-independent in Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription on the immobilized DNA template allows us to use a “transcription walking” method to provide the exact positioning of the polymerase along the DNA probe. The promoter-dependent transcription methodology, however, generates several populations of RNA transcripts, which most likely originate from nonspecific transcription initiation around the start site (data not shown and see above). Multiple stop sites in the vicinity of the platinum adduct, such as those observed in Fig. 2, might therefore derive from such false initiation. In order to circumvent this problem, we employed a promoter-independent T7 RNA polymerase transcription assay by assembling an elongation complex to study the exact stop sites of the stalled polymerase (Fig. 1C). The construction of similar elongation complexes of yeast RNA polymerase II and T7 RNA polymerase using RNA:DNA hybrids has been reported previously (24Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 25Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts corresponding to RNA48 and RNA62 were produced from “transcription walking” along the undamaged DNA probe (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). In this experiment, the 5′-end of the T-95 DNA fragment was also labeled with32P in order to confirm the ligation between an assembled EC and the 86-bp DNA probe (Fig. 1C). 145-mer DNA probes (PI 145) and unligated 95-mer DNA fragments (T-95) are visible in Fig. 4A. It is noteworthy that 133-nt run-off RNA transcripts are not detectable in this experiment, indicating that most T7 RNA polymerases stall at the GG Pt and GTG Pt lesions on the template strand. At a low concentration of NTP, the polymerase stops before the cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link, producing 62 residues of RNA transcript (Fig. 4, B and C). High NTP concentration drives the polymerase to the damaged d(GpG) site. At a cisplatin 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) cross-link, most of the T7 RNA polymerase reaches the first G site of d(GpTpG) adduct, even at a low concentration of NTPs. The polymerase is capable of proceeding to the T residue of d(GpTpG) at high NTP concentrations. Blockage of T7 RNA polymerase by {Pt(dach)}2+ DNA adducts was also examined by this method. Despite the relatively high ability of T7 RNA polymerase to bypass a GG dach adduct in promoter-dependent transcription (Fig. 3), no detectable run-off RNA transcripts were observed on DNA containing either GG dach or GTG dach lesions (data not shown). The specific sites of NTP-driven translocation of elongation complexes into cisplatin and [Pt(dach)Cl2] cross-links following transcription are depicted in Fig. 5A. T7 RNA polymerase is able to proceed only to the first G residue of [Pt(dach)Cl2] d(GpG) and d(GpTpG) cross-links (Fig. 5, A and B). UTP-specific Incorporation by T7 RNA Polymerase at the Site of a Cisplatin 1,2-Intrastrand d(GpG) Cross-link—We further studied nucleotide incorporation by T7 RNAP at the site of platinum damage under conditions of high NTP concentration, with the aim of determining whether a specific nucleotide might be responsible for this effect. T7 RNAP elongation complexes, stalled before the damage site at low NTP concentration (10 μm) and containing 62-nt RNA, were subsequently treated with 1 mm ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, or all four NTPs. As shown in Fig. 6A, T7 RNAP inserts two additional nucleotides at the site of a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link only when 1 mm UTP is present in addition to 10 μm NTP, forming 64-nt RNA transcripts. Interestingly, the elongation complex is not able to transcribe into the damage site at a high concentration (1 mm) of ATP, GTP, or even CTP, the correct nucleotide for the d(GpG) template. A fraction of T7 RNAP, stalled at the first G site of the cisplatin 1,3-d(GpTpG) cross-link, incorporates a nucleotide opposite T in the template strand of this lesion after the addition of 1 mm NTP (Fig. 6A). These RNA products are observed only at 10 μm NTP with 1 mm ATP or UTP. In a parallel experiment, we removed the 10 μm NTP from the reaction solution after forming the elongation complexes stalled at the site of a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link under the conditions (10 μm NTP) described above. Upon the addition of 1 mm ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, or all four NTPs, we observed that only 1 mm UTP could drive T7 RNAP transcription into the d(GpG) site (Fig. 6B). The data also indicate that T7 RNAP readily incorporates the incorrect nucleotide (UTP), not the correct one (CTP), at the site of the cisplatin d(GpG) cross-link. Fig. 6B also demonstrates the presence of RNA products shorter than 62 nt only when ATP, GTP, or CTP is added to stalled polymerase. This result would appear to indicate intrinsic cleavage of RNA transcripts by stalled T7 RNAP. Multiround in Vitro Transcription—Recently, the ability of a trailing RNA polymerase molecule to alleviate an arrested RNAP was reported when more than one RNA polymerase transcribes along the same DNA template (26Epshtein V. Nudler E. Science. 2003; 300: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Multiround transcription was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to study the effect of a trailing RNA polymerase on polymerase stalled at a platinum cross-link. Upon treatment with additional RNA polymerase, the RNA transcripts in stalled elongation complexes are dissociated from the immobilized DNA template, whereas the transcripts remain at damage sites on the DNA templates without such treatment (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 7 and 8; lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 11 and 12). T7 RNA polymerase that initiates from the same T7 promoter and follows the stalled elongation complex is responsible for the dissociation of the stalled polymerase from immobilized DNA, since added polymerases have no effect on the stalled polymerase in the absence of NTPs (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). Restarting Transcription following Platinum Removal by Cyanide Ion Treatment—Cyanide ion has been successfully used to remove platinum adducts from DNA as the [Pt(CN)4]2- complex (23Bauer W. Gonias S.L. Kam S.K. Wu K.C. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Lippard S.J. Ushay H.M. Merkel C.M. Poirier M.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5165-5168Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This method was used to dissociate platinum from immobilized DNA in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase stalled at the damage site. Platinum adducts were abstracted most efficiently from the [Pt(dach)Cl2] 1,2-intrastrand cross-link under our cyanide ion treatment conditions (data not shown). As indicated in Fig. 8, most elongation complexes stay on the DNA templates after exposure to NaCN. Upon treatment with cyanide ion, more than 90% of the early elongation complexes EC14 are still active (lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, 40% of EC40s are unable to resume transcription after 0.2 m NaCN treatment, and 0.1 m NaCN inactivates 30% of these complexes (lanes 6 and 8). A similar level of elongation complex inactivation occurred upon 0.2 m NaCl treatment without any platinum abstraction (data not shown). These results are presumably the consequence of increased ionic strength. In the absence of cyanide ion, 16% of T7 RNAP bypasses the GG dach adduct, as indicated in Fig. 3. Approximately 77 and 95% of active elongation complexes generate run-off RNA transcripts beyond the site of the platinum lesion after 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCN treatment, respectively (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), indicating successful removal of the GG dach adduct. Similar levels of run-off transcripts are observed following re-elongation of stalled elongation complexes compared with EC40s following platinum complexation by NaCN. This result indicates that T7 RNA polymerase stalled at a platinum lesion is able to resume transcription after the damage is removed. Promoter-dependent and -independent Transcription Inhibition at Platinum Cross-links—The transcription system in which platinum-DNA adducts are immobilized on a solid support provides a powerful tool to investigate the molecular mechanism of transcription inhibition by, and the properties of RNA polymerases stalled at, the major cross-links formed by cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. The DNA template attached to a solid phase provides a simple way to separate the transcription elongation complex from the reaction solution, allowing us to manipulate the position of the polymerase and detect the release of RNA transcripts from the complex. The activity of the protein Mfd on stalled E. coli RNA polymerase was studied by using an immobilized DNA template in a similar strategy (28Park J.-S. Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, a 100-kDa monomer, transcribes RNA from a biotinylated DNA template attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Early elongation complexes (EC14; Fig. 1), formed under CTP deprivation conditions, are fully capable of performing further transcription by the subsequent addition of all"
https://openalex.org/W2083721695,"Apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents or radiation mainly proceeds through death receptor-independent caspase activation. The release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c, into the cytoplasm leading to Apaf1-dependent activation of caspase-9 is a key event in this pathway. The permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is regulated by the various pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and it is thought that DNA damage triggers apoptosis through the downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient and proficient in Apaf1, we show that DNA-damaging agents and radiation lead to a decline in Bcl-2 protein only in wt MEF, but not in apaf1(-/-) MEF, which are defective in the activation of effector caspases and apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of proapoptotic Noxa, the activation of Bax, the cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, as well as a drop of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential Deltapsim are equally observed in wt and apaf1(-/-) MEF following DNA damage. Moreover, the loss of Bcl-2 protein occurring in wt MEF can be prevented by caspase inhibition. Hence, the activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins rather than the downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 mediates the primary signal in the DNA damage-induced release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins in MEF."

We isolated human wee1 kinase gene promoter and found that it contained one AP-1-binding motif in its promoter region (5'-CGAGTCA-3'; -823/-817), through which wee1 kinase gene was directly transactivated by c-Fos/AP-1. In rheumatoid synovial cells, wee1 kinase was increased in conjunction with the increase of c-Fos/AP-1 and the substrate of wee1, cdc2, was phosphorylated. The amount of wee1 and c-Fos and the phosphorylation of cdc2 were decreased after treatment of the cells with an inhibitor of AP-1, curcumin. A significant proportion of cultured synovial cells of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but not those of osteoarthritis, shifted to a tetraploid (4C) state upon long-term culture. Thus, human wee1 kinase gene is directly transactivated by and increased in association with c-Fos/AP-1, and rheumatoid synovial cells overexpressing these genes go into aberrant mitosis."

As one of the most abundant cytoplasmic heat shock proteins and a member of the molecular chaperone family, Hsp90 is highly conserved during evolution and is ubiquitously expressed for cell survival in animals and plants (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is capable of interacting with a wide variety of proteins both native and denatured to affect their turnover, cellular localization, and activity (7Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R322-R325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The specificity of Hsp90 may reside in its cellular “client” selection for players in transcription regulation and signal transduction pathways, such as the steroid hormone receptors, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, oncogenic tyrosine kinase, or cellular serine/threonine kinases, and has been defined as a specific molecular chaperone (9Pearl L.H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). There are two cytoplasmic versions of the Hsp90 subfamily in mammalian cells encoded by two distinct genes, the hsp90α and hsp90β (11Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell.

Although Hsp90α and Hsp90β proteins share very high homology, we have demonstrated that the regulation mechanisms of the two genes are quite different (13Zhang S.L. Yu J. Cheng X.K. Ding L. Heng F.Y.

Wen G.Y. Shen, Y.F. Advances in Medical Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. China Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag, Beijing1999: 205-208Google Scholar). We reported elsewhere (16Shen Y.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 4: 35-40Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that Hsp90 is not only induced in stress response but also uniquely expressed in mitogen-activated T lymphoid cells, indicating its potential importance in cell growth. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that in heat-shocked or other stressed cells, Hsp90 takes part in protecting cell survival and counteracts apoptosis (17Xu Y. Linquest S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 18Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Hostein I. Robertson D. DiStefano F. Workman P. Clarke P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4003-4009PubMed Google Scholar). PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases that participates as a central component in signal transduction pathways responding to multiple external stimuli (2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5735) Google Scholar). It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological functions, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (21Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although PKC isoforms share conserved domains, they exhibit different tissue distribution, subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and cofactor requirements (22Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 23Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332 (Pt. 2): 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The PKC isoforms consist of three subgroups based on their structure and cofactor requirements, the conventional isoforms (cPKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ) which require both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol/phorbol ester for activation; the novel isoforms (nPKC-δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ) which are Ca2+-independent but diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-dependent; and the atypical isoforms (aPKC-ζ, -μ, and -τ/λ) which are Ca2+- and diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-independent (2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 24Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that individual PKC isoforms may play a distinct role in regulation of cellular functions. In some cases, PKC isoforms may counteract each other in regulating cell growth, transformation, or apoptosis (21Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). For example, PKC-ϵ functions as an oncogene upon overexpression, whereas PKC-δ usually promotes differentiation or apoptosis (25Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C.

Our early findings showed that PKC was involved in hsp90 gene expression in heat-shocked Jurkat cells (15Shen Y.F. Wen G.Y. Shen, Y.F. Advances in Medical Molecular Biology. Vol. 2.

However, it is unclear which isoforms of the PKC family are specifically involved in the heat shock-induced responses, such as the induction of hsp90 expression. We demonstrate here that PKC-ϵ plays a critical role in the induction of the hsp90β gene but not the hsp90α gene in response to heat shock in Jurkat cells. The results suggest a link between the Hsp family and the PKC family in heat shock response. It is possible that cooperation between these two families of proteins may play an important role in cell growth control in mammalian cells. Cell Culture—Human Jurkat T lymphoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.03% l-glutamine, 0.2% NaHCO3, 0.59% HEPES (pH 7.2), and sodium penicillin and streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml each) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. For PKC inhibitor studies, Jurkat cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitor GF109203X or Gö6976 at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by a wash of the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells in each condition were then separated into two groups and incubated at either 42 °C or 37 °C for 1 h. Reagents—PKC inhibitors (GF109203X and Gö6976) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-β-actin antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize PKC-δ, -η, -θ, and -α were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse IgG2a against PKC-ϵ was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Antibody against HSP90β and anti-FLAG antibody were obtained from Stressgen and Sigma, respectively. DNA Constructs—A full-length cDNA clone for human PKC-ϵ isoform was obtained from Dr. A. P. Fields (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The human PKC-ϵ cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript II-SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and a FLAG-epitope tag was inserted to the NH2 terminus of the PKC-ϵ in frame. The FLAG-PKC-ϵ cDNA was then cloned into an expression vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). Constructs expressing constitutively active (CA) mutant PKC-ϵ (A159E) and dominant-negative (DN) mutant PKC-ϵ (K437R) were described previously (26Lang W. Wang H. Ding L. Xiao L. Cell. Signalling. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing wild-type PKC-α, PKC-α (A25E, CA-mutant), and PKC-α (K368A, DN-mutant) were generous gifts from Dr. Jean-Guy LeHoux of the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec (27LeHoux J.G. Dupuis G. Lefebvre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8021-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For quantifying the promoter activity of human hsp90 genes, the -1756/+37 fragment of the hsp90α gene and the -1039/+1531 fragment of the hsp90β gene were independently fused to the upstream of a CAT reporter gene in pBLCAT3 to form reporter plasmids of p90α1-CAT and p90β3.1-CAT, respectively (13Zhang S.L. Yu J. Cheng X.K. Ding L. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Shen Y.F. Liu J.H. Wang X.Z. Cheng X.K. Wang Y.L. Wu N.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A transfection control plasmid was constructed in which the +698/+1003-bp fragment of the CAT gene was deleted to express a mutant CAT and was designated as pm-CAT (28Mo Z.C. Li X.Y. Li H.F. Cheng X.K. Xiao L. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. Prog. Nat. Sci. 2002; 12: 742-746Google Scholar). DNA Transfection—Transient transfection of Jurkat cells was carried out by electroporation (as described in Ref. 29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 16.33-16.35Google Scholar). For promoter activity assays, cells (1.5 × 107) were transfected with a mixture of 27 μg of reporter plasmid hsp90α1-CAT or hsp90β3.1-CAT and 3 μg of control plasmid pm-CAT. For assessing PKC isoform-specific effects, constructs expressing wild-type or mutants of PKC-ϵ or PKC-α were individually co-transfected with reporter plasmid hsp90β3.1-CAT along with a control plasmid of pm-CAT into Jurkat cells. At 48-h after transfection, cells were separated into two groups and incubated at either 42 °C or 37 °C for 1 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted according to the method described by Chomezynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and used for detecting mRNA expression and promoter activity of hsp90 genes. Detection of mRNA Expression and Promoter Activity of hsp90 Genes—The mRNA levels of hsp90 genes were determined based on a competitive RT-PCR assay as described by Wang et al. (31Wang Y.L. Shen Y.F. Mei S.E. Liu J.H. Mo X.M. Cheng X.K. Wu N.H. Chin. Sci. Bull. 1996; 41: 1730-1734Google Scholar). Briefly, an internal control RNA (icRNA) was first transcribed in vitro from pHS-YL3 plasmid, which contains the same 5′ and 3′ fragments that existed in the cDNAs of the hsp90α and hsp90β genes. An equal amount of icRNA was then mixed with each aliquot of cellular RNA, reverse-transcribed, and amplified in the competitive RT-PCR system. The sizes of amplified fragments for hsp90α mRNA and icRNA were 564 and 841 bp, respectively, and the amplified fragments for hsp90β mRNA and icRNA were 337 and 625 bp, respectively. For promoter activity assays, control plasmid pm-CAT was co-transfected into Jurkat cells with either hsp90α1-CAT or hsp90β3.1-CAT in an appropriate ratio. Total cellular RNA was then isolated for competitive RT-PCR using paired 5′ and 3′ primers corresponding to nucleotides +554/+573 and +1122/+1141 of pBLCAT3, respectively. A 588-bp fragment for wild-type CAT driven by the hsp90 promoter and a smaller fragment of 286 bp generated from control plasmid pm-CAT were co-amplified and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence intensity of each band stained with ethidium bromide was analyzed with an UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of two bands in each RT-PCR (hsp90 mRNA to icRNA or hsp90-CAT to pm-CAT) was defined as the relative mRNA expression or the relative promoter activity of the hsp90 gene, respectively. Subcellular Fractionation—All of the experimental procedures in subcellular fractionation were carried out at 4 °C with all of the solutions pre-chilled. The fractionation was performed as described by Ding et al. (32Ding L. Wang H. Lang W. Xiao L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35305-35313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Jurkat cells (2 × 107) harvested by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1.5 ml of hypotonic Hepes buffer (HHB: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 15 min, cell suspensions were homogenized by using a Dounce homogenizer for 30-50 strokes and then spun at 200 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed with HHB, suspended in 200 μl of HHB, and sonicated for 5 s, which was designated as HM for heavy membrane fraction. The resulting supernatants were further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C (Beckman SW-60 rotor) and were designated as the cytosolic fraction (Cyto). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described previously (33Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Aliquots of subcellular fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters in a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in a blocking solution (for PKC-δ, -e, -θ, -η, and HSP90β: 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline; for PKC-ϵ, 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl) and then incubated 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies in blocking solution. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia). The intensity of each protein band was scanned and analyzed on an UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Novel PKCs Are Involved in Heat Shock-induced hsp90β Gene Expression—Our previous findings indicated that PKC was involved in hsp90 gene expression in heat-shocked Jurkat cells (15Shen Y.F. Wen G.Y. Shen, Y.F. Advances in Medical Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. China Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag, Beijing1999: 205-208Google Scholar). To identify the specific PKC isoform(s) involved, we assessed the effects of two isoform-selective PKC inhibitors, GF109203X and Gö6976, on heat shock-induced expression of hsp90 genes (34Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were pretreated with indicated PKC inhibitors and subsequently heat shocked at 42 °C for 1 h. Controls were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mRNA levels of hsp90 genes were determined by competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, GF109203X, which inhibits the activity of both classical (cPKC-α and -β) and novel (nPKC-δ and -ϵ) PKC isoforms, specifically repressed the heat shock-induced accumulation of hsp90β mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, which was initially observed at the concentration of 0.02 μm. In contrast, GF109203X showed no effect on the induction of hsp90α mRNA by heat shock. GF109203X elicited similar effects on the promoter activity of hsp90 genes; the inhibitor repressed only the heat shock-induced promoter activity of the hsp90β gene but not the hsp90α gene (Fig. 1B). At the concentration of 2.0 μm, GF109203X abolished the heat shock-induced elevation of the hsp90β promoter activity as well as mRNA induction. The results indicated that PKC plays a specific role in mediating the induction of the hsp90β gene expression in heat-shocked Jurkat cells. To further define the identity of PKC isoform(s) involved, a cPKC-specific inhibitor Gö6976 was used. As shown in Fig. 2, at various concentrations, Gö6976 exerted little inhibition on the heat shock-induced mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2, left panel) and promoter activity (Fig. 2, right panel) of the hsp90β gene. Together, the data exclude the participation of cPKC in the regulation of heat shock-induced hsp90β gene expression and suggest a role for nPKCs in this event. Heat Shock-induced Membrane Translocation of nPKC-ϵ in Jurkat Cells—PKCs have been shown to undergo activation-dependent intracellular redistribution. In particular, a membrane translocation upon stimulation has been linked to the PKC activation. We investigated whether any nPKC isoform can be induced to translocate from the cytosol to the membrane in Jurkat cells by heat shock at 42 °C for 1 h. Cells were either maintained at 37 °C (mock controls) or heat shocked at 42 °C (experimental groups). As a positive control, cells were also stimulated with a PKC activator, PMA. Cells harvested from different treatments were subjected to subcellular fractionation followed by Western blot analysis for detecting cytosolic and membrane levels of nPKC isoforms. Results (Fig. 3) showed that Jurkat cells expressed all four novel PKCs, PKC-δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ, as determined by Western blot analysis. PKC-ϵ was detected as doublet with molecular sizes around 90 kDa, whereas the other three novel PKCs were around 80 kDa, which is consistent with data from others (36Koide H. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Slepko N. Patrizio M. Levi G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that in the unstimulated state all nPKCs existed predominantly in the cytosol. Upon heat shock at 42 °C or PMA treatment, only PKC-ϵ was substantially enriched in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3A, row 2, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, little difference was observed in the distribution of the other three nPKC (Fig. 3A, rows 1 (PKCδ), 3 (PKCη), and 4 (PKCθ)). The redistribution of PKC-ϵ in response to heat shock may be indicative of its activation, suggesting that this isoform may be involved in heat shock-induced hsp90β expression in Jurkat cells. PKC-ϵ Mediates Heat Shock-induced Expression of the hsp90β Gene—Because PKC-ϵ showed a distinct change in its intracellular location during heat shock, we further examined whether PKC-ϵ is a major player in regulating hsp90β expression and whether PKC-ϵ could act independently. Jurkat cells were transfected with wild type (WT), constitutively activated PKC-ϵ (A159) (CA-PKCϵ), or dominant-negative PKC-ϵ (K437R) (DN-PKCϵ); effects of PKC-ϵ expression on hsp90β expression were assayed by mRNA level and promoter activity in response to heat shock. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A, bottom panel) demonstrated that transfected FLAG-tagged WT PKC-ϵ and its mutants were efficiently expressed in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, none of PKC-ϵ constructs notably affected the promoter activity of the hsp90β gene in the absence of heat shock (white bars). Upon heat shock, expression of CA-PKCϵ remarkably induced the hsp90β promoter activity (a 4-fold induction), whereas expression of DN-PKCϵ blocked heat shock-induced induction of the hsp90β promoter activity (Fig. 4A, lane 8 versus lanes 2, 4, and 6). Of note, expression of WT-PKC-ϵ showed no significant effect on the basal and heat shock-induced promoter activity (Fig. 4A, WT versus PCI). To confirm the specificity of PKC-ϵ, we investigated the effect of PKC-α on hsp90β expression by heat shock (Fig. 4B). Consistent with PKC inhibitor studies (Fig. 2), which exclude the involvement of cPKCs in the induction of hsp90β expression upon heat shock, we found that expression of PKC-α (wild type, CA-PKC-α, or DN-PKC-α) had no effect on the promoter activity of the hsp90β gene in response to heat shock. Together, these data clearly suggest an exclusive role for PKC-ϵ in regulating the expression of the hsp90β gene by heat shock. PKC-ϵ Is Not Involved in the Regulation of hsp90β Expression by PMA—Several lines of evidence indicate that PMA is capable of inducing the expression of hsp90 genes in a cell type-specific manner, which may also depend on the dosage and length of treatment adopted (38Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Jornot L. Polla B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14094-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Wang Y.L. Ph.D. thesis. Peking Union Medical College Graduate School, 1995Google Scholar). In particular, we showed previously that PMA efficiently induced hsp90β mRNA but was less effective in the induction of hsp90α mRNA in Jurkat cells (39Wang Y.L. Ph.D. thesis. Peking Union Medical College Graduate School, 1995Google Scholar). Because both PMA and heat shock can lead to PKC-ϵ translocation to the membrane in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3), we investigated whether PKC-ϵ also plays a role in the PMA-induced hsp90β expression. Jurkat cells were transfected with DN-PKC-ϵ (Fig. 5A, black bars) or an empty vector (Fig. 5A, white bars) and then treated with heat shock (42 °C, 1 h), PMA (100 nm, 30 min), or a combination of heat shock and PMA. The promoter activity of the hsp90β gene was assessed by competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5A, when transfected cells were heat shocked in the absence of PMA (Fig. 5A, left panel), the heat shock-induced promoter activity of the hsp90β gene was specifically blocked by the expression of DN-PKC-ϵ (Fig. 5A, bar 4 versus bar 3). When Jurkat cells were treated with PMA alone, the promoter activity of the hsp90β gene in vector-transfected cells (bar 5) was about 2-fold over that of the untreated control (bar 1), indicating that PMA induced hsp90β gene expression. Interestingly, this PMA-induced promoter activity was not affected by the expression of DN-PKC-ϵ (bar 6 versus bar 5). Additionally, we found that when cells were treated with heat shock in addition to the PMA stimulation, there was an additive effect on the induction of hsp90β gene expression (bar 7), and DN-PKC-ϵ partially blocked this induction (bar 8 versus bar 7). These data suggest that DN-PKC-ϵ abrogated the heat shock but not PMA-induced promoter activity of the hsp90β gene. In contrast to DN-PKC-ϵ, expression of DN-PKC-α showed no obvious effects on heat shock as well as PMA-mediated induction of the hsp90β promoter activity (Fig 5B, bar 4 versus bar 3 and bar 8 versus bar 7). These results further confirm our notion that PKC-ϵ is specifically involved in the heat shock-induced expression of the hsp90β gene. It also suggests that heat shock-induced and PMA-induced expression of the hsp90β gene are regulated by distinct mechanisms in a PKC-ϵ-dependent and -independent manner. PKC has been implicated as a potential mediator of inflammatory stimuli-induced gene expression (22Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It was shown that the nuclear PKC activity was stimulated by heat shock prior to the induction of hsp70 mRNA in rat liver (40Holmberg C.I. Roos P.M. Lord J.M. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3357-3365PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ritz M.F. Masmoudi A. Matter N. Rogue P. Lang D. Freysz L. Malviya A.N. Receptor. 1993; 3: 311-324PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown previously that PKC inhibitor GF109203X attenuated the heat shock-induced hsp90β expression in Jurkat cells (15Shen Y.F. Wen G.Y. Shen, Y.F. Advances in Medical Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. China Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag, Beijing1999: 205-208Google Scholar). These data indicate a link between PKC stimulation and heat shock response and suggest that a role for PKC in heat shock response is to modulate the expression of hsp genes. The present study determined the mechanism by which PKC regulates the heat shock response, in particular the induction of hsp90 expression. We showed that pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X, which inhibits both cPKCs (-α and -β) and nPKCs (-δ and -ϵ), preferentially affected heat shock-induced mRNA expression (Fig. 1A) and the promoter activity (Fig. 1B) of the β version of the hsp90 gene but had no effect on that of the hsp90α gene. This finding suggests that the repression of hsp90β expression is mediated by either nPKCs or cPKCs, or alternatively, by the combination of the two PKC subfamilies. To disclose which one of the two PKC subfamily members exerts the enhancing function to hsp90β, we employed a second PKC inhibitor, Gö6976, that is specific to the cPKC subfamily and found that no changes occurred on heat shock-induced mRNA expression and promoter activity of hsp90β at concentrations up to 2 μm (Fig. 2). Thus we excluded the involvement of the cPKC subfamily and suggest that members of the nPKC subfamily are responsible for mediating the induction of hsp90β expression in response to heat shock. PKC isoforms exhibit distinct enzymological properties, differential subcellular localization, and different modes of cellular regulation. Because translocation from the cytosol to the phospholipid-rich environment such as membrane is one of the essential steps that activate the enzyme (42Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), we investigated the subcellular distribution of nPKC in response to heat shock and PMA treatment. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that Jurkat cells expressed four novel PKCs, PKC-δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ. However, only PKC-ϵ demonstrated a heat shock or PMA-mediated translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, evidenced by a decreased level in the cytosol and an increased level in the membrane-associated fractions, indicating that PKC-ϵ may be activated by heat shock in the manner similar to PMA treatment. In contradiction to our results, Holmberg et al. (40Holmberg C.I. Roos P.M. Lord J.M. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3357-3365PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PKC-ϵ was incapable of translocation from the cytosol to the cellular particulate fraction upon heat shock (42 °C for 15 min) in K562 cells. It is possible that heat shock at 42 °C for 15 min (versus 42 °C for 60 min in our study) may not be sufficient to activate the enzyme (membrane translocation). Alternatively, the heat shock-induced translocation of PKC-ϵ is cell-type specific. Expression of wild-type, constitutive active, or dominant-negative PKC-ϵ in Jurkat cells did not lead to an obvious change in basal hsp90β expression in the absence of heat shock (Fig. 4A). Upon heat shock, however, the constitutively active PKC-ϵ exerted a marked induction (a 4-fold increase) of the hsp90β gene, whereas dominant-negative PKC-ϵ completely blocked this effect, suggesting that PKC-ϵ is required only for heat shock-mediated events. It should be noted that expression of WT-PKC-ϵ seems to have little effect on heat shock-mediated induction of hsp90β expression, which was only slightly higher than that in the vector-transfected cells. This suggests that the endogenous PKC-ϵ may be sufficient for the induction of hsp90β by heat shock. In the case of expression of CA-PKC-ϵ, it is possible that activated PKC-ϵ may interact directly with Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, in a functional complex or module leading to the phosphorylation of Hsp90, which in turn stabilizes and keeps PKC-ϵ in a conformation amenable to a full activation upon heat shock. This possibility is supported, at least in part, by our findings that, in Jurkat cells, Hsp90β translocated simultaneously with PKC-ϵ to the membrane upon heat shock, and after the recovery from heat shock, the membrane fractions of both hsp90β and PKC-ϵ were reduced. 2J. M. Wu and Y. F. Shen, unpublished data. The specificity of PKC-ϵ on heat shock-induced expression of the hsp90β gene is further supported by the fact that neither CA-PKC-α nor DN-PKC-α affected the promoter activity of the hsp90β gene in response to heat shock, suggesting that heat shock-induced expression of the hsp90β gene is regulated by a PKC-ϵ-dependent mechanism. Despite the fact that Hsp90α and Hsp90β are highly homologous at the protein level, we have demonstrated earlier that the regulatory sequences and mechanisms that control the expression of these two genes are completely different (13Zhang S.L. Yu J. Cheng X.K. Ding L. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Shen Y.F. Liu J.H. Wang X.Z. Cheng X.K. Wang Y.L. Wu N.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Studies from others and ours suggest that distinct signaling mechanisms are involved in the precise regulation of each hsp90 gene in a heat shock response. For example, we found previously that the intronic heat shock element of hsp90β preferentially binds to the heat shock factor (HSF1) and plays a critical role on heat shock induction of the gene (14Shen Y.F. Liu J.H. Wang X.Z. Cheng X.K. Wang Y.L. Wu N.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was reported that heat shock-induced Hsp70 expression was controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through the activation of HSFs, whereas the PMA-induced HSP70 expression resulted from a stabilization of HSP70 mRNA through the post-transcriptional-dependent mechanism(s) (38Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Jornot L. Polla B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14094-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These data imply that mechanism(s) that control the expression of hsp genes may also be stimuli-specific. Consistent with this notion, we found that PKC-ϵ is required for heat shock- but not PMA-induced induction of hsp90β expression in Jurkat cells. Because PKC has been reported to mediate the phosphorylation of HSF1 and to regulate Hsp70 expression in human cells (41Ritz M.F. Masmoudi A. Matter N. Rogue P. Lang D. Freysz L. Malviya A.N. Receptor. 1993; 3: 311-324PubMed Google Scholar), it is therefore interesting to explore whether PKC-ϵ-mediated heat shock response requires the participation of HSF1 in our system. In summary, we demonstrate that PKC-ϵ can be activated by heat shock and is required for the induction of hsp90β gene expression in heat-shocked Jurkat cells. It is conceivable that PKC-ϵ and Hsp90β may participate in a functional active module to protect cells from external damage, particularly in heat shock-mediated events. We thank Drs. A. P. Fields of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and Jean-Guy LeHoux of University of Sherbrooke in Quebec for generously providing us with full-length cDNA of PKC-ϵ and the PKCα wild-type and mutant constructs, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2137165188,"Calcyon is called a “cross-talk accessory protein” because the mechanism by which it enables the typically Gs-linked D1 dopamine receptor to stimulate intracellular calcium release depends on a priming step involving heterologous Gq-linked G-protein-coupled receptor activation. The details of how priming facilitates the D1R calcium response have yet to be precisely elucidated. The present work shows that calcyon is constitutively localized both in vesicular and plasma membrane compartments within HEK293 cells. In addition, surface biotinylation and luminescence assays revealed that priming stimulates a 2-fold increase in the levels of calcyon expressed on the cell surface and that subsequent D1R activation produces further accumulation of the protein in the plasma membrane. The effects of priming and D1R agonists were blocked by nocodazole implicating microtubules in the delivery of calcyon-containing vesicles to the cell surface. Accumulation of calcyon in the plasma membrane correlated well with increased intracellular calcium levels as thapsigargin mimicked, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane abrogated, the effects of priming. KN-62, an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) also blocked the effects of priming and D1R agonists. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active forms of the kinase bypassed the requirement for priming indicating that CaMKII is a key effector in the Ca2+ and microtubule-dependent delivery of calcyon to the cell surface.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). In addition to the heterotrimeric G-proteins, signaling via D1Rs appears to be regulated by direct association with other proteins called dopamine receptor interacting proteins (DRIPs). Currently identified DRIPs for the D1R include adenosine (2Gines S. Hillion J. Torvinen M. Le Crom S. Casado V. Canela E.I. Rondin S. Lew J.Y. Watson S. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Verniera P. Lluis C.

Calcyon is a predicted single transmembrane protein that is widely distributed in brain (7Zelenin S. Aperia A. Diaz H.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 446: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is abundant in D1R-positive neurons and dendrites in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interaction with calcyon has been shown to enhance the signaling capabilities of D1Rs. Specifically, calcyon enables typically Gs-linked D1Rs to elicit robust intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) release by a mechanism that requires that heterologous Gq-linked GPCRs have first been activated in a step called priming (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from cells in primary culture revealed that endogenous D1 and D5Rs can stimulate [Ca2+]i release in hippocampal and cortical neurons via a priming-dependent mechanism similar is that described for heterologous cells (8Lezcano N. Bergson C. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, details as to the role of Gq-linked GPCR activation in priming the D1R Ca2+ response in either native or heterologous systems are incomplete. Similarly, although the role of calcyon in potentiating D1R-stimulated [Ca2+]i release is well documented, the mechanism by which this is accomplished has yet to be fully elucidated. Several recent studies suggest that the specificity and sensitivity of IP3-mediated [Ca2+]i release is influenced by the spatial proximity of receptors and IP3 signaling “microdomains” (9Xiao B.

Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it is not known whether the spatial arrangement of calcyon and D1Rs is an important aspect of D1R-stimulated [Ca2+]i release. The present study was conducted to better understand how the subcellular distribution of calcyon is regulated during priming and D1R activation. We find that calcyon is constitutively incorporated into the plasma membrane. Levels of cell surface-localized calcyon, however, are significantly increased by heterologous Gq-linked GPCR activation (priming) and subsequent D1/D5 agonist stimulation. Furthermore, intact microtubules and CaMKII activity were required for the agonist-evoked recruitment of calcyon to the plasma membrane. These results provide support for the idea that agonist-dependent trafficking of calcyon-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane may be important for potentiating D1R-stimulated [Ca2+]i release. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing D1R (D1 HEK293 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 250 μg/ml G148, whereas HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected when 50% confluent with the plasmid constructs as specified and processed 18–24 h later. Plasmids used in this study include pCI vector expressing the full-length human calcyon cDNA (pCI-calcyon); pCMV-Tag2C vector expressing FLAG epitope-tagged human calcyon (pFLAG-calcyon), or D1R (pFLAG-D1R) cDNAs. For some experiments, D1 HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-calcyon and a plasmid encoding one of two constitutively active forms of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) designated pRSV-CaMKIIca1–290 and pRSV-CaMKIIT286D (12Sun P.

Agonists were applied in HBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2.5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, or HEPES-MEM containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in MEM. Carbachol, SKF81297-HBr, dopamine, and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. ATP was obtained from Roche Applied Sciences. KN-62, bisindolylmaleimide I, bisindolylmaleimide V, and jasplikinolide were purchased from Calbiochem, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB) and thapsigargin were obtained from Tocris. Sucrose Density Gradient Subcellular Fractionation—D1 HEK293 cells were grown on 100-mm dishes and transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with 2 μgof pCI-calcyon DNA per dish. 20–24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in ice-cold 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% sucrose and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) with a rubber policeman. Homogenates were prepared in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer (size B) by applying 15 strokes. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were layered on top of a discontinuous step sucrose gradient with the steps from top to bottom containing, respectively, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% sucrose in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Gradients were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor overnight at 4 °C. Five equal 1.5-ml fractions were collected from the interfaces between 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, and 50–60% ranges of sucrose. After dilution with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, each fraction was centrifuged again in the SW41 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 2 h. The pellets were dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer without mercaptoethanol or bromphenol blue, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). 50 μg from each fraction was separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (14Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Type 3 IP3 receptors, D1R, Na+/K+ATPase α-1, and calcyon were detected using anti-IP3R3 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2000) (BD Biosciences), anti-D1R rat monoclonal antibody (1:2000) (Sigma), anti-Na+/K+ATPase α-1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:2000) (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-calcyon affinity-purified rabbit antibodies (1:2000) (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), respectively. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing 10% nonfat dry milk, 5% normal goat serum, in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with affinity-purified rabbit calcyon antibody diluted 1:2000. The membranes were subsequently washed three times, each for 20 min with PBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBST, antibody reactive bands were detected using an ECLplus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Non-cleavable Biotin Studies—20–24 h after transfection, HEK293, or D1 HEK293 cells were washed twice with HBS pre-warmed to 37 °C and exposed to agonist(s) for times as specified under “Results.” Cells were immediately transferred to ice after agonist treatment and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeant, non-cleavable sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10 mm glycine. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS with a rubber policeman, and collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were dissolved in a minimum volume of mild lysis solution (Cytosignal) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cleavable Biotin Studies—18–20 h after transfection, D1 HEK293 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeant, cleavable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS. Unreacted biotin was quenched with three washes of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10 mm glycine followed by two washes with HBS pre-warmed to 37 °C. Biotinylated cells were incubated at 37 °C in HBS for 5 min and then treated with agonists for times specified in the results, then immediately placed on ice, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The remaining cell surface biotin was removed by two washes with glutathione strip buffer (containing 50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 10% FBS) each for 20 min at 4 °C. Residual glutathione was quenched with two washes at 4 °C, each for 15 min, with iodoacetamide buffer (50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS with a rubber policeman. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 5 min and dissolved in mild lysis buffer (Cytosignal) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates of the cleavable and non-cleavable biotinylated samples were sonicated for 5 s, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples were then diluted with lysis buffer to give equivalent protein concentrations in all samples. Streptavidin slurry (100 μl) was added to samples containing 500 μg of protein in 150 μl and nutated for 2 h at 4 °C. Streptavidin-bound biotinylated proteins were washed twice with 300 μl of mild lysis solution followed by two washes with 300 μl of 1.5 m guanidine HCl, and two additional washes with 300 μl of mild lysis solution (15Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Alternatively, samples containing 1200 μg of protein were nutated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of calcyon antiserum (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and then nutated for 2 h at room temperature after addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose. The protein complexes were washed three times with mild lysis solution (300 μl) and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and processed as described above. For proteins immunoprecipitated with the calcyon antiserum, blocked membranes were incubated directly with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Bio-Rad) (1:2000) for 1 h, and biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL after washing three times with PBST. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 or D1 HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips, transfected as described above, and processed for immunocytochemistry 20–24 h later. For unpermeabilized conditions, cells were washed three times with MEM media containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (25 mm HEPES-MEM), then blocked with 25 mm HEPES-MEM containing 20% normal goat serum (25 mm HEPES-MEM, 20% NGS) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) (1:1000) diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times each for 20 min with ice cold 25 mm HEPES-MEM. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked again for another 5 min, prior to incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) for 30 min at room temperature. For permeabilized conditions, the cells were washed three times with PBS prior to fixation for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. After incubation in blocking solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 3% nonfat dry milk, 50 mm CaCl2, 5% NGS, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (FLAG M2 (Sigma), golgin-97 (Molecular Probes)) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vital dye, DiIC16 (Molecular Probes) diluted according to the manufacturer's suggestion in blocking solution for 45 min at room temperature. After four washes with PBS each for 20 min, the cells were blocked again for 5 min and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody in blocking solution for 30 min. Both the nonpermeabilized and permeabilized samples were then washed at least six times with PBS each for 20 min, followed by three additional washes with PBST. Coverslips were mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Antibody labeling was viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 META confocal microscope and documented using LSM510 software. Luminescence Assays—D1293 and HEK293 cell lines were plated on 60-mm dishes and transfected at 40% confluence with either pFLAG-calcyon (0.4 μg), or both pFLAG-calcyon (0.2 μg) and pRSV-CaMKIIca1–290 (0.2 μg), pRSV-CaMKIIT286D (0.2 μg), or pRSV vector (0.2 μg) as indicated. 20–24 h later, the cells were washed three times with PBS and stimulated with drugs in 2.0 ml of HBS at 37 °C. After treatment, the media was replaced with ice-cold blocking solution (PBS containing 25% NGS) and incubated for 10 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution) for 1 h at 4 °C and then carefully washed three times with ice-cold PBS, each for 5 min prior to fixation for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose in PBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed six times with PBST, each for 5 min. After the final wash, the volume was adjusted to 2.0 ml with PBST, and 100 μl of ECL solution was added. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow light emission rates to plateau. The luminescence was then determined using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Systems) (16He J. Xu J. Castleberry A.M. Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Xu J. He J. Castleberry A.M. Balasubramanian S. Lau A.G. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10770-10777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The values shown for luminescence intensity represent the average of two to four independent transfection experiments with each experiment including three to five replicates per treatment group. Controls included untransfected cells incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and transfected cells incubated with secondary antibody only. The luminescence of both controls was negligible, whereas the values of the FLAG-calcyon transfected D1 HEK293 cells in HBS averaged ∼3000 absolute luminescence units. Luminescence data, reported as the mean ± S.E., were standardized relative to the absolute luminescence values determined for FLAG-calcyon in the D1 HEK293 HBS samples (defined as 100% basal cell surface calcyon) and analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post test with 95% confidence intervals using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Subcellular Localization of Calcyon—Sucrose density gradient fractionation was performed to obtain information on the subcellular distribution of calcyon (Fig. 1). Three bands with molecular masses of 24, 28, and 35 kDa were detected in lysates of pCI-calcyon-transfected D1 HEK293 cells immunoblotted with calcyon antibodies. Calcyon is a predicted 217-residue single transmembrane-containing protein, therefore, the variety of molecular sizes detected likely correspond to core, immature, and mature calcyon proteins during different stages of biosynthesis. Previous studies suggest that the 28- and 24-kDa bands correspond to N-linked glycosylated calcyon and unmodified core calcyon, respectively (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the post-translation modifications involved in synthesis of the 35-kDa species have yet to be elucidated. Enrichment of the 28- and 35-kDa forms of calcyon was detected in gradient fractions two and three, whereas only the 28-kDa band could be detected in fractions four and five. The α1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, an integral plasma membrane protein, was concentrated in fractions one and two with reduced amounts detectable in fractions three and four. In contrast, type III IP3 receptors, which are primarily expressed in vesicular stores but have also been detected in the plasma membrane (15Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were much more abundant in fractions three to five compared with fractions one and two. Given the differential distribution of IP3 receptors and Na+ pumps across gradient fractions, plasma membrane proteins appeared to be enriched in fractions one and two, and vesicular proteins concentrated in fractions three to five. Therefore, the profile of calcyon in the gradient was consistent both with a vesicular and a plasma membrane protein. As expected, D1Rs were also enriched in plasma membrane protein-containing fractions, but more concentrated in fraction two where calcyon also seemed most abundant. Confocal immunolocalization studies were next conducted to visualize the subcellular distribution of calcyon in transfected HEK293 cells. Labeling with affinity-purified calcyon antibodies produced a punctate staining pattern in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery reflecting the vesicular and plasma membrane localization of the protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, detection of FLAG-tagged D1R yielded much stronger labeling of cell boundaries (Fig. 2B). When the confocal sections were merged, colocalization of D1Rs and calcyon was evident in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, as expected for a transmembrane protein, calcyon antibody staining overlapped with that of the ER marker, DiIC16 (Fig. 2E), and the Golgi apparatus marker, golgin-97 (Fig. 2H). The native calcyon protein exhibits an analogous distribution in neurons (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent Regulation of Calcyon Cell Surface Expression—To obtain more direct evidence for the plasma membrane localization of calcyon, surface proteins of pCI-calcyon-transfected D1 HEK293 cells were labeled with membrane-impermeant, non-cleavable biotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin). Surface biotinylation was used as a strategy to specifically label proteins expressed on the cell surface and to distinguish whether calcyon was an integral plasma membrane protein or merely enriched in plasma membrane fractions due to association with D1Rs. Immunoblotting with calcyon antibodies revealed three bands of molecular mass 24, 28, and 35 kDa in both the streptavidin-bound fractions and lysates (Fig. 3A). In contrast, antibodies against two intracellular proteins, ERK42 (Fig. 3B) and rab11(data not shown), detected bands only in “lysate” lanes and confirmed that the biotinylation conditions did not permeabilize the cells. These results further support the idea that some fraction of calcyon is inserted in the plasma membrane. Because calcyon and D1Rs were shown to physically interact by yeast two-hybrid, pull down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (4Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P. Bergson C. Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), an alternative explanation for the above results is that the calcyon detected in the streptavidin eluates may have co-precipitated with biotinylated D1Rs and may not itself be biotinylated. To address this possibility, cell surface biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with calcyon antiserum, and immunoblots were probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. This approach confirmed the cell surface localization of calcyon because bands migrating at ∼28 kDa could be detected in both pCI-calcyon-transfected HEK293 and D1 HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no bands were detected in untransfected HEK293 and D1 HEK293 cells. Because equivalent levels of calcyon are expressed in HEK293 and D1 HEK293 cells (data not shown), the greater abundance of biotinylated calcyon detected following immunoprecipitation from D1 HEK293 compared with HEK293 cells indicated that, to some extent, D1Rs enhance expression of calcyon on the cell surface. We next examined whether the expression of calcyon on the cell surface may be dynamically regulated by priming and D1R agonists. In these experiments, transfected cells were pretreated with the Gq-linked muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol for 5 min, and subsequently treated with a D1/D5 receptor agonist SKF81297 for 10 min before biotinylation. This combination of agonists produced a striking increase in the intensity of the 28- and 35-kDa calcyon immunoreactive bands detected in the streptavidin-bound material compared with similarly processed samples from untreated cells incubated in HBS for an equivalent period of time (Fig. 3C). Priming with the Gq-linked purinergic receptor agonist ATP for 5 min followed by treatment with DA for 10 min also produced a visible increase in levels of streptavidin-precipitated calcyon (Fig. 3D). In contrast, treatment with DA or ATP alone resulted in either a slight decrease or increase in the 35-kDa calcyon band, respectively, but both agonists had little effect on the intensity of the 28-kDa band. Collectively, these results confirm that some fraction of calcyon is constitutively localized in the plasma membrane and strongly indicate that levels of surface localized calcyon are modulated by priming and D1R stimulation. The effect of agonist stimulation on levels of calcyon localized in the plasma membrane was examined in a time-course experiment. Calcyon-transfected D1 HEK293 cells were exposed to SKF 81297 alone for 2, 5, or 15 min or to the D1 agonist for similar times after pretreatment with the priming agent carbachol for 5 min. Immunoblotting of streptavidin-bound fractions with calcyon antibodies revealed a visible increase in the 35-kDa band after 2 min of treatment with SKF81297 following priming with carbachol (Fig. 3E). Although the intensity of the 35-kDa band increased with time of carbachol and SKF treatment compared with samples from cells incubated in HBS for 35 min, more variation was detected in the strength of the 28-kDa band. In contrast, treatment of SKF81297 alone also resulted in a temporary increase in the intensity of the calcyon immunoreactive bands, but the magnitude was less and not sustained compared with the combined treatment with carbachol and SKF81297. Surface D1Rs are known to internalize following agonist stimulation (18Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether priming and/or D1R stimulation also results in internalization of plasma membrane-localized calcyon. In these experiments, surface proteins were labeled with a cleavable, cell-impermeant biotin compound (sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin), agonist"
https://openalex.org/W2128449930,"To determine whether platelet adhesion to surfaces coated with the matrix protein osteopontin requires an agonist-induced increase in the affinity of the integrin αvβ3 for this ligand, we used laser tweezers to measure the rupture force between single αvβ3 molecules on the platelet surface and osteopontin-coated beads. Virtually all platelets stimulated with 10 μm ADP bound strongly to osteopontin, producing rupture forces as great as 100 piconewtons (pN) with a peak at 45-50 pN. By contrast, 90% of unstimulated, resting non-reactive platelets bound weakly to osteopontin, with rupture forces rarely exceeding 30-35 pN. However, ≈10% of unstimulated platelets, resting reactive platelets, exhibited rupture force distributions similar to stimulated platelets. Moreover, ADP stimulation resulted in a 12-fold increase in the probability of detecting rupture forces >30 pN compared with resting non-reactive platelets. Pre-incubating stimulated platelets with the inhibitory prostaglandin E1, a cyclic RGD peptide, the monoclonal antibody abciximab, or the αvβ3-specific cyclic peptide XJ735 returned force histograms to those of non-reactive platelets. These experiments demonstrate that ADP stimulation increases the strength of the interaction between platelet αvβ3 and osteopontin. Furthermore, they indicate that platelet adhesion to osteopontin-coated surfaces requires an agonist-induced exposure of αvβ3-binding sites for this ligand. To determine whether platelet adhesion to surfaces coated with the matrix protein osteopontin requires an agonist-induced increase in the affinity of the integrin αvβ3 for this ligand, we used laser tweezers to measure the rupture force between single αvβ3 molecules on the platelet surface and osteopontin-coated beads. Virtually all platelets stimulated with 10 μm ADP bound strongly to osteopontin, producing rupture forces as great as 100 piconewtons (pN) with a peak at 45-50 pN. By contrast, 90% of unstimulated, resting non-reactive platelets bound weakly to osteopontin, with rupture forces rarely exceeding 30-35 pN. However, ≈10% of unstimulated platelets, resting reactive platelets, exhibited rupture force distributions similar to stimulated platelets. Moreover, ADP stimulation resulted in a 12-fold increase in the probability of detecting rupture forces >30 pN compared with resting non-reactive platelets. Pre-incubating stimulated platelets with the inhibitory prostaglandin E1, a cyclic RGD peptide, the monoclonal antibody abciximab, or the αvβ3-specific cyclic peptide XJ735 returned force histograms to those of non-reactive platelets. These experiments demonstrate that ADP stimulation increases the strength of the interaction between platelet αvβ3 and osteopontin. Furthermore, they indicate that platelet adhesion to osteopontin-coated surfaces requires an agonist-induced exposure of αvβ3-binding sites for this ligand. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a fundamental role in processes as diverse as wound repair, cancer cell metastasis, organogenesis, implantation, and thrombosis (1Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ability of integrins to interact with ligands can be regulated, to a greater or lesser extent, by cellular metabolism, a process known as “inside-out signaling” (2Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is often not possible to determine experimentally whether inside-out signaling augments cell adhesion by increasing integrin avidity for ligands via integrin clustering or whether it actually increases the affinity of integrins for ligands. Agonist-induced changes in integrin avidity are thought to be largely responsible for the increase in αLβ2- and α4β1-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively, although agonist-stimulated changes in the affinity of these integrins for their ligands have also been reported (3Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 to support platelet aggregation is due to an agonist-induced increase in the affinity of αIIbβ3 for soluble ligands (5Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laser tweezers are an optical system in which external forces applied to a particle trapped by a laser can be accurately measured, because the angular deflection of the laser beam is directly proportional to the lateral force applied to the particle. Laser tweezers are sensitive and accurate at the lower end of the force spectrum (0-150 pN) 1The abbreviations used are: pNpiconewtonOPNosteopontinPGE1prostaglandin E1VNvitronectinMES4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acidTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine.

Litvinov R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, because laser tweezers can measure the force of interaction between individual receptor-ligand pairs (7Weisel J.W. Shuman H. Litvinov R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), they can potentially differentiate between agonist-stimulated changes in integrin avidity versus changes in integrin affinity. To use laser tweezers for this purpose, a ligand-coated bead can be trapped by the laser and repeatedly brought into contact with an integrin-coated pedestal or an immobilized cell so that the forces required to separate the two can be measured and displayed as “rupture force” histograms. piconewton osteopontin prostaglandin E1 vitronectin 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. Previously, we used laser tweezers to measure rupture forces between the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 and its principal ligand fibrinogen (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that measured rupture forces could be segregated into three classes: first, rupture forces of 10 pN or less were contacts during which no binding occurred or were optical artifacts; second, rupture forces of 10-60 pN that represented nonspecific interactions between the fibrinogen-coated beads and the αIIbβ3-coated pedestal; and third, rupture forces ranging from 60 to 150 pN and a peak yield strength of 80-100 pN that resulted from specific binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3. Moreover, because we observed only one well defined peak of specific αIIbβ3-fibrinogen rupture forces, rather than a series of peaks that was a multiple of a single rupture force, we concluded that the peak represented the interaction of individual αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen molecules. In addition, rupture events nearly all occurred as a single step, also consistent with the probability that each one represented the rupture of a single ligand-receptor pair. Platelets express a second β3 integrin, αvβ3. Although there are 50-500-fold fewer copies of αvβ3 compared with αIIbβ3 on platelets (9Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Blood. 1989; 74: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), αvβ3 mediates the adhesion of platelets to the matrix proteins osteopontin (OPN) and vitronectin (VN), at least in vitro, and like αIIbβ3 does so only following platelet stimulation (11Bennett J.S.

Haemostas. 2003; 1: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There are two possible parallel explanations for the increase in αvβ3-mediated platelet adhesion to OPN and VN following platelet stimulation. First, platelet stimulation could increase the avidity of αvβ3 for its ligands by inducing αvβ3 clustering (14Bazzoni B. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Second, platelet stimulation could increase the affinity of αvβ3 for OPN and VN by inducing a conformational change in αvβ3, similar to the way in which platelet stimulation enables αIIbβ3 to bind soluble ligands (5Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the second possibility, we reported that incubating platelets with the reducing agent dithiothreitol or with the divalent cation Mn2+ induces platelet adhesion to OPN, indicating that αvβ3-mediated platelet adhesion can be induced by perturbing the conformation of extracellular domain of αvβ3 (13Paul B.Z.S. Vilaire G. Kunapuli S.P. Bennett J.S. J. Thromb. Haemostas. 2003; 1: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Pampori et al. (15Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), using a monovalent ligand mimetic antibody that selectively binds to the activated form of αvβ3, were unable to detected antibody binding to resting or thrombin-stimulated platelets. Here we use laser tweezers to examine the consequences of agonist stimulation on the activity of αvβ3 on platelets at the level of single molecules. We found that platelet stimulation specifically increases the force of interaction between individual αvβ3 and OPN molecules. Thus, our data demonstrate that the mechanism responsible for platelet adhesion to OPN-coated surfaces requires an agonist-induced exposure of αvβ3-binding sites for this ligand. Reagents and Materials—The RGD-containing peptide XJ735 (16Bach A.C.I. Espina J.R. Jackson S.A. Stouten P.F.W. Duke J.L. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 293-294Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and recombinant human OPN were gifts of Dr. Shaker Mousa (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.). Plain silica microspheres and COOH-modified latex beads were obtained from Bangs Laboratories, Inc. (Carmel, IN). Sigma supplied N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, bovine serum albumin (≥99%), poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (Mr >300,000), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), ammonium persulfate (SigmaUltra), and MES. Acrylamide and TEMED were purchased from Bio-Rad. Glutaraldehyde was obtained from EMS (Fort Washington, PA). Abciximab (ReoPro®) was purchased from Lilly. All other reagents were analytical grade. Laser Tweezer Measurements—We used a custom-built laser tweezers set-up assembled from a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope, 100 × 1.3NA Fluor lens, and a Spectra Physics FCBar Nd:YAG laser (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to measure the strength of OPN binding to unstimulated and agonist-stimulated human platelets. For these measurements, recombinant human OPN, prepared as described previously (11Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was covalently bound to 0.93-μm carboxylate-modified latex beads using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide as a cross-linking agent in a two-step procedure described in the TechNote 205 issued by Bangs Laboratories, Inc., and previously used to bind fibrinogen. The density of OPN on the bead surface, measured using 125I-labeled OPN, was 29,500 ± 3,200 molecules per μm2. To measure OPN binding to platelets, an individual platelet was trapped from a suspension of gel-filtered human platelets containing ≈5 × 106 platelets/ml and ≈105/ml OPN-coated beads and manually attached to a 5-μm diameter silica pedestal coated with polylysine. All the experiments were performed in a 4 mm HEPES gel filtration buffer, pH 7.4, containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.35 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. An OPN-coated bead, trapped by the laser light, was then brought to a distance of 2-3 μm from the immobilized platelet. After oscillation of the OPN-coated bead was initiated at 50 Hz with 0.8 μm peak-to peak amplitude, the bead was brought into contact with the platelet by micromanipulation using a keyboard-controlled piezoelectric stage. Data collection was initiated at the first contact between the bead and the platelet. Rupture forces following repeated contacts between the platelet and the bead were collected for periods of several seconds to 1 min and were displayed as normalized force histograms for each experimental condition. The studies presented here resulted from measurements using 376 individual platelets and a total of 650,000 contact cycles between OPN-coated beads and platelets. Thus, there were ∼1700 contacts per platelet. Individual forces measured during each contact-detachment cycle were collected into 5-pN bins. The number of events in each bin was plotted against the average force for that bin after normalizing by the total number of interaction cycles. The percentage of events in a particular force range (bin) represented the probability of rupture events at that force, with 100% being the total of all contact cycles, including binding and non-binding events. The results from individual experiments were averaged so that each histogram shown represents from 104 to 105 contacts. Signals corresponding to ruptures forces ≤10 pN could be recorded even in the absence of a trapped latex bead, indicating that such signals represent contacts during which no binding occurred or optical artifacts (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accordingly, rupture forces in this range were considered non-binding events when data were analyzed. Interaction of OPN with Unstimulated Platelets—Initially, we studied the interaction of freshly isolated unstimulated gel-filtered platelets with OPN-coated beads. When observed by light microscopy, these platelets had an oval or discoid shape with rare short protrusions. Individual platelets were easily trapped by a focused laser beam and gently brought into contact with a polylysine-coated surface to which they immediately attached without spreading. As shown in Fig. 1, ∼90% of the attached platelets interacted weakly with the OPN-coated beads, exhibiting rupture forces in the range of 10 to 60 pN. Moreover, the rupture forces segregated into two populations: a predominant population with a range of 10-30 pN and a cumulative probability of ≈1% of total contacts, and a smaller population with rupture forces ranging from 30 to 60 pN and a cumulative probability of ≈0.1%. In contrast, ≈10% of the platelets interacted strongly with the beads, exhibiting rupture forces of up to 100 pN and with a broad peak at 40-55 pN. To verify the specificity of the interaction of OPN with the latter group of platelets, rupture forces were measured in the presence of a cyclic RGD-peptide (cRGD), a competitive inhibitor of OPN binding to αvβ3. As shown in Fig. 2, cRGD decreased the probability of rupture events at all forces, but the probability of detecting rupture forces >30 pN decreased dramatically, such that the resulting rupture force histograms resembled those of the less reactive platelets shown in Fig. 1. This result suggests that the more reactive platelets had been inadvertently activated during the gel filtration procedure or when they were attached to the polylysine-coated pedestal.Fig. 2Effect of a cyclic RGD peptide (cRGD) on the interaction of unstimulated reactive platelets with OPN-coated beads. Aliquots of a suspension of gel-filtered platelets were incubated in the absence (shaded bars) or presence (white bars) of 40 μm cRGD for 15 min at 25 °C. Rupture forces between single platelets and OPN-coated beads were then measured as described for Fig. 1. In the presence of cRGD, there is a substantial decrease in the probability of rupture forces in the 30-60 pN range such that the histogram now resembles that of the unstimulated non-reactive platelets shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interaction of OPN with ADP-stimulated Platelets—Platelet activation is required to induce platelet adhesion to OPN-coated surfaces (11Bennett J.S.

Haemostas. 2003; 1: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Based on previous measurements of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that rupture forces <30 pN between OPN and αvβ3 may be nonspecific, whereas forces >30 pN may correspond to OPN binding to an activated conformation of αvβ3. To test this possibility, 10 μm ADP was added to the platelet suspension immediately before it was studied. As shown in Fig. 3, ADP stimulation substantially affected the interaction of platelets with the OPN-coupled beads. After stimulation, virtually all of the platelets studied had a peak of rupture force at 45-50 pN, indicating that OPN bound strongly to all platelets, compared with only 10% of the unstimulated cells. Moreover, this peak of yield force was far more pronounced than that of the reactive unstimulated cells. Overall, there was a 12-fold increase in the probability of forces >30 pN when the ADP-stimulated platelets were compared with unstimulated reactive platelets, as well as a less pronounced change in smaller nonspecific forces. It should be noted that previous experiments using a variety of proteins not known to interact specifically with platelets indicate that rupture forces <30 pN represent nonspecific interactions (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, rupture forces with a peak at 45-50 pN, induced by ADP, correspond to specific OPN-αvβ3 binding. To confirm that the 45-50 pN peak of rupture stimulated by ADP represents a specific interaction between αvβ3 and OPN, the measurements were repeated using known inhibitors of OPN binding to αvβ3. Competitive inhibitors of OPN binding to αvβ3-cRGD, XJ735, a cyclic RGD-based peptide specific for αvβ3 (16Bach A.C.I. Espina J.R. Jackson S.A. Stouten P.F.W. Duke J.L. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 293-294Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and abciximab, a murine-human chimeric Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 7E3 that binds to both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 (18Coller B.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), reduced the probability of high yield force interactions by 3-6-fold (Fig. 4) without affecting the lower force nonspecific interactions. In addition, PGE1, a prostaglandin that functions as a global inhibitor of platelet reactivity by increasing the platelet concentration of cAMP, returned the force histogram of ADP-stimulated platelets to that of resting non-reactive platelets. It is also noteworthy that whereas the pattern of rupture forces exhibited by the inadvertently stimulated platelets (Fig. 1B) was essentially the same as that of ADP-stimulated platelets, the probability of encountering rupture forces >30 pN was substantially decreased. This indicates that there were fewer activated αvβ3 molecules per platelet and suggests that these platelets were only partially activated as compared with platelets exposed to 10 μm ADP. Because the results shown in Fig. 4 imply that rupture forces >30 pN represent specific interactions between OPN and αvβ3 on agonist-stimulated platelets, we next compared the probability of interaction and the average yield strength of the 3 groups of platelets studied. This comparison, shown in Fig. 5, demonstrates that the probability of specific interactions between OPN and αvβ3, i.e. interactions with rupture forces >30 pN, is directly proportional to the degree of platelet stimulation. Nonetheless, the average yield strength remained constant at a value of 45-50 pN, suggesting that like αIIbβ3, αvβ3 resides on the platelet surface in either an inactive or an active state and that platelet stimulation results in a shift to a greater proportion of active, ligand binding, complexes. It is often not possible to determine experimentally whether integrin-mediated cell adhesion is due to the increased avidity that accompanies integrin clustering or is due to an increase in integrin affinity for adhesive ligands. Because laser tweezers can measure the force of interaction between individual receptor-ligand pairs (7Weisel J.W. Shuman H. Litvinov R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), they have the potential to differentiate between these possibilities. We reported previously (11Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that the integrin αvβ3 mediates the adhesion of agonist-stimulated, but not unstimulated, platelets to surfaces coated with OPN. However, whether platelet adhesion is due exclusively to the integrin-clustering that accompanies ligand binding or results from an agonist-induced increase in αvβ3 affinity for OPN was not clear before the results presented in this paper. Although we have found that perturbing the conformation of the extracellular portion of αvβ3 with either dithiothreitol or Mn2+ also induces platelet adhesion to OPN (13Paul B.Z.S. Vilaire G. Kunapuli S.P. Bennett J.S. J. Thromb. Haemostas. 2003; 1: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that a conformational change in αvβ3 is sufficient to support adhesion, the inability to detect binding of the ligand-mimetic αvβ3 antibody WOW-1 to thrombin-stimulated platelets (15Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggests that this might not be the case. Accordingly, we applied laser tweezers technology to this question, much as we had used the technology to study the interaction of fibrinogen to platelet αIIbβ3 (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate directly that ADP stimulation increases the force of interaction between individual platelet αvβ3 and OPN molecules. Thus, our data imply that the mechanism responsible for platelet adhesion to OPN-coated surfaces requires an agonist-induced increase in the affinity of αvβ3 for this ligand. The validity of this conclusion is based on our ability first to determine which laser tweezers signals correspond to specific interactions between activated αvβ3 and OPN and second to determine whether the specific signals result from the interaction of single αvβ3 and OPN molecules. The strength of nonspecific protein-protein interactions, measured using laser tweezers or atomic force microscopy, can be as large as several tens of piconewtons, partially overlapping forces produced by specific receptor-ligand interactions (19Willemsen O.H. Snel M.M. van der Werf K.O. de Grooth B.G. Greve J. Hinterdorfer P. Gruber H.J. Schindler H. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2220-2228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Stout A.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2976-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To discriminate between specific and nonspecific interactions, we performed experiments using quiescent unstimulated platelets and established inhibitors of OPN binding to αvβ3. Although the vast majority of quiescent platelets were non-reactive with OPN-coated beads, such that rupture forces decreased exponentially from 10 pN and the probability of rupture forces >30 pN was negligible, a small proportion of these platelets exhibited ruptures forces as great as those detected following platelet stimulation with ADP. Partial activation of platelets by handling is a well known phenomenon. Because our experiments determine the reactivity of individual platelets, they will detect platelets that had been inadvertently stimulated during preparation. Nevertheless, such platelets were useful in studying OPN-platelet interactions because the frequency of their specific interactions with OPN was lower than that of ADP-activated platelets. Thus, they can be regarded as partially activated, regardless of the nature of the activating stimulus. Furthermore, pre-incubating non-stimulated and ADP-stimulated platelets with the inhibitory prostaglandin PGE1 prevented the appearance of rupture forces >30 pN, implying that rupture forces below 30 pN represent the nonspecific background. Similarly, stimulating platelets with ADP in the presence of the chimeric mAb Fab fragment abciximab or either of the cyclic peptides cRGD or XJ735 prevented the appearance of rupture forces >30 pN, indicating that rupture forces >30 pN correspond to the specific binding of OPN to αvβ3. The likelihood that the rupture forces we measured correspond to the interaction between single αvβ3 and OPN molecules is based on three arguments (7Weisel J.W. Shuman H. Litvinov R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). First, histograms of rupture forces that result from multiple interactions should appear as a series of quantized peaks that are multiples of a single value of force and have probabilities inversely proportional to the number of bonds (21Allen S. Davies J. Davies M.C. Dawkes A.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Williams P.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Lee I. Marchant R.E. Surface Sci. 2001; 491: 433-443Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Apart from the nonspecific interactions discussed above, we observed only a single well defined peak in the force histograms, suggesting that this peak represents individual ligand-receptor bonds. Second, the proportion of touching cycles in the laser tweezers apparatus that result in the formation and rupture of αvβ3-OPN bonds is largely dependent on surface density of each (20Stout A.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2976-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Goldsmith H.L. McIntosh F.A. Shahin J. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1195-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The surface density of OPN was ≈1 molecule per ∼35 nm2, but how many retained the conformation and spatial orientation compatible with binding to αvβ3 is unknown, as is the density of αvβ3 on the platelet surface. Accordingly, the only available parameter is the actual frequency of specific binding events, each displayed as a force signal >30 pN. Even for ADP-activated platelets, which had the greatest frequency of specific binding events, the probability of specific interactions was always less than 5%. If we were to assume that the rupture force peak of 40-45 pN that we observed with a 5% probability represents the interactions of two ligand-receptor pairs, then single interactions at 20-25 pN would have a hypothetical probability of 22%, whereas the observed probability of rupture forces of this magnitude was actually 0.3%, implying that the 40-45 pN peak represents single ligand-receptor interactions. Similarly, there is no peak observed at 90-100 pN because, with 5% probability of single ligand-receptor pairs, the probability of two ligand-receptor pairs is 0.25%. Finally, if multiple bonds were formed during a contact between a platelet and an OPN-coated bead, it is unlikely that all of the bonds would ruptured simultaneously; rather, it is probable that they would be ruptured sequentially such that multiple steps should have been observed during bond breakage. However, the rupture events we observed all occurred as a single step with a resolution time of 0.5 ms. By using laser tweezers, we found that the average adhesion strength (the mean value of rupture forces >30 pN) for OPN-αvβ3 interactions was 47 ± 7 pN. Lehenkari and Horton (24Lehenkari P.P. Horton M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), using atomic force microscopy to measure the binding force between OPN and constitutively active osteoclast αvβ3 at a similar loading rate, reported a binding force of 50 ± 2 pN. However, the average adhesion strength of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 on ADP- and thrombin-stimulated platelets was nearly 2-fold greater at 80-90 pN (8Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 are homologous proteins (25Fitzgerald L.A. Poncz M. Steiner B.

Kunapuli S.P. Bennett J.S. J. Thromb. Haemostas. 2003; 1: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), sites at which OPN and fibrinogen bind to these integrins undoubtedly differ. Thus, whereas fibrinogen binds to αIIbβ3 via the carboxyl terminus of its γ chain (26Basani R.B. D'Andrea G. Mitra N. Vilaire G. Richberg M. Kowalska M.A. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. J. Biol.

The activation state of αvβ3 has been also studied in cells other than platelets. Filardo and Cheresh (27Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4641-4647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that truncating the αv cytoplasmic tail before the motif PPQEE impairs the ability of M21-L melanoma cells to adhere to vitronectin-coated surfaces, but has no effect on their interaction with adenovirus penton base protein, suggesting that αvβ3 may exist in several ligand binding conformations. Similarly, Boettiger et al. (28Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), using a spinning disc assay to measure the strength of cell adhesion, observed that although the αvβ3-mediated adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin is a single-stage process that is independent of cellular metabolism, adhesion to vitronectin is a multistage process that is enhanced by intracellular signals. By contrast, Felding-Habermann et al. (17Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl.

We have found that αvβ3 on platelets is also present in two activation states that are regulated by platelet stimulation (11Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In previous studies of fibrinogen binding to platelet αIIbβ3 using laser tweezers, we found that agonist concentration affected the probability of encountering an activated αIIbβ3 molecule but had no effect on the strength of fibrinogen binding (8Litvinov R.I.

Similarly, in the current work, we found that the strength of OPN binding to αvβ3 was unaffected by the degree of platelet stimulation, implying that the function of platelet agonists is to shift αvβ3 from its inactive to active state.

The gene structure of the precursor cephalosporin acylases generally consists of a signal peptide that is followed by an α-subunit, a spacer sequence, and a β-subunit. The cephalosporin acylase precursor is post-translationally modified into an active heterodimeric enzyme with α- and β-subunits, first by intramolecular cleavage and, second, by intermolecular cleavage. Intramolecular autocatalytic proteolysis is initiated by nucleophilic attack of the residue Ser-1β onto the adjacent scissile carbonyl carbon. This study determined the precursor structure after disabling the intramolecular cleavage. This study also provides experimental evidence showing that a conserved water molecule plays an important role in assisting the polarization of the OG atom of Ser-1β to generate a strong nucleophile and to direct the OG atom of the Ser-1β to a target carbonyl carbon. Intramolecular proteolysis is disabled as a result of a mutation of the residues causing conformational distortion to the active site. This is because distortion affects the existence of the catalytically crucial water at the proper position.

Cephalosporin acylase (CA) 1The abbreviations used are: CA, cephalosporin acylase; Ntn, N-terminal; PS, proteasome β subunit; GA, glycosyl asparaginase; CAD, a class I CA from P. diminuta KAC-1; r.m.s., root mean square. is a new family of the N-terminal (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily that is defined by the SCOP data base (1.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5606) Google Scholar). The Ntn hydrolase superfamily is defined by SCOP as a motif containing four layers of α-helices and β-sheets in a αββα fashion. There are five known families of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily; they are the class II glutamine amidotransferases, penicillin G acylase, penicillin V acylase, proteasome β subunit, and glycosyl asparaginase (1.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5606) Google Scholar). Ntn hydrolases are generally translated into a precursor enzyme. Several Ntn hydrolases are activated through auto-proteolytic processing by the Ser, Thr, or Cys residues. Auto-proteolytic processing occurs in an intramolecular manner in several Ntn hydrolases. These include glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, penicillin G acylase, proteasome β subunit (PS), glycosyl asparaginase (GA), and cephalosporin acylase (2.Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 3.Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K.

The gene structure of the open reading frame of CAs generally consists of a signal peptide that is followed by an α-subunit, a spacer sequence, and a β-subunit, all of which are translated into a single polypeptide chain, the CA precursor. The precursor is post-translationally modified into an active heterodimeric enzyme with α and β subunits, first by intramolecular cleavage process and, second, by intermolecular cleavage process. The heterodimeric enzyme is envisaged from the structural studies of the active CA and precursor CA, in which the nascent polypeptide (precursor) of cephalosporin acylase is autoproteolytically activated through a two-step autocatalytic process upon folding (3.Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The first step is an intramolecular cleavage process by the N-terminal Ser at the beginning of the β-subunit. This results in an α-subunit, a spacer peptide that is attached to the C terminus of the α-subunit, and a β-subunit. The second step is an intermolecular event, which is mediated by the newly generated N-terminal Ser or Thr of the β-subunit by means of the intramolecular cleavage. The second event results in further cleavage at the second scissile bond and finally releases the spacer peptide (5.Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6.Lee Y.S. Kim H.W. Park S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39200-39206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The study for the autoproteolytic mechanism of intermolecular cleavage was carried out in several precursor structures of N-terminal hydrolase. The structures of the GA and PS precursors were determined, and the autoproteolytic mechanisms for intramolecular cleavage by the Thr residue were proposed (4.Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two Ntn hydrolases (GA and PS) proceed to autoproteolysis along different paths even if the same amino acid (Thr) was used as a key nucleophile for autoproteolysis. This means that a water molecule enhances the nucleophilicity of the Thr Oγ at the +1 position in PS, although the Asp-151 carboxylate at the -1 position promotes the nucleophilicity of the Thr-152 at the +1 position in GA. The intramolecular proteolysis proceeds to a N → O or N → S acyl shift (8.Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L.

The resulting N-terminal Ser, Thr, or Cys residue becomes exposed to the solvent to participate in the nucleophilic catalytic center for the Ntn hydrolases (2.Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Also, the mechanism of the intramolecular cleavage of the scissile peptide bond at the N-terminal side of the catalytic Ser-1β 2The notation of the amino acid sequence in precursor CAD is identical to the CAD up to residue 158α (12.Kim Y.

The α and β subunits are indicated by attaching α and β, respectively, to the end of the residue number. In addition, the spacer residue is represented by an “s” at the end of a residue number, such as 159s. The spacer sequence of the precursor CAD is from residue 159s to 169s in this structure (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol.

Nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon at the N-terminal side by the OG atom of Ser-1β results in ester formation between the carbonyl carbon of Gly-169s (amino acid immediately before the nucleophilic Ser-1β) and the OG atom of Ser-1β. Initially, the hydroxyl of Ser-1β is assisted by the conserved water, which is stabilized by four hydrogen bonds in a pseudo-tetrahedral geometry, and may accept a proton from the hydroxyl group. As a result nucleophilic attack takes place on the main chain carbonyl carbon of the Gly-169s. The detailed pattern of autoproteolysis in the precursor CA is some-what different from the previously determined precursor structures of the Ntn hydrolase families such as GA (7.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and PS (4.Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in terms of both the type of the nucleophilic residue and the reaction pattern. A previous structural study of the precursor, CAD, revealed that conserved water (present in both the precursor CAD and the mature CAD) plays an important role in assisting the OG atom of Ser-1β so that the nucleophilic OG atom can carry out an attack on the scissile carbonyl carbon of Gly-169s (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The study proposed that the bound water assists the autocatalytic proteolysis of intramolecular cleavage. However, the role of bound water has not been fully examined due to insufficient experimental data. This study examined the role of bound water. A mutant CA that had lost the capability of autocatalytic proteolysis and remained a precursor enzyme was obtained. The structure of the mutant CA was determined at a 2.5-Å resolution. The precursor structure that was disabled in the autocatalytic proteolysis lost the bound water from the active site. A comparison of the active sites between the two different precursors with and without the autocatalytic proteolysis provided data that showed that the absence of bound water abolished the capability of carrying out the autoproteolytic intramolecular cleavage from the precursor CA. Also, the disability of the intramolecular proteolysis was the result of a mutation of the residues, causing a conformational distortion to the active site. This study provides the first evidence that a bound water molecule can play a critical role in initiating the beginning of intramolecular cleavage in the post-translational modification of the precursor enzyme.

The protein was then purified using His-tag affinity chromatography. The precursor CAD concentration was 10 mg ml-1 in a storage buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl). The F177βP precursor CAD crystals grew overnight at 21 °C from hanging drops containing 3 μl of a protein solution (10 mg ml-1 precursor CAD, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl) and 3 μl of a reservoir solution (16%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0) by the vapor diffusion method against a 500-μl reservoir solution. The crystals of the F177βP precursor CAD grew under quite similar conditions to the native CAD crystals (12.Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G.

Refinement—The structure of the F177βP precursor CAD yielded an excellent initial crystallographic model that is based on the structure of the S1βA precursor CAD (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T.

Fo - Fc difference Fourier maps provided an excellent guide for locating the residues Fig. 1). The modeled residues were refined using the program O (18.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) based on the structure of the S1βA precursor CAD. All of the crystallographic refinements were carried out using the CNS program (19.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of the F177βP precursor CAD is quite similar to that of the S1βA precursor CAD (13.Kim Y. Kim S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except for the mutation sites, the deviations in the Cαs of the main chain backbone, and the residue conformation of the active site.

Site-directed Mutagenesis of CAD Yields a Different Status of Intramolecular and Intermolecular Cleavage—The CAD precursor of the wild-type spontaneously conducts intramolecular cleavage by autocatalytic proteolysis at the scissile peptide bond between the Gly-169s and Ser-1β residues upon folding after protein synthesis. Subsequently, the processed form of CAD performs intermolecular cleavage at the peptide bond between the Gly-158α and Glu-159s residues (3.Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48376-48381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many mutants of the active site residues were examined to determine whether they are properly post-translated to an active heterodimeric form of CAD. Some of the active site mutants did not undergo proper intramolecular or intermolecular cleavage (Fig. 2, a and b). In particular the mutation of Ser-1β to Ala (S1βA) completely lost its intramolecular autoproteolytic activity (24.Kwon T.H. Rhee S. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) because the OG atom from the side chain of Ser-1β plays an important role in nucleophilic attack at the scissile peptide bond. The 77-kDa size of the S1βA protein, which contains the α-subunit, spacer, and β-subunit, appears as a single band that corresponds to the non-processed CAD (Fig. 2a). The S1βA precursor CAD could represent a wild-type precursor CAD with a proper active site conformation that would carry out autocatalytic intramolecular cleavage (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) once the mutated Ala residue at the β1 position is modeled to Ser. This is because the overall conformation of the precursor S1βA CAD structure is similar to the mature CAD structure. In fact, a r.m.s. deviation of 0.18 Å is obtained after superimposing the 672 common Cα atoms to a wild-type mature CAD (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Cαsof the nine active site residues of the mature CAD, which directly interacted with the substrate, glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid, are superimposed onto the corresponding Cα atoms of the S1βA precursor CAD with a r.m.s deviation of 0.22 Å (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting mutations is F177β to Pro (F177βP). The intramolecular cleavage is interrupted even though it possesses a catalytic nucleophile for intramolecular cleavage, Ser-1β (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The F177βP mutant is believed to be a conformational mutant; therefore, it cannot undergo nucleophilic attack at the scissile peptide for intramolecular cleavage. Other mutants show various stages of intramolecular and intermolecular cleavage (Fig. 2, a and b). The Ser-1β to Cys-1β (S1βC) mutation undergoes intramolecular cleavage, but its intermolecular cleavage is interrupted (Fig. 2, a and b). The mutations of the Tyr-33β residues show three different stages of processing in intermolecular cleavage (Fig. 2a). The Y33βF processes are normal to the mature heterodimeric CAD with the right-sized α and β subunits. Y33βS completes the intramolecular cleavage, but the intermolecular cleavage is interrupted. Y33βI accomplishes the intramolecular cleavage in part so that it produces mixed bands of sα and α (Fig. 2a). Four of the five Ser-152α mutants can normally undergo intramolecular and intermolecular cleavage to produce mature CADs, but only the intermolecular cleavage of the S152αP mutant is interrupted (Fig. 2b). Only the L24βG mutant of the three L24β mutations proceeds to a mature CAD, whereas, L24βF can undergo partial intermolecular cleavage, and the L24βR mutant cannot undergo intermolecular cleavage (Fig. 2b). It appears that the S152αP, L24βF, and L24βR mutants contain a trace amount of the precursor forms of the 77-kDa size, as shown in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). They all contain bulky side chains, but further investigation may be required to determine the relationship with the intermolecular cleavage. The F177βP mutant remains a non-processed precursor (the F177βP precursor CAD); therefore, its structure is very interesting for understanding the intramolecular cleavage from a mechanistic point of view. The conformational or functional moieties in the F177βP mutant may be damaged due to its mutation so that it cannot accomplish the catalytic action of intramolecular cleavage. For that reason, the structure of the precursor F177βP CAD was determined at a 2.5-Å resolution, and the structure was compared with that of the structure of the S1βA precursor CAD. Structure Determination of F177βP Precursor CAD—The structure of the F177βP precursor CAD was determined at a 2.5-Å resolution (Table I). In the course of the structure refinement, the Fo - Fc difference Fourier map, with neighboring residues around P177β and Ser-1β that were omitted from the phase calculation (Fig. 1, see also Fig. 5, a and b), showed a clear positive density for these sequence regions before adding any information of backbone residues in the unbiased map. The residues were easily adjusted into the Fo - Fc difference maps using the O program (18.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). They were then refined using CNS (19.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar) to an Rcryst of 22.3% and an Rfree of 26.7% (Table I). The S1βA precursor CAD was determined previously at a 2.5-Å resolution. It was refined to good geometry (Rcryst of 20.3%, Rfree of 23.7%) (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The space group of the F177βP crystal was P41212, which is the same as the S1βA precursor CAD. Therefore, the structure determination was straightforward and guided by the S1βA precursor CAD structure. The overall conformation of the F177βP structure was refined using the CNS program (19.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). The neighboring regions of P177βP and Ser-1β were manually corrected based on the Fo - Fc difference maps using the O program (18.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The overall conformation of the F177βP precursor CAD was quite similar to the S1βA precursor CAD. However, the Cαs of the F177βP precursor CAD was not superimposed onto those of the S1βA precursor CAD as much as the S1βA precursor CAD was superimposed onto those of the mature CAD (Fig. 3). The r.m.s. deviation for the 62 Cαs of the active site pockets between the F177βP precursor CAD and the S1βA precursor CAD was 0.573 Å, whereas the r.m.s. deviation of the 51 Cαs between the S1βA precursor CAD and the mature CAD was 0.125 Å (11 residues of the spacer peptide were not used for the superposition) (Fig. 3). The superposition among the three CADs (mature CAD, S1βA, and F177βP) showed that the S1βA precursor CAD was similar to the mature CAD. However, the F177βP precursor CAD was considerably deviated from both the mature CAD and the precursor S1βA structures. This comparison suggests that the active site of the F177βP precursor CAD was significantly distorted from that of the wild-type CAD. It is clear that the mutation of F177β to Pro imposes much strain on the main chain backbone of F177βP. Therefore, it induces significant conformational changes in the active site. This conformational distortion is leveraged into a non-processed precursor CAD for intramolecular cleavage, resulting in the F177βP precursor CAD. It will be interesting to investigate how one amino acid substitution is linked to abolishing the intramolecular cleavage in the post-translational modification. Conceivably, if these conformational mutations occur in nature, then they will have an influence upon the selection procedure in the post-translational modification. Model of Autocatalytic Proteolysis in Intramolecular Cleavage—The structures of the S1βA precursor CAD and the mature CAD led us to previously propose the model of the auto-catalytic intramolecular cleavage (Fig. 4, a and b) (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of Gly-169s by the OG atom of Ser-1β resulted in an ester formation between the carbonyl carbon of Gly-169s and the OG atom of Ser-1β. Previously, the hydroxyl of Ser-1β was assisted by the conserved water (WAT1 in Figs. 4, a and b, and 5a) and by the four hydrogen bonds in pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. WAT1 may enable the hydroxyl of Ser-1β to be precisely positioned and assist the polarization of the hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack. A tetrahedral intermediate can form after the OG atom of Ser-1β carries out the nucleophilic attack on the main chain carbonyl carbon of Gly-169s. Subsequently, the resulting oxyanion may move toward WAT2 (Figs. 4b and 5a) to be stabilized by the hydrogen bonds from the plausible oxyanion hole, which is not formed in the nucleophilic attack stage, but it may form in the transition state, consisting of WAT2 (Fig. 5a) and the main chain NH of His-23β. The oxyanion intermediate may then collapse, resulting in a shift in the linkage of the amide bond to an ester bond (N → O acyl shift) (3.Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Saarela J. Laine M. Tikkanen R. Oinonen C. Jalanko A. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. J. Biol.

Finally, the conserved water, WAT1, may carry out a second nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the newly formed ester intermediate, which would result in a free N-terminal Ser-1β and a carboxylate of Gly-169s (13.Kim Y.

In the proposed model the conserved water, WAT1, played a key role in assisting the critical nucleophilic residue of Ser-1β (13.Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest N.T. Hol G.J.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2068325899,"Most papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) have an isozyme-specific reduction of protein kinase C (PKC)epsilon, which occurs through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Here, we test whether the oncoprotein RET/PTC could be responsible for this effect, since RET/PTC rearrangements are quite prevalent in PTC and RET/PTC activates PLCgamma, an upstream modulator of PKCs. At 3 h after induction of RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 expression, there was evidence of PKCepsilon activation. Activation was restricted to PKCepsilon, as acute expression of RET/PTC did not change the subcellular distribution of other PKC isozymes expressed in PCCL3 cells. Prolonged RET/PTC expression (2-6 days) produced an isozyme-specific change in PKCepsilon subcellular localization and a decrease in total PKCepsilon levels. The expression of RET/PTC3(Y541F), which does not interact with PLCgamma, but signals normally through other RET effectors, had no effect on PKCepsilon distribution at any of the time points examined. However, downregulation of total PKCepsilon levels was only partially prevented by expression of RET/PTC(Y541F). Cells with decreased PKCepsilon following prolonged expression of RET/PTC were relatively resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Based on our previous observation that PCCL3 cells expressing a dominant-negative PKCepsilon are also markedly resistant to apoptosis, we propose that selective downregulation of PKCepsilon following prolonged RET/PTC activation promotes cell survival and clonal expansion."

To avoid mutagenesis and carcinogenesis by the (6-4) photoproduct, this damage must be removed by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in cells (22Wood R.D. J. Biol.

No base excision repair (BER) enzyme is known for the (6-4) photoproduct, but if the photoproduct can be degraded artificially, this DNA may be repaired by the BER pathway, even in xeroderma pigmentosum patients lacking NER function. For such an application, it is important to characterize the chemical properties of the (6-4) photoproduct. In this paper we describe the analysis of the alkali degradation of DNA containing the (6-4) photoproduct using chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. A relatively stable intermediate before the strand break was found, and its properties were compared with those of other alkali-labile DNA lesions by HPLC analysis. The results suggested that the first step was the hydrolysis between the N3 and C4 positions of the 5′-pyrimidine of the photoproduct. The structure of this degradation intermediate was determined by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The biochemical properties of DNA containing the hydrolyzed photoproduct are also described. Oligonucleotides—The building blocks of the (6-4) photoproduct (25Iwai S. Shimizu M. Kamiya H. Ohtsuka E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7642-7643Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and thymine glycol (26Iwai S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 3874-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described previously, and the oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 1 were prepared using the nucleoside phosphoramidites for the ultramild DNA synthesis (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). For the 5,6-dihydrothymine (DHT) 11-mer, 5,6-dihydro-dT-CE phosphoramidite was purchased from Glen Research. For the AP 11-mer, the uracil-containing 11-mer, d(CGTACUCATGC) (7.2 nmol), was incubated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (4 units, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a buffer (600 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min followed by extraction of the enzyme with phenol/chloroform and desalting on a NAP 10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant AP 11-mer was purified by HPLC. The HPLC purification of these 11-mers were carried out using a μ-Bondasphere C18 5-μm, 300-Å column (3.9 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5–13% during 20 min) in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0). The preparation and the characterization of the thymine glycol (Tg) 11-mer are described in Ref. 27Iwai S. Chem. Eur. J. 2001; 7: 4343-4351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Alkali Treatment—The (6-4) 4-mer (0.30 nmol) and the 11-mers containing each lesion (0.08–0.15 nmol) were dissolved in 50 mm KOH (50 μl), and the mixtures were heated at 60 °C for the designated times (see figure legends). For the mild alkali treatment, the oligomers were dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 12, 50 μl) and the solutions were kept at room temperature for 30 min. These solutions were mixed with 50 mm HCl (50 μl) and injected into an HPLC column. HPLC analysis was carried out using an Inertsil ODS-2 column (4.6 × 250 mm, GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–15 and 5–15% during 20 min for the 4- and 11-mers, respectively) in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0). A photodiode array detector (Waters Model 2996) was used to monitor the elution. Alkali Degradation at Lower pH Values—The (6-4) 4-mer (0.30 nmol) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 12.0, 11.0, 10.0, and 9.0, 50 μl), and the mixtures were heated at 60 °C for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h. After neutralization with HCl, the samples were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The yield of the degradation intermediate was obtained from the peak areas (the sum of the two product peaks observed in Fig. 2b) and was plotted against the reaction time (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Dependence of the intermediate formation upon pH. The (6-4) 4-mer was treated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 12.0, circles; pH 11.0, squares; pH 10.0, triangles; pH 9.0, crosses) at 60 °C, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC to quantify the intermediate formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NMR Measurement—The dinucleoside monophosphate of the (6-4) photoproduct bearing protecting groups at the phosphate and the 3′-hydroxyl function (Compound 2 in Ref. 25Iwai S.

Soc. 1996; 118: 7642-7643Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 72 mg, 103 μmol) was dissolved in 50 mm KOH (8.0 ml), and the solution was heated at 60 °C for 5 h. This mixture was neutralized with HCl, and the product corresponding to the intermediate found for the (6-4) 4-mer was purified on a column (1.0 × 18.5 cm) of Preparative C18 125Å, (Waters). Because the product eluted immediately after the void volume without acetonitrile, the salt was removed by dialysis against water using a membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 100. The intact (6-4) photoproduct was prepared by deprotection of the above compound with ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were dissolved in D2O or Me2SO-d6 containing 0.5% H2O. One- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE600 spectrometer at 37 °C. Setup and data processing were done according to the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, version 3.0). Signals were assigned by the 1H-1H-correlated spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC), and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) experiments. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDITOF) Mass Spectrometry—The compounds prepared for the NMR study (50 pmol) were dissolved in 10 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0, 2 μl) and were mixed with a solution (0.7 μl) of 22.5 mg/ml 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and 2.5 mg/ml picolinic acid. The mixtures were placed on the sample plate, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. Measurements were performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 4338 mass spectrometer in the negative linear mode. The mass range between 500 and 600 Da was measured with a laser intensity around 2400, and 200 single-shot spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The theoretical and observed m/z values for the dinucleoside monophosphate of the intact (6-4) photoproduct were 545.13 and 545.51, respectively. Binding of XPC·HR23B—The (6-4) photoproduct-containing 30-mer, d(CTCGTCAGCATCT(6-4)TCATCATACAGTCAGTG) (100 pmol), was treated with 50 mm KOH or with water at 60 °C for 6 h, desalted using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences), and precipitated with ethanol (68 pmol were recovered). The assays were carried out basically as described previously (24Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The reactions (10 μl) contained the 32P-labeled 30-mer duplex (5 fmol), the XPC·HR23B complex (1.3, 6.4, 32, or 160 fmol), 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), NaCl (10 mm), KCl (15 mm), dithiothreitol (5 mm), poly(dI·dC) (1 ng), bovine serum albumin (2 μg), and glycerol (2.5%). The mixtures were kept on ice for 15 min, and the protein-DNA complex was separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 2 °C. Translesion Synthesis (TLS) Assays—The assays were carried out as described previously (21Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the above-mentioned 30-mer as a template with three types of primers, d(CACTGACTGTATGATG) (16-mer), d(CACTGACTGTATGATGA) (17-mer), and d(CACTGACTGTATGATGAA) (18-mer). The amounts of DNA polymerase η were 0, 25, and 250 fmol for each experiment. Design and Preparation of Oligonucleotides—The oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 1 were designed for the alkali degradation experiments. We expected that small changes in the chemical structure of the photoproduct could be detected by using a short oligomer and that the fragments after the strand break could be identified easily by HPLC using a photodiode array detector if the nucleotide attached on the 5′ side of the photoproduct had a different base moiety from that attached on the 3′ side. Therefore, a tetramer, d(GT(6-4)TC), was designed and prepared using the building block of the (6-4) photoproduct (25Iwai S. Shimizu M. Kamiya H. Ohtsuka E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7642-7643Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The other oligomers used in this study contained modified nucleosides known as alkali-labile lesions to compare their properties with those of the (6-4) photoproduct. The AP site, Tg, and DHT were chosen, and relatively longer oligonucleotides, i.e. 11-mers with the same sequence, were used for two reasons. One reason was that a tetramer could not be the substrate for uracil DNA glycosylase in the preparation of the AP site-containing oligonucleotide, and the other reason was that relatively long sequences were favorable at the deprotection step in our synthesis of the thymine glycol-containing oligomers (26Iwai S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 3874-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A dinucleoside monophosphate and a 30-mer containing the (6-4) photoproduct were used for the NMR experiments and the biochemical assays, respectively, as described in the following sections. Alkali Treatment of the (6-4) Photoproduct-containing Oligonucleotide—To analyze the alkali degradation of the (6-4) photoproduct, the (6-4) 4-mer was treated with a KOH solution. After neutralization, the reaction mixtures were injected into a reversed-phase HPLC column and the elution was monitored using a photodiode array detector. We tested several conditions of the KOH concentration and the reaction temperature and found that a single compound was produced when this oligomer was incubated with 50 mm KOH at 60 °C (Fig. 2). The (6-4) 4-mer was completely converted to this product in 6 h. The UV absorption spectrum of the product was almost identical to that of the starting tetramer as shown in Fig. 3. These results indicated that a strand break did not occur in this experiment and that the pyrimidone ring of the photoproduct, which absorbs the long wavelength region of UV, was intact. Comparison with Other Lesions—To obtain clues regarding the chemical structure of the aforementioned product formed by the alkali treatment of the (6-4) photoproduct-containing oligonucleotide, the reaction was compared with the degradation of other alkali-labile lesions. The AP site, thymine glycol, and DHT were chosen, and the stability of the oligonucleotides containing each lesion was compared under two sets of conditions, 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 12) at room temperature and 50 mm KOH at 60 °C, although the (6-4) photoproduct was not degraded under the former conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The treatment of the oligonucleotide containing the AP site with 50 mm KOH at 60 °C caused a strand break by the β-and δ-elimination reactions (28Lhomme J. Constant J.-F. Demeunynck M. Biopolymers. 1999; 52: 65-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the strand break occurred even under the mild conditions (Fig. 4A). The same treatment of the thymine glycol-containing oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of two products, which were not separated thoroughly by HPLC (Fig. 4B). The reaction of the DHT 11-mer was the slowest among those used for comparison with the (6-4) photoproduct. The elution profiles were similar to those of the Tg 11-mer, but the alkali treatment of the DHT 11-mer gave a single product (Fig. 4C). NMR Study of the Product—The compound produced by the alkali treatment was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. For the NMR measurement, a dinucleoside monophosphate, in which the base moiety was the (6-4) photoproduct, was treated with 50 mm KOH at 60 °C for 5 h and the spectra of the product were compared with those of the starting material. To ensure the confidence of the results, two data sets, one in D2O and the other in Me2SO-d6, were obtained independently. The nonexchangeable protons were assigned using the COSY spectra, and the 1H-13C HSQC and HMBC experiments provided the information required for the full assignment of the carbon signals. In the 1H spectra, large changes in the chemical shifts after the alkali treatment were observed at the base protons and H1′ of the 5′ component (Fig. 5A). The measurement in Me2SO-d6 revealed that the imino proton of the 5′ base disappeared with the alkali treatment (Fig. 5C). In the 13C spectra, chemical shift changes were obvious at the C2 and C5 positions and the methyl group of the 5′ component (Fig. 5B). The change of the C4 signal of this base was observed only in D2O. The molecular weight of the product was determined by MALDITOF mass spectrometry, and the observed m/z value was 563.43. Biochemical Characterization—We analyzed the biochemical properties of the DNA containing the partially degraded form of the (6-4) photoproduct found in this study. First, the recognition of the alkali-treated photoproduct by the XPC·HR23B complex was analyzed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As a probe, a 30-mer containing the (6-4) photoproduct was treated with 50 mm KOH at 60 °C for 6 h, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and hybridized to the complementary oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 7, the XPC·HR23B binding to the partially degraded photoproduct was indistinguishable from the binding to the intact (6-4) photoproduct. The TLS by human DNA polymerase η was assayed next. The same 30-mer was used as a template, and as primers, 16-, 17-, and 18-mers were used to analyze the nucleotide incorporation opposite the 3′ base of the photoproduct, the nucleotide incorporation opposite the 5′ base, and the elongation past the lesion, respectively. A small difference was found for the elongation of the 17-mer primer at the lower enzyme concentration, and the efficiency of the TLS for the alkali-treated template was slightly lower in the experiments using the high enzyme concentration. However, the overall results were the same when the two templates were compared (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase η Three types of 32P-labeled primers were annealed to a 30-mer oligonucleotide containing the (6-4) photoproduct treated with water (mock) or 50 mm KOH, and the translesion synthesis was analyzed. The 17- and 18-mers had one and two adenylates, respectively, opposite the photoproduct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that the (6-4) photoproduct is labile against alkali.

Tornaletti S. Methods. 1997; 11: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the mechanism of the alkali degradation of this DNA lesion, or even its stability, has not been elucidated. We expected that if the (6-4) photoproduct could be degraded artificially in cells, the damaged DNA might be able to be repaired by the BER pathway (29Klungland A. Höss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A.

Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) while the intact photoproduct is removed by NER (24Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As the first step toward such a study, we have analyzed the alkali degradation of the (6-4) photoproduct. The first finding in this study was that the treatment of the (6-4) photoproduct-containing oligonucleotide with dilute KOH gave a single product when the reaction was monitored by HPLC. Because the product obtained in this experiment was further degraded under severe alkaline conditions similar to the hot piperidine treatment (data not shown), this product was considered to be an intermediate before the strand break and we thought that the alkali lability of the (6-4) photoproduct could be understood by characterizing this intermediate. The UV absorption spectra (Fig. 3) showed that the compound in question contained all of the base moieties, indicating that the sugar-phosphate backbone was intact. The formation of this intermediate was compared with those from the reactions of several other damaged bases for which the degradation products were known. The AP site was used because Franklin et al. (8Franklin W.A. Lo K.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13535-13543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the alkali treatment of the (6-4) photoproduct would cause the hydrolysis of one of the glycosyl bonds. Although the strand break did not occur in the (6-4) photoproduct-containing oligonucleotide when it was treated with 50 mm KOH at 60 °C, the AP site was cleaved completely within 30 min under the same conditions (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrated that the intermediate found for the (6-4) photoproduct did not contain the AP site formed by the direct hydrolysis of either of the glycosyl bonds of the photoproduct. Thymine glycol and DHT were chosen because of their structural similarity to the 5′ component of the (6-4) photoproduct. It should be noted that the 3′-pyrimidone was intact after the alkali treatment as shown by the UV absorption spectrum (Fig. 3B). According to the literatures, the hydrolysis of thymine glycol in a pH 12 buffer at room temperature produces deoxyribosylurea (30Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which is a mixture of the α- and β-anomers as shown in Fig. 1 (31Baillet S. Behr J.-P. Tetrahedron. Lett. 1995; 36: 8981-8984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Dubey I. Pratviel G. Robert A. Meunier B. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2001; 20: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our experiments reproduced these descriptions (Fig. 4B). Because the alkali treatment of the (6-4) photoproduct-containing oligonucleotide gave a single peak (this was not due to low HPLC resolution, because the short oligomer was used for the (6-4) photoproduct), the reaction in question could not be the degradation of the 5′-pyrimidine ring to urea. On the other hand, it was proposed that the alkali treatment of DHT results in ring opening to ureidoisobutyric acid as shown in Fig. 1 (33Ide H. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Ide H. Petrullo L.A. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1469-1477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the majority of the DHT was converted to the product by a treatment with 50 mm KOH for only 30 min (Fig. 4C), the reaction for the (6-4) photoproduct was similar to that of DHT. Consequently, this type of ring opening was strongly suggested for the alkali degradation of the (6-4) photoproduct. The chemical structure of the degradation intermediate was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. All of the signals in the 1H and 13C spectra were assigned successfully, and the differences before and after the alkali treatment were observed exclusively at the 5′ base moiety (Fig. 5, A and B). It is also important that the imino proton of the 5′-pyrimidine component disappeared (Fig. 5C). The analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that the reaction was hydrolysis, because the observed m/z value of 563.43 was very close to the theoretical value for the dinucleoside monophosphate of the (6-4) photoproduct plus water (563.14). These results demonstrated that the intermediate had the chemical structure with the ring opening of the 5′ base caused by the hydrolysis between the N3 and C4 positions (Fig. 5D) as presumed from the HPLC results. The formation of this degradation intermediate was dependent upon pH and was observed even when the pH value of the solution was lowered to 9.0 in this study (Fig. 6). Although the reaction rate is low, the (6-4) photoproduct produced in DNA may be hydrolyzed to the ring-opened form when it is left unrepaired in cells. Therefore, the biochemical properties of this intermediate were determined. As an index of NER, the major pathway for the removal of the (6-4) photoproduct, the binding of the XPC·HR23B complex, which recognizes the DNA damage at the first step of NER, was analyzed using probes containing the intact and hydrolyzed photoproducts. The TLS by human DNA polymerase η, which bypasses the (6-4) photoproduct only at a high enzyme concentration, was also analyzed because the ring opening of the 5′-pyrimidine might influence the efficiency of the replicative bypass especially at the 5′ base. The results showed no obvious difference between the intact and hydrolyzed photoproducts (Figs. 7 and 8), and thus we concluded that the ring-opened form of the (6-4) photoproduct, which is the stable intermediate before the strand break at this alkali-labile DNA lesion, is not distinguished from the intact photoproduct in the NER and TLS processes. Future studies will probe the recognition of this hydrolyzed photoproduct by the BER system."

Daugherty, unpublished results. On the other hand, full-length yeast TBP has a monomer-tetramer-octamer pattern of self-association over a wide range of solution conditions (24.Perez-Howard G.M.

These contrasting self-association mechanisms suggest that the amino-terminal domain plays an important role in the association mechanism. Evidence of this involvement comes from significant changes in the fluorescence spectrum and anisotropy of Trp-26 (roughly the middle of the amino-terminal domain) that accompany TBP self-association (34.Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M. Fried M.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4869-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40.Khrapunov S. Pastor N. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9559-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have proposed that the amino-terminal domain contributes structures necessary for the monomer-tetramer-octamer association pattern (34.Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M. Fried M.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4869-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This might occur if some or all of an interaction surface were contained in the amino-terminal domain. If this were the case, isolated amino-terminal domains might be expected to self-associate. In the experiments described below we tested this prediction and present the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a self-association activity for the amino-terminal domain. Reagents—Agar base was obtained from Difco. Restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase were from Promega. Taq DNA polymerase, buffers, and dNTPs for PCR were provided in kit form by Qiagen. Protein cross-linking reagents DFDNB (1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and ANB-NOS (N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide) were obtained from Pierce. All other biochemicals were from Sigma. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Plasmid pKA9-TBP, encoding full-length yeast TBP was the kind gift of Dr. Michael Brenowitz, Albert Einstein University. The Escherichia coli strain used as a “reporter” for two-hybrid experiments was Bacteriomatch™, a restriction-minus, KanR derivative of XL1-Blue MR obtained from Stratagene. Strain XL1-Blue MR (Stratagene) was used for routine propagation of plasmids. Expression plasmids were propagated in E. coli BL21 Star™ cells (Invitrogen). Cells containing the two-hybrid bait plasmid pBT (3.2 kb, CamR, from Stratagene) and prey plasmid pTRG (4.4 kb, TetR, from Stratagene) were maintained on LB agar containing chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) or tetracycline (15 μg/ml), respectively. Plasmids pBT-LGF2 and pTRG-Gal11p were supplied by Stratagene. The expression vectors used for protein purification and pull-down assays were pPROTet.E (2.2 kb, CamR, from Clontech) encoding an amino-terminal (His-Asn)6 affinity tag for in-frame fusion with target genes and pFLAG.mac (5 kb, AmpR from Sigma) expressing an amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) for in-frame fusion with target genes. These were maintained on LB agar containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin, respectively. The LB selection agar for two-hybrid experiments contained 30 μg/ml carbenicillin, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (CTCK), simultaneously selecting for protein-protein interaction and the presence of pBT and pTRG plasmids. In some cases these selection conditions were modified by the inclusion of 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG, conditions designated CTCK + IPTG). Cloning and Constructs—The DNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1-62) of TBP was PCR-amplified from plasmid pKA9-TBP using primers P1 and P3 (Table I). Reaction products were cut with endonucleases BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the prey plasmid pTRG (linearized with the same enzymes). Independently constructed isolates are designated pTRGN1, pTRGN2, and pTRGN5 (Table II). Amplification of pKA9-TBP with primers P2 and P3 and cleavage with EcoRI and XhoI gave products for ligation with the bait plasmid pBT (previously linearized with the same enzymes) designated pBTN1 and pBTN2. Primer P2 also encodes a flexible (Gly4Ser)3 linker connecting the plasmid-encoded λ repressor protein to the TBP amino-terminal (bait) domain.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification of TBP amino-terminal domainNameSequence (5′ to 3′)CommentsP1TGACTGGATCCATGGCCGATGAGGAACGTTTAAAGGAForward primer for pTRG cloningP2TGACTGAATTCGGGTGGTGGTGGTAGCGGTGGTGGTGGTAGCGGTGGTGGTGGTAGCAT GGCCGATGAGGAACGTTTAAAGGAForward primer for pBT cloningP3GAAGACTCGAGTTATGATGTGGCGGAGGTGTCTTTTTCAReverse primer for pBT and pTRG cloningP4TCCGTTGTGGGGAAAGTTATCpBT 5′ sequence primerP5CAGCCTGAAGTGAAAGAApTRG 5′ sequence primerP6TGACTGTCGACATGGCCGATGAGGAACGTTTAAAForward primer for pPROTet.E subcloningP7GAAGAGCGGCCGCTTATGATGTGGCGGAGGTGTCTTTTTCAReverse primer for pPROTet.E subcloningP8TGACTCTCGAGATGGCCGATGAGGAACGTTTAAAForward primer for pFLAG.mac subcloningP9GAAGAAGATCTTTATGATGTGGCGGAGGTGTCTTTTTCAReverse primer for pFLAG.mac subcloningP10CACATCAGCAGGACGCACTGACpPROTet.E 5′ sequence primerP11CATCATAACGGTTCTGGCAAATATTCpFLAG.mac 5′ sequence primer Open table in a new tab Table IIChallenge, negative control, and positive control plasmid pairsBait:preyChallenge pairsNegative control pairsPositive control pairspBTN1:pTRGN1pBT:pTRGpBT-LGF2:pTRG-Gal11ppBTN2:pTRGN1pBTN1:pTRGpBTN1:pTRGN5pBT:pTRGN1 Open table in a new tab Constructs for protein purification and pull-down assays were prepared as follows. Primers P6 and P7 (Table I) were used for PCR amplification of TBP amino-terminal sequences from pTRGN1. After cleavage with SalI and NotI, reaction products were ligated into pPROTet.E (linearized with the same enzymes). The product was designated pPROTet.E.N1. TBP amino-terminal domain sequences amplified from pTRGN1 with primers P8 and P9 were digested with XhoI and BglII and ligated into pFLAG.mac (linearized with the same enzymes). The product was designated pFLAG.mac.N1. E. coli cells were transformed by the CaCl2/heat shock method (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and clones were selected on LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotics. All plasmid constructs were verified by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Primers P3 and P4 amplified pBT inserts, and primers P3 and P5 amplified pTRG inserts. Primers P7 and P10 amplified pPROTet.E inserts, and primers P9 and P11 amplified pFLAG.mac inserts. Expression of TBP amino-terminal domain sequences in candidate cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with immunoblot detection; anti-TBP polyclonal antibody (kindly supplied by Frank Pugh, Penn State University, University Park) was used to detect expression of TBP sequences from pBTN1, pBTN2, pTRGN1, pTRGN2, and pPROTet.E133.N1 vectors. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to detect FLAG-tagged proteins expressed from pFLAG.mac.N1. E. coli Two-hybrid Assays—The method used was based on the work of Dove et al. (42.Dove S.L. Juong J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 43.Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Aliquots of challenge bait plasmids (pBTN1 and pBTN2), challenge prey plasmids (pTRGN1 and pTRGN5), and control vectors pBT (with no insert), pTRG (with no insert), pBT-LGF2, and pTRG-Gal11p were co-transformed as pairs (Table II) into freshly prepared competent cells. Transformations were carried out in triplicate by the CaCl2/heat shock method (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following heat shock, samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and diluted with NZYM medium (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and aliquots of each transformation mixture were plated in duplicate on CTCK and CTCK + IPTG agar media. Colonies were counted after growth at 30 °C for 48 h. Protein Pull-down Interaction Assay—E. coli BL21 Star cells were transformed with the plasmid pPROTet.E (empty) or with pPROTet.E.N1 (encoding the TBP amino-terminal domain) and grown with agitation at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced with anhydrotetracycline (final concentration, 0.4 μg/ml) when cultures reached A600 = 0.3. After incubation for 8 h at 30 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed at 4 °C with lysozyme (0.75 mg/ml) followed by sonication (3 × 30 s with a pause for 30 s on ice between each burst). The (His-Asn)6-tagged TBP amino-terminal domain was purified by absorption on cobalt affinity resin (Talon, Clontech) followed by elution with 50 mm sodium acetate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 5.0 as specified by the manufacturer. Samples were concentrated using Centricon YM3000 filter devices (Millipore), and pH was adjusted to 7.0 with sodium phosphate buffer. E. coli BL21 cultures transformed with pFLAG.mac (empty) or with pFLAG.mac.N1 (encoding the TBP amino-terminal domain) were grown at 30 °C to A600 = 0.5, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG. Growth was continued at 30 °C for an additional 8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by incubation with lysozyme followed by sonication as described above. Samples were prepared by mixing 20 μg of purified (His-Asn)6-tagged amino-terminal protein with crude cell lysate proteins (1 mg) containing FLAG-tagged amino-terminal domain in a reaction volume of 800 μl. The incubation buffer was 94 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0 at 20 °C), 6.6 mm sodium acetate, and 222 mm NaCl. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Cobalt affinity resin was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0 at 20 °C), 300 mm NaCl. Samples were incubated (batchwise for 1 h at 4 °C) with cobalt affinity resin (1-ml packed volume). The resin was washed with 5 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0 at 20 °C), 300 mm NaCl and then eluted with 5 volumes of the same buffer adjusted to pH 5.0. Eluates were concentrated using Centricon YM3000 concentrators and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with immunoblot detection using anti-FLAG and anti-TBP antibodies. Protein Cross-linking—Extracts were prepared from E. coli BL21 Star BEM cells expressing (His-Asn)6-tagged TBP amino-terminal domain pROTet.E.N1 or from cells containing the empty control vector pPROTet.E by the lysozyme-sonication method. (His-Asn)6-tagged proteins were partially purified by cobalt affinity chromatography as described above. The cross-linkers used were DFDNB (spacer length, ∼3 Å) and ANB-NOS (spacer length, ∼7.7 Å). Cross-linking reactions (30 μl) contained 0.3 mg/ml protein and 5 mm cross-linker in buffer consisting of 110 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 115 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 at 20 °C. Samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Samples containing ANB-NOS were then exposed to light from a short wavelength UV light box (Fotodyne) for 1 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and TBP amino-terminal domain peptides were detected by immunoblotting using anti-TBP polyclonal antibody. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—The (His-Asn)6-tagged amino-terminal domain was purified to homogeneity (by SDS-PAGE criteria) by immobilized metal and ion-exchange chromatography. Aliquots were transferred into 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl buffer using a centrifugal concentrator (Centricon YM3000). Samples were brought to sedimentation equilibrium at 4 °C in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AN-60 rotor. Absorbance values were measured at 280 nm as functions of radial position. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed. The approach to equilibrium was considered to be complete when replicate scans separated by ≥6 h were indistinguishable. Solvent densities were calculated using the formula and tables published by McRorie and Voelker (44.McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar). At sedimentation equilibrium, the absorbance at a specified wavelength and position in the solution column is given by Equation 1 (44.McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar, 45.Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A(r)=∑nαn,0exp[σn(r2-r02)]+ζ Here A(r) is the absorbance at radial position r; the summation is over all species, n; αn,0 is the absorbance of the nth species at the reference position r0; σn = Mn(1 - v̄nρ)ω2/2RT where Mn is the molecular weight of the nth species, v̄n is the partial specific volume (0.699 for TBP amino-terminal domain), ρ is the solution density, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The base-line offset term ζ compensates for slight position-independent differences in the optical properties of different cell assemblies. Global analysis of data obtained at different rotor speeds was performed with the program NONLIN. 4NONLIN for the Macintosh was obtained from www.cauma.edu/software. Yeast TBP Amino-terminal Domains Interact in Living E. coli Cells—The output signal of the classical yeast two-hybrid assay (cell survival and growth) results from enhanced transcription of one or more indicator genes (49.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Interactions between yeast transcription factors may be difficult to study by this assay because two-hybrid constructs containing these proteins may be capable of activating yeast transcription in the absence of the protein-protein interaction of interest (false positive results). In addition, other yeast transcription factors may compete with or inhibit the interaction of interest, giving rise to false negative results. To minimize the potential for these complications we have used an E. coli two-hybrid assay (Refs. 42.Dove S.L. Juong J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 43.Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, summarized schematically in Fig. 1). While this strategy does not prevent all false positive and false negative results it has the advantage that the TBP amino-terminal domain is an exogenous protein so any interactions that it may have with the E. coli transcription machinery are likely to be adventitious. In the two-hybrid method that we have used, the proteins of interest are expressed as carboxyl-terminal fusions with the λ cI protein (bait constructs in plasmid pBT) or with the α subunit of RNA polymerase (prey constructs in plasmid pTRG). Thus, appropriate controls for the absence of interaction are plasmid pairs in which bait and prey contain only λ cI protein and α subunit of RNA polymerase, respectively (since no additional sequences are added, we refer to these as “empty” constructs). The two-hybrid data shown in Fig. 2 are normalized to the average number of colonies produced by the pairing of empty bait and empty prey constructs. An additional control for the interaction of the TBP amino-terminal domain with RNA polymerase alone is the pairing of the TBP amino-terminal domain bait construct with an empty prey construct (designated N1:E). A similar control for the interaction of the TBP amino-terminal domain with λ cI protein alone is the pairing of an empty bait construct with the TBP amino-terminal domain RNA polymerase α subunit construct (designated E:N1). Both of these controls gave levels of carbenicillin resistance that were within error the same as that found with the negative control in which both vectors are empty. This indicates that the expression of either amino-terminal bait or amino-terminal prey protein alone is not sufficient to give enhanced carbenicillin resistance. It also indicates the absence of endogenous E. coli proteins that combine strongly with bait or prey proteins to activate transcription from the test promoter.

The editing reactions are required to be highly specific in order to ensure that functional open reading frames are created in edited mRNAs and that potentially deleterious modification of normally nonedited sequence does not occur. Selection-amplification and mutagenesis were previously used to identify the optimal sequence requirements for in vitro editing. There is, however, a minority of natural editing sites with suboptimal sequence. Several cis-acting elements, obtained from an in vitro selection, are described here that are able to compensate for a suboptimal editing site. An A + U sequence element within the 5′-untranslated region of cytochrome b mRNA from Leishmania tarentolae is also demonstrated to function as a cis-acting guide RNA and is postulated to compensate for a suboptimal editing site in vivo. Two proteins within an enriched editing extract are UV-cross-linked to two different in vitro selected editing substrates more efficiently than poorly edited RNAs.

The results suggest that these proteins contribute to the specificity of the editing reaction. The kinetoplastid uridylate insertional and deletional editing reactions have been proposed to be initiated by an endonuclease cleavage at an editing site that produces a 5′ mRNA fragment with a 3′-hydroxyl and a 3′ fragment with a 5′-monophosphate (1Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). U additions or deletions at the 3′-end of the 5′ fragment followed by religation of the two mRNA fragments would complete a cycle of editing that is then reiterated at subsequent sites. Experimental evidence in support of the proposed mechanism has been obtained in vitro (2Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K.

Editing is required to be highly specific in order to create functional coding sequences and to prevent the detrimental modification of RNA. Part of the genetic information specifying the location of an editing site is contained within a guide RNA (gRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: gRNAguide RNARTreverse transcriptaseDMSdimethyl sulfateCMCT1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate.1The abbreviations used are: gRNAguide RNARTreverse transcriptaseDMSdimethyl sulfateCMCT1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate. that binds to its cognate mRNA immediately downstream of an editing site. Each gRNA has a sequence complementary to the edited sequence that functions as a guide for the appropriate number of U insertions and deletions (1Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The sequence of the mRNA upstream of an editing site has also been demonstrated to dramatically influence the efficiency of the editing reaction (6Kabb A.L. Oppegard L.M. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J.

The proteins that recognize and initially bind to the editing sites have not yet been identified, and only a few proteins have so far been unambiguously demonstrated to be essential for catalysis of the editing reaction. An RNA ligase designated as TbMP52 (10Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo Jr., R.P. Wirtz E. Salavati R. Stuart K.

TbMP57 is a terminal uridylyltransferase that is associated with the editing complex, catalyzes U addition in a gRNA-directed manner and has been proposed to be the U addition activity for the editing reaction (16Ernst N.L.

In addition to the in vitro gRNA directed U insertions, in vitro U insertions also occur within a Leishmania tarentolae cytochrome b mRNA transcript independent of added gRNA (17Connell G. J Byrne E.

The reaction is dependent on a 32-nucleotide A + U sequence within the 5′-untranslated sequence (18Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The A + U-dependent and gRNA-directed activities co-purify through several chromatographic columns, suggesting that the two reactions are closely related (19Oppegard L.M. Kabb A.L. Connell G.J. J.

Although chemical probing had previously suggested that the cytochrome b mRNA A + U sequence forms a hairpin loop that resembles a gRNA-mRNA duplex (17Connell G. J Byrne E. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was difficult to envision how this structure could account for the multiple sites of in vitro U insertions occurring both 5′ and 3′ of the sequence (18Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the A + U sequence can induce U insertions when cloned within unrelated sequences (18Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol.

This appeared to be inconsistent with it functioning as a cis-acting gRNA, because the duplex formed with the mRNA, as suggested by the chemical protection studies, would be disrupted. Furthermore, whereas the guiding sequence of a characterized cis-acting gRNA can also function in trans (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J.

Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7470) Google Scholar), an in vitro combinatorial strategy, was performed in order to obtain insight into the role of the A + U element during the editing reaction. Several RNAs were obtained from this selection that have been used to define the critical sequence and structural features required for optimal gRNA-directed insertional editing (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These features include a strong bias against cytidines 5′ of the editing sites and guanosines immediately 3′ of guiding nucleotides. Base pairing immediately flanking an editing site can also significantly stimulate the editing reaction and affect the reaction fidelity. Although many of these features are consistent with a phylogenetic analysis of the sequence flanking an editing site (23Burgess M.L.K. Stuart K. RNA. 2000; 6: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), there is a minority of natural editing sites that clearly have a suboptimal sequence. Several different cis-acting elements obtained from the in vitro selection are described here that are able to compensate for a suboptimal editing site. Two proteins of a highly enriched editing extract with apparent molecular weights of 80,000 and 100,000 are UV-cross-linked to two different in vitro selected RNA editing substrates. Cytidines immediately 5′ of the editing site inhibit both editing and the cross-links to these proteins, but both can be compensated by an in vitro selected hairpin loop. The result identifies two proteins that contribute to the specificity of the editing reaction. The in vitro selection also suggested that the cytochrome b mRNA A + U element is functioning as a cis-acting gRNA and this was subsequently confirmed. Editing Extract—A 2-liter L. tarentolae culture (UC strain) was grown to a density of 1.5 × 108 cells/ml at 27 °C in BHI medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.01 mg/ml hemin. The culture was lysed under isotonic conditions using a Stansted Disrupter (Energy Service Co.) at 1200 p.s.i. as previously described (17Connell G. J Byrne E. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4212-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fraction was enriched by flotation through a Renografin-60 (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium; Bracco Diagnostics) density gradient (24Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After three washes in SHE (0.25 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA), the mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 3.8 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and 200 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added. The fraction was left on ice for 7 min with occasional mixing and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 4-ml Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin) containing 20 mm KCl. The column was washed with 8 ml of the 20 mm KCl wash buffer followed by 8 ml of 100 mm KCl in wash buffer and then eluted with 200 mm KCl in wash buffer. One-ml fractions were collected, and 15 μl of each fraction were assayed for protein with a Coomassie dye reagent (Pierce); the editing activity had earlier been found to co-elute with the peak protein concentration within the 200 mm eluted fractions (20Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The peak protein fractions were diluted 2-fold in wash buffer and then loaded onto a 3.5-ml SP-Sepharose column that had been pre-equilibrated in 100 mm KCl wash buffer. After washing for 8 ml, the column was eluted in 200 mm KCl wash buffer, 250-μl fractions were collected, and 15 μl from each was assayed for protein. The protein concentration of the pooled SP-eluted fractions was ∼0.02 μg/μl. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C. Prior to freezing at -80 °C, bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml to the SP fractions. RNAs—RNAs were transcribed in vitro from the corresponding single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide templates as previously described (25Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The transcription reactions contained a 4 mm concentration of each rNTP, 5.5 mm GMP, 40 mm Tris (pH 8.2 at 22 °C), 22 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a 100-μl volume. Transcriptions of radiolabeled RNAs also contained 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. The RNAs were gel-purified, eluted, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. All RNAs used as substrates for the editing reaction were circularized with T4 RNA ligase to block a 3′ U addition activity that would otherwise complicate the assay. The ligation reactions were at 37 °C for 2 h and contained 50 mm Tris (pH 8.7 at 22 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm rATP, 2.1 m Me2SO, 2.5 μm RNA, and 0.3 units/μl of T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs). After 2 h, the reactions were terminated by phenol/CHCl3 extraction and ethanol-precipitated. The RNAs were resuspended in 7 μl of distilled H2O, 3 μl of urea loading dye (10 m urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanole), and the circular product was resolved on a 60-cm-long/0.75-mm-thick 9% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide weight ratio of 19:1)/8 m urea gel. The RNA bands were visualized by UV shadowing, excised, eluted, and ethanol-precipitated. Editing Assay—One pmol of the radiolabeled circular RNAs was heated at 65 °C for 3 min in a 10-μl volume containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.1 at 27 °C) and 0.2 mm EDTA. After adding 25 μl of editing buffer (40 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 6 mm potassium phosphate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm UTP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), the RNA was left at room temperature for 10 min, at which point 15 μl of the SP fractionated extract (∼0.3 μg of protein) were added, and the reactions left at 27 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm, SDS to 0.5%, and proteinase K to 200 μg/ml. After heating 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were phenol/CHCl3-extracted, and the RNA was ethanol-precipitated. The RNA was resuspended in 3 μl of distilled H2O and 1 μl of urea dye, and the products were resolved on a 60-cm-long/0.4-mm-thick 9% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The edited signal was quantified after PhosphorImaging scanning (Amersham Biosciences). Selection-Amplification—The strategy used to select optimal editing substrates has previously been described (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled RNA containing a 23-nucleotide random region (Fig. 1A) was treated with editing extract, the products were resolved on a 9% polyacrylamide 8 m urea gel, and the gel was exposed to x-ray film for 12 h at -80 °C. The region of the gel corresponding to 1-3 U insertions was excised and eluted. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension in distilled H2O, cDNA was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (RT) at 42 °C and primer RP-1 (AACAAGAACAAGTTAAACGC), which is complementary to nucleotides 51-70 (Fig. 1A). The cDNA product was PCR-amplified using primers RP-1 and FP-1 (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTGCTTTATTTGTGGGATAAATTTA), which contains a T7 promoter sequence at its 5′ end and has sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1-27 of the randomer (Fig. 1A). Low stringency PCR annealing and extension conditions were used so that cDNA resulting from the reverse transcription of RNAs containing insertions within the upstream fixed sequence could be amplified (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Localization of U Insertions—RNAs were treated with extract, and the slower migrating bands with insertions were excised, eluted, and precipitated for reverse transcription. Two parallel reverse transcription reactions were performed using primers RP-2 (TCTGAATTCCCACAAATAAAGCAACC), which is complementary to nucleotides 1-18 (Fig. 1A), and RP-3 (TCTGAATTCAACAAGAACAAGTTAAACGC), which is complementary to nucleotides 51-70; both primers also have EcoRI sites on their 5′ ends to facilitate subsequent cloning. Full-length cDNA was gel-purified, eluted in the presence of 10 μg of carrier tRNA, and ethanol-precipitated. Terminal transferase (Roche Applied Science) was used to add an oligo(dA) tail to the isolated cDNA. The tailed cDNA was PCR-amplified for cloning using FP-2 (CTGGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) and either RP-2 or RP-3 as appropriate. Chemical Modifications—The dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) modification reactions were performed as previously described (26Krol A. Carbon P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 212-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the exception that the CMCT concentration was reduced to 2.6 μg/μl, and the CMCT denaturing reaction was performed at 70 °C for 1 min. The modifications were detected by reverse transcription using several different primers: RP-4 (CAAATAAAGCAACCAAC) complementary to nucleotides 14-68 (Fig. 2A) and either RP-5 (CACGCCTAAATTTATCCC) complementary to nucleotides 33 to 16 of RNA B-1 or RP-6 (CCCGTTTAAATTTATCCC) complementary to nucleotides 33 to 16 of RNA C-1 (Fig. 2A). UV Cross-linking—One pmol of radiolabeled linear RNA was heated in 5 μl of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.1 at 27 °C), 0.2 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 3 min, 11 μl of binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was added, and the RNA was left at room temperature for 10 min. After the addition of 9 μl of the SP-fractionated editing extract (∼0.2 μg of protein) the RNAs were incubated at 27 °C for 20 min. The RNA-editing extract solution was transferred onto parafilm placed on ice and exposed for 20 min to 120,000 microjoules/cm2, utilizing a 254-nm light source in a model 1800 Stratalinker (Stratagene). The products were treated with 10 μg of RNase A for 10 min and then resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The cross-linked products were quantified after PhosphorImager scanning. Diverse Editing Substrates—Selection-amplification (21Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar, 22Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7470) Google Scholar) was initially exploited in order to identify the sequence and structural requirements for the A + U-dependent editing reaction. A random mixture of the four standard nucleotides was substituted at 23 positions of the A + U element (Fig. 1A). RNAs within the random population that had the sequence and structure able to support in vitro U additions independent of added gRNA were partitioned from the bulk unedited population on the basis of their slower mobility on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The RNAs were circularized with T4 RNA ligase prior to extract treatment so as to prevent a terminal uridylyltransferase activity, present within the editing extract, from adding Us to the 3′-end, which would have interfered with the selection. Edited RNA was excised from the gel and amplified by RT-PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription for additional cycles of enrichment. Low stringent primer annealing and extension conditions were chosen so that the editing sites within the flanking fixed sequence could be regenerated for subsequent selection. However, editing sites within the random region would not be regenerated by this strategy. In addition to selecting RNAs that are permutations of the A + U element, it was possible that cis-acting gRNAs would be obtained from the selection. In fact, 14 of the RNAs selected after four cycles of selection clearly function as cis-acting gRNAs that guide U insertions between nucleotides 16 and 21 of the fixed sequence (labeled Group A in Fig. 1B). The first six RNAs within group A were used to define the critical RNA sequence and structure required for efficient gRNA-directed editing and have been described (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the majority of the selected RNAs did not appear to be related to the group A RNAs, and there also did not appear to be any obvious predicted structural similarity among these RNAs. Several selected sequences 8-14 nucleotides in length are each present within two different RNAs and were used to define the groups labeled B-F (Fig. 1B). Even within each group, however, it was difficult to fold the two RNAs into a structure that placed the consensus sequence within a similar conformation. The majority of the selected RNAs did not appear to be related either to the seven groups or to each other and were defined as group G. Since it was possible that RNAs were selected without meeting the intended criterion of being an editing substrate, two of the RNAs labeled B-1 and C-1 were chosen for further characterization. Treatment of both RNAs with editing extract resulted in a ladder of slower migrating products not detected with the starting random population (Fig. 1C). The slower migrating products are consistent with RNAs B-1 and C-1 being substrates for the in vitro U insertion reaction. However, unlike the parental A + U sequence, the predominant product formed with the editing of RNAs B-1 and C-1 is consistent with the insertion of only one U. Secondary Structure of RNAs B-1 and C-1—The location of the in vitro U insertions was determined for both RNAs B-1 and C-1. After treating the RNAs with extract, the edited product was resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, excised and reverse-transcribed in two parallel reactions using two nonoverlapping primers. The two different reverse transcription primers permitted U insertions to be detected throughout the entire sequence within each population of edited RNA. After the reverse transcriptions, a 3′ oligo(dA) extension was added to the cDNAs using terminal transferase and the product was PCR-amplified for cloning and sequencing. The major editing site for both RNAs B-1 and C-1 is located between nucleotides 59 and 62 (Fig. 2A). There is ambiguity in the precise localization because nucleotides 60 and 61 are Us, and it has been demonstrated for other RNAs that editing can occur both 5′ and 3′ of a genomically encoded U (9Pai R.D. Oppegard L.M. Connell G.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition to the major editing site(s), both RNAs also had several minor editing sites. The multiple editing sites were of interest, because it is also a characteristic of the A + U element-dependent reaction (18Brown L.M. Burbach B.J. McKenzie B.A. Connell G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6295-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In order to obtain insight into the relevant secondary structure of RNAs B-1 and C-1, conformations that placed a potential guiding nucleotide opposite the major site of in vitro editing were initially identified using an RNA folding algorithm (27Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10151) Google Scholar). These were subsequently tested by altering the number of purines at positions that potentially could act as guiding nucleotides in order to determine whether the number of Us inserted during the editing reaction was altered in the predicted manner. Changing the number of purines from zero to two at position 21 had the predicted effect on the number of insertions within both RNAs (Fig. 2B). Sequencing confirmed that the change in the number of insertions was occurring between nucleotides 59 and 62 (not shown), the major editing site. The relatively low background of incorrect insertions, especially when there are no guiding nucleotides at position 21 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 9), is also consistent with the other editing sites making only a minor contribution to the editing signal. Knowing the location of the guiding nucleotides and the major site of insertion provided constraints on the possible secondary structures. Most of the non-group A selected RNAs can be folded into hairpin loop structures similar to RNAs B-1 and C-1 (not shown); these include the group B-F RNAs and RNAs G-1 through G-30 (Fig. 1B). In order to refine the predicted secondary structures, both RNAs B-1 and C-1 were probed with the RNA-modifying agents DMS and CMCT (Fig. 2, C and D). Whereas DMS modifies As and Cs at Watson-Crick positions that are not involved in secondary or tertiary interactions, CMCT modifies Gs and Us at nonprotected Watson-Crick positions. Sites of modification were detected by RT-primer extension. The intensity from each RT product of the treated RNA was corrected for the corresponding modification-independent termination, and the ratio of the corrected intensity obtained under native conditions to that obtained under denaturing conditions was calculated for each position (Fig. 2A). Values could not be calculated at those positions where there are strong modification-independent RT terminations or limited reactivity under denaturing conditions. Most of the nucleotides within the predicted hairpin loop of RNA B-1 (nucleotides 33-50) are reactive under native conditions, and the nucleotides within the predicted helix formed by the pairing of (G-51, C-52, G-53, U-54, U-55, U-56) with (U-32, G-31, C-30, G-29, G-28, A-27) are mostly protected under the native reaction conditions (Fig. 2, A and C). Although the helix could potentially be extended further through the pairing of (A-57, A-58) with (U-26, U-25) and the pairing of (U-48, A-49, U-50) with (A-35, U-34, G-33), the modifications are more consistent with these nucleotides being unpaired. A-21 is more reactive than both A-22 and A-23, which is consistent with it being the unpaired guiding nucleotide. The modification reactions are also consistent with the helix predicted to form through the pairing of (G-62, U-63, U-64 C-65, U-66) with (U-20, A-19, G-18, G-17, G-16, G-15); however, modification-independent RT terminations limit the value of chemical probing within this region. The chemical probing is also mostly consistent with the proposed folding of RNA C-1 (Fig. 2, A and D). The ambiguity in the RNA C-1 secondary structure is primarily within the region predicted to form the internal G-G bulge (U-49, C-50, G-51, G-32, G-33, A-34). U-49 is not protected, and A-34, C-50, and C-52 are only partially protected, which is not completely consistent with the proposed structure but could result from fraying of base pairs near the end of the helix. Approximately 20% of the RNAs obtained from the fourth cycle of selection can also be folded with analogous G-G bulge loops, including RNAs B-2, D-1, E-1, E-2, and G-1 through G-11. The discrepancy between the in vitro selection of RNAs with the G-G bulge and chemical modification results may reflect an increased stability of the G-G bulged loop region in the presence of editing extract relative to the chemical probing when no protein is present. Mutagenesis is also consistent with the proposed structures. Substitutions within RNA B-1 that wo"
