https://openalex.org/W2155496693,"SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date."
https://openalex.org/W2138069158,"We report a set of tools to estimate the number of susceptibility loci and the distribution of their effect sizes for a trait on the basis of discoveries from existing genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We propose statistical power calculations for future GWASs using estimated distributions of effect sizes. Using reported GWAS findings for height, Crohn's disease and breast, prostate and colorectal (BPC) cancers, we determine that each of these traits is likely to harbor additional loci within the spectrum of low-penetrance common variants. These loci, which can be identified from sufficiently powerful GWASs, together could explain at least 15-20% of the known heritability of these traits. However, for BPC cancers, which have modest familial aggregation, our analysis suggests that risk models based on common variants alone will have modest discriminatory power (63.5% area under curve), even with new discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2145642736,"The development of selective inhibitors for discrete anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins implicated in pathologic cell survival remains a formidable but pressing challenge. Such precisely tailored compounds would serve as molecular probes and targeted therapies to study and treat human diseases driven by specific anti-apoptotic blockades. In particular, MCL-1 has emerged as a major resistance factor in human cancer. By screening a library of stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains (SAHBs), we determined that the MCL-1 BH3 helix is itself a potent and exclusive MCL-1 inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis studies defined key binding and specificity determinants, including the capacity to harness the hydrocarbon staple to optimize affinity while preserving selectivity. MCL-1 SAHB directly targets MCL-1, neutralizes its inhibitory interaction with pro-apoptotic BAK and sensitizes cancer cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis. By leveraging nature's solution to ligand selectivity, we generated an MCL-1-specific agent that defines the structural and functional features of targeted MCL-1 inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2053668040,"Upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent increases in extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling are implicated in prostate cancer progression. Impaired endocytic downregulation of EGFR also contributes to oncogenic phenotypes such as metastasis. Thus, understanding the roles of divergent signaling pathways in the regulation of EGFR trafficking and EGFR-driven invasive migration may enable the development of more effective therapies. In this study, we use the human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, to investigate the effects of both the ERK and Akt pathways on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated EGFR signaling, trafficking and cell motility. We show that DU145 and PC3 cells overexpress EGFR and migrate in a ligand (EGF)-dependent manner. Next, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ERK (but not Akt) signaling enhances EGF-induced EGFR activation, ubiquitination and downregulation, and may lead to enhanced receptor turnover. These findings negatively correlate with ERK-mediated threonine phosphorylation of EGFR, implicating it as a possible mechanism. Further, we uncover that EGF promotes disassembly of cell-cell junctions, downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of the transcriptional repressor, Snail, typical characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These effects are dependent on activation of Akt, as inhibition of Akt signaling abolishes EGF/EGFR-driven cell migration and EMT. Knockdown of endogenous Snail also prevents EGFR-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin, EMT and cell migration. Surprisingly, inhibition of the ERK pathway augments EGFR-dependent motility, occurring concomitantly with elevation of EGF-induced Akt activity. Collectively, our results suggest that EGF-triggered ERK activation has profound feedback on EGFR signaling and trafficking by EGFR threonine phosphorylation, and Akt has a pivotal role in EGFR-mediated cell migration by activating EMT. More important, our results also suggest that therapeutic targeting of ERK signaling may have undesirable outcomes (for example, augmenting EGFR-driven motility)."
https://openalex.org/W2104209180,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has pivotal roles during embryonic development and carcinoma progression. Members of the Snai1 family of zinc finger transcription factors are central mediators of EMT and induce EMT in part by directly repressing epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, a gatekeeper of the epithelial phenotype and a suppressor of tumor invasion. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Snai1-mediated transcriptional repression remains incompletely understood. Here we show that Snai1 physically interacts with and recruits the histone demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) to epithelial gene promoters. LSD1 removes dimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4m2), a covalent histone modification associated with active chromatin. Importantly, LSD1 is essential for Snai1-mediated transcriptional repression and for maintenance of the silenced state of Snai1 target genes in invasive cancer cells. In the absence of LSD1, Snai1 fails to repress E-cadherin. In cancer cells in which E-cadherin is silenced, depletion of LSD1 results in partial de-repression of epithelial genes and elevated H3K4m2 levels at the E-cadherin promoter. These results underline the critical role of LSD1 in Snai1-dependent transcriptional repression of epithelial markers and suggest that the LSD1 complex could be a potential therapeutic target for prevention of EMT-associated tumor invasion."

Mfp-2 is the most abundant protein in the plaques, but little is known about its function. Analysis of Mfp-2 films using the surface forces apparatus detected no interaction between films or between a film and bare mica; however, addition of Ca2+ and Fe3+ induced significant reversible bridging (work of adhesion Wad ≈ 0.3 mJ/m2 to 2.2 mJ/m2) between two films at 0.35 m salinity. The strongest observed Fe3+-mediated bridging approaches the adhesion of oriented avidin-biotin complexes. Raman microscopy of plaque sections supports the co-localization of Mfp-2 and iron, which interact by forming bis- or tris-DOPA-iron complexes. Mfp-2 adhered strongly to Mfp-5, a DOPA-rich interfacial adhesive protein, but not to another interfacial protein, Mfp-3, which may in fact displace Mfp-2 from mica. In the presence of metal ions or Mfp-5, Mfp-2 adhesion was fully reversible. These results suggest that plaque cohesiveness depends on Mfp-2 complexation of metal ions, particularly Fe3+ and also by Mfp-2 interaction with Mfp-5 at the plaque-substratum interface.

At least five other proteins known mostly as MFPs are present in the byssal plaque and contribute presumably to its adhesive performance: Mfp-1, Mfp-2, Mfp-4, Mfp-6, the prepepsinized collagens (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Of these, only two have reasonably well established functions: Mfp-1 complexed to Fe3+ provides a protective outer coating for the plaque and thread (11Harrington M.J. Masic A. Holten-Andersen N.

Qin X.X. Coyne K.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Other proteins have been partially characterized and sequenced, but their role in byssal structure is largely speculative. Mfp-2 is particularly intriguing because it is the most abundant protein of byssal plaques comprising >25% of the plaque by weight (14Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biological Bulletin. 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mfp-2 has a mass of 45 kDa and consists of 11 tandem repeats of an EGF motif, each of which resembles a knot-like structure stabilized by three disulfide bonds (Fig. 2) (15Inoue K. Takeuchi Y.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DOPA content is comparatively low at 3–5 mol % with an average of two residues per EGF repeat and three to four residues at the N- and C-terminal ends of Mfp-2. Surface binding studies of Mfp-2 using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometry showed the protein to be adsorbed rapidly to a variety of surfaces, but it was displaced effectively by Mfp-1 (17Suci P.A. Geesey G.G. Colloids Surf. 2001; 22B: 159-168Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In vitro, in the absence of protein cross-linkers such as tyrosinase, Mfp-2 exhibits little tendency for interaction with Mfp-1 (18Fant C. Elwing H. Höök F. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Mfp-2. A, sequence is based on Mfp-2 from M. galloprovincialis (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry Q25464) (13Waite J.H.

SFA is suited ideally to distinguish the proteins that coat surfaces from those that bridge from one surface to another, an important distinction in adhesion (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our studies show that Mfp-2 by itself coats mica but tends not to bridge between two mica surfaces. However, addition of Ca2+ and Fe3+ can mediate bridge formation between films of Mfp-2, and Mfp-2 can bind directly to Mfp-5 films. The strongest bridging between two adsorbed Mfp-2 films was induced by addition of low micromolar Fe3+. High resolution resonance Raman microprobe analysis of plaques supports the co-localization of iron and Mfp-2 and suggests that iron binding may be necessary for cohesion of Mfp-2 in plaque. Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis L.) feet were obtained in 500-g flash-frozen lots from Northeast Transport of Union, Maine. Mussel foot proteins Mfp-1, Mfp-2, Mfp-3, and Mfp-5 were purified from frozen M. edulis feet according to published procedures (19Waite J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Waite J.H. Qin X.-X. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Papov V.V.

Sample purity was assessed by acid urea-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The mol % DOPA in purified Mfp-1, Mfp-2, Mfp-3, and Mfp-5 was ∼12, ∼2, 22, and 28%, respectively, determined by amino acid analysis after a 1-h hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 158 °C. Purified samples were freeze-dried, resuspended in 50 mm acetic acid, and thereafter divided into convenient aliquot volumes for storage in vials at −70 °C prior to testing. Low pH and protection from light were necessary to reduce DOPA losses during handling and storage. Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used for all glassware cleaning and solution preparation. The SFA technique has been used for many years to measure both normal and lateral forces between surfaces in vapors and liquids, e.g. van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, adhesion forces, friction and lubrication forces, hydrophobic interactions, and specific and nonspecific biological interactions (22Israelachvili J.N. Adams G.E. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. I. 1978; 74: 975-1001Crossref Google Scholar, 23Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Intermolecular and Surface Forces. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1992Google Scholar). A diagram of the instrument and description of the underlying theory can be found in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” SFA can measure accurately the normal (attractive adhesion or repulsive) forces F as low as 10 nanonewtons as a function of surface separation distance D with a resolution of <1 Å determined using multiple beam interferometry. The normal force-distance profiles and adhesion forces (Fad) of Mfp-2 were determined using an SFA in a configuration reported previously (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, a thin mica sheet of 1–5 μm was glued onto a cylindrical silica disk (radius, r = 2 cm). 100 μl of a stock Mfp-2 solution (20 μg/ml) diluted in 0.1 m sodium acetate with 0.25 m potassium nitrate at pH 5.5, was injected onto one mica surface. (Note that in SFA, potassium nitrate is used in place of NaCl to reduce chloride ion-induced corrosion of the semireflecting silver layers under the mica substrates. Salt concentration was adjusted to half that of salinity of seawater.) For experiments with iron, 1 mm bis-tris was added to stabilize the solubility of Fe3+ (26Taylor S.W. Chase D.B. Emptage M.H. Nelson M.J. Waite J.H. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 7572-7577Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the test pH is significantly lower than seawater (pH 8.2), it was necessitated by the poor solubility of iron and the mussel proteins at higher pH in the SFA. The two curved and coated mica surfaces were then mounted in the SFA chamber in a crossed-cylinder geometry, which corresponds roughly to a sphere of radius R on a flat surface based on the Derjaguin approximation: F(D) = 2πRW(D), where F(D) is the force between the two curved surfaces, and W(D) is the interaction energy per unit area between two flat surfaces. The measured adhesion or “pull-off” force Fad is related to the adhesion energy per unit area Wad by Fad = 2πRWad for rigid (undeformable) surfaces with weakly adhesive interactions, and by Fad = 1.5πRWad (used in this study) for soft deformable surfaces with strong adhesive contact (27Johnson K.L. Kendall K. Roberts A.D. Proc. R. Soc. London. 1971; 324: 301-313Google Scholar, 28Helm C.A. Knoll W. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, the separation distance D is monitored in situ using the fringes of equal chromatic order in multiple beam interferometry. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 °C). Protein film deposition to one or both mica surfaces was determined by whether asymmetric or symmetric testing was planned. In the asymmetric mode, protein was applied to one mica surface only. In contrast, protein was applied to both mica surfaces in symmetric mode. Plaques from Mytilus galloprovincialis were embedded in PEG-2000 (Carl Roth Gmbh), and 20-μm thick longitudinal sections were microtomed. Plaque sections were washed thoroughly with several changes in distilled water to remove any remaining PEG, positioned on a quartz slide in distilled water and fixed under a quartz coverslip. For Raman microspectroscopy, a continuous laser beam was focused on the sample through a confocal Raman microscope (model CRM200, WITec, Ulm, Germany) equipped with a piezo scanner (model P-500, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany). The diode-pumped, 785-nm near-infrared laser excitation (Toptica Photonics AG, Graefelfing, Germany) was used in combination with a 100× oil immersed (Nikon, NA = 1.25) microscope objective. Laser power ranging between 15 and 30 milliwatts was used for all measurements. The spectra were acquired using an air-cooled charge-coupled device (DU401A-DR-DD, Andor, Belfast, North Ireland) behind a grating (300 g mm−1) spectrograph (Acton, Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) with a 6 cm−1 spectral resolution. Software ScanCtrlSpectroscopyPlus (version 1.38, Witec) was used for measurement setup. Raman spectra were processed and analyzed with Witec Project software (version 2.02). Raman spectra were background-subtracted and lightly smoothed using the first order polynomial function and 9-point Savitzky-Golay filter (4th order polynomial), respectively. More details on background subtraction are available in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Color images were obtained from Witec Project software using the basis analysis and image color combination functions. In the case of basis analysis, the algorithm fits each spectrum of the multigraph data object with a linear combination of the basis spectra (tree spectra, see Fig. 9E) using the least squares method. To solve the problem of differing fluorescence background in various parts of the sample, the first derivative of both multigraph data object and basis spectra was performed. The weighting factors of various components obtained by fitting were stored in an image and combined in a false color bitmap using the image color combination function. A purified solution of Mfp-2 (1 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium acetate with 0.25 m KNO3 and 1 mm bis-tris (pH 5.5) was mixed with a small volume of 1 mm FeCl3 in 10 mm bis-tris (pH 5.5) and equilibrated for 10 min. The added iron was adjusted to achieve DOPA:Fe3+ ratios of 2:1 and 20:1. The pH was then raised to ∼8.0 with 0.1 m NaOH, and a droplet of the solution was dried by evaporation on a glass slide. Raman spectra were taken of the protein-iron film at the edge of the film and of Mfp-2 solutions prior to iron complexation. As the dominant plaque protein between the byssal thread and adhesive interface (14Rzepecki L.M. Hansen K.M. Waite J.H. Biological Bulletin. 1992; 183: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Mfp-2 needs to be able to interact strongly with interfacial proteins at the substratum, with itself, and with various proteins within the mussel adhesive plaque (Fig. 1). We tested the adhesion of Mfp-2 to bare mica (asymmetric) and of two opposing Mfp-2 films on mica (symmetric) using the surface forces apparatus. The ability of Mfp-2 to coat or bridge on mica surfaces is revealed in the force-distance (F versus D) profile and by the repulsion associated with an initial approach to the “hard wall” followed by separation of the surfaces (note that the hard wall is defined as the mica-mica separation at which the thickness of the confined proteins becomes asymptotic with increased normal load or pressure). Adsorption of Mfp-2 to mica was confirmed by the hard wall distance shift from 5 to 10 nm evident from the fringes of equal chromatic order signal shift and shape changes as shown previously (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). No apparent adhesion was measured between Mfp-2 and bare mica, nor could adhesion be detected between two Mfp-2 films (Fig. 3, A and B). Even a 1-h contact time failed to induce adhesion in Mfp-2. As significant levels of calcium and iron have been detected in byssal plaques (∼0.1% (w/w) (29Sun C. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39332-39336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)), it seemed appropriate to test the effect of these ions on Mfp-2 adhesion. Weak adhesion between two symmetric Mfp-2 coated surfaces occurred after adding 5 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). Adhesion improved slightly to ∼0.28 mJ/m2 by increasing the contact time for Mfp-2 films (Fig. 4B). Ca2+-mediated bridging of Mfp-2 films was further subjected to five cycles of approach and separation without significant loss in adhesion energy (Fig. 4D). With respect to Fe3+, no adhesion was initially detected after introducing 5 μm Fe3+ between symmetric Mfp-2 films, but a longer contact time (∼1 h) resulted in significant adhesion (∼1.3 mJ/m2) (Fig. 5B). Reapproach and separation after breaking the 1-h contact produced the strongest observed adhesion (∼2.2 mJ/m2) in our studies (Fig. 5C). A reversible iron-mediated bridging of Mfp-2 is suggested by the instantaneous enhanced adhesion of subsequent approach-separation cycles. Studying the effect of pH on the iron-Mfp-2 interaction proved challenging because both iron and protein tend to precipitate at higher pH; however, it was possible to raise the pH to 6.8 (Fig. 6, A–D). Remarkably, adhesion remained the same, but the rate at which adhesion increased was faster (compare, for example, the similar asymptotic adhesion after 1 h at pH 5.5 and 6.8 in Figs. 5B and 6C, respectively). However, after 10 min at pH 6.8, adhesion was 70% complete (Fig. 6B), whereas at pH 5.5, adhesion was not yet detectable. Higher pH also affects the magnitude of adhesion after the 1-h separation and approach. At pH 6.8, it is only half that at 5.5 (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6Influence of Fe3+ (5 μm) on the interaction between two symmetric Mfp-2 films on mica at pH 6.8.

Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). 5H. Zeng, D. S. Hwang, and J. H. Waite, unpublished data. We hypothesized that Mfp-2 should be able to adhere to either or both Mfp-3 and -5. In an asymmetric experiment, Mfp-2 was deposited on one mica face and a film of either Mfp-3 or Mfp-5 was formed on the other. Mfp-2 showed strong adhesion to Mfp-5 that took effect immediately and reached a maximum of 1.3 mJ/m2 after a 1-h contact (Fig. 7C). There was no change in the hard wall, suggesting that both films remain on the mica. In contrast, Mfp-2 showed no adhesion to Mfp-3 until after 10 min of contact, after which it increased to 1.0 mJ/m2 at 60 min. The observed hard wall at 10 and 60 min is only half that at 0 min, suggesting that the proteins are rearranging on the surface or that Mfp-2 is displaced by Mfp-3 (Fig. 8, A–C). To explore whether iron addition enhances adhesion between Mfp-2 and Mfp-3 or Mfp-5, we repeated the asymmetric experiments in the presence of these metal ions (5 μm), but no significant effects were detected (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Consistent with a previous report, Mfp-1 did not exhibit bridging in our studies. Similarly, when Mfp-1 and Mfp-2 were asymmetrically coated on mica, a hard wall distance of 10 nm suggests the persistence of both films, but there was no adhesion between them (Fig. 9). Addition of 5 μm Fe3+ did not lead to detectable bridging. DOPA-iron coordination gives distinctive resonance Raman spectra that can be combined with confocal microscopy to localize DOPA-iron complexes in biomaterials (11Harrington M.J. Masic A. Holten-Andersen N. Waite J.H. Fratzl P. Science. 2010; 328: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Different regions of the spectrum, namely CH stretching, Fe3+-DOPA complexation, and phenylalanine, were integrated after Raman imaging of a thin (20-μm) section of the byssal plaque (Fig. 10, A–D). Notably, DOPA-iron coordination (500–650 cm−1) is distributed throughout the plaque with highest intensity in the cuticle (Fig. 10C). Phenylalanine (1003 cm−1) is only prominent in the foam-like core (Fig. 10D). Average spectra were extracted from the different morphological regions of the plaque (cuticle, core, and interface) (Fig. 10E) and were fitted to the image (Fig. 10F). As expected, the plaque cuticle spectrum is essentially identical to the thread cuticle spectrum published previously (10Sagert J. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2009; 212: 2224-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Spectra of the plaque core, however, deviate subtly from the cuticle in some respects: a) a sharp peak at 1003 cm−1 associated with Phe (30Movasaghi Z. Rehman S. Rehman I.U. Appl. Spectrosc. Review. 2007; 42: 493-541Crossref Scopus (1322) Google Scholar); b) several shifts and intensity changes in the region of DOPA-metal complex vibrations (500–650 cm−1); c) changes in intensity of tyrosine-related peaks in the region of 810–860 cm−1; and d) changes in the DOPA ring vibrations (1380–1520 cm−1). The Raman spectrum of the plaque-surface interface shows further differences from the core. The adhesive protein primers (Mfp-3 and Mfp-5) are located this region, which exhibits the lowest intensities for DOPA-iron complexes (Fig 10E, green trace). Mixtures of Fe3+ and purified Mfp-2 precipitated at pH ∼ 8 also showed a strong resonance Raman signal indicative of DOPA-iron coordination (Fig. 11 with the triscatecholato-iron structure). The Phe peak at 1003 cm−1 is easy to spot in the uncomplexed protein but is overwhelmed by resonance at 2:1 DOPA to iron. At 20:1 DOPA to iron, in contrast, with less developed resonance Raman, the Phe peak of Mfp-2 is clearly evident. Indeed, apart from the buffer artifact at 1060 cm−1, the 20:1 DOPA to iron spectrum of Mfp-2 is very similar to the Raman spectrum of the plaque. At 2:1 and 3:1 DOPA to iron ratios, the spectra of Mfp-2 closely resemble those of Mfp-1 following the same precipitation procedure (supplemental Fig. S4), but both differ significantly from spectra obtained from the plaque in situ. There has been a long-standing challenge of how to best study protein-protein interactions in sclerotized biomaterials such as mussel byssal plaques. The protein precursors, although often quite abundant while stockpiled in secretory cells, become chemically modified following release by covalent and metal complexation-based cross-linking, which in turn leads to hardening. Traditional immunohistochemical localization of DOPA-containing proteins in a variety of sclerotized structures has proven useless due to the speed with which DOPA epitopes change following oxidation and metal binding (31Anderson K.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Robinson M.W. Colhoun L.M. Fairweather I. Brennan G.P. Waite J.H. Parasitology. 2001; 123: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored two new approaches for insights relating to protein interactions in sclerotized structures: the Raman microscope and surface forces apparatus. Raman microscopy enables analysis of biological specimens for chemical functionalities, secondary structure, and orientational preference with a 1-μm spatial resolution, and the surface forces apparatus allows a facile means of quantifying interactions between polymers or between polymers and surfaces. By depositing paired polymer candidates on opposing mica surfaces, the strength of each pairwise interaction can be measured and compared. Given that byssal plaques adhere strongly to mica surfaces in seawater (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), mica is suitable as a support surface to which various MFPs can be adsorbed, and their interactions can be examined at salinities approaching seawater. pH 5.5 hardly resembles seawater pH (8.2), but it is a reasonable approximation for the intragranular pH of regulated protein secretion (33De Young M.B. Nemeth E.F. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Njus D. Sehr P.A. Radda G.K. Ritchie G.A. Seeley P.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4337-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and, as such, will resemble the pH of MFPs secreted onto a surface. Most of the MFPs and Fe3+ precipitate at pH ∼ 8; in addition, we observed in a previous study (3Zhao H. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26150-29158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that plaque footprints preserved the 20 mol % DOPA content of Mfp-3 notwithstanding the pH of the surrounding seawater. This would be possible only if the footprints were maintained at acidic pH or were full of antioxidants. Given the above factors, pH 5.5 was the most expedient for this study. Mfp-2 is the most abundant protein in the attachment plaques of the mussel byssus and thus cannot afford to be a weak link in the structure. At the top of the plaque, it needs to interact with the scaffolding collagens (prepepsinized collagens) and associated matrix proteins that join the thread to the plaque (Fig. 1); at the bottom, Mfp-2 must bind to the priming proteins (Mfp-3 and/or Mfp-5) that secure the footprint of the plaque to foreign surfaces. An Mfp-2 film was incapable of adhering to bare mica (asymmetric). No improvement was obtained by coating both mica surfaces with Mfp-2 (symmetric). The results imply that Mfp-2 is not an adhesive protein, a result that resembles the behavior of Mfp-1, a protein known to function only as a coating in byssus (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 11Harrington M.J. Masic A. Holten-Andersen N. Waite J.H. Fratzl P. Science. 2010; 328: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Given that iron and calcium are present in adhesive plaques at levels (∼0.1 w/w%) significantly above those of seawater (29Sun C. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39332-39336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we explored the effect of adding Ca2+ and Fe3+ on adhesion between symmetric Mfp-2 films. Mfp-2 showed weak calcium-mediated adhesion consistent with electrostatic interactions, but the effect of ionic strength needs further scrutiny. Notwithstanding the high positive charge density and high pI of Mfp-2, there are clusters of negatively charged residues on EGF repeat 8 and at C and N termini (Fig. 2, A and B). These clusters would be repelled by the anionic mica surface and presumably serve as ligands for Ca2+ ions (Fig. 2). Separate from these, the seventh EGF repeat contains a calcium binding motif with a known consensus sequence Cys3-x-Asn-x-x-x-x-Tyr-x-Cys4 (35Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) having a micromolar binding constant (36Rand M.D. Lindblom A. Carlson J. Villoutreix B.O. Stenflo J. Protein Science. 1997; 6: 2059-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fe3+ increased adhesion by a factor of 5 to 7 times more than that of calcium during the separation of symmetric Mfp-2 films. Notably, the measured adhesion energy (Wad∼ Fad/1.5πR) was 2.2 mJ/m2, which approaches the 10 mJ/m2 energy measured for the strongest known noncovalent protein-ligand interaction, i.e. biotin-avidin (28Helm C.A. Knoll W. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Given the incremental coordination of Fe3+ by low molecular weight catechols (from one to three) with increasing pH (37Avdeef A. Sofen S.R. Bregante T.L. Raymond K.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 5362-5370Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the prediction that the adhesion of iron bridging in Mfp-2 would increase with pH seemed reasonable, but there was no change. We suggest that in Mfp-2 as in Mfp-1, iron binding already has achieved the maximal tris-catecholate iron at pH 5.5 (38Zeng H. Hwang D.S. Israelachvili J. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 10.1073/pnas.1007416107Google Scholar). Although complex stoichiometry is fixed at the 3:1 limit, its formation can be accelerated, and this is probably what we observed in the enhanced rate of adhesion (11Harrington M.J. Masic A. Holten-Andersen N. Waite J.H. Fratzl P. Science. 2010; 328: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 38Zeng H. Hwang D.S. Israelachvili J. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 10.1073/pnas.1007416107Google Scholar). There is another pH-dependent result that merits scrutiny. The reduced adhesion post-1 h separation and reapproach at pH 6.8 (Fig. 6D) was half of that occurring at pH 5.5. Given the roughly 2-fold thicker hard wall at pH 6.8, the higher rate of complex formation may render the film more stiff and less compliant than at pH 5.5. The larger recovered adhesion at pH 5.5 may be stronger because the film can flow and rearrange to form new complexes, whereas at pH 6.8, it is more rigid. The strength of adhesion in Mfp-2 is reminiscent of iron-induced adhesion of symmetric Mfp-1, which was attributed to formation of multiple catecholate iron complexes (11Harrington M.J. Masic A. Holten-Andersen N. Waite J.H. Fratzl P. Science. 2010; 328: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 38Zeng H. Hwang D.S. Israelachvili J. Waite J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 10.1073/pnas.1007416107Google Scholar). Curiously, even though all MFPs have DOPA, iron bridging seems MFP-specific; iron addition to asymmetric Mfp-2-Mfp-1 films had no effect. In this regard, it should be noted that there is no evidence that Mfp-1 and -2 make direct contact in the plaque. These results indicate that the intrinsically poor cohesion between Mfp-2 films, at least as measured by the SFA, can be overcome by the addition of metal ions. Raman maps of plaque thin sections support a role for iron in setting. This conclusion was also proposed by Sever et al. (39Sever M.J. Weisser J.T. Monahan J. Srinivasan S. Wilker J.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) based on EPR analysis of plaques. Given the strong phenylalanine signal coupled with the Fe3+-catechol resonance signals localized in the plaque core, Mfp-2 is most likely the Fe3+ binding protein in this region. Mfp-2 has a significant Phe content (7–8 residues per protein), whereas Mfp-1, Mfp-3, and Mfp-5 have none. Indeed, at DOPA:iron ratios of 20:1, Mfp-2 and the plaque core have highly similar Raman spectra. The observed difference between the resonance spectra of the plaque cuticle and core probably reflects the effect of different protein/metal mixtures on the coordination environment. Mfp-2 and Mfp-1 are both capable of coordinating Fe3+, but the mussel apparently tunes the coordination chemistry and environment of the different proteins during processing by titrating the supply of iron to the precursors in the secretory granules. The reliance of reversible Mfp-2-Mfp-2 interactions on two different metal ions Ca2+ and Fe3+ may be a fascinating example of a biological “safety net.” As the two binding sites are distinct, DOPA for iron and a specific binding motif for calcium, both may be present at any given interface. Assuming a parallel binding array, the stronger (iron-DOPA) may yield during a separation with a second weaker bridge (calcium binding) providing guidance for contact recovery. Notwithstanding that this model should be tested directly by SFA, a high initial stiffness and gradual post-yield recovery is generally observed in byssal threads under tension (40Harrington M.J. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4307-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Carrington E. Gosline J.M. American Malacological Bulletin. 2004; 18: 135-142Google Scholar). At the interface between the plaque and the foreign substratum, three MFPs have been detected, namely Mfp-3, Mfp-5, and Mfp-6 (2Zhao H. Robertson N.B. Jewhurst S.A. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Zhao H. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26150-29158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Of these, only Mfp-3 and Mfp-5 are known to be strongly adhesive (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).5 Indeed, Mfp-3 and Mfp-5 have inspired a wide range of DOPA-like synthetic adhesive polymers (e.g. 6Lee B.P. Chao C.Y. Nunalee F.N. Motan E. Shull K.R. Messersmith P.B. Macromolecules. 2006; 39: 1740-1748Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The interaction of Mfp-5 and Mfp-2 was instantaneous, very strong, and reversible. The binding functionalities for this protein-protein interaction are not at all clear at present. In contrast, the interaction between Mfp-2 and Mfp-3 is a very unconvincing one with no instantaneous adhesion. At this time, the best interpretation of the results is that Mfp-3 completely displaces Mfp-2 from one mica surface to become the only adhesive protein to span the mica sheets. Indeed, the time-dependent adhesion achieved between Mfp-3 and Mfp-2 is no different than with Mfp-3 alone (9Lin Q. Gourdon D. Sun C. Holten-Andersen N. Anderson T.H. Waite J.H. Israelachvili J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Presumably, binding to surface Mfp-3 is mediated by some other plaque protein(s). In summary, the interactions of Mfp-2 in the plaque are as follows (Fig. 12); Mfp-2 binds strongly to Mfp-5 at the interface and to other Mfp-2 proteins in the core in the presence of Fe3+ and/or Ca2+. Mfp-2 does not bind Mfp-1 nor apparently to Mfp-3; binding to Mfp-5 is not enhanced by adding iron. Other interactions remain to be investigated. We thank C. J. Sun and E. Danner for partially purifying Mfp-2 and J. Yu and P. Fratzl for support. Download .pdf (1.26 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2003861270,"Cysteine is considered a nonessential amino acid in mammals as it is synthesized from methionine via trans-sulfuration. However, premature infants or patients with hepatic failure may require dietary cysteine due to a lack of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), a key trans-sulfuration enzyme. Here, we generated CTH-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice as an animal model of cystathioninemia/cystathioninuria. Cth(-/-) mice developed normally in general but displayed hypercystathioninemia/hyperhomocysteinemia though not hypermethioninemia. When fed a low cyst(e)ine diet, Cth(-/-) mice showed acute skeletal muscle atrophy (myopathy) accompanied by enhanced gene expression of asparagine synthetase and reduced contents of glutathione in livers and skeletal muscles, and intracellular accumulation of LC3 and p62 in skeletal myofibers; they finally died of severe paralysis of the extremities. Cth(-/-) hepatocytes required cystine in a culture medium and showed greater sensitivity to oxidative stress. Cth(-/-) mice exhibited systemic vulnerability to oxidative injury, which became more prominent when they were fed the low cyst(e)ine diet. These results reveal novel roles of trans-sulfuration previously unrecognized in mice lacking another trans-sulfuration enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs(-/-)). Because Cbs(-/-) mice display hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethioninemia, our results raise questions against the homocysteine-based etiology of CBS deficiency and the current newborn screening for homocysteinemia using Guthrie's method, which detects hypermethioninemia."

Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6648) Google Scholar). Their robust mode of action (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 3Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar), as well as their broad activity toward bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6648) Google Scholar, 4Jenssen H. Hamill P. Hancock R.E.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), makes AMPs appealing candidates for the development of new and more efficient antimicrobial agents. In fact, they provide an alternative to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of resistant pathogens (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 3Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanisms adopted by the AMPs is thus central to the advancement of these molecules to the status of a new group of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.Characterization of AMPs has revealed a highly heterogeneous group of molecules, which differ in sequence, length, and structural conformation (α-helical, β-sheet, extended, and looped) (3Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar, 5Hancock R.E. Chapple D.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these variations, two functionally important features are shared by most AMPs: a net positive charge and the ability to adopt an amphipathic structure. The net positive charge allows for the electrostatic binding of the peptide to the anionic microbial surface, while the amphipathic structure promotes peptide insertion into the hydrophobic core of the cell membrane (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 3Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). Several models describing membrane disruption as a result of these direct peptide-lipid interactions have been proposed: the barrel-stave pore model (6Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8347-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 7Melo M.N. Ferre R. Castanho M.A. Nat. Rev.

Shai Y. Peptide Science. 1998; 47: 451-463Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism adopted, a threshold peptide concentration needs to be reached for disruption of the membrane structure to occur (6Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8347-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 7Melo M.N. Ferre R. Castanho M.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Alternative mechanisms involving cytoplasmic invasion and interference of core metabolic functions have also been considered to account for the antimicrobial properties of some AMPs (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). In these cases, the microbial outer membrane must still be traversed to allow peptide penetration into the cell. Analysis of the peptide interactions at the membrane level is therefore central to the understanding of the mode of action of AMPs.In this study, the modes of action of two distinctly different AMPs on the cell envelope of E. coli are explored. The first peptide, BP100 (KKLFKKILKYL-NH2), is a short cationic cecropin A-melittin hybrid (12Andreu D. Ubach J. Boman A. Wåhlin B. Wade D. Merrifield R.B. Boman H.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) obtained through a combinatorial chemistry approach (13Badosa E. Ferre R. Planas M. Feliu L. Besalú E. Cabrefiga J. Bardají E. Montesinos E. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been established as an effective AMP, capable of inhibiting in vitro the growth of the economically important plant pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria Erwinia amylovora, Pseudomonas syringae pv. Syringae, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, as well as in vivo the growth of E. amylovora (13Badosa E. Ferre R. Planas M. Feliu L. Besalú E. Cabrefiga J. Bardají E. Montesinos E. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). BP100 has also been reported to display minimal cytotoxicity and low susceptibility to proteinase K degradation (13Badosa E. Ferre R. Planas M. Feliu L. Besalú E. Cabrefiga J. Bardají E. Montesinos E. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Details of the membrane perturbation mechanisms adopted by this peptide have largely been revealed through biophysical studies (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A strong selectivity toward anionic bacterial membrane models was detected for BP100, with a strong correlation between the closely coupled processes of charge neutralization, permeabilization, and translocation being identified. The second peptide, pepR (LKRWGTIKKSKAINVLRGFRKEIGRMLNILNRRRR), is derived from the putative RNA-binding domain of the dengue virus capsid protein (15Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J. Post C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3414-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The structural features of this peptide as observed in the capsid protein (i.e. cationic, amphipathic α-helix) seem to point to a potentially potent AMP.Here, we present the characterization of BP100 and pepR effects toward E. coli, both at cellular and molecular levels. Antimicrobial susceptibility and surface charge studies were used to explore the concept of a neutralization-mediated killing mechanism adopted by either AMP. In addition to this, AFM was used to assess the bactericidal effect of each AMP on the cell envelope morphology of E. coli, a representative Gram-negative bacterium. It is worth stressing that both peptides are not effective against Gram-positive bacteria, for which other considerations may apply.DISCUSSIONBiophysical studies have previously been employed to explore the mode of action of BP100 (14Ferre R.

In these studies, the binding affinity and damaging effect of BP100 on phospholipid bilayers having lipid compositions similar to that of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane were explored. In addition to the ability of this peptide to permeabilize and translocate the model bacterial membrane, surface charge neutralization upon membrane saturation was detected. The peptide concentrations required for saturation and consequently neutralization to occur (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were found to be in the range of that required for microbial inhibition (13Badosa E. Ferre R. Planas M. Feliu L. Besalú E. Cabrefiga J. Bardají E. Montesinos E. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Clearly, these closely coupled events provide some insight into the antimicrobial mechanism adopted by BP100. Although these concepts have already been extended to other AMPs (reviewed in Ref. 7Melo M.N. Ferre R. Castanho M.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), there is still a need to draw parallels between the biophysical and biological studies. In the present study, a correlation between antimicrobial susceptibility and bacterial surface charge neutralization as exerted by either BP100 or pepR on E. coli was investigated. AFM imaging was also used to gain some insights into the mode of action of each AMP against E. coli, at an atomic level.Both BP100 and pepR were found to be effective antimicrobial agents against E. coli, inhibiting the growth of this Gram-negative bacterium at micromolar concentrations. Inhibition occurred to an equivalent extent for both peptides, with pepR being only slightly more effective at lower peptide concentrations. For the BP100-treated E. coli cells, the MICs recorded were comparable to those previously reported for E. amylovora, P. syringae pv. Syringae, and X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (13Badosa E. Ferre R. Planas M. Feliu L. Besalú E. Cabrefiga J. Bardají E. Montesinos E. Peptides. 2007; 28: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as well as the theoretically determined values (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Having established the MICs for each peptide, zeta potential studies were performed under the equivalent experimental conditions. In doing so, characterization of the bacterial surface following the addition of either cationic AMP at MICs was made possible. In the absence of peptide, the E. coli surface displayed a zeta potential of −21.9 ± 3.0 mV. This negative surface net charge originates from the negative lipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules present in the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane (18Domingues M.M. Santiago P.S. Castanho M.A. Santos N.C. J. Pept. Sci. 2008; 14: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Amro N.A. Kotra L.P. Wadu-Mesthrige K. Bulychev A. Mobashery S. Liu G.Y. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 2789-2796Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Analysis of the electrostatic properties of the E. coli surface by zeta potential measurement, after incubation with either AMP, revealed significant differences between both peptides. The observed behavioral differences recorded for each AMP can be rationalized on the basis of the peptide and membrane properties. For BP100, the surface charge of the bacteria was neutralized when using concentrations at, and above, the MIC (i.e. >2 μm). This corresponds well to the biophysical data, where surface neutralization of the model bacterial membrane was induced by equivalent BP100 concentrations at the saturation state (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The postulated saturation-triggered antimicrobial mechanisms adopted by BP100 (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) thus appear to be connected to the neutralization of the bacterial surface when using peptide concentrations equivalent to MICs. In biological systems, surface neutralization can largely be attributed to the balance in electrostatic interactions between the positive charges (mainly lysine and arginine side chains) of the peptides with the negatively charged groups (mainly phosphates and carboxylates) of LPS. For BP100 (+6 at pH 7.4) in a model bacterial membrane, it has been proposed that one peptide molecule interacts with 5.6 negatively charged phospholipid molecules at saturation, thereby inducing neutralization (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This phenomenon more than likely accounts for BP100 behavior when treating E. coli cells with the peptide at MIC.For pepR, surface neutralization of E. coli occurred at peptide concentrations below MIC values (0.63 μm). In fact, a charge overcompensation was registered in the zeta potential measurements when treating E. coli with pepR at concentrations above 1.25 μm. Mechanisms other than just surface neutralization seem to be present in the case of pepR. Relative to BP100, pepR is considerably more basic and positively charged (+12 at pH 7.4). The interaction of this peptide with E. coli at low concentrations (i.e. below MIC) can be attributed, at least initially, to electrostatics. Several studies investigating the interaction of cationic AMPs with model bacterial membranes have shown that an overcompensation in zeta potential at high peptide concentrations is associated with membrane insertion via hydrophobic interactions (22Andrä J. Koch M.H. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Den Hertog A.L. Wong Fong Sang H.W. Kraayenhof R. Bolscher J.G. Van't Hof W. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Domingues M.M. Castanho M.A. Santos N.C. PLoS One. 2009; 4e8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A similar trend was also reported for the interaction of the cationic peptide rBPI21 with LPS aggregates (24Domingues M.M. Castanho M.A. Santos N.C. PLoS One. 2009; 4e8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The overcompensation in E. coli zeta potential at high pepR concentrations (≥MICs) may indicate: 1) that hydrophobic interactions contribute to membrane interaction in addition to electrostatic attraction, or 2) not all positive charges of pepR contribute to electroneutralization. The relatively large size of pepR, as well as the large majority of charged/polar residues within the peptide, makes it unlikely that all its charges will be able to simultaneously come into contact with the bacterial surface. Thus, the observed zero in zeta potential at low concentrations of pepR may not correspond to the actual neutralization of the surface but rather its masking by unbound charges. This interpretation conciliates the zeta potential results of pepR with the MIC-neutralization correlation hypothesis. In any case, the existence of an inherent neutralization-mediated killing mechanism employed by either AMP is not necessarily implied.To gain further insights into these MIC-associated events, AFM images of the E. coli cells under varying conditions were acquired. The use of the cationic polymer PLL as an adhesion molecule for bonding bacteria to surfaces prior to AFM imaging has been questioned (25Colville K. Tompkins N. Rutenberg A.D. Jericho M.H. Langmuir. 2009; 26: 2639-2644Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in part due to its potential antimicrobial activity (26Conte M. Aliberti F. Fucci L. Piscopo M. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 23: 1679-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Yoshida T. Nagasawa T. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 62: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that the use of this method for imaging bacteria in their native state does not affect the properties of the bacterial membrane surface (28Bolshakova A.V. Kiselyova O.I. Filonov A.S. Frolova O.Y. Lyubchenko Y.L. Yaminsky I.V. Ultramicroscopy. 2001; 86: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Schaer-Zammaretti P. Ubbink J. Ultramicroscopy. 2003; 97: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Bacteria can also be imaged in an air-dried state, as this enables the high-resolution imaging of their surface morphology (28Bolshakova A.V. Kiselyova O.I. Filonov A.S. Frolova O.Y. Lyubchenko Y.L. Yaminsky I.V. Ultramicroscopy. 2001; 86: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30da Silva Jr., A. Teschke O. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 21: 1103-1110Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Ubbink J. Schär-Zammaretti P. Micron. 2005; 36: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For this reason, the bacterial cells imaged in this study were immobilized onto glass slides functionalized with PLL and allowed to air-dry. Overall, satisfactory and informative AFM images of the untreated and AMP-treated bacterial cells were acquired, revealing detailed information on the membranolytic properties of both BP100 and pepR. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that, due to the deposition and washing protocols, free debris resulting from cell disruption are partially eliminated.The AFM results presented in this study clearly demonstrate the time- and concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity of both BP100 and pepR. Intricate details of the damage sustained by the E. coli cells following AMP treatment under the different conditions were revealed. During the initial stages of treatment, where cells were incubated with peptide either for short periods of time (0.5 h) or using low peptide concentrations (below MICs), minor changes in the outer membrane of the bacterial cell envelope were induced. The appearance of blebs at the bacterial surface, as well as the slight collapse in the outer membrane, already pointed to the interaction of either AMP to the negatively charged LPS outer layer. The formation of vesicle-like structures, as well as the alterations in surface roughness, observed in the E. coli cells exposed to either BP100 or pepR for longer time periods (≥2 h) and at higher peptide concentrations (≥MICs) confirmed this. Previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in surface roughness is a direct consequence of AMP incorporation into the LPS-containing outer membrane (21Meincken M. Holroyd D.L. Rautenbach M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30da Silva Jr., A. Teschke O. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 21: 1103-1110Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Li A. Lee P.Y. Ho B. Ding J.L. Lim C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Miyajima K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that release of LPS-containing vesicles and even autolytic reactions are possible outcomes of such interactions (21Meincken M. Holroyd D.L. Rautenbach M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30da Silva Jr., A. Teschke O. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 21: 1103-1110Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Li A. Lee P.Y. Ho B. Ding J.L. Lim C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When exposing E. coli to either BP100 or pepR under extreme conditions (i.e. long exposure time, ≥2 h; high peptide concentrations, ≥MICs), a collapse of the outer membrane at the septal region was generally observed. In some images, a release of cytoplasmic content was also detected. These phenomena may be explained by taking into account that cardiolipin, a negatively charged phospholipid, is generally located at the apical and septal regions of the E. coli inner membrane (34Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1172-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and that both BP100 and pepR are highly cationic. Furthermore, BP100, which displays a high affinity toward negatively charged phospholipids, is known to induce vesicle permeabilization at high peptide/lipid ratios (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that treatment of E. coli with either AMP for long periods of time, or when using high concentrations, could result in an accumulation of peptide at either the apical or septal regions. When a threshold peptide concentration is reached in these regions, membrane disruption may occur, thereby initiating cell leakage. Similar observations have been reported for the cationic AMPs magainin 2, melittin, PGLa, and Sushi 3 (21Meincken M. Holroyd D.L. Rautenbach M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Li A. Lee P.Y. Ho B. Ding J.L. Lim C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on the nature of such alterations, the adoption of a carpet-like or detergent-like mechanism (9Bechinger B. Lohner K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) in vivo by the two AMPs investigated here seems to be likely.Combining the antimicrobial susceptibility, zeta potential and AFM data, the closely coupled events leading to E. coli cell death after AMP treatment can thus be summarized as follows. At peptide concentrations below MIC, an association of the cationic AMP with the negatively charged LPS molecules in the bacterial outer membrane occurs. For BP100, this event involves an initial electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the LPS molecules and a gradual increase of the membrane surface charge. In contrast, the electrostatic association of pepR to the LPS outer layer prompts an almost immediate net neutralization of the membrane surface charge. At an initial stage and at low extents of peptide binding, minor changes in the bacterial cell envelope are provoked (e.g. bleb formation and slight collapse in the outer membrane). Treatment of E. coli with either AMP at, and above the MIC, brings about further membrane alterations (e.g. increase in surface roughness and formation of vesicle-like structures). After the permeabilization of the outer membrane and cell envelope, each AMP interacts with the negatively charged phospholipids of the bacterial inner membrane. In the case of BP100, these events are associated with saturation (14Ferre R. Melo M.N. Correia A.D. Feliu L. Bardají E. Planas M. Castanho M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1815-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, consequently, neutralization of the membrane. For pepR, events beyond electrostatic equivalence prompt peptide binding to the inner membrane. The final stages leading to E. coli cell death, as evidenced by the release of cytoplasmic content, involve the disruption of the inner membrane by either AMP.The differences in the MIC values of the two peptides may also be closely related to their charge behavior. It has been proposed that threshold events that lead to cell death (35Huang H.W. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3263-3272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) depend on the strain imposed on the cell membrane due to peptide-induced thinning. The reaching of such thresholds requires that peptide molecules become concentrated in the membrane despite an intrinsic repulsion between them as their density increases. The driving forces that overcome this repulsion are the electrostatic and hydrophobic peptide-membrane interactions, which also result in the typically high membrane binding affinities of AMPs (7Melo M.N. Ferre R. Castanho M.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Bacterial surface charge neutralization by pepR occurs at very low peptide concentrations, which is a likely consequence of the high cationicity of the peptide. From neutralization onward, only the hydrophobic interactions will be left to draw more peptide molecules to the membrane (the zeta potential increasing above 0 mV; Fig. 1B) and across the disruption threshold. With a weaker driving force to bind the membrane, larger amounts of peptide are eventually required for the threshold to be reached, which translates into a higher MIC. Ultimately, too high a cationic charge on an AMP may actually compromise its activity. This concept may in fact account for the observed lack of antibacterial activity reported for some of the cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptides (e.g. BP16, +9 at pH 7.4) developed by Ferre et al. (36Ferre R. Badosa E. Feliu L. Planas M. Montesinos E. Bardají E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 3302-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Based on the data presented in this work, insights into the events leading to E. coli cell death after treatment with either BP100 or pepR were gained. This was achieved through the unconventional approach of bridging the microbiological properties of each AMP with some of their respective biophysical characteristics. Firstly, the question of a neutralization-mediated killing mechanism adopted by either AMP was addressed. Exploration of this concept using a standard antimicrobial activity assay and zeta potential studies demonstrated a clear correlation linking the MICs of each AMP to corresponding alterations in the E. coli surface charge. More specifically, neutralization of the bacterial surface was detected when treating E. coli with peptide concentrations close to MIC values. Visual insights into these MIC-associated events were then sought. The acquisition of AFM images of E. coli cells treated with either BP100 or pepR under varying conditions illustrated the time- and concentration-dependent antimicrobial action of both AMPs. Taken together, the biological and biophysical data acquired in this study clearly point to a critical AMP concentration, equivalent to MIC values, being necessary for E. coli membrane disruption to occur.

https://openalex.org/W2030310238,"Potassium channels embedded in cell membranes employ gates to regulate K+ current. While a specific constriction in the permeation pathway has historically been implicated in gating, recent reports suggest that the signature ion selectivity filter located in the outer membrane leaflet may be equally important. Inwardly rectifying K+ channels also control the directionality of flow, using intracellular polyamines to stem ion efflux by a valve-like action. This study presents crystallographic evidence of interdependent gates in the conduction pathway and reveals the mechanism of polyamine block. Reorientation of the intracellular domains, concomitant with activation, instigates polyamine release from intracellular binding sites to block the permeation pathway. Conformational adjustments of the slide helices, achieved by rotation of the cytoplasmic assembly relative to the pore, are directly correlated to the ion configuration in the selectivity filter. Ion redistribution occurs irrespective of the constriction, suggesting a more expansive role of the selectivity filter in gating than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2090678665,"Proline oxidase (POX) is a novel mitochondrial tumor suppressor that can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Recent studies have shown the absence of expression of POX in human cancer tissues, including renal cancer. However, the mechanism for the loss of POX remains obscure. No genetic or epigenetic variation of POX gene was found. In this study, we identified the upregulated miR-23b* in renal cancer as an important regulator of POX. Ectopic overexpression of miR-23b* in normal renal cells resulted in striking downregulation of POX, whereas POX expression increased markedly when endogenous miR-23b* was knocked down by its antagomirs in renal cancer cells. Consistent with the POX-mediated tumor suppression pathway, these antagomirs induced ROS, inhibited HIF signaling and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, we confirmed the regulation of miR-23b* on POX and its function in the DLD1 Tet-off POX cell system. Using a luciferase reporter system, we verified the direct binding of miR-23b* to the POX mRNA 3′-untranslated region. In addition, pairs of human renal carcinoma and normal tissues showed a negative correlation between miR-23b* and POX protein expression, providing its clinical corroboration. Taken together, our results suggested that miR-23b*, by targeting POX, could function as an oncogene; decreasing miR-23b* expression may prove to be an effective way of inhibiting kidney tumor growth."

Here, we report the tRNA binding to the P-site of 40 S ribosomes by a novel GTP-independent factor eIF2D isolated from mammalian cells. The binding of tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> occurs after the AUG codon finds its position in the P-site of 40 S ribosomes, the situation that takes place during initiation complex formation on the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site or on some other specific RNAs (leaderless mRNA and A-rich mRNAs with relaxed scanning dependence). Its activity in tRNA binding with 40 S subunits does not require the presence of the aminoacyl moiety. Moreover, the factor possesses the unique ability to deliver non-Met (elongator) tRNAs into the P-site of the 40 S subunit. The corresponding gene is found in all eukaryotes and includes an SUI1 domain present also in translation initiation factor eIF1. The versatility of translation initiation strategies in eukaryotes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2076047768,"Oncogenic c-Myc has been described to modulate the expression of a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs), which include miR-22; however, the mechanism through which a miRNA controls c-Myc activity remains unclear. Here we report a novel anti-c-Myc function mediated by miR-22. Ectopically expressed miR-22 inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cell lines. Microarray screening and western analyses revealed that miR-22 repressed the c-Myc-binding protein MYCBP, a positive regulator of c-Myc. Consistent with this, reporter assays showed that miR-22-mediated MYCBP gene suppression largely depends on the conserved miR-22 target site within the MYCBP 3'-untranslational region (3'UTR), implying that MYCBP mRNA is a direct miR-22 target. Depletion of MYCBP using small interfering RNA (siRNA) recapitulated the miR-22-induced anti-growth effect on tumor cells, whereas ectopically expressed MYCBP rescued cells from the growth suppression mediated by miR-22. Moreover, repression of MYCBP by miR-22 downregulated a panel of E-box-containing c-Myc target genes. Our results suggest that miR-22 acts as a tumor suppressor through direct repression of MYCBP expression and subsequent reduction of oncogenic c-Myc activities. As c-Myc inhibits the expression of miR-22, we propose a novel positive feedback loop formed by oncogenic c-Myc to accelerate cell proliferation by suppressing miR-22, a potent inhibitor of MYCBP."
https://openalex.org/W1996614613,"Recurrence is frequently associated with the acquisition of radioresistance by tumors and resulting failures in radiotherapy. We report, in this study, that long-term fractionated radiation (FR) exposures conferred radioresistance to the human tumor cells, HepG2 and HeLa with cyclin D1 overexpression. A positive feedback loop was responsible for the cyclin D1 overexpression in which constitutively active AKT was involved. AKT is known to inactivate glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), which is essential for the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1. The resulting cyclin D1 overexpression led to the forced progression of S-phase with the induction of DNA double strand breaks. Cyclin D1-dependent DNA damage activated DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which in turn activated AKT and inactivated GSK3beta, thus completing a positive feedback loop of cyclin D1 overproduction. Cyclin D1 overexpression led to the activation of DNA damage response (DDR) consisted of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Long-term FR cells repaired radiation-induced DNA damage faster than non-FR cells. Thus, acquired radioresistance of long-term FR cells was the result of alterations in DDR mediated by cyclin D1 overexpression. Inhibition of the AKT/GSK3beta/cyclin D1/Cdk4 pathway by the AKT inhibitor, Cdk4 inhibitor or cyclin D1 targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the radioresistance. Present observations give a mechanistic insight for acquired radioresistance of tumor cells by cyclin D1 overexpression, and provide novel therapeutic targets for recurrent radioresistant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1967736480,"Activating mutations in the KRAS gene are among the most prevalent genetic changes in human cancers. To identify synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cells harbouring mutant KRAS, we performed a large-scale screen in isogenic paired colon cancer cell lines that differ by a single allele of mutant KRAS using an inducible short hairpin RNA interference library. Snail2, a zinc finger transcriptional repressor encoded by the SNAI2 gene, was found to be selectively required for the long-term survival of cancer cells with mutant KRAS that have undergone epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a transdifferentiation event that is frequently seen in advanced tumours and is promoted by RAS activation. Snail2 expression is regulated by the RAS pathway and is required for EMT. Our findings support Snail2 as a possible target for the treatment of the broad spectrum of human cancers of epithelial origin with mutant RAS that have undergone EMT and are characterized by a high degree of chemoresistance and radioresistance."
https://openalex.org/W1986159981,"SLC17A1 protein (NPT1) is the first identified member of the SLC17 phosphate transporter family and mediates the transmembrane cotransport of Na(+)/P(i) in oocytes. Although this protein is believed to be a renal polyspecific anion exporter, its transport properties are not well characterized. Here, we show that proteoliposomes containing purified SLC17A1 transport various organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in an inside positive membrane potential (Deltapsi)-dependent manner. We found that NPT1 also transported urate. The uptake characteristics were similar to that of SLC17 members in its Cl(-) dependence and inhibitor sensitivity. When arginine 138, an essential amino acid residue for members of the SLC17 family such as the vesicular glutamate transporter, was specifically mutated to alanine, the resulting mutant protein was inactive in Deltapsi-dependent anion transport. Heterologously expressed and purified human NPT1 carrying the single nucleotide polymorphism mutation that is associated with increased risk of gout in humans exhibited 32% lower urate transport activity compared with the wild type protein. These results strongly suggested that NPT1 is a Cl(-)-dependent polyspecific anion exporter involved in urate excretion under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2055727614,"Chemokines are important regulators of directional cell migration and tumor metastasis. A genome-wide transcriptome array designed to uncover novel genes silenced by methylation in lung cancer identified the CXC-subfamily of chemokines. Expression of 11 of the 16 known human CXC-chemokines was increased in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC). Tumor-specific methylation leading to silencing of CXCL5, 12 and 14 was found in over 75% of primary lung adenocarcinomas and DAC treatment restored the expression of each of the silenced gene. Forced expression of CXCL14 in H23 cells, where this gene is silenced by methylation, increased cell death in vitro and dramatically reduced the in vivo growth of lung tumor xenografts through necrosis of up to 90% of the tumor mass. CXCL14 re-expression had a profound effect on the genome altering the transcription of over 1000 genes, including increased expression of 30 cell-cycle inhibitor and pro-apoptosis genes. In addition, CXCL14 methylation in sputum from asymptomatic early-stage lung cancer cases was associated with a 2.9-fold elevated risk for this disease compared with controls, substantiating its potential as a biomarker for early detection of lung cancer. Together, these findings identify CXCL14 as an important tumor suppressor gene epigenetically silenced during lung carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2148812348,"The cytosine analogues 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine are currently the most advanced drugs for epigenetic cancer therapy. Both drugs function as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and lead to the reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes. However, not much is known about their target sequence specificity and their possible side effects on normally methylated sequences such as long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1 retroelements. It has been shown that demethylation and activation of the LINE-1 antisense promoter can drive the transcription of neighbouring sequences. In this study, we show that demethylation of the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, either by treatment with DNMT inhibitors or by genetic disruption of the major DNMTs, induces the expression of an illegitimate fusion transcript between an intronic LINE-1 element and the proto-oncogene cMet (L1-cMet). Similar findings were also obtained with myeloid leukaemia cells, an established cellular model for the approved indication of azacytidine and decitabine. Interestingly, upregulation of L1-cMet transcription resulted in reduced cMet expression, which in turn led to decreased cMet receptor signalling. Our results thus provide an important paradigm for demethylation-dependent modulation of gene expression, even if the promoter of the corresponding gene is unmethylated."
https://openalex.org/W2044167411,"The authors show that a developmental shift occurs in the dimensions of the calcium domain required for vesicle endocytosis at calyx of Held terminals. After hearing onset, endocytosis at mature synapses is largely driven by calcium nanodomains. Endocytosis becomes independent of calmodulin and calcineurin and completely dependent on GTP hydrolysis. Ca2+ is thought to be essential for the exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, the manner in which Ca2+ coordinates these processes remains unclear, particularly at mature synapses. Using membrane capacitance measurements from calyx of Held nerve terminals in rats, we found that vesicle endocytosis is initiated primarily in Ca2+ nanodomains around Ca2+ channels, where exocytosis is triggered. Bulk Ca2+ outside of the domain could also be involved in endocytosis at immature synapses, although only after extensive exocytosis at more mature synapses. This bulk Ca2+-dependent endocytosis required calmodulin and calcineurin activation at immature synapses, but not at more mature synapses. Similarly, GTP-independent endocytosis, which occurred after extensive exocytosis at immature synapses, became negligible after maturation. We propose that nanodomain Ca2+ simultaneously triggers exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and that the molecular mechanisms underlying Ca2+-dependent endocytosis undergo major developmental changes at this fast central synapse."

Several factors required for specific RNA-editing events in plant mitochondria and plastids have been identified, all of them PPR proteins of the PLS subclass with a C-terminal E-domain and about half also with an additional DYW domain. Based on this information, we here probe the connection between E-PPR proteins and RNA editing in plant mitochondria. We initiated a reverse genetics screen of T-DNA insertion lines in Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated 58 of the 150 E-PPR-coding genes for a function in RNA editing. Six genes were identified to be involved in mitochondrial RNA editing at specific sites. Homozygous mutants of the five genes MEF18-MEF22 display no gross disturbance in their growth or development patterns, suggesting that the editing sites affected are not crucial at least in the greenhouse. These results show that a considerable percentage of the E-PPR proteins are involved in the functional processing of site-specific RNA editing in plant mitochondria.

IntroductionRNA editing in mitochondria of flowering plants changes 400–500 selected cytosines to uridines mostly in coding regions of mRNAs and some tRNAs (1Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The second part of the answer seems to be provided by the identification of nuclear encoded specificity factors in Arabidopsis thaliana such as MEF1, MEF9, and MEF11 (mitochondrial-editing factor (MEF) 2The abbreviations used are: MEFmitochondrial-editing factorPPRpentatricopeptide repeat proteinColColumbia.), which are required intact for correct editing of specific different sites (12Takenaka M.

This model makes several predictions, which need to be tested to correct or substantiate this connection. First, the nuclear-encoded MEF proteins must show an evolutionary diversity and a variation sufficient to recognize and target the more than 400 editing sites in plant mitochondria in, for example, A. thaliana. Secondly, the MEF proteins must be able to bind RNA and do so selectively to specific RNA sequences, the identified cis-elements. Specific RNA binding has been experimentally verified for one of the proteins required for a plastid RNA-editing event, the CRR4 protein (16Okuda K. Nakamura T. Sugita M. Shimizu T. Shikanai T. J.

These DYW-PPR proteins are extended by the about 100-amino acid long DYW region at the C terminus beyond the preceding E-domain. The mitochondrial protein MEF9 as well as several plastid RNA-editing factors do not contain the DYW C terminus and terminate with the E-domain (12Takenaka M.

Thus, all of the RNA-editing factors identified today belong to the E-class, suggesting that this E-domain is important for their function in the editing process.In this reported analysis, we, therefore, focus on this E-subgroup of the 450 PPR proteins encoded in the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis (30Andrés C. Lurin C. Small I.D. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 14-22Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Lurin C. Andrés C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyère C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J.M.

About 150 of the PPR proteins contain the E region and 87 of these also the DYW domain (19Delannoy E. Stanley W.A. Bond C.S. Small I.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Andrés C. Lurin C. Small I.D. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 14-22Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura T. Sugita M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4163-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consequently we consider the DYW-containing PPR proteins a subgroup of the E-domain-containing PPR proteins. The DYW C-terminal extension is particularly intriguing in proteins involved in organellar RNA editing in plants because it displays a signature characteristic of Zn-containing cytidine deaminases. The enzymatic activity involved in the C to U RNA editing has not yet been identified, and the DYW domain has been proposed to potentially mediate this reaction (34Rüdinger M. Polsakiewicz M. Knoop V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 1405-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Salone V. Rüdinger M. Polsakiewicz M. Hoffmann B. Groth-Malonek M. Szurek B. Small I. Knoop V. Lurin C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4132-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). On the other hand, truncated proteins without the DYW domain can still be competent in editing in vivo (36Okuda K. Hammani K. Tanz S.K. Peng L. Fukao Y. Myouga F. Motohashi R. Shinozaki K. Small I. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2010; 61: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Okuda K. Chateigner-Boutin A.L.

Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).To investigate whether more of the about 150 E-group proteins with 65 E-only and 87 DYW-E-PPR proteins are involved in RNA editing at specific sites in plant mitochondria, we here screened 58 T-DNA insertion lines of genes coding for DYW-E-PPR proteins and E-domain PPR proteins in Arabidopsis by a direct analysis for impaired RNA editing with the recently developed multiplexed SNaPshot procedure (38Takenaka M. Brennicke A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONHere we functionally assign the five PPR proteins MEF18-MEF22 to be involved in RNA editing in plant mitochondria and identify target sites for each of these proteins. The five T-DNA insertions disrupt the respective reading frames and have induced the deletion of fragments of the coding sequences (Fig. 5). The insertions in MEF18 and MEF21 are within the PPR repeats, the insert in MEF20 is just upstream of the ATG codon. These three insertions and sequence deletions appear to disable gene functions because editing is lost at their target sites. The insertion in MEF22 in the E-domain and the thus disabled partial E-domain potentially does not completely abolish the function of the mutant protein. If stably transcribed and translated, the mutant protein may still be partially functional and thus may cause the only partial reduction of editing at the target site. The insertion in the MEF19 mutant is also in the E-domain, but most likely abolishes the competence in RNA editing because no nucleotide conversion is observed at the target site of MEF19.We detected no gross detrimental phenotypic effect on plant growth and development in the homozygous T-DNA insertion lines in which no editing is seen at the target sites for MEF18-MEF21. The second finding in common for these five factors is that as yet only single targets have been identified for each of them. Both common features may be connected to the selection of homozygous and basically healthy T-DNA plants, because loss of a single editing event may be less likely to be detrimental to plant health than the elimination of several editing events. However, fully functional mitochondrial proteins specified by fully edited mRNAs may be crucial under more stressful growth conditions in the wild.Analogous observations have been reported for plastid-editing sites, several of which, although highly conserved, show no phenotypical consequences when their cognate-editing factors are disabled by T-DNA mutations (42Hammani K. Okuda K. Tanz S.K. Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Shikanai T. Small I. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3686-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These congruent findings in both organelles impact considerations underlying analyses of evolutionarily conserved editing sites and their loss in individual plant lineages (47Tillich M. Le Sy V.L. Schulerowitz K. von Haeseler A. Maier U.G. Schmitz-Linneweber C. BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The Target Sites of MEF18-MEF22 Alter Conserved Amino AcidsAll target-editing sites alter the encoded amino acid sequence; none of the events is silent. The nad4-1355 site of MEF18 alters a serine to a conserved leucine codon in the NAD4 protein, the ccb206-566-editing event of MEF19 results in encoding a conserved phenylalanine rather than a serine in CCB206, the rps4-226 site requires MEF20 to change a proline amino acid to a serine residue codon at amino acid residue 76 in RPS4. The cox3-257 site targeted by MEF21 changes a serine amino acid to a conserved phenylalanine residue at amino acid 86 in COX3 and MEF22 enhances editing at nad3-149 to code for a conserved phenylalanine rather than a serine.At most of these positions, all land plants including the moss and the liverwort incorporate the amino acid into the protein specified after the respective editing event in Arabidopsis (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that these conserved residues are important for proper function. From this high degree of conservation, one would expect impaired proteins synthesized from mRNA intermediates unedited at these positions and thus detectable physiological consequences on the growth pattern and phenotypes of the plants. The apparently normal growth and absence of any gross malformation in the greenhouse is similar to the phenotypes seen for MEF1 and MEF9 (12Takenaka M. Plant Physiol. 2010; 152: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Zehrmann A. Verbitskiy D. van der Merwe J.A. Brennicke A. Takenaka M. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the criterion of conservation of an amino acid (and an underlying editing event) between different plant species is not a straightforward indicator of functional importance.The Five Identified MEF Proteins Have Different CompositionsThe predicted gene structures of the five PPR proteins and their annotated T-DNA insertion sites show that only one, MEF22, belongs to the DYW subclass of the E-PPR proteins. The other four predicted PPR proteins, MEF18-MEF21, are also members of the E-group, but do not contain the C-terminal DYW extension (Fig. 5). The five proteins MEF18-MEF22 show very little structural similarity in the order and sizes of the various PPRs. MEF20 is, with about 8 repeats, the shortest, MEF18 with 17 predicted repeats the longest. These two proteins display a rather degenerated E-domain, in which only a C-terminal part is fairly well conserved, whereas the region between the C-terminal discernible PPR and this conserved E-internal region displays little similarity. Furthermore, MEF18 and MEF20 terminate within the actual E-domain just beyond the conserved E-internal region. MEF19 is only few amino acids longer than MEF18 and MEF20 and of the same size as MEF9 (12Takenaka M. Plant Physiol. 2010; 152: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The P, L2, and S repeats (nomenclature according to Ref. 48Rivals E. Bruyère C. Toffano-Nioche C. Lecharny A. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) just upstream of the E-domain are much better conserved between these and the other MEF proteins than any of the further N-terminal PPR repeats. Assignments of further PPR proteins to the functional group of RNA-editing factors will show which of these similar features is a characteristic feature of MEF-PPR proteins distinguishing these from non-MEF-PPRs. Recently, a PPR protein of the P subfamily without E- or DYW domain has been found to influence RNA-editing levels, in fact to lower the percentage of edited steady state mRNAs for a ribosomal protein (49Doniwa Y. Ueda M. Ueta M. Wada A. Kadowaki K. Tsutsumi N. Gene. 2010; 454: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).When searching the genomic databases of other plant species for orthologs of the five proteins MEF18-MEF22, an interesting distribution emerges for MEF20: the three fully sequenced dicot plants Arabidopsis, Brassica oleracea, and Vitis vinifera encode clearly assigned orthologs and show this editing event at the mitochondrial rps4-226 site. In rice, where the mitochondrial genome already encodes a T residue, no ortholog of MEF20 is detected. This finding may suggest that since this editing event is not required in rice, the dedicated factor MEF20 has been lost from the genome. This scenario would support the assumption that MEF20 is required only for this single editing event in the mitochondrial transcriptome of Arabidopsis.On the other hand, orthologs of MEF22 are detected in all four flowering plants, although Vitis does not require this editing event since a U corresponding to the editing site can be directly transcribed from the mitochondrial genomic sequence. In Arabidopsis, we observe that disruption of MEF22 only lowers editing at this site, and there may be another target site not yet identified that requires this factor in Arabidopsis and also in the grape. Alternatively, if stably transcribed and translated, the mutant protein of mef22 may still be partially functional and thus may cause only partial reduction of the editing at the target site. Orthologs can be found for MEF18, 19, and 21 in the four vascular plants, with the most similar grapevine PPR protein varying more from Arabidopsis MEF18 than the orthologs in the other plants.Further E-class PPR Proteins May Be Required for Functionally Important Editing EventsThe selection criterion of having yielded viable homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants will have preselected for editing events with minor biochemical and physiological impact. The other about 90 E-class PPR proteins may be required for editing reactions resulting in amino acid changes with major structural and functional consequences. This may be the reason why no homozygous lines had been annotated for these other genes. A number of the E-class proteins will not be involved in RNA editing at all but in other functionally important RNA-processing steps (20Schmitz-Linneweber C. Small I.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 663-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 27Shikanai T. Cell. Mol.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Nevertheless many more E-class PPR proteins, also within the group analyzed, may be involved in mitochondrial-editing sites. Several lines of reasoning contribute to this assumption: Foremost, one-third of the T-DNA lines investigated here are annotated to have a T-DNA insertion outside of the actual reading frames and may not be affected in the function of the respective PPR protein. Likewise not or little affected may be proteins from genes with insertions near their C termini (14Verbitskiy D. Zehrmann A. van der Merwe J.A. Brennicke A. Takenaka M. Plant J. 2010; 61: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further factors may have been missed if homozygous seeds were not present, and the original seed batches contained only heterozygous seeds. Other, small effects of specific PPR proteins like that observed for MEF22 at nad3-149 may have escaped our screen. Furthermore, we screened only 2/3 of the editing sites in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial transcriptome and thus will have missed the E-class PPR proteins involved in the editing events that are not included.Outside of the T-DNA insertion lines of genes for E-class PPR proteins annotated as yielding homozygous plants, there will be more of such proteins involved in RNA editing in plant mitochondria. These other factors may affect more than one editing site as observed for some of the previously identified plant mitochondrial-editing factors MEF1, MEF11, and OGR1 (13Tang J. Kobayashi K. Suzuki M. Matsumoto S. Muranaka T. Plant J. 2010; 61: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Verbitskiy D. Zehrmann A. van der Merwe J.A. Brennicke A. Takenaka M.

Plant J. 2009; 59: 738-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chances are that knock-out mutants of such factors will accumulate additive effects from disturbances of several unedited mitochondrially encoded proteins and therefore will show defects in their physiology even in the greenhouse. These genes will then not be amenable to identification by T-DNA insertions, which abolish gene function, but will require the analysis of more mild mutations such as the EMS mutants we are investigating in parallel (38Takenaka M. Brennicke A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These may allow access to such further trans-factors dedicated to editing sites, which need to be processed for proper mitochondrial function. IntroductionRNA editing in mitochondria of flowering plants changes 400–500 selected cytosines to uridines mostly in coding regions of mRNAs and some tRNAs (1Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This model makes several predictions, which need to be tested to correct or substantiate this connection. First, the nuclear-encoded MEF proteins must show an evolutionary diversity and a variation sufficient to recognize and target the more than 400 editing sites in plant mitochondria in, for example, A. thaliana. Secondly, the MEF proteins must be able to bind RNA and do so selectively to specific RNA sequences, the identified cis-elements. Specific RNA binding has been experimentally verified for one of the proteins required for a plastid RNA-editing event, the CRR4 protein (16Okuda K. Nakamura T. Sugita M. Shimizu T. Shikanai T. J.

These DYW-PPR proteins are extended by the about 100-amino acid long DYW region at the C terminus beyond the preceding E-domain. The mitochondrial protein MEF9 as well as several plastid RNA-editing factors do not contain the DYW C terminus and terminate with the E-domain (12Takenaka M.

Thus, all of the RNA-editing factors identified today belong to the E-class, suggesting that this E-domain is important for their function in the editing process.In this reported analysis, we, therefore, focus on this E-subgroup of the 450 PPR proteins encoded in the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis (30Andrés C.

About 150 of the PPR proteins contain the E region and 87 of these also the DYW domain (19Delannoy E. Stanley W.A. Bond C.S. Small I.D. Biochem. Soc.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4163-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consequently we consider the DYW-containing PPR proteins a subgroup of the E-domain-containing PPR proteins. The DYW C-terminal extension is particularly intriguing in proteins involved in organellar RNA editing in plants because it displays a signature characteristic of Zn-containing cytidine deaminases. The enzymatic activity involved in the C to U RNA editing has not yet been identified, and the DYW domain has been proposed to potentially mediate this reaction (34Rüdinger M. Polsakiewicz M. Knoop V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 1405-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Salone V. Rüdinger M. Polsakiewicz M. Hoffmann B. Groth-Malonek M. Szurek B. Small I. Knoop V. Lurin C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4132-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). On the other hand, truncated proteins without the DYW domain can still be competent in editing in vivo (36Okuda K.

https://openalex.org/W2170235750,"Topoisomerase IIα (topoIIα) is an essential mammalian enzyme that topologically modifies DNA and is required for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Previous research suggests that inhibition of topoII decatenatory activity triggers a G2 checkpoint response, which delays mitotic entry because of insufficient decatenation of daughter chromatids. Here we examine the effects of both topoIIα and topoIIβ on decatenatory activity in cell extracts, DNA damage and decatenation G2 checkpoint function, and the frequencies of p16INK4A allele loss and gain. In diploid human fibroblast lines, depletion of topoIIα by small-interfering RNA was associated with severely reduced decatenatory activity, delayed progression from G2 into mitosis and insensitivity to G2 arrest induced by the topoII catalytic inhibitor ICRF-193. Furthermore, interphase nuclei of topoIIα-depleted cells showed increased frequencies of losses and gains of the tumor suppressor genetic locus p16INK4A. This study shows that the topoIIα protein is required for decatenation G2 checkpoint function, and inactivation of decatenation and the decatenation G2 checkpoint leads to abnormal chromosome segregation and genomic instability."

In this report we describe new roles for glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin1 (GRX1) in Cu homeostasis through their regulation of Cu-ATPase activity. GRX1 is a thiol oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reversible reduction of GSH-mixed disulfides to their respective sulfhydryls (deglutathionylation).

The data support our hypothesis that the Cu-ATPases serve as substrates for Cu-dependent GRX1-mediated deglutathionylation. This in turn liberates the Cu-ATPase cysteinyl thiol groups for Cu binding and transport. GSH depletion experiments led to reversible inhibition of the Cu-ATPases that correlated with effects on intracellular Cu levels and GRX1 activity.

IntroductionCopper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for all organisms because it is an indispensable catalytic and structural cofactor for many essential enzymes and proteins (1Bertini I. Cavallaro G. McGreevy K.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2010; 254: 506-524Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, organisms have evolved mechanisms that regulate intracellular Cu levels to support physiological requirements while preventing a toxic buildup of Cu that would lead to oxidative damage. This control is mediated by carrier proteins for the uptake, delivery, and efflux of Cu (2Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25461-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of Cu homeostasis can lead to a variety of pathologies that include the genetically inherited Cu transport disorders, Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively, and is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (3Danks D.M.

They comprise eight transmembrane domains and an N terminus with six Cu-binding domains. Each Cu-binding domain is ∼70 amino acids in length and contains the highly conserved Cu-binding GMXCXXC motif (where X is any amino acid). The Cu-binding domains can each bind one Cu(I) ion that is coordinated by the thiol groups from the two cysteine residues at each site (7Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S.

With elevated Cu levels they undergo a steady-state shift to vesicular compartments in close proximity to the basolateral (ATP7A) or apical (ATP7B) surface for Cu efflux from the cell (10Cater M.A. La Fontaine S.

Mutation of the corresponding genes in Menkes disease (ATP7A) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 309400) and Wilson disease (ATP7B) (OMIM 277900) leads to systemic Cu deficiency and liver Cu toxicosis, respectively (3Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). The expression and activity of ATP7A and ATP7B are regulated by a variety of physiological stimuli in addition to Cu as well as posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions (13van den Berghe P.V. Klomp L.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2010; 15: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14La Fontaine S. Ackland M.L. Mercer J.F.B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Recently, we showed that glutaredoxin1 (GRX1) interacted with the N terminus of ATP7A and ATP7B, and this interaction required Cu and the CXXC motifs (15Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GRX1 is a member of the thiol oxidoreductase family of proteins and specifically reverses S-glutathionylation of protein substrates (16Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Holmgren A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); that is, it catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds formed between protein thiol groups and glutathione (GSH), which are often referred to as protein-SSG mixed disulfides. GRX1 is a 12-kDa protein present within the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space of mitochondria, has a GSH-binding site, and is dependent on GSH for its activity. GRX1 also has two redox-active cysteines in a conserved active site motif, CPYC, and it uses one or both cysteines to catalyze deglutathionylation (for review, see 16Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Holmgren A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 17Herrero E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cell Mol.

Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1059-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Glutathionylation is a reversible posttranslational modification of cysteinyl thiols that is emerging as an important and widespread means of redox regulation and signaling, comparable with protein phosphorylation (for review, see 19Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S. Sabens E.A. Shelton M.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 20Shelton M.D. Mieyal J.J. Mol. Cells. 2008; 25: 332-346PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of oxidative stress, glutathionylation of proteins is increased and serves as a protective mechanism to prevent irreversible oxidation of thiol groups (e.g. 21Gilge J.L. Fisher M. Chai Y.-C. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Eaton P. Wright N. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1549-1560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Glutathionylation thus can alter protein function, either activating or temporarily inactivating proteins. Although mechanisms of deglutathionylation have been well characterized, mechanisms of protein-SSG formation have yet to be resolved and may occur spontaneously or via enzymatic reactions (19Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S. Sabens E.A. Shelton M.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).GRX1 interaction with the cysteine-based, Cu-binding motifs in the N-terminal region of ATP7A/7B implicated glutathionylation of the Cu-ATPases as a regulatory or protective modification. We propose that at least some of the Cu-binding domain cysteines may be glutathionylated and that GRX1 deglutathionylates the cysteines to allow Cu ions to coordinate with the thiol groups for subsequent transport (Fig. 1A). Here, we confirm the interaction between the endogenous Cu-ATPases and GRX1 from mammalian cells and provide support for our hypothesis that glutathionylation and GRX1-mediated deglutathionylation regulate the redox state of the Cu-ATPase cysteines and their access to Cu. This study reveals new roles for GSH and GRX1 in regulating ATP7A/7B and thus Cu homeostasis.DISCUSSIONThe data presented demonstrate new key roles for GSH and GRX1 in regulating the activity of ATP7A and ATP7B, and hence Cu homeostasis. This regulation is through posttranslational mechanisms, glutathionylation/deglutathionylation that are involved in the regulation of an increasing number of proteins but for the first time have been implicated in the regulation of Cu-trafficking proteins. The model under consideration in this study was based on the demonstrated interaction between GRX1 and the Cu-binding N terminus of ATP7A and ATP7B (Ref. 15Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and this study). According to this model, at least some of the thiol groups of the Cu-binding cysteines within the CXXC motifs of ATP7A/7B are glutathionylated and consequently, unavailable to bind Cu. GRX1 would deglutathionylate the ATP7A/7B-SSG mixed disulfide, releasing the reduced ATP7A/7B-SH protein that can then coordinate Cu(I) ions for subsequent transport (Fig. 1A). The results from this study support this model.Cu(I) binding is favored by sulfur donor ligands such as the cysteine thiolate and Cu coordination to cysteinyl thiols has been well documented among Cu-sensing and Cu-trafficking proteins (36Davis A.V. O'Halloran T.V. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, cytosolic Cu is trafficked and maintained as Cu(I) complexed to proteins with cysteine-rich motifs such as CXXC. Because of high levels of small thiol-containing molecules such as GSH, overall, the eukaryotic cytosol is a reducing environment in which the cysteine residues of Cu-trafficking proteins are thought to be reduced and available to bind Cu(I) (36Davis A.V. O'Halloran T.V. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the susceptibility of thiol groups to oxidative modifications makes them prime candidates for posttranslational modifications such as glutathionylation, either for redox regulation and signaling or for protection during conditions of oxidative stress (19Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S. Sabens E.A. Shelton M.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 38Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Ion translocators are among the many proteins regulated by thiol oxidation (39Figtree G.A. Liu C.-C. Bibert S. Hamilton E.J. Garcia A. White C.N. Chia K.K.M. Cornelius F. Geering K. Rasmussen H.H. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the reducing environment of the cytosol, glutathionylation of some proteins persists, whereas others require a stimulus (19Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S. Sabens E.A. Shelton M.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 20Shelton M.D. Mieyal J.J. Mol. Cells. 2008; 25: 332-346PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the cysteine residues of some redox-sensitive proteins such as enzymes and receptors may exist as the thiolate anion that is particularly reactive and susceptible to glutathionylation (41Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 325-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).We demonstrated an interaction between endogenous GRX1 and the Cu-ATPase proteins, which suggested some basal degree of glutathionylation of the Cu-ATPases under normal conditions, as observed with other proteins (38Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Figtree G.A. Liu C.-C. Bibert S. Hamilton E.J. Garcia A. White C.N. Chia K.K.M. Cornelius F. Geering K. Rasmussen H.H. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite the high expression level of endogenous GRX1 detected in M17 and HepG2 cells, the amount of co-precipitated GRX1 was consistently low and difficult to detect (Fig. 1B). This observation was not surprising because GRX1 has a widespread role in the cell and is likely to be associated with a large number of cellular proteins in addition to the Cu-ATPases. This result also was consistent with the rapid, transient nature of glutathionylation/deglutathionylation (38Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) that would permit constitutive Cu translocation by the Cu-ATPases, for example into the TGN lumen for metallation of Cu-dependent enzymes.The increased ATP7A-GRX1 interaction with increased Cu levels and the decreased interaction with Cu depletion were consistent with our model and suggested that GRX1 interaction with the Cu-ATPases was tied to the need for Cu binding and transport. The increased GRX1 co-precipitation when elevated Cu levels were combined with depleted GSH levels was unexpected (Fig. 1Cii). However, a similar observation was made for apoptosis signal regulating kinase1 (ASK1) where the dissociation of GRX1 from ASK1 was inhibited by BSO under conditions of oxidative stress and hence was dependent on GSH (42Song J.J.

In the current study, conceivably, with elevated Cu levels GRX1 was recruited to ATP7A, but with depleted GSH levels, GRX1 was ineffective at deglutathionylating ATP7A and was unable to dissociate from it. This nonproductive interaction of GRX1 with ATP7A was consistent with the disrupted Cu-ATPase trafficking and Cu export under these conditions, which led to increased Cu accumulation in cells (Fig. 4A).Consistent with our model, ATP7A glutathionylation was decreased following exposure of cells to elevated Cu levels. This observation was likely due to enhanced deglutathionylation by GRX1 to allow Cu binding and was consistent with the increased GRX1 interaction seen with Cu excess. Physiological Cu levels are in the range of 1–20 μm (43Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). The Cu-loading conditions used in this study were chosen to represent near physiological levels (20 and 50 μm) or Cu excess (200 μm), the latter designed to obtain maximal responses of the Cu-ATPases. For both ATP7A and ATP7B, trafficking has been demonstrated at high Cu levels (≥200 μm) and at physiological Cu levels (even as low as 1 μm Cu) by ours and other groups (10Cater M.A. La Fontaine S. Shield K. Deal Y. Mercer J.F. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Nyasae L. Bustos R. Braiterman L. Eipper B. Hubbard A. Am. J.

A precise and key role of the Cu-ATPases is to expel excess Cu to prevent and/or alleviate Cu-mediated oxidative stress, and they achieve this by trafficking to the cell periphery. This study reveals that the Cu-ATPases are redox-regulated in a Cu-dependent manner; that is, that the level of Cu-ATPase glutathionylation progressively decreases with increasing Cu, and this deglutathionylation allows Cu binding to and activation of the Cu-ATPases to traffic to expel the excess Cu. So whether at physiological Cu levels or in Cu excess, the trafficking of the Cu-ATPases is not a nonspecific effect of oxidative stress, but rather, an elegant and specific mechanism regulated by their redox state, which in turn is determined mechanistically (rather than nonspecifically) by Cu-dependent GRX1-mediated deglutathionylation. Up to a point, the greater the Cu load, the more pronounced are these effects.GSH depletion and subsequent recovery experiments linked GSH with the ability of the Cu-ATPases to traffic and mediate Cu export. A recent report that BSO-mediated GSH depletion down-regulated the Cu importer CTR1 (45Chen H.H.W. Song I.-S. Hossain A. Choi M.-K. Yamane Y. Liang Z.D. Lu J. Wu L.Y. Siddik Z.H. Klomp L.W.J. Savaraj N. Kuo M.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggested that the Cu accumulation seen here in +Cu/+BSO was not due to enhanced Cu uptake. There are three possible explanations for our observations that may not be mutually exclusive.First, the lack of Cu-ATPase trafficking and Cu accumulation may represent the effects of GSH depletion on other proteins required for Cu-ATPase activity, such as the Cu chaperone ATOX1 and/or other trafficking proteins (5La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The formation of a yeast Cu(I)-bridged Atx1 dimer of high affinity for Cu(I) required GSH (47Miras R. Morin I. Jacquin O. Cuillel M. Guillain F. Mintz E. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), prompting the suggestion that the Cu(I)·GSH complex is the major source of Cu(I) for Atx1. Hence, it is plausible that GSH depletion disrupted ATOX1-mediated Cu delivery to the Cu-ATPases.Second, potentially GSH depletion directly impacted GRX1-mediated deglutathionylation of the Cu-ATPases because GRX1 requires GSH for activity. Under the same conditions, GRX1 activity was reduced, and its recovery on return to normal growth conditions corresponded with enhanced GSH levels, restoration of Cu-ATPase trafficking, and Cu export. Whether the magnitude of the effect on GRX1 activity was sufficient to account for the effects on Cu-ATPase activity is not clear. With reduced GSH, GRX1 may use other cellular reducing agents for its deglutathionylating activity (48Raghavachari N. Krysan K. Xing K. Lou M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1002-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 49Terada T. Hara T. Yazawa H. Mizoguchi T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). A direct involvement of GRX1 in facilitating Cu export was confirmed by GRX1 knockdown, which led to an increase in Cu accumulation following Cu supplementation.Finally, under physiological conditions, reversible S-glutathionylation of protein thiols plays a role in redox signaling and regulates protein activity and function. During moderate oxidative stress, protein glutathionylation increases globally and is associated with reduced GSH levels. This represents a storage mechanism of GSH inside the cell and a means of protecting sensitive protein thiols against irreversible oxidation (often at the expense of temporary loss of protein function) (38Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). If the +BSO/+Cu conditions in this study constituted moderate oxidative stress (because the effects were recoverable), then increased glutathionylation of the Cu-ATPases with associated temporary loss of function may explain the lack of trafficking and Cu accumulation. It also would explain the inverse relationship between Cu and GSH (Fig. 5) and the recovery of Cu export as GSH levels increase, likely due to restoration of Cu-ATPase function following the reversal of glutathionylation.GSH creates a redox buffer in cells and is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant. Inside the cell, Cu is bound by GSH and transferred to the metallothioneins for storage and detoxification (50Freedman J.H. Ciriolo M.R. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5598-5605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51White A.R. Cappai R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 52Freedman J.H. Peisach J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Cu chaperones (ATOX1 and COX17) and GSH also may form an exchangeable Cu-binding pool (53Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Kozyreva T. Zovo K. Palumaa P. Nature. 2010; 465: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In the current study, with depleted GSH, the location and the form of the accumulated Cu are not clear. Potentially, metallothioneins may be up-regulated (46Mattie M.D. Freedman J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C293-C301Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and bind and sequester some of the Cu.The observations reported in this study are likely to arise from complex interactions among Cu, GSH, and GRX1 as well as other factors in the cell. However, the data clearly show that GSH and GRX1 and hence glutathionylation and deglutathionylation are important in regulating Cu-ATPase activity in a manner that is dependent on intracellular Cu levels. This study, therefore, provides important new insight into the expanding cellular role of GRX1 and has identified a new key player in intracellular Cu homeostasis. IntroductionCopper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for all organisms because it is an indispensable catalytic and structural cofactor for many essential enzymes and proteins (1Bertini I. Cavallaro G. McGreevy K.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2010; 254: 506-524Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, organisms have evolved mechanisms that regulate intracellular Cu levels to support physiological requirements while preventing a toxic buildup of Cu that would lead to oxidative damage. This control is mediated by carrier proteins for the uptake, delivery, and efflux of Cu (2Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25461-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of Cu homeostasis can lead to a variety of pathologies that include the genetically inherited Cu transport disorders, Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively, and is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (3Danks D.M.

Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2010; 15: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).The Cu transport proteins ATP7A and ATP7B are members of the P1B subfamily of the P-type ATPases and are key regulators of systemic Cu levels in mammals (for review, see 5La Fontaine S.

Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Through ATP-dependent catalytic activity they transport Cu across cellular membranes. They comprise eight transmembrane domains and an N terminus with six Cu-binding domains. Each Cu-binding domain is ∼70 amino acids in length and contains the highly conserved Cu-binding GMXCXXC motif (where X is any amino acid). The Cu-binding domains can each bind one Cu(I) ion that is coordinated by the thiol groups from the two cysteine residues at each site (7Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S.

With elevated Cu levels they undergo a steady-state shift to vesicular compartments in close proximity to the basolateral (ATP7A) or apical (ATP7B) surface for Cu efflux from the cell (10Cater M.A. La Fontaine S.

Mutation of the corresponding genes in Menkes disease (ATP7A) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 309400) and Wilson disease (ATP7B) (OMIM 277900) leads to systemic Cu deficiency and liver Cu toxicosis, respectively (3Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). The expression and activity of ATP7A and ATP7B are regulated by a variety of physiological stimuli in addition to Cu as well as posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions (13van den Berghe P.V. Klomp L.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2010; 15: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14La Fontaine S. Ackland M.L. Mercer J.F.B. Int. J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2147370015,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has shown tremendous potential for understanding the mechanisms of reprogramming and creating applications in the realms of agriculture, therapeutics, and regenerative medicine, although the efficiency of reprogramming is still low. Somatic nucleus reprogramming is triggered in the short time after transfer into recipient cytoplasm, and therefore, this period is regarded as a key stage for optimizing SCNT. Here we report that CBHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, modifies the acetylation status of somatic nuclei and increases the developmental potential of mouse cloned embryos to reach pre- and post-implantation stages. Furthermore, the cloned embryos treated by CBHA displayed higher efficiency in the derivation of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cell lines by promoting outgrowths. More importantly, CBHA increased blastocyst quality compared with trichostatin A, another prevalent histone deacetylase inhibitor reported previously. Use of CBHA should improve the productivity of SCNT for a variety of research and clinical applications, and comparisons of cells with different levels of pluripotency and treated with CBHA versus trichostatin A will facilitate studies of the mechanisms of reprogramming."

The aim of the present study was to establish whether the associated depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ triggers sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Samples of vastus medialis muscle were obtained from patients undergoing assessment for MH susceptibility using the in vitro contracture test. Single fibers were mechanically skinned, and confocal microscopy was used to detect changes in [Ca2+] either within the resealed t-system ([Ca2+]t-sys) or within the cytosol. In normal fibers, halothane (0.5 mm) failed to initiate SR Ca2+ release or Ca2+t-sys depletion. However, in MH-susceptible (MHS) fibers, halothane induced both SR Ca2+ release and Ca2+t-sys depletion, consistent with SOCE. In some MHS fibers, halothane-induced SR Ca2+ release took the form of a propagated wave, which was temporally coupled to a wave of Ca2+t-sys depletion. SOCE was potently inhibited by “extracellular” application of a STIM1 antibody trapped within the t-system but not when the antibody was denatured by heating. In conclusion, (i) in human MHS muscle, SR Ca2+ depletion induced by a level of volatile anesthetic within the clinical range is sufficient to induce SOCE, which is tightly coupled to SR Ca2+ release; (ii) sarcolemmal STIM1 has an important role in regulating SOCE; and (iii) sustained SOCE from an effectively infinite extracellular Ca2+ pool may contribute to the maintained rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] that underlies MH.

Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the role of this Ca2+ influx mechanism remains uncertain. SOCE has typically been studied using protocols that involve caffeine-induced activation of RyR1 and/or inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase to induce a profound depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ (1Launikonis B.S.

However, under physiological conditions, the amount of Ca2+ released during a tetanic contraction is typically <10% of the total SR Ca2+ content (4Posterino G.S. Lamb G.D. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Launikonis B.S. Zhou J. Royer L. Shannon T.R. Brum G. Ríos E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This suggests that SOCE is unlikely to have a significant role in Ca2+ homeostasis during exercise of moderate intensity. SOCE might, however, be activated during intensive exercise leading to fatigue (7Zhao X. Yoshida M. Brotto L. Takeshima H. Weisleder N. Hirata Y. Nosek T.M. Ma J. Brotto M. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), where SR luminal Ca2+ declines (8Kabbara A.A. Allen D.G. J.

Consistent with this possibility, a reduced capacity for SOCE has been linked to impaired fatigue resistance in aged murine skeletal muscle (10Zhao X. Weisleder N. Thornton A. Oppong Y. Campbell R.

Another possibility not yet considered is that SOCE might contribute to the pathological rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] that underlies human malignant hyperthermia (MH). In most cases of MH, susceptibility is conferred by mutations in the gene encoding RyR1 (RYR1, chromosome 19q13.1) (11MacLennan D.H. Duff C. Zorzato F. Fujii J. Phillips M. Korneluk R.G. Frodis W. Britt B.A. Worton R.G. Nature. 1990; 343: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12McCarthy T.V. Healy J.M. Heffron J.J. Lehane M. Deufel T. Lehmann-Horn F. Farrall M. Johnson K. Nature. 1990; 343: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). During an MH episode, activation of RyR1 by a volatile anesthetic induces SR Ca2+ release, muscle contracture, and a potentially fatal rise in core body temperature. Given this established sequence of events, it is generally assumed that the rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] during MH solely reflects Ca2+ efflux from the SR. However, activation of RyR1 and consequent depletion of SR Ca2+ might also induce SOCE, thereby triggering a sustained Ca2+ influx from an effectively infinite extracellular pool. Interestingly, the involvement of extracellular Ca2+ in MH is suggested by findings that the anesthetic-induced contracture during the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) is markedly reduced in solutions lacking extracellular Ca2+ (13Adnet P.J. Krivosic-Horber R.M. Adamantidis M.M. Reyford H. Cordonnier C. Haudecoeur G. Anesthesiology. 1991; 75: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Fletcher J.E. Huggins F.J. Rosenberg H. Can. J. Anaesth. 1990; 37: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, this observation is inconclusive because reduced binding of extracellular Ca2+ to the dihydropyridine receptor has been shown to inhibit pharmacological activation of RyR1 independently from Ca2+ entry (15Brum G. Ríos E. Stéfani E. J. Physiol. 1988; 398: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and thus the role of SOCE in human MH remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to establish whether SOCE is activated by volatile anesthetic exposure in human MH-susceptible (MHS) skeletal muscle. Experiments were done on normal (MHN) or MHS vastus medialis muscle obtained from patients undergoing MH diagnosis. Fibers were mechanically skinned, and confocal microscopy was used to detect changes in [Ca2+] within the sealed t-system or within the cytosol, using fluo-5N or fluo-3, respectively. The data provide the first evidence of SOCE in adult human skeletal muscle and show that clinically relevant levels of volatile anesthetic can induce Ca2+ influx, secondary to a submaximal SR Ca2+ depletion in MHS but not in MHN fibers. The characteristics of SOCE in human skeletal muscle and the possible involvement of sarcolemmal STIM1 in the Ca2+ influx mechanism are addressed. Samples of vastus medialis muscle were obtained by open biopsy from patients attending for MH diagnosis at St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK. Approximately 1 g of muscle was removed for use in the IVCT. With institutional Research Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent, an additional bundle (0.2 g) was taken to provide material for mechanically skinned muscle experiments. All procedures were done according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The IVCT provided the primary method of categorizing tissue as MHN or MHS, according to the criteria for MH research of the European MH Group (16The European Malignant Hyperpyrexia GroupBr. J. Anaesth. 1984; 56: 1267-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This ensures a high sensitivity and specificity of the MHS diagnosis (98 and 94% respectively)(17Ording H.

With institutional review board approval, all patients consented to provide a blood sample for DNA analysis. DNA was extracted from whole blood, and RYR1 mutation analysis was conducted (18Robinson R. Carpenter D. Shaw M.A. Halsall J. Hopkins P. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The MHS samples used in this study originated from 13 patients (supplemental Table 1). 11 of the samples were from patients with one of 34 recurrent RYR1 mutations (supplemental Table 2). The mutations were distributed among three hot spot regions (see the legend of supplemental Table 1 for details). Muscle samples were placed in paraffin oil to displace the extracellular fluid before isolation and mechanical skinning of individual fibers with fine forceps. Skinned fibers were suspended in a bath with an “internal” solution designed to mimic the intracellular environment (see below). Vastus medialis is of mixed fiber type, and Sr2+ sensitivity was used to classify the fibers as type 1 or type 2 (19Lynch G.S. Stephenson D.G. Williams D.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Most preparations did not generate tension at negative logarithm (base 10) of the molar concentration of Sr2+ 5.2, confirming that most fibers selected for skinning were type-2. Preparations generating tension at negative logarithm (base 10) of the molar concentration of Sr2+ 5.2 were excluded from the study. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK). A basic internal solution was prepared comprising (in mm): 50 HDTA; 8 ATP; 37 Na+; 126 K+; 10 phosphocreatine; 0.1 EGTA; 90 HEPES. The free [Mg2+] was adjusted to 0.8 mm by the addition of MgO. The free [Ca2+] was 60 nm. In most experiments, 50 μm n-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) was added to inhibit Ca2+ activation of the myofilaments (20Cheung A. Dantzig J.A. Hollingworth S. Baylor S.M. Goldman Y.E. Mitchison T.J. Straight A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and associated movement. All experiments were done at room temperature (20–22 °C), pH 7.1. A modified Tyrode's “external” solution was used, which comprised (in mm): 140.3 NaCl; 2.48 KCl; 1.5 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 5 HEPES; 5 glucose; and 5 sodium pyruvate. A halothane stock solution was prepared in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1%. Once prepared, solutions with halothane were contained within airtight syringes with zero dead space to prevent vaporization (21Duke A.M. Hopkins P.M. Halsal J.P. Steele D.S. Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Stock fluo-5N and fluo-3 (Biotium, Hayward, CA) solutions (1 m) were prepared in deionized water. In some experiments, a STIM1 antibody (20 μg/ml; BD Biosciences, Dorset, UK) was introduced into the t-system before skinning. This antibody targets the extracellular N terminus of STIM1 within the plasma membrane (22Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). MHN muscle samples were fractionated using detergent-free methods (23Calaghan S. Kozera L. White E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2008; 45: 88-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, peripheral membrane proteins were extracted in 500 mm Na2CO3 containing 0.5 mm EGTA and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), homogenized, sonicated (three times each for 20 s at full power), and layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (45–35-5%). 12 fractions were collected following centrifugation for 17 h (280,000 × g) at 4 °C. STIM1 (610954; BD Biosciences), caveolin-3 (610420; BD Biosciences), and β-adaptin (610382; BD Biosciences) were measured by Western blotting following SDS-PAGE. As described recently (24Edwards J.N. Murphy R.M. Cully T.R. von Wegner F. Friedrich O. Launikonis B.S. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the STIM1 antibody identified additional bands at two additional bands at ∼50 and ∼42 kDa in human muscle (not shown). Consequently, although extracellular application of the STIM1 antibody produced a striated pattern consistent with binding to the t-system (supplemental Fig. 1), this finding should be interpreted with caution. Mechanically skinned muscle fibers were mounted in a shallow bath with a glass coverslip base as described previously (25Duke A.M. Steele D.S. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The experimental bath was placed on the stage of an S200 Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Surrey, UK). Muscle fibers were viewed via ×40 Fluor objective (Nikon CF Fluor, NA 0.75). A confocal laser-scanning unit (Cellmap, Bio-Rad, Herts, UK) was attached to the side port of the microscope. Fluorophores were excited with the 488-nm line of a diode laser and emitted fluorescence was measured at >515 nm. In most experiments, the system was configured with a “signal-enhancing lens system” in the light path, which improves detection efficiency while slightly reducing confocality (50Reichelt S. Amos W.B. Microsc. Anal. 2001; 86: 9-11Google Scholar). This configuration minimizes bleaching and allows more prolonged scanning of live cells. When fibers are mechanically skinned under oil, the necks of the t-tubules close off at the periphery, thereby trapping the extracellular fluid within the resealed t-system (1Launikonis B.S. Barnes M. Stephenson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2941-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the cytosolic space becomes an extension of the bathing solution. There was no apparent difference in susceptibility to damage between MHS and MHN fibers. Changes in [Ca2+] within the t-system were detected using fluo-5N, which was trapped within the t-system using one of two methods. In the first method, a thin film of external solution containing fluo-5N was introduced at the interface between the fiber and the surrounding oil (1Launikonis B.S. Barnes M. Stephenson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2941-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), allowing the dye to enter the t-system before mechanical skinning and resealing. Supplemental Fig. 2A shows a confocal x-y image (average of four frames) obtained from a human MHN fiber, which was skinned using this method. As indicated by the line profile, the characteristic “M” pattern associated with the t-tubule arrangement in mammalian muscle is clearly visible (26Launikonis B.S. Stephenson D.G. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In other figures shown in this study, the t-tubule pattern is typically less distinct. This is because the frames were not averaged and because of slight movement of the fiber despite the presence of n-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide and the use of the signal-enhancing lens system. In some experiments, an alternative method was used, which exploits the tendency for fluorophores to be transported from the cytosol to the extracellular space (27Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, skinned fibers were placed in an internal solution containing 100 μm fluo-5N, which was progressively transported from the cytosol into the t-system. Adequate dye loading was obtained after ∼20 min, and uptake into the t-system was potently inhibited by the nonspecific anion transport inhibitor probenecid (see supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting the involvement of an anion transporter (27Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In all experiments, fluo-5N was removed from the bathing solution for at least 5 min before commencing the experiment, leaving the dye in the t-system only. There was no apparent difference between the properties of SOCE measured using the two methods. In control experiments with the signal-enhancing lens system lens in place, a slow decrease in t-system fluorescence occurred with time (supplemental Fig. 2B). This presumably reflects the combined effects of dye bleaching and loss. All cumulative data graphs were corrected for this loss of t-system fluorescence. In previous studies, we have characterized the effects of both halothane and sevoflurane on RyR1 activation in human MHS and MHN skinned fibers (21Duke A.M. Hopkins P.M. Halsal J.P. Steele D.S. Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Duke A.M. Hopkins P.M. Halsall P.J. Steele D.S. Br. J. Anaesth. 2006; 97: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Once triggered, the properties of SR Ca2+ release are similar with both anesthetics, although the probability of triggering release is lower with sevoflurane (28Duke A.M. Hopkins P.M. Halsall P.J. Steele D.S. Br. J. Anaesth. 2006; 97: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the clinical setting, sevoflurane is the more commonly used volatile anesthetic. However, halothane was used in the present study (i) because it induces SR Ca2+ release more consistently than sevoflurane in MHS muscle and (ii) because single fiber data can be compared with the IVCT from the same patient, where the dose-response relationship to halothane is the basis of the standardized diagnostic test. Halothane was applied at 0.5 mm, which is within the range that occurs clinically during anesthetic induction (29Davies D.N. Steward A. Allott P.R. Mapleson W.W. Br. J. Anaesth. 1972; 44: 548-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (and therefore known to induce MH) but does not normally trigger SR Ca2+ release in MHN fibers. In experiments involving cytosolic Ca2+ measurement (see Fig. 1), a maximal SR Ca2+ depletion was induced by rapid exposure to 20 mm caffeine, whereas simultaneously decreasing the free [Mg2+] to 20 μm. However, in experiments involving SOCE where x-y images were taken (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), maximal SR Ca2+ depletion was induced by decreasing the free [Mg2+] to 20 μm alone (30Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although less rapid, this method of SR Ca2+ depletion was preferred because it minimized movement associated with myofilament activation.FIGURE 4Effect of reduced [ Mg2+] on the response of MHN fibers to halothane. A, typical x-y confocal images of fluo-5N fluorescence within the resealed t-tubules of a skinned MHN fiber in the presence of 0.8 mm (upper panel) or 0.2 mm Mg2+ (lower panel) free [Mg2+]. At 0.8 mm Mg2+, halothane had no apparent effect on fluo-5N fluorescence, whereas a subsequent maximal SR Ca2+ release (MR) induced a sustained decrease in [Ca2+]t-sys. In the presence of 0.2 mm Mg2+, the introduction of halothane resulted in a transient increase in [Ca2+]t-sys followed by a sustained decrease.

A, typical x-y confocal images of fluo-5N fluorescence obtained with the dye trapped within the resealed t-tubules of a mechanically skinned MHN or MHS fiber. In MHN fibers (upper panel), the introduction of 0.5 mm halothane had no apparent effect on fluo-5N fluorescence within 60 s. However, after initiation of a maximal SR Ca2+ release (MR) by reducing in the free [Mg2+] to 20 μm, t-tubule fluorescence decreased markedly. In MHS fibers (lower panel), the introduction of 0.5 mm halothane resulted in an initial increase in fluo-5N fluorescence followed by a decrease, which approached a new steady state after ∼60 s. Thereafter, initiation of a maximal SR Ca2+ release induced a further decrease in fluo-5N fluorescence.

The change in t-tubule fluorescence was expressed as a percentage of the maximum steady-state fluorescence immediately prior to induction of SOCE. The zero point was taken to be that remaining after the fiber had been exposed to 50 μg/ml saponin for 10 min to permeabilize the t-system. In the cumulative data, each point represents the average pixel value of the corresponding x-y frame. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E., with the number of observations indicated in parentheses (n). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using a one-way analysis of variance. All statistical analysis was performed using Origin software (MicroCal). Initial experiments were done to establish whether the differential halothane sensitivity of MHN and MHS muscle apparent in the diagnostic IVCT could be demonstrated in skinned fibers (Fig. 1A). After skinning, both MHN and MHS fibers were perfused for 5 min with a weakly Ca2+-buffered intracellular solution. A solution containing 20 mm caffeine and 20 μm [Mg2+] (low Mg2+) was then applied until the response reached a maximal level after ∼10 s. The amplitude of the resulting fluo-3 fluorescence transient was used as an index of the SR Ca2+ content. A further ∼5-min perfusion was typically sufficient to allow the SR to re-reload to a similar level, as indicated by the amplitude of the second response to 20 mm caffeine/low Mg2+. Using this SR Ca2+ load and release protocol, several reproducible Ca2+ transients could be obtained with little change in the amplitude or time course of the response. After reloading the SR for a third time, fibers were subjected to stepwise increases in [halothane] over the range 0.2–5 mm or until SR Ca2+ release occurred. In MHN fibers (upper panel), SR Ca2+ release consistently occurred at ≥2 mm halothane under these conditions. In contrast, MHS fibers typically exhibited a robust SR Ca2+ release at ≤0.5 mm halothane (lower panel). Following exposure to halothane, the SR was reloaded, and a final maximal SR Ca2+ release was induced to confirm the viability of the preparation. In ∼10% of MHS fibers, the SR Ca2+ release induced by halothane took the form of a propagated cytosolic Ca2+ wave. Fig. 1B shows sequential x-y confocal images obtained from an MHS fiber under control conditions and following the introduction of 0.5 mm halothane. Application of halothane was associated with SR Ca2+ release, which originated outside the field of view and propagated from right to left in sequential images, consistent with Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. As in previous studies (21Duke A.M. Hopkins P.M. Halsal J.P. Steele D.S. Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), propagated SR Ca2+ release was not observed in MHN fibers under these conditions. Cumulative data showing the number of MHS and MHN fibers that exhibited SR Ca2+ release in response to 0.5 mm halothane under control conditions and in the presence of 0.8 mm Mg2+ or 0.2 mm Mg2+ is shown in Fig. 1C. At 0.8 mm [Mg2+]i, a level within the normal physiological range (31Westerblad H. Allen D.G. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 413-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), 0.5 mm halothane discriminated effectively between MHS and MHN fibers with 8/8 and 1/8 fibers responding to 0.5 mm halothane, respectively. Consistent with previous studies on human fibers (32Steele D.S. Duke A.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 458: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a decrease in the cytosolic [Mg2+] to 0.2 mm increased the responsiveness of MHN fibers to the anesthetic such that 0.5 mm halothane induced SR Ca2+ release in all MHS and MHN fibers. Although one MHN fiber responded unexpectedly to 0.5 mm halothane, these data on skinned fibers demonstrate a high degree of consistency with the IVCT diagnosis. Therefore, as 0.5 mm halothane is also within the range expected to occur during anesthetic induction (29Davies D.N. Steward A. Allott P.R. Mapleson W.W. Br. J. Anaesth. 1972; 44: 548-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments. Experiments were carried out to establish whether the SR Ca2+ release induced by volatile anesthetic exposure (Fig. 1) triggers Ca2+ influx via SOCE. MHN or MHS fibers were mechanically skinned, and fluo-5N was trapped within the resealed t-system (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this and all subsequent protocols addressing SOCE, dyes were absent from the cytosol. Fig. 2A shows representative confocal x-y images of fluo-5N trapped with the resealed t-system of an MHN (upper panel) and an MHS (lower panel) human skeletal muscle fiber. In the MHN fiber, rapidly increasing [halothane] to 0.5 mm for 60 s had no apparent effect on fluo-5N fluorescence. However, a subsequent maximal SR Ca2+ release induced by a decrease in the [Mg2+] from 0.8 mm to 20 μm (30Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was associated with a pronounced reduction in fluo-5N fluorescence, consistent with SOCE. In contrast, exposure of the MHS fiber to 0.5 mm halothane caused a transient increase in [Ca2+] within the resealed t-system ([Ca2+]t-sys) followed by a gradual decrease due to SOCE. A subsequent maximal SR Ca2+ release induced a further depletion of Ca2+t-sys, indicating that the effect of 0.5 mm halothane on SOCE was submaximal. Cumulative data showing the time-dependent effects of halothane on fluo-5N fluorescence are given in Fig. 2B. MHN fibers consistently failed to respond to 0.5 mm halothane. However, in MHS fibers, fluorescence transiently increased on halothane exposure to 107 ±"

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase phophatase-8, in human neuroblastoma. We found that DUSP26 was expressed in a majority of neuroblastoma cell lines and tissue specimens. Importantly, we found that DUSP26 promotes the resistance of human neuroblastoma to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by acting as a p53 phosphatase to downregulate p53 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibiting DUSP26 expression in the IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell line enhanced doxorubicin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax expression as well as apoptosis. In contrast, DUSP26 overexpression in the SK-N-SH cell line inhibited doxorubicin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax expression and apoptosis. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that DUSP26 binds to p53 and dephosphorylates p53 at Ser20 and Ser37. In this report, we show that DUSP26 functions as a p53 phosphatase, which suppresses downstream p53 activity in response to genotoxic stress. This suggests that inhibition of this phosphatase may increase neuroblastoma chemosensitivity and DUSP26 is a novel therapeutic target for this aggressive pediatric malignancy."

Specific transcription factors have been identified that activate the gene program to induce pathological forms of LVH. It is likely that apart from activating transcriptional inducers of LVH, constitutive transcriptional repressors need to be removed during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we report that the constitutive presence of Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is lost in pathological hypertrophy and that this loss precedes progression toward heart failure. We show that transforming growth factor-β-mediated activation of p38 MAPK is necessary and sufficient to decrease KLF15 expression. We further show that KLF15 robustly inhibits myocardin, a potent transcriptional activator. Loss of KLF15 during pathological LVH relieves the inhibitory effects on myocardin and stimulates the expression of serum response factor target genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor.

Myocardin stimulates transcription from CArG-dependent muscle enhancers but does not bind DNA directly. Instead, myocardin forms a stable ternary complex on CArG-boxes by associating with SRF (4Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N.

Moreover, patients with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been reported to harbor causal mutations in myocardin-regulated genes such as ACTN2, MYH7, ACTC, and TPM1 (6Huang J. Min Lu M.

Altogether, these studies have shown that myocardin regulates the organization of the contractile unit and adaptive responses of the cardiomyocyte to stress. In contrast to these activators, repressors of cardiac gene expression and hypertrophy are less well explored (11Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One of the best studied repressors of cardiac hypertrophy is the family of histone deacetylases. For instance, HDAC9 null mice display spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy and are hypersensitive to pressure overload (12Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N.

Circulation. 2006; 113: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, NAB1 has been identified to repress hypertrophy by direct inhibition of Egr-dependent transcription (14Buitrago M. Lorenz K. Maass A.H. Oberdorf-Maass S. Keller U. Schmitteckert E.M. Ivashchenko Y. Lohse M.J. Engelhardt S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that KLF15 acts a transcriptional repressor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). KLF15 belongs to the family of Krüppel-like factors, which has 17 members (16Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17van Vliet J. Crofts L.A. Quinlan K.G. Czolij R. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Genomics. 2006; 87: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). KLF15 is widely expressed, but the highest expression levels are found in liver, kidney, pancreas, and cardiac and skeletal muscle (18Uchida S. Tanaka Y. Ito H. Saitoh-Ohara F. Inazawa J. Yokoyama K.K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7319-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The zinc finger transcriptional regulator KLF15 was first identified as a repressor of the kidney-specific chloride channel CLC-K1 (18Uchida S. Tanaka Y. Ito H. Saitoh-Ohara F. Inazawa J. Yokoyama K.K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7319-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). KLF15 can also act as an activator of transcription as illustrated by the increased GLUT4 promoter activity and GLUT4 expression in response to KLF15 overexpression (19Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen-Banerjee S. DePina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Expression of KLF15 in the mouse heart is very low during development but increases after birth to reach high levels in the adult heart (19Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M.

Mice lacking KLF15 have higher base-line expression of ANF and BNP. Interestingly, when these mice are exposed to pressure overload, they develop rapid and severe hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting that KLF15 may repress cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we sought to understand how KLF15 is regulated and how it represses cardiac hypertrophy. Our results reveal that the TGFβ-p38-MAPK axis down-regulates KLF15 and that KLF15 acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of myocardin, thereby preventing transcription of SRF target genes. Ren-2 rats were obtained from Möllegard Breeding Center, Lille Skensveld, Denmark, and were studied as described previously (20Schroen B. Leenders J.J. van Erk A. Bertrand A.T. van Loon M. van Leeuwen R.E. Kubben N. Duisters R.F. Schellings M.W. Janssen B.J. Debets J.J. Schwake M. Høydal M.A. Heymans S. Saftig P. Pinto Y.M. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 1–2-Day-old Lewis neonatal rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Hearts were carefully removed, and left ventricles were cut into small pieces. Cardiac cells were then isolated by enzymatic dissociation using 0.05% collagenase I (Invitrogen, catalog no. 17100-017) and 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma, catalog no. p3292) dissolved in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma, catalog no. H4641). Cells were pre-plated for 1 h in DMEM (Invitrogen, catalog no. 11966) (supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 0.16% glucose and antibiotics) to separate myocytes from fibroblasts. After 1 h, cardiomyocytes were collected, counted, and plated in plates coated with 1% gelatin (Fluka, via Sigma). Overnight, cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 0.16% glucose, and antibiotics. Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA SMARTpools for non-targeting control (D-001810-10) and KLF15 (L-080131-01) were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 300 nm and incubated for 5 h. Medium was changed to medium containing 2% BSA, and after 72 h cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with phalloidin 1:40 (Invitrogen, catalog no. F432) in PBS for actin. Images were taken with a Leica inverted microscope, and cell size (actin-positive area) was analyzed with Scion image. Prior to stimulation of cardiomyocytes with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) (PeproTech, via Tebu-Bio, the Netherlands), cells were serum-starved for 24 h with DMEM supplemented with 0.16% glucose and antibiotics. Cells were stimulated for 24 h. One hour prior to TGFβ1, cells were treated with two independent p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB202190 or SB203580 (Sigma). Endothelin-1 (100 nm), phenylephrine (50 μm), insulin (100 nm) (Sigma), IGF-I (100 nm), and IGF-II (100 nm) (PeproTech, via Tebu-Bio) were used to stimulate cardiomyocytes as described for TGFβ1. TGFβ1- (10 ng/ml) and SB202190 (10 μm)-stimulated cells were exposed to [3H]leucine (1 μCi) for 24 h. After 24 h of TGFβ1 stimulation, cells were scraped in 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and centrifuged, and pellets were dissolved in 0.5 m NaOH. Activity was measured in 4 ml of high ionic count fluid in a scintillation counter. Infection of cardiomyocytes with AdMKK6 was performed to phosphorylate p38 MAPK as described previously (21Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For infection of cardiomyocytes, 200 μl of viral supernatant (AdMKK6 and AdGFP) was added to 5 × 105 cardiomyocytes that were plated in a gelatinized 6-well plate and cultured as described above. Three days after infection, cells were harvested for protein analyses by scraping the cells in an SDS buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Western blotting was performed using phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) (1:1000) and p38 MAPK (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, via Bioké, the Netherlands). Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old FVB mice. Heart tissue was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (United States Biochemical, catalog no. 22715), HBSS (Sigma, catalog no. H4641) supplemented with 1 g/liter d-glucose (Merck). Tissue was digested in collagenase buffer (150 units/ml collagenase type II (Worthington 4176) in DMEM 41965 (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C. Individual cells were obtained by trituration and filtering over a 100-μm filter. Cells were centrifuged and pre-plated for 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in plating medium (10% FCS, 20 μm l-glutamine, and 10 μm AraC in DMEM) on 1% gelatin (Sigma, catalog no. G1890)-coated culture plates at a final density of 100,000 cells/cm2. After 48 h, medium was changed to DMEM 41965 supplemented with 25 mm l-glutamine, 2% BSA (Sigma, catalog no. A6003), 0.25 milliunits/ml insulin (Sigma, catalog no. I6634), 250 μm l-carnitine (Sigma, catalog no. C0283), and 10 μm AraC (Sigma, catalog no. C6645)). 24 h later, medium was changed to DMEM 41965 without penicillin/streptomycin for transfection. All solutions were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 10 mm HEPES. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA SMARTpools for nontargeting control (D-001810-10) and KLF15 (L-059453-01) were added with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, catalog no. 11668) as described above. For quantitative real time PCR, RNA was isolated from cardiomyocytes or left ventricles using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real time was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 20 ng of total RNA, and 10 pmol/μl forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table 1a). Quantification was performed using LinRegPCR analysis software (22Ruijter J.M. Ramakers C. Hoogaars W.M. Karlen Y. Bakker O. van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Transfection of COS7 cells for luciferase assays were performed as described previously (23Kuwahara K. Barrientos T. Pipes G.C. Li S. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3173-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SM22 (505 bp) luciferase reporter was a kind gift of Dr. J. M. Miano (Rochester, NY) (24Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The 3×CArG and ANF (638 bp) luciferase reporter and the expression plasmids encoding myocardin (935 amino acids) and SRF were provided by Dr. Eric Olson (Dallas, Tx) (25Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A pcDNA3.1-based expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged KLF15 was donated by Dr. M. K. Jain (Cleveland, OH). Transfection of COS7 cells and luciferase assays was performed as described previously (23Kuwahara K. Barrientos T. Pipes G.C. Li S. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3173-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In short, 24-well plates with COS7 cells were transfected per well with 30 ng of pcDNA-β-gal, 75 ng of luciferase reporter, and 50 ng of pcDNA-KLF15 and myocardin(935). Transfection of vectors was facilitated using GeneJammer (Stratagene, via Bio-Connect, Huissen, the Netherlands). For titration experiments, we transfected 50 ng of ANF- or Sm22-luciferase, 50 ng of pcDNA-myocardin, and increasing concentrations of KLF15 (1–100 ng) or pcDNA-SRF (0.5–25 ng) as indicated. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Measurements were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KLF15 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the KLF15 open reading frame into the pGEX-KG vector. GST fusion proteins were produced and isolated by standard procedures. Deletion mutants of myocardin were constructed through PCR-based mutagenesis and subcloning of these DNA fragments into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Myocardin proteins were translated in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine in a coupled transcription-translation T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and assayed for binding to GST fusion proteins. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Unpaired t test was used. p values of ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. To explore whether KLF15 expression, besides in the TAC model (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is also regulated in other models of hypertrophy and failure, we studied KLF15 expression in the homozygous TGR(mRen2)27 rat (Ren-2). In this model, KLF15 is down-regulated already in an early stage of LVH. We employed this model to evaluate whether down-regulation of KLF15 could distinguish the hypertrophied hearts that will quickly progress to failure versus those where hypertrophy remains compensated for a prolonged period. We obtained cardiac biopsies at a time when all Ren-2 rats displayed similar cardiac hypertrophy and were well compensated. After cardiac biopsies were taken, we followed each rat to see whether it would progress to failure or not (20Schroen B. Leenders J.J. van Erk A. Bertrand A.T. van Loon M. van Leeuwen R.E. Kubben N. Duisters R.F. Schellings M.W. Janssen B.J. Debets J.J. Schwake M. Høydal M.A. Heymans S. Saftig P. Pinto Y.M. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This revealed that KLF15 expression was decreased significantly more in the hypertrophied hearts that later progressed toward failure (Fig. 1a). To evaluate whether KLF15 is also down-regulated in physiological LVH, we assessed KLF15 expression levels in rats with exercise-induced LVH. Heart weights from trained rats were significantly increased compared with those from sedentary rats. Training resulted in hypertrophy of individual cardiomyocytes as shown by an increased length, but not width, of these cells (supplemental Fig. 1, a–d). Despite this pronounced cardiac remodeling, no difference in KLF15 gene expression between the sedentary group and the trained rats was noted (Fig. 1b). KLF15 is specifically down-regulated in pathological hypertrophy, which prompted us to search for the stimuli and pathways that repress KLF15. We used cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to study the effect of several hypertrophic stimuli such as phenylephrine, endothelin-1, TGFβ, and FCS on the expression of KLF15. All stimuli were able to decrease KLF15 expression levels (Fig. 1c). In contrast, when cardiomyocyte growth was stimulated with stimuli that are known to induce physiological hypertrophy (insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2), KLF15 levels did not decrease (Fig. 1d). This further supports the in vivo findings that KLF15 is down-regulated only in pathological hypertrophy. Because TGFβ was the most robust inhibitor of KLF15 expression, we explored this pathway more extensively. The observed TGFβ-mediated down-regulation of KLF15 was completely abolished in cultured cardiomyocytes after knockdown of TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFBR1 or ALK5) (Fig. 2a and supplemental Fig. 2), demonstrating that TGFβ signaling via ALK5 is vital to regulate KLF15 expression. It is known that during hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, TGFβ induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation via TAK1 (26Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), suggesting that TGFβ may decrease KLF15 expression by activation of p38 MAPK. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated cultured cardiomyocytes with two different specific p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580. Indeed, TGFβ-induced down-regulation of KLF15 was dose-dependently abolished by either inhibitor (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 3). Strikingly, KLF15 expression was inversely correlated with ANF expression (supplemental Fig. 3). Apart from preventing KLF15 down-regulation, inhibition of p38 phosphorylation blunted the TGFβ-induced hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation and phalloidin staining of F-actins (Fig. 2, c and d). From this, we conclude that in cardiomyocytes p38 MAPK signaling is necessary for TGFβ-induced hypertrophy and KLF15 down-regulation. To elucidate whether activation of p38 MAPK is not only necessary but also sufficient to repress KLF15 expression downstream of TGFβ, we activated p38 MAPK by adenoviral overexpression of the upstream kinase of p38 MAPK, MKK6, which induced a robust increase of phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 2e). This resulted in an almost 80% decrease in KLF15 mRNA levels and induced expression of the hypertrophy marker BNP in cultured cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2e). In conclusion, we show that activation of p38 MAPK is necessary and sufficient to decrease KLF15 expression in cardiac myocytes, providing one of the first examples of a cardiac transcription factor that is actually down-regulated by activated p38. Earlier studies have shown that loss of KLF15 aggravates cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We confirmed these observations, after transfecting cultured neonatal rat and mouse cardiomyocytes with two independent SMARTpool siRNAs against KLF15 or a nontargeting control siRNA. This resulted in a 16–30% increase in cardiomyocyte size and shows that loss of KLF15 alone is sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and elevate ANF expression (supplemental Fig. 4). The opposite also holds true; overexpression of KLF15 using a lentiviral approach seems to inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as demonstrated by decreased mRNA levels of ANF in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (supplemental Fig. 4). It remains unknown how KLF15 inhibits LVH. It has been shown that KLF15 interacts with different major transcriptional regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, like the MADS box transcription factor MEF2A and the zinc finger transcription factor GATA4, but it remains unclear whether KLF15 displays specificity to certain cardiac transcription factors or whether it represses the general transcriptional machinery through other mechanisms. This prompted us to investigate whether KLF15 could repress SRF, “the other” MADS box transcription factor with an established role in cardiac gene expression. We first performed GST pulldown assays using in vitro translated MEF2A and SRF and a GST-KLF15 fusion protein, but we did not observe a direct interaction of KLF15 to either SRF or MEF2A (supplemental Fig. 5a). This suggested to us that the previously reported repression of MEF2 activity by KLF15 is indirect (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen-Banerjee S. DePina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We subsequently tested if KLF15 could physically interact with myocardin, an extraordinarily potent coactivator of the MADS box transcription factors, which has recently been reported to play a role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac failure (6Huang J. Min Lu M. Cheng L. Yuan L.J. Zhu X. Stout A.L. Chen M. Li J. Parmacek M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18734-18739Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, GST-pulldown assays showed that KLF15 directly binds to myocardin (Fig. 3d). We next tested whether KLF15 could affect the transcriptional activity of myocardin. Indeed, luciferase assays showed that KLF15 virtually abolished myocardin activity on SRF-dependent promoters such as ANF(638), SM22(505), and an artificial promoter that contains three SRF binding domains (3×CArG) in COS7 cells. Repression of these promoters by KLF15 only took place in the presence (Fig. 3, a–c) and not in the absence of myocardin (supplemental Fig. 5b), indicating that KLF15 does not affect the basic transcriptional machinery in our assays but specifically functions through its interaction with myocardin. To map the region of myocardin that is required for the interaction with KLF15, we compared binding of several deletion mutants of myocardin to KLF15 using GST pulldown assays. As shown in Fig. 3, d and e, KLF15 binds to a 50-amino acid region within amino acids 232–282 of myocardin. Interestingly, this region contains the basic domain of myocardin, which is also required for binding to SRF (4Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Binding of SRF and KLF15 to the same region within myocardin implicates that KLF15 can trigger the displacement of myocardin from SRF by competition for a common docking site. Indeed, competition experiments in COS7 cells using the ANF(638) reporter show that repression of myocardin activity by KLF15 is relieved in a dose-dependent manner by addition of SRF (Fig. 3f). In conclusion, competition of SRF and KLF15 for myocardin provides a mechanism whereby lower KLF15 levels in response to TGFβ signaling can enhance the expression of SRF-dependent genes during the hypertrophic response of the heart (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Proposed mechanism of action of TGFβ-p38 MAPK-KLF15 cascade to explain induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. KLF15 competes with SRF for a common docking site within myocardin, thereby limiting myocardin to activate cardiotrophic genes in normal adult myocytes. Growth factors repress KLF15 expression, allowing myocardin to bind SRF and activate cardiotrophic genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observations that TGFβ represses KLF15 expression and that KLF15 inhibits myocardin activity predict that TGFβ increases the expression of myocardin target genes. To evaluate this, we stimulated cultured cardiomyocytes under serum-free conditions for 24 h with 5 ng/ml TGFβ and measured the expression of ANF, SM22, and αSKA (i.e. ACTC1), three bona fide myocardin/SRF target genes (4Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 6Huang J. Min Lu M. Cheng L. Yuan L.J. Zhu X. Stout A.L. Chen M. Li J. Parmacek M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18734-18739Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, b–d, these SRF targets were significantly up-regulated in response to TGFβ stimulation, whereas myocardin levels were unchanged (data not shown). Regulation of myocardin target genes by TGFβ was fully prevented by titrating in p38 inhibitors (Fig. 4). These results provide further evidence that TGFβ regulates myocardin activity in cardiomyocytes via activation of p38 MAPK as depicted in the model in Fig. 5. In contrast to transcriptional activators, transcriptional inhibitors of LVH are less well explored. Recently, KLF15 was described as a novel transcriptional inhibitor of LVH (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This study aimed to elucidate how KLF15 is regulated and how it inhibits pathological LVH. There is increasing recognition of the intrinsic differences between load induced, pathological LVH, and more physiological forms of cardiac hypertrophy as occurs after exercise (28McMullen J.R. Jennings G.L. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2007; 34: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, many factors involved in pathological LVH are also involved in adaptive LVH (29Strøm C.C. Aplin M. Ploug T. Christoffersen T.E. Langfort J. Viese M. Galbo H. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). More recently, some transcriptional mechanisms have been identified that specifically inhibit pathological LVH, like class II histone deacetylases and the transcriptional repressor NAB1 (12Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 14Buitrago M. Lorenz K. Maass A.H. Oberdorf-Maass S. Keller U. Schmitteckert E.M. Ivashchenko Y. Lohse M.J. Engelhardt S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although NAB1 is activated during LVH, class II histone deacetylases have been suggested to constitutively repress the expression of hypertrophy genes like MEF2 (12Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Here, we show that KLF15 is a second constitutive transcriptional inhibitor of pathological LVH. The specific role of KLF15 in pathological forms is exemplified by the following findings: (a) KLF15 was not suppressed in exercise-induced LVH, and (b) KLF15 was significantly more suppressed in the hypertrophied Ren-2 hearts that would soon progress to failure. These findings suggest a novel mechanism in pathological LVH, where activated p38 MAPK actually down-regulates a repressive transcription factor. Earlier work showed the relation between loss of KLF15 and LVH in general. KLF15 was found to be expressed less in hypertrophied hearts as compared with the healthy adult myocardium. In addition, KLF15 null mice have higher base-line levels of BNP and ANF and respond to pressure overload with exaggerated expression of these genes, accompanied by higher mortality due to heart failure (15Fisch S. Gray S. Heymans S. Haldar S.M. Wang B. Pfister O. Cui L. Kumar A. Lin Z. Sen-Banerjee S. Das H. Petersen C.A. Mende U. Burleigh B.A. Zhu Y. Pinto Y.M. Pinto Y. Liao R. Jain M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7074-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This underlines the protective role of constitutive expression of KLF15. Because activation of p38 MAPK has been shown to activate numerous mechanisms, but has not yet been shown to repress important transcriptional regulators, we were surprised to find that activation of p38 MAPK was sufficient to decrease KLF15 (30Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1385-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although there is some debate about the role of p38 in the development of LVH (30Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1385-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Wang Y. Circulation. 2007; 116: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), published findings are in agreement with those we report here. Studies in cultured cardiomyocytes conclude that p38 activation is sufficient to induce myocyte hypertrophy marked by increased cell size and induction of hypertrophy markers like ANF, BNP, and αSKA (32Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In vivo studies using transgenic overexpression mice of the p38 MAPK upstream kinases, MKK3 and MKK6, do not show myocyte hypertrophy, but instead they rapidly progress toward heart failure and have increased levels of embryonic genes like ANF, β-MHC, and αSKA (33Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which is in line with the loss of repression of myocardin as we suggest here. Finally, it has been shown that activation of p38 MAPK via the TAK1 axis induces hypertrophy, which is in line with our findings (26Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, very recently it has been shown that KLF15 is not the only Krüppel-like factor that is regulated in cardiomyocytes. In cultured cardiomyocytes, ET-1 up-regulated several Krüppel-like factors like KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF6 and down-regulated KLF3, KLF11, and KLF15 (34Cullingford T.E. Butler M.J. Marshall A.K. Tham el L. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) The possible involvement of p38 MAPK in the regulation of KLF expression was studied, but blockade of p38 by a p38 inhibitor did not have an effect on the ET-1-induced expression of KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF6. We explored a possible mechanism by which KLF15 can repress pathological LVH. The role of myocardin in the development of hypertrophy and failure has recently been described (6Huang J. Min Lu M. Cheng L. Yuan L.J. Zhu X. Stout A.L. Chen M. Li J. Parmacek M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18734-18739Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z.

Myocardin levels are reported to be increased upon induction of hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes and in patients with LVH (27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Overexpression of myocardin in cardiomyocytes induces hypertrophy and increases ANF, BNP, and β-MHC expression (27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In vivo ablation of myocardin in adult cardiomyocytes in mice results in rapid heart failure, and the expression of myocardin/SRF-regulated sarcomeric genes is extinguished (6Huang J. Min Lu M. Cheng L. Yuan L.J. Zhu X. Stout A.L. Chen M. Li J. Parmacek M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18734-18739Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that KLF15 is a very potent inhibitor of myocardin activity. Luciferase assays show that KLF15 suppresses myocardin-induced activation of three reporter vectors harboring one or more GArG-boxes (Fig. 2a). In addition, binding studies revealed that KLF15 is able to bind myocardin specifically in a 50-amino acid region where the SRF binding domain (basic domain) is also situated. Competition studies show that KLF15-mediated repression of myocardin activity is abolished by SRF in a dose-dependent manner. This indicates that KLF15 and SRF compete for binding the same region within myocardin. When we studied the effect of TGFβ on the expression of established myocardin targets SM22, ANF, and αSKA, we found these targets to be up-regulated. Moreover, this up-regulation was completely abolished by p38 inhibitors. This is congruent with the notion that TGFβ represses KLF15 expression via p38 MAPK, resulting in enhanced physical association of myocardin to SRF. Unchanged myocardin mRNA levels in response to TGFβ further underscore the interpretation that myocardin activity is not regulated at the level of transcription but rather by interactions at the protein level. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that myocardin mRNA and protein levels are increased in human and mouse failing hearts (27Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This indicates that in failing hearts not only myocardin activity is enhanced by a decrease in KLF15 but also by enhancing protein levels of myocardin itself. Taken together, our data suggest a novel pathway in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. We show here that down-regulation of KLF15 is a vital step in the development of hypertrophy and possibly its progression toward heart failure. We propose that in the healthy post-natal heart, where KLF15 levels are high, KLF15 inhibits the activity of myocardin, a potent transcriptional activator of numerous genes involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy like Anf, Sm22, and αska. During cardiac hypertrophy, when levels of TGFβ increase, p38 MAPK signaling is activated, which subsequently reduces KLF15 and releases the endogenous inhibition that KLF15 exerts on myocardin (Fig. 4). In conclusion, our studies show that molecular mechanisms counteracting cardiomyocyte growth are dysregulated in pathological hypertrophy of the heart. The fact that KLF15 counteracts hypertrophy and is significantly down-regulated in pathological LVH suggests that therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing the decrease of KLF15 levels could be beneficial in the prevention of heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2029637498,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through its cognate receptors death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5), preferentially in malignant cells. However, many malignant cells remain resistant to TRAIL cytotoxicity by poorly characterized mechanisms. Here, using cholangiocarcinoma cells, as a model for TRAIL resistance, we identified a role for the oncogenic Hedgehog (Hh)-GLI pathway in the regulation of TRAIL cytotoxicity. Blockade of Hh using pharmacological and genetic tools sensitizes the cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Restoration of apoptosis sensitivity coincided with upregulation of DR4 expression, while expression of other death effector proteins remained unaltered. Knockdown of DR4 mimics Hh-mediated resistance to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Hh regulates the expression of DR4 by modulating the activity of its promoter. Luciferase, chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression assays show that the transcription factor GLI3 binds to the DR4 promoter and Hh requires an intact GLI3-repression activity to silence DR4 expression. Finally, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeted knockdown of GLI3, but not GLI1 or GLI2, restores DR4 expression and TRAIL sensitivity, indicating that the Hh effect is exclusively mediated by this transcription factor. In conclusion, these data provide evidence of a regulatory mechanism, which modulates TRAIL signaling in cancer cells and suggest new therapeutic approaches for TRAIL-resistant neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2061928415,"The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. To evaluate the biological and clinical relevance of p53 loss, human somatic cell gene targeting was used to delete the TP53 gene in the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line, MCF-10A. In all four p53−/− clones generated, cells acquired the capability for epidermal growth factor-independent growth and were defective in appropriate downstream signaling and cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, p53 loss induced chromosomal instability leading to features of transformation and the selection of clones with varying phenotypes. For example, p53-deficient clones were heterogeneous in their capacity for anchorage-independent growth and invasion. In addition, and of clinical importance, the cohort of p53-null clones showed sensitivity to chemotherapeutic interventions that varied depending not only on the type of chemotherapeutic agent, but also on the treatment schedule. In conclusion, deletion of the TP53 gene from MCF-10A cells eliminated p53 functions, as well as produced p53−/− clones with varying phenotypes possibly stemming from the distinct chromosomal changes observed. Such a model system will be useful to further understand the cancer-specific phenotypic changes that accompany p53 loss, as well as help to provide future treatment strategies for human malignancies that harbor aberrant p53."

The SIN3 corepressor serves as a scaffold for the assembly of HDAC complexes. These complexes are recruited to chromatin, where the catalytic subunit, RPD3 in yeast and Drosophila and HDAC1 and -2 in mammals, deacetylates histones to repress transcription (11Silverstein R.A. Ekwall K. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Kadosh D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Compositionally similar SIN3 complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and mammals have been isolated and characterized, illustrating the conservation of SIN3 complex proteins among eukaryotes (11Silverstein R.A.

Acta. 2009; 1789: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This similarity further suggests that the essential functions of these complexes may be conserved as well. In yeast, two distinct mechanisms of SIN3-mediated repression of gene transcription have been characterized. First, SIN3 complexes, such as the Rpd3L (large) complex, can be recruited to the promoter of target genes by DNA-binding factors or other corepressors to inhibit transcription (14Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L.

Second, SIN3 complexes, such as Rpd3S (small), can be recruited by chromatin-associated proteins to the coding region of a target gene to repress transcription from internal cryptic promoters (14Carrozza M.J.

In mammals, a third mechanism has been demonstrated in which SIN3 is recruited by the transcription factor E2F4 to downstream regions of cell cycle-regulated genes (6van Oevelen C. Wang J. Asp P. Yan Q. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 359-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After recruitment, SIN3 spreads farther downstream to permanently silence these genes during differentiation (6van Oevelen C. Wang J. Asp P. Yan Q. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 359-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, the molecular mechanisms by which SIN3 complexes regulate transcription at specific subsets of target genes to affect the growth and development of multicellular organisms are still not well understood. SIN3 isoforms have been shown to form distinct complexes that function differently. For example, in S. pombe, three SIN3 proteins (PST1, -2, and -3) are encoded by separate genes (11Silverstein R.A. Ekwall K. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Dang V.D. Benedik M.J. Ekwall K. Choi J. Allshire R.C. Levin H.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2351-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PST1-containing complex, similar to Rpd3L of S. cerevisiae, is recruited to promoters (14Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T.

The complex containing PST2, similar to the Rpd3S complex of S. cerevisiae, is recruited to coding regions (14Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S.

For example, mSin3A has been shown to promote cell proliferation during embryonic development (1Cowley S.M. Iritani B.M. Mendrysa S.M. Xu T. Cheng P.F. Yada J. Liggitt H.D. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6990-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Dannenberg J.H. David G. Zhong S. van der Torre J. Wong W.H. Depinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1581-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas mSin3B is up-regulated in response to oncogenic stress and is required for cellular senescence (9Grandinetti K.B. Jelinic P. DiMauro T. Pellegrino J. Fernández Rodríguez R. Finnerty P.M. Ruoff R. Bardeesy N. Logan S.K. David G. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 6430-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although these studies establish SIN3 isoforms as distinct proteins that serve separate essential roles in a developing organism, a systematic analysis of metazoan isoform-specific complexes is still lacking. The Drosophila Sin3A gene produces multiple alternatively spliced isoforms that differ only at the C terminus (3Neufeld T.P. Tang A.H. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pennetta G. Pauli D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These isoforms are differentially expressed and are hypothesized to perform different functions during Drosophila development (20Sharma V. Swaminathan A. Bao R. Pile L.A. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3040-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SIN3 220, the isoform of 220 kDa, is the predominantly expressed isoform in highly proliferative cells, such as immortalized cell lines and larval imaginal discs, whereas SIN3 187 is the predominant isoform in differentiated tissues, such as those found in late stage embryos and adult flies (20Sharma V. Swaminathan A. Bao R. Pile L.A. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3040-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A third isoform, SIN3 190, which is not conserved in other insect species, is detected only in adult females and embryos. Although expression patterns of the Drosophila SIN3 isoforms suggest that they perform unique roles during development, the nature of these roles has not been characterized. To understand how SIN3 isoforms contribute to the growth and development of a metazoan organism, we have affinity-purified SIN3 isoform-specific complexes from both Drosophila S2 cells and embryos. We report here that Drosophila SIN3 187 and 220 are found in distinct HDAC complexes containing both shared and unique proteins. We further show that these complexes exhibit different HDAC activity and that SIN3 187 and 220 are localized to discrete regions on polytene chromosomes. Additionally, isoform-specific rescue experiments indicate that expression of SIN3 187 is insufficient to support fly viability. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that SIN3 187 and 220 are functionally distinct. The results further suggest that isoform-specific proteins likely contribute to the unique regulatory functions of distinct SIN3 complexes. S2 cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (1×) + l-glutamine with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 50 mg/ml gentamycin was added to the medium for S2 control cells, whereas 0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1 mg/ml Geneticin were added to stably transfected cell lines. Lines carrying expression constructs for HA-tagged SIN3 187 or 220 or FLAG-tagged p55 were made by transfecting S2 cells with a pMT vector containing cDNA for tagged SIN3 187, SIN3 220, or p55. The cells were simultaneously transfected with the pV9 vector that carries the neomycin gene to allow for selection of the transformed cells. Cells that carried chromosomal insertions of both transgenes were then selected for by growth in Geneticin. TAP-tagged SIN3 187 and 220 cell lines were constructed in the same manner, except that the TAP vector carries the Hygromycin B marker. Cells were thus grown in medium with 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 300 μg/ml Hygromycin B. Details regarding construction of the expression plasmids are available upon request. Drosophila melanogaster stocks were maintained, and crosses were performed according to standard laboratory procedures. The following stocks were used: UAS-p55 RNA interference (RNAi) (26455GD), obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center; Act-GAL4 (4414), tub-GAL4 (5138), en-GAL4 (8828), and Sin3A08268 (12350), all obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center; UAS-SIN3RNAi, as described (20Sharma V.

The UAS-190,220RNAi lines were generated according to the protocol given in Ref. 20Sharma V. Swaminathan A. Bao R. Pile L.A. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3040-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. The targeting sequence that was cloned into the pWiz vector was generated using the following primers (oriented 5′ to 3′): CAGTTCTAGAGCGTAACTCAGGCGAAATAC and CAGTTCTAGACGTCGAGGAACTGGTATCAC. To generate lines with constitutive ubiquitous expression of either SIN3 187HA or 220HA, the UAS-187HA or UAS-220HA transgenes were recombined onto chromosomes containing tub-GAL4 or Act-GAL4, respectively. For the rescue of lethality experiments, the UAS-187HA and UAS-220HA transgenes were recombined onto the Sin3A08268 and Sin3Ae374 mutant chromosomes. A stock containing this recombinant chromosome and tub-GAL4 transgene was created and maintained over CyO and Sb balancer chromosomes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from both S2 control and SIN3HA-transformed cells. 1 × 108 cells were pelleted at 1250 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 5 min. Cells were lysed in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 Complete protease inhibitor minitablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml of buffer. Lysis was monitored by trypan blue staining. Isolated nuclei were pelleted at 2000 × g for 5 min through 1 ml of nuclear lysis buffer plus sucrose (15 ml of 1 m sucrose was added to 50 ml nuclear lysis buffer) and resuspended in 1 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 Complete Protease Inhibitor minitablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml of buffer and incubated on ice for 1–2 h. Debris was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Approximately 550 μl of nuclear extract was incubated with 40 μl of anti-HA beads (HA-7 monoclonal antibody conjugated to Sepharose beads (Sigma). The total volume was increased to 650 μl with interaction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Extracts were incubated with the antibody beads overnight. The beads were washed with each of the following three buffers for the indicated times: radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfide, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) one time for 5 min; Wash 2 (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol) two times for 5 min; Wash 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) one time for 5 min. Bound proteins were eluted by incubation with 25 μl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) for 5 min. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 0–24 h 187HA, 220HA, and w1118 embryos as described previously (21Nelson M.R. Leidal A.M. Smibert C.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 300–400 μl of extract was incubated with 40 μl of anti-HA beads for 2–6 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of Laemmli buffer. 5 × 107 cells were pelleted at 1250 × g for 5 min. Histones were acid-extracted by resuspending the cells in 500 μl of 0.4 n sulfuric acid in PBS, incubating for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 n glacial acetic acid in distilled H2O and for 4 h in distilled H2O the next day. After TCA precipitation, protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 0–24 h 187HA, 220HA, and w1118 embryos as described previously (22Weake V.M. Swanson S.K. Mushegian A. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. 10–15 g of washed, dechorionated embryos were first homogenized in Buffer I (1 ml per 1 g of embryos) using a mortar and pestle. The homogenate was then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and disrupted with 20 strokes of a loose pestle. The soluble nuclear extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 50 min. 4 ml of nuclear extract prepared from 4 × 108 S2 cells or 10–15 g of embryos, as described above, was incubated with 150–200 μl of anti-HA beads overnight at 4 °C. To control for nonspecific interactions, immunoprecipitations were also performed using extracts prepared from non-transfected S2 cells and non-transgenic wild type w1118 Drosophila embryos. Bound proteins were eluted with 3 × 200 μl of 500 μg/ml HA peptide, and samples were concentrated using 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon Ultra 4 spin columns (Millipore). The LC/MS/MS analysis was performed at the Proteomics Facility Core of the Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University. Eluted proteins were separated by PAGE, and the resulting lanes were cut into gel slices. Proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin in gel. Peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography before introduction into a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-XL, Thermo Scientific). Peptide identification of MS2 spectra was scored using Proteome Discoverer 1.1 (Thermo) and Mascot (Matrix Science) software using the latest FlyBase D. melanogaster protein data base (r5.24). A MudPIT-type strategy was employed (all LC/MS/MS runs for a lane were grouped into one search), and proteins were positively identified if minimally two unique peptides per protein scored above the 5% false discovery rate cut-off. Nonspecific proteins identified in the control immunoprecipitations were removed from the list. Protein abundance was estimated by spectral counting. Results were normalized to the number of SIN3 peptides in each group and further adjusted to account for protein size. Fold difference protein binding in SIN3 187 and SIN3 220 immunoaffinity pull-down experiments was determined by dividing normalized spectral counts of the 220 experiment by those of 187 for each protein identified. Gels were stained using the SilverSnap Silver Stain kit from Pierce or the Silver Stain kit from Owl Scientific. Gels from which bands were excised for LC/MS/MS analysis were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Sigma). Western blot analysis was performed in accordance with standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A8.40-A8.55Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 15% for histone extracts, and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pall). Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies HA-HRP (1:6000; Sigma), FLAG (1:5000; Sigma), SIN3 (1:2000 (24Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), RPD3 (1:1000 (24Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), p55 (1:5000; kindly provided by Dr. Carl Wu), CBP (1:5000; Millipore), H3 (1:30000; Abcam), H3K9/K14Ac (1:5000; Millipore), H3K9Ac (1:6000; Millipore), H3K14Ac (1:5000; Millipore), H4K8Ac (1:600; Millipore), or H4K12Ac (1:1500; Millipore), followed by incubation in donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG (1:3000; GE Healthcare) secondary antibody where applicable. The antibody signals were detected using the ECL+ Western blot detection system (GE Healthcare). Histone deacetylase activity was monitored using the HDAC fluorimetric assay/drug discovery kit AK-500 (Enzo Life Sciences). SIN3 187 and 220 complexes were affinity-purified as described above. 18 μl of the eluted complexes was incubated with 25–500 μm Fluor de Lys substrate at 30 °C for 0–20 min. After the addition of the developer, the fluorescence was read using a Gemini XPS Microplate Spectrofluorometer (MDS Analytical Technologies) with excitation at 360 nm and fluorescence at 460 nm. Counts were normalized to the levels of RPD3 as determined by Western blot analysis. Kinetic data were analyzed by calculating the change in arbitrary fluorescent units (AFU)/min between the 10 and 20 min time points and plotting this data versus the substrate concentration. The Km and Vmax were determined using Prism curve-fitting software (GraphPad Software). At least three independent experiments were performed at each substrate concentration. Polytene chromosome preparation and staining was performed as described previously (24Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies: mouse anti-HA-FITC (1:100; Sigma), rabbit anti-SIN3 220 (1:500 (20Sharma V. Swaminathan A. Bao R. Pile L.A. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3040-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)), and secondary antibody Alexa 594 donkey anti-rabbit (1:400; Invitrogen). An unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine significance for the p55 genetic rescue experiments, whereas a paired t test was used to determine significance for the differences in histone acetylation levels among S2, 187HA, and 220HA cells. For the kinetic HDAC analyses, the statistical function present in the Prism curve-fitting software (GraphPad Software) was used to compare the Km and Vmax for 187HA and 220HA. To identify isoform-specific SIN3-interacting factors, we generated stably transfected S2 cell lines or transgenic Drosophila that express either the SIN3 187 or SIN3 220 isoform with a C-terminal HA tag. The transgenes used for S2 cell expression were under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter, whereas transgene expression in flies was controlled by the GAL4-UAS system. To ensure that the SIN3 187 and 220 proteins were expressed in cultured cells, we prepared whole cell extracts from 187HA, 220HA, and S2 control cells and probed a Western blot with antibody to the HA tag. Western blot analysis confirmed that SIN3 187HA and 220HA are expressed (Fig. 1A). The transgenic fly lines that were generated have a single chromosome carrying both a ubiquitous GAL4 and a UAS-SIN3 187HA or 220HA transgene. To verify that these flies express SIN3 187HA and 220HA, we prepared whole cell extracts from adult SIN3 187HA, 220HA, and w1118 control flies. Western blot analysis with antibody to the HA tag confirmed that the transgenic flies express SIN3 187HA and 220HA (Fig. 1A). To identify proteins that interact with SIN3 187 and 220, we affinity-purified SIN3HA complexes from the S2 cells and flies described above. Nuclear extracts prepared from SIN3 187HA and 220HA S2 cells and transgenic Drosophila were incubated with anti-HA-agarose affinity gel, and bound proteins were eluted with HA peptide. Three independent purifications from both S2 cells and embryos were performed. To determine whether the SIN3 187 and 220 isoforms interact with different sets of proteins, the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1B). The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were then identified by LC/MS/MS. Through this analysis, we identified a number of proteins common to both isoforms as well as some proteins unique to one SIN3 protein or the other (Fig. 1C and supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Although obvious differences in interacting proteins are not apparent in the silver stain of the embryo samples, distinct proteins were definitively identified by the more sensitive LC/MS/MS analysis. The sets of interacting factors, which were very similar between S2 cells and embryos, included a number of proteins previously found to be part of either a yeast or mammalian SIN3 complex (supplemental Table 3). These findings clearly demonstrate that SIN3 complexes are conserved from yeast to Drosophila to mammals. Analysis of the SIN3 purifications from the cultured cells identified seven proteins in addition to SIN3 that were isolated as part of SIN3 complexes from other organisms (Fig. 1C). RPD3, SDS3, and ARID4B were found in similar levels in both Drosophila complexes, whereas BRMS1L, SAP130, ING1, and p55 were present at higher levels in the SIN3 220 complex. Orthologs of six of these proteins were purified as components of an mSin3A complex from human erythroleukemia cells (25Fleischer T.C. Yun U.J. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 3). Additionally, both Drosophila complexes appear to be more similar to the yeast Rpd3L/Complex I as opposed to Rpd3S/Complex II (supplemental Table 3). The identification of two Drosophila SIN3 complexes similar to RPD3L/Complex I does not necessarily imply that an Rpd3S/Complex II type complex is absent from Drosophila. The purification approach used in this study may have precluded recovery of such a complex. Instead, the presence of two isoform-specific SIN3 complexes similar to Rpd3L/Complex I suggests that there are likely additional mechanisms for SIN3-mediated regulation in Drosophila that may not be present in yeast.

IntroductionCell migration is crucial in many physiological processes such as embryogenesis, cell differentiation, cell renewal, and immune system responses. During these processes, cells undergo highly regulated and coordinated cell migration to enable growth or repair of cells. Cell migration is also important in the metastasis of tumor cells. Indeed, it is a hallmark of the most aggressive and advanced epithelial tumors prior to entering the metastatic stage. These tumor cells often undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migrate in a deregulated manner. As a result, they invade other tissues and take over the host organism (1Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), causing 90% of cancer-related deaths (2Mehlen P. Puisieux A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar).Cell migration occurs through the coordination of numerous cellular proteins. This process includes directional sensing of cells, anchorage of cells at the leading edge, and the reorganization of different components in the cell to assist in cell movement. The orientation of cell movement is largely dependent on the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which consists of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin cytoskeleton. Although microtubules, intermediate filaments, and leading edge proteins are pivotal in the structure and organization of migrating cells, the actin cytoskeleton also plays an essential role in cell polarity and cell migration. For instance, actin is involved in the formation of the lamellipodia and filopodia, which are membrane and finger-like projections, respectively, at the leading edge of migrating cells. Both lamellipodia and filopodia are important for directional and environmental sensing even though they may be formed through two distinct actin-assembly machineries with different actin dynamic properties (3Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 489-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Lamellipodia are formed by actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) 2The abbreviations used are: Arpactin-related proteinn-WASpneural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome proteinTRAILtumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligandCDDO2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acidb-CDDObiotinylated CDDOb-CDDO-Mebiotinylated CDDO-MeCDDO-ImCDDO-imidazolideDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideDICdifferential interference contrast. complexes through branched actin nucleation, whereas filopodia are formed by formin by progressive unbranched actin nucleation. Although the processes of the two are similar in that they are both activated by small Rho GTPases and a nucleation-promoting factor is required for actin polymerization, the key effectors that enable these processes are distinct. For instance, Cdc42 activates neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (n-WASp), which in turn promotes nucleation and branched actin polymerization, whereas the activation of the RhoA induces formin-dependent unbranched actin polymerization. Interestingly, Rac1, another small Rho GTPase, has been shown to be involved both indirectly and directly in branched and unbranched actin polymerization, respectively. The understanding of the two distinct actin polymerization processes is crucial in understanding how cell migration is coordinated with other key cellular processes.Because cell migration is a precursor event of cancer metastasis, chemotherapeutic agents that block cell migration have been an important focus in the field of cancer chemotherapy. Recently, the parental synthetic oleanane triterpenoid (CDDO) and its more potent derivatives (CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me) have been suggested to be promising therapeutic agents. Specifically, CDDO and its methyl ester (CDDO-Me) and imidazolide (CDDO-Im) derivatives have been shown to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis (4Ahmad R. Raina D. Meyer C. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

However, even though recent studies have shown that CDDO-Im is highly effective in various cancer cell lines and animal studies for inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis, the effect of the synthetic triterpenoids on cell migration and metastasis remains unclear. Thus far, CDDO-Im has been shown to target proteins at the leading edge of the cells and cause the disruption of the microtubule network through a mechanism that differs from microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as nocodazole (49To C.

However, the molecular target(s) of this inhibition remain(s) unknown and we sought to identify them through the use of mass spectrometry and protein array analyses. For these techniques, we opted to use biotinylated synthetic triterpenoids that could be used for the purification and identification of associated proteins. Because the active nature of the imidazolide side group of CDDO-Im complicated its biotinylation, we used the CDDO and the methyl ester derivative (CDDO-Me) in our studies. CDDO-Me is a suitable substitute as it has been shown to be as potent as the CDDO-Im in many cellular assays (7Gao X. Deeb D. Danyluk A. Media J. Liu Y. Dulchavsky S.A. Gautam S.C. Immunopharmacol.

Briefly, Rat2 fibroblasts were grown to confluence before a “wound” was created by scratching the cells off of the surface of the culture dish. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of synthetic triterpenoids (Fig. 1). Brightfield images were taken at zero time and again after 16 h of incubation at 37 °C to examine whether the rate of cell migration would be affected by CDDO, CDDO-Im, and CDDO-Me (Fig. 1). We observed that cell migration remained relatively unaltered in the presence of 1 μm CDDO, whereas cell migration was inhibited >50% in the presence of either 1 μm CDDO-Im or CDDO-Me (Fig. 1). Indeed, at 1.5 μm, the rate of cell migration in CDDO-Im- and CDDO-Me-treated cells was reduced to 80%, whereas the rate of migration in CDDO-treated cells did not differ from control. Compared with the imidazolide and methyl ester derivatives, the parental CDDO is inactive at 1 μm in inhibiting cell migration and was used as a inactive control in subsequent studies. To address cell toxicity, the drugs were washed out using PBS and the cells were incubated with medium for an additional 24 h. We observed that cells incubated with <5 μm CDDO and ≤1.25 μm CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me migrated and filled the wound (data not shown). This further confirmed that CDDO is ∼10 times less potent than the CDDO-Im and -Me derivatives. These more potent triterpenoids also acted in similar concentration ranges to reduce cell migration.We previously demonstrated that CDDO localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells (49To C. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Sporn M.B. Wrana J.L. Di Guglielmo G.M. J. Biol.

We therefore assessed if CDDO-Me also targets the leading edge of migrating cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. We observed that b-CDDO-Me localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, similar to biotinylated CDDO (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the subcellular localization of CDDO and CDDO-Me is similar.FIGURE 2b-CDDO and b-CDDO-Me target the leading edge of migrating cells. Confluent Rat2 fibroblasts were scratched to create a wound. After incubation for 4 h to allow cell polarization and migration, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibodies (Rac1; green) and biotin, CDDO, biotinylated CDDO (b-CDDO), CDDO-Me, or biotinylated CDDO-Me (b-CDDO-Me) followed by Cy2-labeled anti-mouse antibody and Cy3-labeled streptavidin. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The co-localization of Rac1 (green) with b-CDDO or b-CDDO-Me (red) at the leading edge of migrating cells is indicated (yellow arrowheads).

In the first approach, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based method and proteins that precipitated with b-CDDO or b-CDDO-Me were processed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and trypsinization before being sent for ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 3A). This mass spectrometry method was compared with a protein array approach, which was purchased from Invitrogen. The slide, containing >8000 human purified proteins, was incubated with biotin, biotinylated CDDO, or biotinylated CDDO-Me followed by Alexa Fluor 647-labeled streptavidin. The triterpenoid-binding proteins were then visualized and proteins that bound the biotinylated-CDDO-Me ≥2-fold higher than biotin alone were counted as potential triterpenoid-binding targets (data not shown). Using two different proteomic approaches and by comparative analysis, several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration were identified (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Identification of triterpenoid-binding proteins. A, Rat2 fibroblasts were incubated with DMSO, 10 μm biotin, 10 μm biotinylated-CDDO, or 10 μm biotinylated CDDO-Me, lysed, and incubated with neutravidin-agarose beads. SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed and proteins that were uniquely stained in biotinylated CDDO-Me-treated samples were excised from the gel, trypsinized, and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry.

C, Rat2 fibroblasts were incubated with DMSO, 10 μm biotin, 10 μm b-CDDO, or 10 μm b-CDDO-Me, lysed, and incubated with neutravidin-agarose beads. Precipitated samples (left panels) were processed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for cytoskeletal proteins (anti-β-tubulin and anti-actin).

Consistent with previously published results (55Couch R.D. Ganem N.J. Zhou M. Popov V.M. Honda T. Veenstra T.D. Sporn M.B. Anderson A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we found that tubulin interacts with the b-CDDO-Me and was also detected to interact with b-CDDO, albeit to a much lower extent. Interestingly, actin, a large component of the cytoskeleton, and actin-related protein 3 (Arp3), were also found to associate with b-CDDO-Me (Figs. 3C and 4A).FIGURE 4Synthetic tritepenoids interact with the Arp2/3 and inhibit branched actin polymerization. A, purified Arp2/3 protein complex (2.5 μg) was incubated with 10 μm biotin or 10 μm b-CDDO-Me for 2 h. An affinity pulldown assay was performed by incubating samples with neutravidin beads for 1 h followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Arp3 antibodies (left panel). Total input was also immunoblotted with Arp3 and shown (right panel). B, Rat2 fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μm biotin or b-CDDO-Me for 2 h before lysis, followed by incubation of streptavidin-agarose beads to precipitate proteins that associated with the biotinylated form of the synthetic triterpenoids. SDS-PAGE was performed followed by immunoblotting for Arp3 with anti-Arp3 antibody (top panel). Fifty μg of protein lysates were also immunoblotted for Arp3 and shown (bottom panel). C, subconfluent Rat2 fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (Control; C), 1 μm CDDO-Im (Im), or 1 μm CDDO-Me (Me) for 2 h before lysis followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Arp3 antibody. The immunoprecipitates (IP; left panel) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-n-WASp, anti-actin, and anti-Arp3 antibodies. Fifty micrograms of total lysates were also immunoblotted for n-WASp, actin, and Arp3 and shown (right panel). Note that the association of Arp3 and n-WASp is not altered by triterpenoid treatment. D, purified Arp2/3 complex and the GST-VCA domain of nWASp were incubated in the absence or presence of triterpenoids and immunoprecipitated with anti-GST antibodies. The immunoprecipitates (IP; left panel) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GST and anti-Arp3 antibodies. Fifty percent of the input was also immunoblotted for GST and Arp3 and shown (right). Note that the association of Arp3 and n-WASp is not altered by triterpenoid treatment. E, purified pyrene-labeled actin was incubated for 1 h on ice to depolymerize actin oligomers. Two μm actin (Actin) or actin in the presence of 13 μm Arp2/3 complex (Arp2/3) and 100 nm VCA domain of n-WASp protein (VCA) were incubated with DMSO, 50 or 100 μm of either CDDO-Im (Im) or CDDO-Me (Me). Actin polymerization was measured by pyrene fluorescence and graphed as fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units) versus time (min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another group of proteins identified in our proteomic approaches were modulators of the Rho GTPase family (Fig. 3B). Rho GTPases are a group of G-proteins extensively involved in the establishment of cell polarity and orientation of the cytoskeletal dynamics during cell migration. They are regulated by guanine exchange factors, which promote the activation of small Rho GTPases, and by GTPase activating proteins, which render the protein into its inactive state.The possibility that triterpenoids affect the activity of one or more of the numerous guanine exchange factor and GTPase activating proteins (56Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Kaibuchi K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) was assessed by directly testing the GTP-bound state of Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42. We observed that CDDO-Im only moderately increased Rac1 activity but was ineffective in altering Cdc42 and RhoA activities (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). In addition, affinity pulldown assays using specific antibodies against Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA indicated that b-CDDO-Me does not bind to these small GTPases (supplemental Fig. 1C).CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me Inhibit Branched Actin Polymerization by Targeting Arp3We next directed our attention to molecules that are downstream of GTPases and alter the cytoskeleton and cell migration: molecules that alter the actin cytoskeleton. There are two different actin assembly machineries involved in the formation of actin with different properties in different areas of migrating cells. Arp2/3 complex is involved in the assembly of branched actin at the leading edge of migrating cells, whereas formin is involved in the formation of unbranched actin such as stress fibers (3Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 489-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that the actin stress fibers are largely unaffected by triterpenoid treatment (49To C. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Sporn M.B. Wrana J.L. Di Guglielmo G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2073245743,"Up to one-third of human melanomas are characterized by an oncogenic mutation in the gene encoding the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) NRAS. Ras proteins activate three primary classes of effectors, namely, Rafs, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks) and Ral guanine exchange factors (RalGEFs). In melanomas lacking NRAS mutations, the first two effectors can still be activated through an oncogenic BRAF mutation coupled with a loss of the PI3K negative regulator PTEN. This suggests that Ras effectors promote melanoma, regardless of whether they are activated by oncogenic NRas. The only major Ras effector pathway not explored for its role in melanoma is the RalGEF–Ral pathway, in which Ras activation of RalGEFs converts the small GTPases RalA and RalB to an active guanosine triphosphate-bound state. We report that RalA is activated in several human melanoma cancer cell lines harboring an oncogenic NRAS allele, an oncogenic BRAF allele or wild-type NRAS and BRAF alleles. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of RalA, and to a lesser extent of RalB, variably inhibited the tumorigenic growth of melanoma cell lines having these three genotypes. Thus, as is the case for Raf and PI3 K signaling, Rals also contribute to melanoma tumorigenesis."

PKC∈ depletion by RNAi or expression of a dominant negative kinase-dead PKC∈ mutant potentiated the apoptotic response of PMA and sensitized LNCaP cells to the death receptor ligand TNFα.

https://openalex.org/W2065582754,"Mitochondrial membrane potential loss has severe bioenergetic consequences and contributes to many human diseases including myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and neurodegeneration. However, despite its prominence and importance in cellular energy production, the basic mechanism whereby the mitochondrial membrane potential is established remains unclear. Our studies elucidate that complex II-driven electron flow is the primary means by which the mitochondrial membrane is polarized under hypoxic conditions and that lack of the complex II substrate succinate resulted in reversible membrane potential loss that could be restored rapidly by succinate supplementation. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase induced mitochondrial depolarization that was independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family proteins, or high amplitude swelling and could not be reversed by succinate. Importantly, succinate metabolism under hypoxic conditions restores membrane potential and ATP levels. Furthermore, a reliance on complex II-mediated electron flow allows cells from mitochondrial disease patients devoid of a functional complex I to maintain a mitochondrial membrane potential that conveys both a mitochondrial structure and the ability to sequester agonist-induced calcium similar to that of normal cells. This finding is important as it sets the stage for complex II functional preservation as an attractive therapy to maintain mitochondrial function during hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1978746682,"p27 is an atypical tumor suppressor that can regulate the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and G(0)-to-S phase transitions. More recent studies reveal that p27 may also exhibit its tumor-suppressive function through regulating many other essential cellular events. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these anticancer effects of p27 are largely unknown. In this study, we found that depletion of p27 expression by either gene knock-out or knockdown approaches resulted in up-regulation of both Hsp27 and Hsp70 expression at mRNA- and promoter-derived transcription as well as protein levels upon arsenite exposure, indicating that p27 provides a negative signal for regulating the expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70. Consistently, arsenite-induced activation of JNK2/c-Jun and HSF-1 pathways was also markedly elevated in p27 knock-out (p27(-/-)) and knockdown (p27 shRNA) cells. Moreover, interference with the expression or function of JNK2, c-Jun, and HSF-1, but not JNK1, led to dramatic inhibition of arsenite-induced Hsp27 and Hsp70 expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that p27 suppresses Hsp27 and Hsp70 expression at the transcriptional level specifically through JNK2/c-Jun- and HSF-1-dependent pathways upon arsenite exposure, which provides additional important molecular mechanisms for the tumor-suppressive function of p27."
https://openalex.org/W2125526974,"Thymosin β4(Tβ4) is an actin-binding peptide overexpressed in several tumors, including colon carcinomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Tβ4 in promoting the tumorigenic properties of colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs), which are responsible for tumor initiation and growth. We first found that CR-CSCs from different patients have higher Tβ4 levels than normal epithelial cells. Then, we used a lentiviral strategy to down-regulate Tβ4 expression in CR-CSCs and analyzed the effects of such modulation on proliferation, survival, and tumorigenic activity of CR-CSCs. Empty vector-transduced CR-CSCs were used as a control. Targeting of the Tβ4 produced CR-CSCs with a lower capacity to grow and migrate in culture and, interestingly, reduced tumor size and aggressiveness of CR-CSC-based xenografts in mice. Moreover, such loss in tumorigenic activity was accompanied by a significant increase of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and a concomitant reduction of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression, which resulted in a decreased activation of protein kinase B (Akt). Accordingly, exogenous expression of an active form of Akt rescued all the protumoral features lost after Tβ4 targeting in CR-CSCs. In conclusion, Tβ4 may have important implications for therapeutic intervention for treatment of human colon carcinoma.—Ricci-Vitiani, L., Mollinari, C., di Martino, S., Biffoni, M., Pilozzi, E., Pagliuca, A., Chiara de Stefano, M., Circo, R., Merlo, D., De Maria, R., Garaci, E.

https://openalex.org/W2014886648,"Wnt signaling pathways play important roles in various stages of developmental events and several aspects of adult homeostasis. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling has also been associated with several types of cancer. We have recently identified Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) as a novel activator of Wnt signaling through a comprehensive proteomic approach in human colorectal cancer cell lines. TNIK is an activating kinase for T-cell factor-4 (TCF4) and essential for the beta-catenin-TCF4 transactivation and colorectal cancer growth. Here, we report the essential role of TNIK in Wnt signaling during Xenopus development. We found that Xenopus TNIK (XTNIK) was expressed maternally and that the functional knockdown of XTNIK by catalytically inactive XTNIK (K54R) or antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in significant malformations with a complete loss of head and axis structures. XTNIK enhanced beta-catenin-induced axis duplication and the expression of beta-catenin-TCF target genes, whereas knockdown of XTNIK inhibited it. XTNIK was recruited to the promoter region of beta-catenin-TCF target genes in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that XTNIK is an essential factor for the transcriptional activity of the beta-catenin-TCF complex and dorsal axis determination in Xenopus embryos."

Altered calcium handling in these diseases is evidenced by changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction. Mutations in the Ca(2+) sensor, troponin C (TnC), were generated to increase/decrease the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac skinned fibers to create the characteristic effects of DCM, HCM, and RCM. We also used a reconstituted assay to determine the mutation effects on ATPase activation and inhibition. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). Three mutants (S37G, V44Q, and L48Q) were identified with RCM-like properties (a large increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity, partial loss of ATPase inhibition, and increased basal force). Two mutations were identified (E40A and I61Q) with DCM properties (decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force recovery, and activation of the ATPase at high [Ca(2+)]). Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cardiac (c)TnCs containing F27W and did not necessarily mirror the fiber Ca(2+) sensitivity. Circular dichroism of mutant cTnCs revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were as follows: 1) cTnC mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM, and DCM mutations; 2) a region in cTnC associated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers was identified; and 3) the F27W reporter mutation affected Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force, and ATPase activation of some mutants."

A single type of AChE-BChE hybrid tetramer was formed in cell cultures by co-transfection of cDNAs encoding AChET and BChET with proline-rich attachment domain-containing proteins, PRiMA I, PRiMA II, or a fragment of ColQ having a C-terminal GPI addition signal (QN-GPI). Using AChE and BChE mutants, we showed that AChE-BChE hybrids linked with PRiMA or QN-GPI always consist of AChET and BChET homodimers. The dimer formation of AChET and BChET depends on the catalytic domains, and the assembly of tetramers with a proline-rich attachment domain-containing protein requires the presence of C-terminal “t-peptides” in cholinesterase subunits. Our results indicate that PRiMA- or ColQ-linked cholinesterase tetramers are assembled from AChET or BChET homodimers. Moreover, the PRiMA-linked AChE-BChE hybrids occur naturally in chicken brain, and their expression increases during development, suggesting that they might play a role in cholinergic neurotransmission.

Moreover, the PRiMA-linked AChE-BChE hybrids occur naturally in chicken brain, and their expression increases during development, suggesting that they might play a role in cholinergic neurotransmission. In vertebrates, cholinesterases are widespread enzymes present in cholinergic and noncholinergic tissues, as well as in plasma and body fluids (1Massoulié J. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 2Falasca C. Perrier N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 878-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cholinesterases are divided into two classes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 2The abbreviations used are: AChEacetylcholinesteraseBChEbutyrylcholinesteraseGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolColQcollagen QPRADproline-rich attachment domainrratcchickenEnembryonic day n. and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), according to their substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibitors. The main function of AChE is to rapidly hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses, whereas the function of BChE in vertebrates is far less clear, except that it prevents a prolonged neuromuscular blockage after succinylcholine treatment in humans (3Lockridge O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, the survival of AChE knock-out mice suggested that BChE can partially compensate for the absence of AChE in the nervous system (4Xie W. Stribley J.A. Chatonnet A. Wilder P.J. Rizzino A. McComb R.D. Taylor P. Hinrichs S.H. Lockridge O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 896-902PubMed Google Scholar). acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase glycosylphosphatidylinositol collagen Q proline-rich attachment domain rat chicken embryonic day n. At the molecular level, AChE and BChE are found in a number of forms, depending on alternative splicing and on the association with their interacting partners, ColQ and PRiMA (5Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). By alternative splicing in the 3′ region of the primary transcripts, AChE exists as different splice variants that possess the same catalytic domain but differ by small C-terminal peptides (6Massoulié J. Anselmet A. Bon S. Krejci E. Legay C. Morel N. Simon S. J. Physiol. Paris. 1998; 92: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date, there are three known variants in mammals: the AChER variant, which produces a soluble monomer that may be up-regulated in the brain during stress (7Kaufer D. Friedman A. Seidman S. Soreq H. Nature. 1998; 393: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 8Perrier N.A. Salani M. Falasca C. Bon S. Augusti-Tocco G. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the AChEH variant, which produces a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored dimer that is mainly expressed in blood cells in mammals (9Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the AChET variant, which is the only type of catalytic subunit expressed in the brain and muscles (10Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Massoulié J. Bon S. Perrier N. Falasca C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2005; 157–158: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BChE comes as a single variant: BChET, which possesses a C-terminal t-peptide similar to that of AChET (12Liang D. Blouet J.P. Borrega F. Bon S. Massoulié J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The t-peptide of AChET, or BChET, also called the tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domain, contains seven strictly conserved aromatic residues, including three evenly spaced tryptophans and is organized as an α-helix (14Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The major function of the t-peptide is to allow the association of cholinesterase subunits (AChET and BChET) with their structural anchoring proteins: ColQ and PRiMA. Complexes with ColQ represent the collagen-tailed or asymmetric (A) forms in muscle (15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Krejci E. Thomine S. Boschetti N. Legay C. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 11765-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These heteromeric molecules are assembled through the tight coiled-coil association of four tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domains (t-peptides) with a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) of ColQ or PRiMA (21Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Dvir H. Harel M. Bon S. Liu W.Q. Vidal M. Garbay C. Sussman J.L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The C-terminal peptides of AChET and BChET are very similar; this may explain the existence of asymmetric AChE-BChE hybrid molecules (12Liang D. Blouet J.P. Borrega F. Bon S. Massoulié J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); in 1-day-old chicken pectoral muscle, the principal collagen-tailed form of AChE, sedimentating at 20 S, is a mixed oligomer containing both AChET and BChET subunits (12Liang D. Blouet J.P. Borrega F. Bon S. Massoulié J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that is associated with ColQ. The BChET subunits of this 20 S hybrid cholinesterase progressively disappear during muscle development from embryo to adult, ultimately resulting in an homogeneous asymmetric AChE form (24Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2451-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether PRiMA could organize AChET and BChET subunits into a PRiMA-linked G4 hybrid molecule. In a recombinant system, the co-expression of AChET and BChET subunits never produced hybrid (mixed) dimers. However, when both cholinesterase subunits were co-expressed with PRiMA, we obtained one type of AChE-BChE hybrid tetramer, as well as PRiMA-linked AChE and BChE homotetramers. Several lines of evidence suggest that the hybrids are always composed of two AChET subunits and two BChET subunits, associated with one PRiMA subunit. Because only AChE or BChE homodimers can be formed, they most probably represent an intermediate in the assembly of (AChET)2-(BChET)2-PRiMA hybrids. As expected, the t-peptides of AChET and BChET play a critical role in their tetrameric association with the PRAD-containing protein PRiMA. In addition, PRiMA-linked AChE-BChE hybrid molecules were found in chicken brain. In contrast with the collagen-tailed AChE-BChE hybrids in muscle, the expression level of PRiMA-linked hybrid molecules increased during development in the brain, suggesting a physiological role in the nervous system. A human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line (HEK293T) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 incubator. All of the reagents for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen. The cDNAs encoding for human AChET, BChET, AChEBChE-T (AChE catalytic subunit with a BChE t-peptide), BChEAChE-T (BChE catalytic subunit with an AChE t-peptide), AChEΔT, and BChEΔT (catalytic subunits lacking t-peptides) were subcloned in pGS vectors, under a CMV promoter, as described previously (12Liang D. Blouet J.P. Borrega F. Bon S. Massoulié J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding full-length rat AChE and the full-length mouse PRiMA I, tagged with an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus, were subcloned into pEF-BOS vectors, driven by the EF-1α promoter (18Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Noureddine H. Carvalho S. Schmitt C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol.

The cDNA encoding full-length chicken AChET was subcloned in a pcDNA3 vector under a CMV promoter (26Gough N.R. Randall W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also used cDNAs encoding mouse PRiMA II (19Perrier N.A. Khérif S. Perrier A.L. Dumas S. Mallet J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal fragment of ColQ, which was linked to a GPI addition signal (QN-GPI) in pEF-BOS vectors (14Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNA constructs by calcium phosphate precipitation, 1 day after the cells were plated (27Choi R.C. Leung P.W. Dong T.T. Wan D.C. Tsim K.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 217: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were collected 2 days after the transfection. The media were discarded, because they contained very little or no cholinesterase activity in this cellular system, in contrast with COS cells (2Falasca C. Perrier N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 878-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two days after the transfection, the cell cultures were collected in low salt lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) with the addition of the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm pepstatin, and 2.5 mm benzamidine HCl. The homogenization was done by vortexing for 10 min, and the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Frozen tissues from chicken were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold low salt lysis buffer, and the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Separation of the various molecular forms of AChE and BChE was performed by sucrose density gradient analysis, as described previously (27Choi R.C. Leung P.W. Dong T.T. Wan D.C. Tsim K.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 217: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, continuous sucrose gradients (5–20%), created in a detergent-containing buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Brij-97, and 1 m or 150 mm NaCl), were prepared in 12-ml polyallomer ultracentrifugation tubes with a 0.4-ml cushion of 60% sucrose at the bottom. The samples of cell extracts (0.2 ml) containing equal amounts of protein were mixed with the sedimentation markers, alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) and β-galactosidase (16 S), and loaded onto the gradients to be centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH 641 rotor at 4 °C for 16 h. Approximately 45 fractions were collected. AChE and BChE enzymatic activities were determined according to the method of Ellman et al. (29Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21508) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For AChE assay, the cell lysates were incubated with 0.1 mm tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide for 10 min to inhibit chicken BChE activity or 40 μm ethopropazine for 10 min to inhibit mammalian BChE. Samples of ∼5–20 μl were then added to the reaction mixture with final concentrations of 0.625 mm acetylthiocholine iodide (Sigma) and 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma) in 80 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4). The increase in absorbance at 410 nm was recorded, and the specific enzyme activity was expressed as absorbance units/min/μg of protein. BChE activity was assayed in a similar manner, except that the lysates were preincubated with 20 μm BW284c51 (an inhibitor of AChE; Sigma) for 10 min, and the substrate was 0.625 mm butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCh; Sigma). The assays for both enzymes were highly specific (supplemental Fig. S1A). The amounts of the various AChE or BChE forms were determined by summation of the enzymatic activities corresponding to the peaks of their respective sedimentation profiles. The sedimentation values of the enzymes were calculated from the positions of the markers, alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase, as described previously (12Liang D. Blouet J.P. Borrega F. Bon S. Massoulié J. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Five hundred μl of G2 or G4 fractions, obtained from the sucrose density gradients, were incubated with anti-mammalian AChE antibody E-19 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-mammalian BChE antibody N-15 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-chicken AChE monoclonal antibody (3D10, 1:200, purified at 2 μg/ml) (15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. These anti-AChE and anti-BChE antibodies are highly specific and did not cross-react with BChE and AChE, respectively. Each sample was added with 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein G beads were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge tube and washed three times with ice-cold extraction buffer. The supernatant was discarded by careful aspiration, and the protein G beads were then subjected to enzymatic assays for either AChE or BChE. Fractions containing dimers (G2) and tetramers (G4) obtained from the sucrose density gradients were subjected to horizontal nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (30Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The gel contained 7.5% polyacrylamide, 0.5 m glycine-Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 0.25% Triton X-100, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and was run at 400 V for 5 h. The enzymes were visualized by the histochemical method of Karnovsky and Roots (31Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar). The staining solution contained 150 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mm sodium citrate, 3 mm CuSO4, and 0.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The activity of AChE was visualized by adding 40 μm ethopropazine (BChE inhibitor) and 1 mg/ml acetylthiocholine iodide; BChE activity was visualized by adding 20 μm BW284c51 (AChE inhibitor) and 1 mg/ml BTCh iodide. For electrophoresis in denaturing but nonreducing conditions, the G2 or G4 fractions obtained from the sucrose density gradients were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 2% SDS and separated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE. For standard SDS-PAGE, the protein lysate was denatured in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Anti-mammalian AChE antibody E-19 (1:2,000), anti-mammalian BChE antibody N-15 (1:2,000), anti-chicken AChE antibody (1:5,000), and anti-HA antibody (1:5,000) were used for Western blot analyses. The immune complexes were visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). To verify the presence of HA-labeled PRiMA in cholinesterase tetramers, 0.2 ml of G4 fractions from AChET, BChET, and PRiMA I-HA triple transfected cell lysate were incubated for 4 h at room temperature at different doses of anti-HA antibody (1:100, 1:500, 1:2,500, and 1:12,500 dilutions; Sigma). Then 30 μl of washed protein-G agarose was added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were loaded onto nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and different G4 enzymes were visualized by enzymatic activity staining as described above. Another method to prove that these tetramers are PRiMA-linked was by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. The three bands corresponding to G4 AChET, G4 BChET, and G4 hybrid molecules in the G4 fractions of AChET, BChET, and PRiMA I-HA triple transfected cell lysate were isolated from nondenaturing gel. The gels were chopped into small pieces and boiled at 100 °C for 10 min in a buffer containing 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant containing the protein extracts was used for denaturing reducing SDS-PAGE and was plotted with anti-HA antibody (1:5000). Ninety μl of G2 and G4 fractions of AChE or BChE obtained from the sucrose density gradients were mixed with 10 μl of 10× incubation buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 5% Triton). 1 mm PMSF was added to inhibit protease activity. The reaction was incubated with 0.5 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C. After the addition of nonreducing SDS gel loading buffer, the samples were boiled for 5 min and applied to nonreducing electrophoresis. The anti-chicken AChE antibody was diluted to 10 μg/ml in coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.5), and 50-μl aliquots were dispensed into each well of 96-well ELISA plate (Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplate, Roskilde, Denmark). The plates were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Samples of tissue lysates with equal amounts of AChE activity from chicken cerebrum at different developmental stages were loaded on anti-AChE antibody-precoated ELISA plates. After 4 h, the plates were washed three times. The amount of AChE and BChE activities immobilized on the well surface was assayed directly in the wells with the Ellman reagents, described above. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) with a kit from Bio-Rad. To investigate whether AChET and BChET could form a hybrid oligomer in vitro, cultured HEK293T fibroblast cells, possessing very low levels of endogenous AChE and BChE activities, were employed as an expression system. The cDNAs encoding human AChET and human BChET were single or double expressed with or without mouse PRiMA in cultured HEK293T cells. In the absence of PRiMA, expression of AChET or BChET produced mainly G2 dimers, together with a minor proportion of G1 monomers, forming an overlapping peak in sedimentation profiles, but no G4 tetramers (Fig. 1A). The profiles obtained for each enzyme when they were co-expressed in the cultures were identical to those obtained when they were expressed separately (Fig. 1A), indicating that they did not form AChET-BChET hybrid dimers. The absence of AChET-BChET dimer was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments of G2-enriched fractions collected from sucrose density gradients using anti-AChE (E-19) and anti-BChE (N-15) specific antibodies. Both of these antibodies are highly specific for each enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). No BChE activity was co-precipitated by the anti-AChE antibody, or vice versa, in G2 fractions from double transfected cells (Fig. 1B). The G2 fractions from AChET and BChET singly transfected cells served as controls. In parallel experiments, cultured HEK293T cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding PRiMA I-HA. In the presence of PRiMA I-HA, G4 AChE and G4 BChE (sedimenting at 9.6 and 11 S, respectively) were produced (Fig. 1C). In triple transfected cells expressing both AChET and BChET with PRiMA I-HA, the G4 peaks corresponding to AChE and BChE activities were markedly broader than those observed for AChET or BChET alone and appeared to include a component of intermediate sedimentation coefficient, suggesting the presence of mixed PRiMA-linked tetramers. Immunoprecipitation of the G4 fractions of triple transfected cells showed that AChE activity could be precipitated by the anti-BChE antibody, and BChE activity could be precipitated by the anti-AChE antibody (Fig. 1D). The G4 fractions from cells expressing only AChET or BChET with PRiMA I-HA served as negative controls. These results suggest that AChET and BChET produce only homodimers in the G2 fractions but can associate with PRiMA I into PRiMA I-linked AChET-BChET G4 hybrid molecules. To understand the molecular assembly of the G4 hybrid molecules, the subunit composition was studied by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The G2-enriched fractions, collected from cells expressing AChET, BChET, or both enzymes in the absence of PRiMA, contained only monomers and homodimers. AChET and BChET oligomers were clearly separated; in particular, BChET dimers migrated much slower than AChET dimers (Fig. 2A). In the double transfected cells, we observed only homodimers of both AChET and BChET subunits, but no hybrid dimers that would present an intermediate electrophoretic migration. We analyzed the G4 fractions obtained from cells expressing AChET and/or BChET together with PRiMA I-HA in the same manner. Extracts from double transfected cells showed that PRiMA-linked BChET tetramer migrated more slowly than PRiMA-linked AChET tetramers (Fig. 2B). In the case of triple transfected cells expressing both AChET and BChET with PRiMA I, we observed an additional molecular species, with an intermediate migration between G4 AChE and G4 BChE, which possessed both AChE and BChE activities (Fig. 2B). In addition, the G4 AChE, G4 BChE, and G4 hybrid molecules, detected on the native gel, were depleted by the anti-HA antibody in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that they were PRiMA I-linked (Fig. 2C). The presence of PRiMA I-HA in G4 AChE, G4 BChE, and G4 hybrid enzymes produced by triple transfected cells expressing AChET, BChET, and PRiMA I-HA was further confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2D). The single type of hybrid tetramer that we observed might represent one of the following combinations: (AChET)1-(BChET)3-PRiMA, (AChET)2-(BChET)2-PRiMA, and (AChET)3-(BChET)1-PRiMA. Because AChET and BChET do not form hybrid dimers, the molecular composition of the hybrid tetramer most likely corresponds to one AChET dimer, one BChET dimer, and one PRiMA, i.e. (AChET)2-(BChET)2-PRiMA, excluding the other two combinations. In mammals, PRiMA has two splicing variants, PRiMA I and PRiMA II; PRiMA II differs from PRiMA I by its conspicuously shorter C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The two splice variants appear equivalent in their capacity to anchor tetramers of AChET at the cell surface (19Perrier N.A. Khérif S. Perrier A.L. Dumas S. Mallet J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In our study, we expressed AChET, BChET, and PRiMA II in cultured HEK293T cells. We found that the co-expression of AChET or BChET with PRiMA II produced amphiphilic tetramers of AChE and BChE, in the same way as with PRiMA I (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-AChE or anti-BChE antibodies indicated the formation of AChE and BChE G4 hybrid tetramers when they were co-expressed with PRiMA II (Fig. 3B). In nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, a single molecular species possessing both enzymatic activities migrated between PRiMA II-linked AChET and BChET tetramers (Fig. 3C). Thus, PRiMA II, like PRiMA I, is able to direct the assembly of a hybrid tetramer, i.e. (AChET)2-(BChET)2-PRiMA II, indicating that the intracellular cytoplasmic tail of PRiMA I is not required for this oligomerization process. The first AChE-BChE hybrid molecule was discovered in muscles of a 1-day-old chicken as a ColQ-associated asymmetric form (15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2451-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We did not use the full-length ColQ subunit in the following study, because it forms a highly complex oligomer containing 12 catalytic subunits and three collagenous subunits and because its aggregation properties do not allow analysis by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. An N-terminal fragment of ColQ (QN) has been shown to organize cholinesterase tetramers (21Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Dvir H. Harel M. Bon S. Liu W.Q. Vidal M. Garbay C. Sussman J.L. Massoulié J. Silman I.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we used this fragment, linked with a C-terminal GPI addition signal (QN-GPI). As expected, the expression of QN-GPI with AChET or BChET in HEK293T cells produced QN-linked, cell surface GPI-anchored tetramers (Fig. 3D). Immunoprecipitation and nondenaturing electrophoresis showed that the triple expression of both AChET and BChET with QN-GPI produced a hybrid tetramer, composed of two AChE subunits and two BChE subunits, i.e. (AChET)2-(BChET)2-QN-GPI (Fig. 3, E and F). Therefore, these findings suggest that ColQ-linked A12 hybrid molecules contain three ColQ-linked AChE-BChE tetramers, with equal numbers of AChET and BChET subunits (15Tsim K.W. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both AChET and BChET possess a cysteine residue near the C-terminal extremity of their t-peptide; this residue has been found to participate in the formation of disulfide-linked dimers in asymmetric AChE (28Bon S.

In addition, mouse PRiMA I contains four cysteines upstream of the PRAD (Cys6, Cys13, Cys17, and Cys19 in the mature protein) (25Noureddine H. Carvalho S. Schmitt C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling has emerged as one major pathway allowing cellular adaptation to stress. Recent findings led to the hypothesis that HIF-1α may enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells by a survival-independent mechanism. So far it has not been shown that HIF-1α also directly regulates invasive processes during metastasis in addition to conferring a survival advantage to metastasizing tumor cells. In a hypoxia-tolerant tumor cell line (L-CI.5s), which did not rely on HIF-1 signaling for viability in vitro and in vivo, knockdown of Hif-1α reduced invasiveness of the tumor cells in vitro as well as extravasation and secondary infiltration in vivo. Liver metastases associated induction of proinvasive receptor tyrosine kinase Met phosphorylation as well as gelatinolytic activity were Hif-1α-dependent.

This study uncovers a new survival-independent biological function of HIF-1α contributing to the efficacy of metastases formation. During the metastatic cascade, tumor cells encounter several kinds of microenvironmental stress, namely lack of oxygen and nutrients (1Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIF-1hypoxia-inducible factor-1MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseHGFhepatocyte growth factorDFOdesferrioxamine mesylateshNTnon-targeting shRNA sequenceqRTquantitative RT. is a transcription factor known to mediate the adaptation to microenvironmental stress in general (2Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) as well as during tumor progression in particular (1Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). HIF-1 consists of a constitutively expressed β-subunit and a highly regulated α-subunit that is, under physiological conditions, degraded by the proteasome (3Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 4Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). During stress situations such as hypoxia, HIF-1α is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus where it forms together with HIF-1β the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF-1 (5Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Via its interaction with hypoxia-responsive elements, HIF-1 regulates the expression of molecules such as the major pH-regulating enzyme carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) (6Wykoff C.C. Beasley N.J. Watson P.H. Turner K.J. Pastorek J. Sibtain A. Wilson G.D. Turley H. Talks K.L. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7075-7083PubMed Google Scholar), which allows the metabolic adaptation on the cellular level (7Weidemann A. Johnson R.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 8Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HIF-1 signaling is also a major determinant of adaptation on the tissue level by induction of the “angiogenic switch,” thereby overcoming the limited supply of oxygen and nutrients in expanding neoplasias (1Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M.

Recent findings led us to the hypothesis that HIF-1α not only impacts on metastasis formation by securing survival but also directly impacts on metastasis in a survival-independent manner. This hypothesis was based on the following findings. Reduced levels of HIF-1α correlate with decreased invasive potential of tumor cells in vitro (9Victor N. Ivy A. Jiang B.H. Agani F.H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Fujiwara S. Nakagawa K. Harada H. Nagato S. Furukawa K. Teraoka M. Seno T. Oka K. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1α knock-out reduced primary tumor onset and growth in a transgenic model of cancer initiation (12Liao D. Corle C. Seagroves T.N. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This correlated with a later onset of pulmonary metastasis (12Liao D. Corle C. Seagroves T.N. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutive expression of HIF-1α has been shown to enhance bone metastasis in a breast cancer model (13Hiraga T. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hirota K. Hiraoka M. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4157-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although these data have suggested that HIF-1α increases the metastatic potential of tumor cells, recent reviews by Bertout et al. (14Bertout J.A. Patel S.A. Simon M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and Ruan et al. (15Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) have pointed out that it has so far remained unclear whether HIF-1α regulates tumor cell invasiveness directly in vivo and, if so, which molecular mechanisms determine this metastasis-promoting function (14Bertout J.A. Patel S.A. Simon M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 15Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The difficulty in clarifying this topic has been caused mainly by the fact that under microenvironmental stress, the survival of tumor cells usually depends on HIF-1 signaling (16Semenza G.L. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Consequently, so far, it could not be excluded that reduced metastasis upon HIF-1α depletion was simply a reflection of decreased survival. To elucidate whether HIF-1α only promotes metastasis by securing survival (8Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 16Semenza G.L. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 17Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar) or whether HIF-1α really promotes the invasive potential of tumor cells as one specific hallmark of cancer (17Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar), it is advantageous to use a hypoxia-tolerant tumor cell line, which does not rely on HIF-1 signaling for survival under hypoxic conditions. Several studies have proposed a link between HIF-1 signaling and the expression of proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (10Fujiwara S. Nakagawa K. Harada H. Nagato S. Furukawa K. Teraoka M. Seno T. Oka K. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Int. J. Oncol. 2007; 30: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shyu K.G. Hsu F.L. Wang M.J. Wang B.W. Lin S. Exp.

Oncol. 2007; 16: S25-S27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is of great relevance as the invasive steps of tumor progression are characterized by imbalances in the “protease web,” comprising the complex network of proteases, their inhibitors, and effector molecules (20Krüger A. Kates R.E. Edwards D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Overall C.M. Kleifeld O. Nat. Rev.

Specifically, up-regulation of MMP-9 in the tumor microenvironment (23Gerg M. Kopitz C. Schaten S. Tschukes A. Kahlert C. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Edwards D.R. Brand K. Krüger A. Mol.

Cancer. 2007; 121: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) accounts for the degradation of the basal membrane and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to clear the path for tumor cells during the invasive steps of metastasis (25Björklund M. Koivunen E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 37-69PubMed Google Scholar). Another important mediator of tumor cell scattering from already established metastases is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling pathway (26Benvenuti S. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2007; 213: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), initiated by binding of HGF, originally also described as the “scatter factor” (27Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Vigna E. Gaudino G. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Narsimhan R.P. Hartmann G. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. et al.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2867-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), to its receptor MET. MET expression was shown to be up-regulated by elevated levels of HIF-1α (28Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Taken together, HIF-1α may be able to act as a promoter of tumor cell invasion via both ways, the induction of proteolytic activity as well as triggering HGF signaling. The L-CI.5s murine T-lymphoma cell line (29Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. von Hoegen P. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was shown here to be independent from HIF-1 signaling for survival under hypoxic conditions, therefore representing the necessary model to study the effects of HIF-1α on invasiveness of tumor cells without interference with survival. We here were able to show for the first time that Hif-1α knockdown in tumor cells indeed drastically reduced their invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. HIF-1α knockdown reduced the efficacy of extravasation, formation of metastatic colonies, and secondary infiltration from established metastases. Decreased proteolytic activity in primary tumors and metastases upon Hif-1α knockdown in tumor cells correlated with diminished expression of Mmp-9 in vivo and reduced mmp-9 promoter activity in vitro. Furthermore, Hif-1α deficiency impaired HGF signaling. Similar antimetastatic effects of Hif-1α knockdown were shown in a lung metastasis model of CT-26L murine colon carcinoma cells. Taking into consideration that HIF-1 signaling is detected in a large variety of cancers (30Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar) and often correlates with poor prognosis (31Yamamoto Y. Ibusuki M. Okumura Y. Kawasoe T. Kai K. Iyama K. Iwase H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our findings support the usefulness of HIF-1α-directed therapies in advanced tumor disease. 293T (32DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) as well as lacZ-tagged L-CI.5s (29Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. von Hoegen P. Int.

Cancer. 1983; 31: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. Stable knockdown of HIF-1α was achieved by lentiviral gene transfer of two shRNAs (shHIF-1α, TRCN0000054450; shHIF-1α_2, TRCN0000054451). A control cell line was generated by lentiviral gene transfer of a non-targeting shRNA sequence (shNT) that does not target any murine gene. Plasmids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Deisenhofen, Germany. Lentiviruses were generated using respective plasmids and the ViraPowerTM lentiviral expression system (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Transduction was done as described previously (23Gerg M. Kopitz C. Schaten S. Tschukes A. Kahlert C. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Edwards D.R. Brand K. Krüger A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 5 × 103 L-CI.5s-shNT or L-CI.5s-shHIF-1α cells were inoculated into the tail vein of pathogen-free, immune-competent, syngeneic female DBA/2 mice. To analyze extravasation events during liver metastasis, 2 × 106 tumor cells were inoculated. In a second assay, pathogen-free, immune-competent, syngeneic female BALB/C mice were injected i.v. with 1 × 106 CT-26L cells. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and livers and lungs were removed. The right lung lobe as well as three samples of each liver were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for biochemical analysis. For histological analyses, two samples of each liver were analogously conserved or fixed in alcohol and then paraffin-embedded. Remaining liver and lung tissue was used for X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galatopyranoside) staining (see below). 1 × 105 L-CI.5s-shNT or L-CI.5s-shHIF-1α were injected intradermally in the flank of DBA/2 mice. Primary tumor growth was documented using a caliper. Mice were sacrificed at primary tumor diameters of 7 mm, and primary tumors, livers, and lungs were removed. Half of the primary tumor was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for biochemical analysis. The rest was fixed in alcohol and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. Livers and lungs were removed and treated as described above. All animal experiments were done in compliance with the guidelines of the Tierschutzgesetz des Landes Bayern. Paraffin-embedded liver sections were dewaxed and rehydrated as described previously (34Kopitz C. Gerg M. Bandapalli O.R. Ister D. Pennington C.J. Hauser S. Flechsig C. Krell H.W. Antolovic D. Brew K. Nagase H. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Brand K. Coussens L.M. Edwards D.R. Krüger A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For antigen retrieval, liver slices were cooked in citrate buffer (pH = 6.0) for 15 min. Immunostaining was performed according to the staining kit (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) or proliferating nuclear antigen (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), respectively. Apoptosis assay on liver and primary tumor sections was performed with the TACSTM terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase kit (R&D Systems). In situ zymography was done as described previously (35Krüger A. Arlt M.J. Gerg M. Kopitz C. Bernardo M.M. Chang M. Mobashery S. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3523-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Complete liver and lung lobes were stained with X-gal (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) as described previously (29Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. von Hoegen P. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indigo blue multicellular foci on the liver surface >0.2 mm were qualified as metastases and counted. For X-gal staining of frozen liver slices (8 μm), tissue was fixed in PBS containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, washed in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, and incubated in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet-P40 for 10 min each. Then, the slices were incubated for 12 h with X-gal as described earlier (29Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. von Hoegen P. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After counterstaining with eosin, slices were mounted with glycerin-gelatin. To quantify the metastatic burden in the liver 3 and 6 h after tumor cell inoculation, single indigo blue-stained tumor cells were counted, and their number was normalized to the area of the section. To analyze tumor cell density in metastases, tumor cells were counted inside metastatic foci, and their number was normalized to the area of metastasis. RNA was isolated using PureYieldTM RNA Midiprep system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Reverse transcription was done with a High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). qRT-PCR was performed as described previously (36Arlt M. Kopitz C. Pennington C. Watson K.L. Krell H.W. Bode W. Gansbacher B. Khokha R. Edwards D.R. Krüger A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5543-5550PubMed Google Scholar) using primers and probes from Applied Biosystems. For the alamarBlue® cell viability assay (Invitrogen), L-CI.5s and CT-26L cells were seeded and cultured under normoxic (21% (v/v) O2) or hypoxic (1% (v/v) O2) conditions and counted 6, 24, and 48 h after seeding. According to standard cell culture conditions used for these assays, we cultivated cells under normoxic conditions at 21% O2. Although these conditions are rather hyperoxic and do not reflect normoxia on the tissue level, the conditions of 21% O2 and 1% O2 are suitable to activate HIF-1 signaling (4Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). For the Boyden chamber invasion assay, 2 × 106 tumor cells were seeded in serum-free medium in 6.5 mm Transwell® inserts with a pore size of 3 μm (Corning, Corning, NY), which had been coated with 78 μg/cm2 Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). Medium with FCS were given in the lower chamber of the assay. 48 h later, L-CI.5s cells in the lower chamber were counted. mmp-9 promoter activity was analyzed using a chimeric luciferase-MMP-9 promoter construct (37Estève P.O. Robledo O. Potworowski E.F. St-Pierre Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cloned into the pLenti vector (Invitrogen) according to standard protocols. Transduction was performed as described above. 2 × 106 L-CI.5s cells were cultured for 20 h with or without supplementation of 100 μm desferrioxamine mesylate (DFO) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie), RNA was isolated, and luciferase mRNA levels were assessed (see above). Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test when data were normally distributed. Otherwise, Mann-Whitney U rank sum test was used. p < 0.05 was considered significant. First, we assessed whether Hif-1α knockdown in L-CI.5s cells (knockdown efficacy: −90% on mRNA level as compared with the shNT control) influenced their survival in vitro. We quantified tumor cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions at several time points. The number of tumor cells was drastically diminished under hypoxia (Fig. 1A). However, Hif-1α knockdown reduced the number of tumor cells neither under hypoxia nor under normoxia (Fig. 1A), indicating that L-CI.5s cells did not require Hif-1α for survival. Next, we tested whether lack of Hif-1α reduced the invasiveness of L-CI.5s cells in vitro under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hif-1α knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of invasiveness under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). Importantly, even under normoxia, L-CI.5s cells were less invasive upon Hif-1α knockdown (Fig. 1B). Taken together, Hif-1α regulated the invasiveness of L-CI.5s cells in vitro in a survival-independent manner under both normoxia and hypoxia. In vivo, the metastatic index, which normalized the number of liver metastases to the diameter of primary tumors, was significantly reduced when Hif-1α-deficient tumor cells had been inoculated (Fig. 1C). In line with our in vitro results, we also observed no changes in primary tumor growth (Fig. 1D), indicating that survival of L-CI.5s cells was not affected by lack of Hif-1α. To overcome the limitation of spontaneous metastasis assays, i.e. not knowing how many tumor cells dissociate from a primary tumor at a given time point, we performed an experimental liver metastasis assay where we inoculated a defined number of tumor cells in the tail vein. qRT-PCR revealed that Hif-1α mRNA levels in the liver continuously ascended during colonization of this target organ of metastasis (Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemical analysis documented a strong staining for Hif-1α protein mainly in tumor cells located in the center of metastases (Fig. 2B). By combining immunohistochemistry with X-gal staining to identify L-CI.5s cells (29Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. von Hoegen P. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we elucidated the presence of Hif-1α in the nucleus of tumor cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting activation of HIF-1 signaling. To determine the ability of the lacZ-tagged tumor cells to extravasate and to lodge in the liver parenchyma, invaded single tumor cells were counted at 3 and 6 h after their inoculation. At both time points, the number of tumor cells lacking Hif-1α in the liver was significantly lower (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Hif-1α mediated tumor cell extravasation. Importantly, Hif-1α mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. 1A) as well as the expression of the HIF-1 target gene (6Wykoff C.C. Beasley N.J. Watson P.H. Turner K.J. Pastorek J. Sibtain A. Wilson G.D. Turley H. Talks K.L. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7075-7083PubMed Google Scholar) CAIX (supplemental Fig. 1B) were induced at 6 h after tumor cell inoculation. To elucidate the impact of Hif-1α deficiency on further progression of liver metastasis, we measured the tumor cell burden at 3 days after their inoculation. A significant decrease of the metastatic load was detected with tumor cells lacking Hif-1α (Fig. 3B). Also, a significantly reduced number of metastatic foci was found at day 7 after tumor cell inoculation (Fig. 3C). This result was confirmed with a second shRNA against Hif-1α (knockdown efficacy: −80% on mRNA level as compared with the shNT control) (supplemental Fig. 2A).FIGURE 3A, number of invaded tumor cells per mm2 of liver parenchyma ± S.

Staining for the proliferating nuclear antigen revealed that proliferation of L-CI.5s cells within metastases was not affected by lack of Hif-1α (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, TUNEL and caspase-3 analysis showed no difference in apoptosis between tumor cells with and without Hif-1α expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, in analogy to the in vitro data (Fig. 1A) and the primary tumor growth (Fig. 1D), neither proliferation nor apoptosis of L-CI.5s cells in the liver was affected by Hif-1α knockdown. Measuring the mean diameter of established metastases revealed a significantly reduced size of metastatic foci upon Hif-1α knockdown (Fig. 5A). To clarify this finding, we counted the number of tumor cells within metastatic foci, revealing increased tumor cell density in metastases when Hif-1α was knocked down (Fig. 5B). X-Gal staining of liver lobes suggested that the increased compactness of metastases upon Hif-1α knockdown was due to decreased secondary invasion emanating from established metastases (Fig. 5C). As HGF signaling is known to be an important mediator of tumor cell scattering, we analyzed metastatic foci for Met phosphorylation. Indeed, lack of Hif-1α, as achieved by both shRNAs used, drastically reduced activation of this pathway within liver metastases (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. 2B), providing one explanation for decreased tumor cell scattering upon Hif-1α ablation. As secondary invasion of L-CI.5s cells depends on MMP-9 expression (23Gerg M. Kopitz C. Schaten S. Tschukes A. Kahlert C. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Edwards D.R. Brand K. Krüger A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we tested whether lack of Hif-1α interfered with gelatinolytic activity. In situ zymography indicated that Hif-1α deficiency, as achieved by both shRNAs used, indeed reduced gelatinolytic activity in metastases (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 3A). To reveal whether Hif-1α-dependent gelatinolytic activity relied on mmp-9 expression in tumor cells, we employed an MMP-9 luciferase promoter construct. Induction of HIF-1 signaling in vitro by the HIF-1 signaling inducer DFO (38Nguyen M.V. Pouvreau S. El Hajjaji F.Z. Denavit-Saubie M. Pequignot J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) drastically increased mmp-9 promoter activity in the L-CI.5s-shNT cells (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 3B). Hif-1α knockdown drastically diminished induction of mmp-9 promoter activity in vitro, which was stimulated by DFO (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 3B). This indicated that Hif-1α took part in the regulation of mmp-9 expression. qRT-PCR analysis showed that mmp-9 expression (supplemental Fig. 1C) as well as gelatinolytic activity in metastases correlated with Hif-1α mRNA levels and signaling also in vivo (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that Hif-1α regulated invasion of tumor cells into the liver at least in part by inducing mmp-9 expression. Next, we hypothesized that the observed reduction of spontaneous liver metastasis (Fig. 1C) also relied on decreased gelatinolytic activity and mmp-9 expression at the primary site. Indeed, in situ zymography and qRT-PCR revealed a decreased gelatinolytic activity (Fig. 6C) and reduced mmp-9 mRNA levels (Fig. 6D) in the primary tumor, again documenting an important role of MMP-9 in mediating HIF-1α-dependent invasion. We then tested whether the observed impact of Hif-1α on tumor cell invasiveness by regulating the activity of gelatinolytic enzymes can be extended to conventional tumor models where survival is dependent on HIF-1 signaling. We employed the murine colon carcinoma cell line CT-26L, which can be tested in experimental metastasis assays in syngeneic BALB/C mice. In vitro, Hif-1α knockdown drastically reduced survival of these tumor cells under hypoxia (Fig. 7B), whereas their survival was not affected under normoxia (Fig. 7A). Consequently, the observed drastic reduction of lung metastases formation (Fig. 7C) upon Hif-1α knockdown could in part be attributed to reduced tumor cell survival in vivo. However, despite this interference with tumor cell survival, lack of Hif-1α also led to a strong reduction of gelatinolytic activity within lung metastases (Fig. 7D). Recent findings (9Victor N.

Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hirota K. Hiraoka M. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4157-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) led us to the hypothesis that HIF-1α increases the metastatic potential of tumor cells in a survival-independent manner. Based on these findings, Bertout et al. (14Bertout J.A. Patel S.A. Simon M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and Ruan et al. (15Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) have also pointed out that it has so far remained unclear whether HIF-1α regulates tumor cell invasiveness directly in vivo (14Bertout J.A. Patel S.A. Simon M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and, if so, which molecular mechanisms determine this metastasis-promoting function (15Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The reason for the difficulty in clarifying this topic until now has been the dependence of most tumor cell lines on HIF-1 signaling for survival (16Semenza G.L. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 39Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). By using a hypoxia-tolerant tumor cell line, here we were able to identify a survival-independent role of Hif-1α in enhancing the metastatic potential of tumor cells, namely its ability to regulate invasive processes in vivo via induction of Met signaling and Mmp-9. It has been known for a long time that HIF-1α takes part in the cellular adaptation to stress situations such as lack of oxygen and nutrients (40Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). However, various studies suggest that HIF-1α not only regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, and angiogenesis (40Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar) but also induces tumor cell invasiveness under hypoxic conditions in vitro (9Victor N. Ivy A. Jiang B.H. Agani F.H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Fujiwara S. Nakagawa K. Harada H. Nagato S. Furukawa K. Teraoka M. Seno T. Oka K. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Int. J. Oncol. 2007; 30: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krishnamachary B. Berg-Dixon S. Kelly B. Agani F. Feldser D. Ferreira G. Iyer N. LaRusch J. Pak B. Taghavi P. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar), thereby meeting one important hallmark of cancer (17Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar). Liao et al. (12Liao D. Corle C. Seagroves T.N. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) showed that lack of HIF-1α resulted in delayed tumor onset, reduced tumor growth, and a diminished number of blood vessels, leading to a later onset of lung metastasis of the spontaneous PymT-model. Other studies elucidated that HIF-1α depletion reduced the size of experimental bone metastases of a human breast carcinoma cell line in nude mice (13Hiraga T. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hirota K. Hiraoka M. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4157-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of HIF-1α by a synthetic inhibitor blocked outgrowth of pulmonary metastases of a human lung carcinoma in an experimental xenograft metastasis assay (41Dikmen Z.G. Gellert G.C. Dogan P. Yoon H. Lee Y.B. Ahn C.H. Shay J.W. J. Cell Biochem. 2008; 104: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, these studies could not resolve whether the antitumorigenic and antimetastatic effect of HIF-1α deficiency can only be attributed to decreased survival of tumor cells within unfavorable microenvironments or whether HIF-1α directly impacts on tumor cell invasiveness in vivo, e.g. via induced expression of prometastatic genes and subsequent prometastatic modulation of the tumor microenvironment (15Ruan K. Song G. Ouyang G. J. Cell Biochem. 2009; 107: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The impact of HIF-1α on the functional capabilities of tumor cells, survival and invasiveness, which are essential for metastasis, can therefore only be dissected by using a hypoxia-tolerant tumor cell line that does not rely on HIF-1 signaling for its survival. In contrast to the tumor cell lines, which all depend on HIF-1 signaling for survival under hypoxic conditions (42Akakura N. Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 2001; 76: 375-384PubMed Google Scholar, 43Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar, 44Chen C. Yu Z. Anticancer Res. 2009; 29: 1367-1372PubMed Google Scholar), L-CI.5s cells did not rely on this pathway as lack of HIF-1α in these cells did not alter survival in vitro neither under normoxic nor under hypoxic conditions. Regarding tumor cell invasiveness in vitro, L-CI.5s were absolutely comparable with the sensitivity of the other tumor cell lines to lack of Hif-1α (9Victor N. Ivy A. Jiang B.H. Agani F.H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Krishnamachary B. Berg-Dixon S. Kelly B. Agani F. Feldser D. Ferreira G. Iyer N. LaRusch J. Pak B. Taghavi P. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar). L-CI.5s tumor cells also showed, upon Hif-1α knockdown, reduced spontaneous metastasis, an effect that is also observed in other tumor models (12Liao D. Corle C. Seagroves T.N. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). By using an experimental metastasis assay in which the inoculated L-CI.5s turned out to be independent from HIF-1 signaling for survival even in vivo, we here uncovered for the first time that HIF-1α is directly involved in the invasive phases of metastasis without interference with survival. Increased expression of Hif-1α and CAIX, which is a well known downstream target (6Wykoff C.C. Beasley N.J. Watson P.H. Turner K.J. Pastorek J. Sibtain A. Wilson G.D. Turley H. Talks K.L. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7075-7083PubMed Google Scholar), as well as nuclear staining of Hif-1α in tumor cells documented the induction of HIF-1 signaling during these early invasive phases of metastasis. Consequently, knockdown of Hif-1α reduced the ability of L-CI.5s cells to lodge in the liver during these early phases. Furthermore, Hif-1α expression was also up-regulated at days 7–9 after tumor cell inoculation, representing the time point of secondary invasion of scattered tumor cells throughout the liver parenchyma (23Gerg M. Kopitz C. Schaten S. Tschukes A. Kahlert C. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Edwards D.R. Brand K. Krüger A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, at these time points, knockdown of Hif-1α drastically reduced invasive events emanating from established metastases into the surrounding liver parenchyma. Furthermore, we could identify two mechanisms by which HIF-1α could influence the metastatic potential of tumor cells. First, reduced occurrence of metastases upon Hif-1α knockdown correlated with drastically decreased gelatinolytic activity in primary tumors and metastases. As the gelatinase MMP-9 is a known mediator of tumor cell invasion (25Björklund M. Koivunen E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 37-69PubMed Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to be the crucial gelatinase for the invasive steps of metastasis (23Gerg M. Kopitz C. Schaten S. Tschukes A. Kahlert C. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L. Edwards D.R. Brand K. Krüger A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Gorden D.L. Fingleton B. Crawford H.C. Jansen D.E. Lepage M. Matrisian L.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the fact that its expression correlated with Hif-1α expression suggests that HIF-1α was involved in promoting MMP-9-dependent metastasis. Using a model of experimental lung metastasis of a murine colon carcinoma (CT-26L) (33Lerner W.A. Pearlstein E. Ambrogio C. Karpatkin S. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we further obtained evidence that Hif-1α-dependent peritumoral gelatinolytic activity was neither restricted to T-lymphoma metastasis nor organ-specific for the liver, although it is important to note that CT-26L cells were dependent on HIF-1 signaling for survival under hypoxic conditions. The revelation that lack of Hif-1α drastically reduced mmp-9 promoter activity in vitro upon induction of HIF-1 signaling by DFO supports the idea of MMP-9 as a HIF-1-regulated gene (45Rankin E.B. Giaccia A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Secondly we observed a reduction of Met signaling activation within metastases upon Hif-1α depletion in L-CI.5s tumor cells. This reduced activation of the proinvasive HGF-Met signaling pathway correlated with a dramatic decrease of secondary invasion during the late phase of metastasis. In principal, both impaired prometastatic mechanisms may account for such inhibition of micro-metastatic spread. Although promotion of tumor cell invasion via HIF-1α-triggered activation of the Met protooncogene and subsequent induction of HGF signaling have already been reported (28Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), here we were able for the first time to establish a link between MMP-9-mediated promotion of micrometastatic spread and HIF-1α-triggered MMP-9 expression. We demonstrate here for the first time with a hypoxia-tolerant tumor cell line that HIF-1α is an important regulator of tumor cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo, thereby confirming our hypothesis that HIF-1α promotes the metastatic potential of tumor cells in a survival-independent manner. Taken together, the results from our study in addition to previous findings that HIF-1 signaling is important for survival of tumor cells explain the negative prognostic role of HIF-1α found in many malignancies (45Rankin E.B. Giaccia A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Consequently, interference with HIF-1 signaling may be a viable approach in the treatment not only of early but also of advanced tumor disease, encouraging further research on HIF-1α as a target for anticancer therapy.

Therefore, peroxisomes possess various β-oxidation enzymes and specialized fatty acid transport systems.

In this study, to identify the substrate-binding sites of these proteins, we synthesized a photoreactive palmitic acid analogue bearing a diazirine moiety as a photophore, and performed photoaffinity labeling of purified rat liver peroxisomes. As a result, an 80-kDa peroxisomal protein was specifically labeled by the photoaffinity ligand, and the labeling efficiency competitively decreased in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA. Mass spectrometric analysis identified the 80-kDa protein as peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE2), one of the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. Recombinant rat MFE2 was also labeled by the photoaffinity ligand, and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that a fragment of rat MFE2 (residues Trp249 to Arg251) was labeled by the ligand. MFE2 mutants bearing these residues, MFE2(W249A) and MFE2(R251A), exhibited decreased labeling efficiency. Furthermore, MFE2(W249G), which corresponds to one of the disease-causing mutations in human MFE2, also exhibited a decreased efficiency. Based on the crystal structure of rat MFE2, these residues are located on the top of a hydrophobic cavity leading to an active site of MFE2.

Fibroblasts from patients with these deficiencies exhibit the disturbed peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), 4The abbreviations used are: VLCFAvery long-chain fatty acidACOXacyl-CoA oxidaseH22E-enoyl-CoA hydrataseHD3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenaseLCFAlong-chain fatty acidMFE1 and MFE2multifunctional enzyme type 1 and type 2PMP7070-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein. and VLCFAs are accumulated in the plasma and tissues of these patients (5Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Analyses of these peroxisomal diseases reflect the importance of the peroxisomal β-oxidation in organisms along with disclosing the enzymatic organization of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system. Peroxisomes are involved in the β-oxidation of VLCFAs, branched chain fatty acids such as pristanic acid, and bile acid intermediates such as dihydroxycholestanoic acid and trihydroxycholestanoic acid, which are incompatible with mitochondrial β-oxidation (6Wanders R.J.

Peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids proceeds via a four-step pathway as in mitochondria, and multiple enzymes are involved in each step of the pathway. The first step of peroxisomal β-oxidation is the desaturation of acyl-CoA to the corresponding 2E-enoyl-CoA. In mammals, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) oxidizes straight chain acyl-CoAs, whereas trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX2) and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX3) oxidize both straight and 2-methyl-branched acyl-CoAs (7Osumi T.

MFE1 hydrates 2E-enoyl-CoA to 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA and subsequently dehydrogenates the 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoAs, which is a naturally occurring pathway in the β-oxidation of straight chain fatty acids (9Osumi T.

MFE2, the other peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme, which also possesses 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, converts the 2E-enoyl-CoA into the corresponding 3-ketoacyl-CoA via a 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate (11Dieuaide-Noubhani M.

MFE2 has a broad substrate spectrum, and is able to hydrate the enoyl-CoA esters of straight chain fatty acids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acids, and bile acid intermediates, and it can dehydrogenate the straight chain and branched chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (14Qin Y.M.

The final step in peroxisomal β-oxidation is the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoAs into chain-shortened acyl-CoAs and acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA. It can be catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase or sterol carrier protein x, which cleaves straight chain ketoacyl-CoAs or both straight and 2-methyl-3-ketoacyl-CoAs, respectively (20Antonenkov V.D.

In terms of the transport of fatty acid derivatives destined for peroxisomal β-oxidation and their metabolites across the peroxisomal membrane, peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette proteins are suggested to be involved in this process.

The enzymatic organization of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system and peroxisomal fatty acid transport system has been made relatively clear. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of these proteins, especially in terms of substrate recognition, are poorly understood. In this study, we synthesized a photoreactive palmitic acid analogue bearing a diazirine moiety as a photophore, and performed a photochemical approach with the novel photoreactive fatty acid analogue to identify fatty acid-binding proteins and analyze the substrate binding of the peroxisomal proteins. pET21a was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pET21a/MFE2 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide primers used were designed on the basis of their sequences (supplemental Table S1). The mutations in the constructions were confirmed by sequencing. Overexpression and purification of recombinant MFE2 was performed as described by Haapalainen et al. (34Haapalainen A.M. Koski M.K. Qin Y.M. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. Structure. 2003; 11: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Details are shown under the supplemental data. The photoprobe (10 nmol) was dissolved in CHCl3, and the solvent was evaporated by nitrogen gas stream to deposit the probe on the wall of glass test tube as a thin film. Binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 2 mg/ml of BSA was then added to make up a 20 μm probe solution and then mixed by vortex. In a typical experiment, rat liver peroxisomes (100 μg of protein) or purified MFE2-His (10 μg of protein) were suspended in a final volume of 0.1 ml of binding buffer. The photoprobe solution was then added to the suspension to a final concentration of 2 μm, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After UV irradiation with 30 W/m2 of 360 nm light for 20 min at 0 °C, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The labeled proteins were detected by a chemiluminescent method using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. After photoaffinity labeling of purified MFE2-His (100 μg of protein), the reaction product was applied onto SoftLink Soft Release Avidin Resin equilibrated with the binding buffer. After incubation of the suspensions for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 250 μl of the binding buffer. Labeled proteins were eluted by 2 × sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (4% (w/v) SDS, 19.8% (v/v) sucrose, 0.08 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm DTT, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and separated on a 5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. After electrophoresis, labeled proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, and then the bands corresponding to the labeled proteins were excised from the membrane. The membrane fragments were incubated for 1 h at 27 °C with reduction buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 8.5, 8 m guanidinium HCl, 0.3%(w/v) EDTA, and 5% acetonitrile) containing 10 mg/ml of DTT and then for 20 min in the same buffer containing 30 mg/ml of iodoacetamide. The S-carboxyamidomethylated sample was soaked in 100 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and 70% acetonitrile), and digested with 2 μg of sequencing-grade modified trypsin for 12 h at 27 °C. The digestion was terminated by the addition of PMSF to 10 μm of the final concentration and the sample was concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). The resulting residue was resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1% TFA. The tryptic peptide mixture was desalted with Zip Tip (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and eluted in 2 μl of 33.3% acetonitrile with 0.06% TFA. The recovered tryptic peptides (1 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33.3% acetonitrile with 0.06% TFA and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Bruker MALDI-TOF AutoFlex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Protein was assayed as described previously (29Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies and a secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Antigen-antibody complex was visualized with ECL+ Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). To identify and characterize long-chain fatty acid (LCFA)-binding proteins in peroxisomes, we synthesized a novel photoreactive LCFA probe 1 (Fig. 1A). The synthetic probe consists of a LCFA, a diazirine-based photophore, and a biotin moiety with a hydrophilic linker. The (3-trifluoromethyl)phenyldiazirine is one of the most promising photophores. By photoirradiation, it produces a carbene species, a highly reactive intermediate, and immediately makes a covalent bond with spatially close molecules. A biotin moiety was directly anchored to the photophore via a hydrophilic linker as a tag for the detection and isolation of labeled proteins utilizing biotin-avidin interaction, and is also useful for identifying the labeled protein and its ligand-interacting site. For preparation of a photoreactive fatty acid analogue, a phenylalanine analogue has been employed to introduce a diazirine photophore with an accompanying carboxylate at the end of palmitic acid (16:0). Preparation of the photoreactive phenylalanine derivative was achieved in excellent yield according to the previous method (35Nakashima H. Hashimoto M. Sadakane Y. Tomohiro T. Hatanaka Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15092-15093Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The coupling reaction with palmitic acid and the subsequent biotinylation to give the corresponding photoreactive fatty acid probe 1 is outlined in Fig. 1B. Using the photoreactive LCFA analogue as a probe, we performed photoaffinity labeling experiments on purified rat liver peroxisomes. Purified rat liver peroxisomes were incubated with the photoreactive fatty acid analogue, and the labeled proteins were separated on a 7–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and then detected by streptavidin-HRP. As shown in Fig. 2, an 80-kDa protein was specifically labeled by the probe upon activation with UV irradiation. The efficiency of the labeling of the 80-kDa protein increased with the irradiation time. In addition to the 80-kDa protein, two bands with molecular masses of 110 and 70 kDa, respectively, were also detected by streptavidin-HRP. However, these two bands were detected even in the non-irradiated sample, suggesting that these two proteins were not photolabeled products, but nonspecifically reacted with streptavidin-HRP. Next, to characterize the binding specificity of the probe to the 80-kDa protein, we examined the competitive effects of palmitoyl-CoA, palmitic acid, and CoA on the photoaffinity labeling of the 80-kDa protein. As shown in Fig. 3A, the probe photoincorporation within the 80-kDa protein was suppressed by the presence of palmitoyl-CoA in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, the labeling was not inhibited even in the presence of an excess amount of palmitic acid or CoA (Fig. 3, B and C). These data indicate that the 80-kDa protein has a potent capacity to interact with palmitoyl-CoA, and the photoreactive LCFA probe could bind to the 80-kDa protein in the region responsible for its palmitoyl-CoA-binding site. In preliminary experiments, the 80-kDa protein labeled by the photoaffinity probe was susceptible to extraction with sodium carbonate, and was protected from digestion with trypsin in the absence of Triton X-100, but degraded by trypsin in the presence of Triton X-100 (data not shown). These behaviors were not similar to those of PMP70, a peroxisomal membrane protein, but resembled those of catalase, a peroxisomal matrix protein, implying that the 80-kDa protein is located in the peroxisomal matrix. To identify the 80-kDa protein, peroxisomes were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 after photoaffinity labeling, and the labeled proteins were isolated by streptavidin-agarose resin. As shown in Fig. 4, the 80-kDa protein was successively purified. The purified probe-incorporated 80-kDa protein was digested with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptide mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As a result, several specific tryptic peptide fragments of the labeled protein were obtained, and the MASCOT search engine revealed that almost all of the major fragments correspond to MFE2-specific tryptic fragments (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to these fragments, a characteristic peak was observed at m/z 1345.81. We assigned the fragment as a photoadduct fragment (details are shown below). Together with MFE2, a 65-kDa protein was also purified by streptavidin-agarose resin (Fig. 4). The 65-kDa protein was indeed labeled by the LCFA probe and the labeling of the 65-kDa protein was competitively inhibited by the presence of palmitoyl-CoA with almost the same extent as that of MFE2 (Fig. 3). Accompanying with intact MFE2, the 65-kDa protein was also detected in the purified rat liver peroxisomes by immunoblotting using anti-MFE2 antibody (data not shown). These data indicate that MFE2 is partially degraded to the 65-kDa protein and the 65-kDa region of MFE2 still possesses a potent capacity to interact with palmitoyl-CoA and the photoreactive LCFA probe. MFE2, also called multifunctional protein 2 or d-bifunctional protein, is a 79-kDa enzyme that possesses a typical peroxisomal matrix protein targeting signal (COOH-terminal Ala-Lys-Leu). MFE2 consists of a 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD) domain, a 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (H2) domain, and a sterol carrier protein 2-like domain, and is known to catalyze the second and third steps of the peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives (36Huyghe S.

https://openalex.org/W2047929075,"Rapid non-genomic effects of 17β-estradiol, the principal circulating estrogen, have been observed in a wide variety of cell types. Here we investigate rapid signaling effects of 17β-estradiol in rat hepatocytes. We show that, above a threshold concentration of 1 nm, 17β-estradiol, but not 17α-estradiol, stimulates particulate guanylyl cyclase to elevate cGMP, which through activation and plasma membrane recruitment of protein kinase G isoform Iα, stimulates plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from rat hepatocytes. These effects are extremely rapid in onset and are mimicked by a membrane-impermeant 17β-estradiol-BSA conjugate, suggesting that 17β-estradiol acts at the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. We also show that 17β-estradiol binds specifically to the intact hepatocyte plasma membrane through an interaction that is competed by an excess of atrial natriuretic peptide but also shows many similarities to the pharmacological characteristics of the putative γ-adrenergic receptor. We, therefore, propose that the observed rapid signaling effects of 17β-estradiol are mediated either through the guanylyl cyclase A receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide or through the γ-adrenergic receptor, which is either itself a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase or activates a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase through cross-talk signaling."

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an essential role in the development and homeostasis of metazoans. Deregulation of apoptosis leads to a variety of pathologic disorders, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Caspases, part of the cysteine protease family, are central to the initiation and execution of apoptosis, acting to specifically cleave the C-terminal side of an aspartate residue in substrates. In mammals, 14 kinds of caspases have been identified, at least seven of which are assumed to be involved in apoptosis (1Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 2Chowdhury I. Tharakan B. Bhat G.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 151: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The apoptotic caspases are generally classified into initiator and executioner caspases. The former include caspase-8, -9, and -10, and the latter include caspase-3, -6, and -7 (3Timmer J.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 4Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). The activation of initiator caspases inevitably triggers the activation of caspase cascades. Activated initiator caspases are able to activate downstream executioner caspases through proteolytic cleavage. Once executioner caspases are activated, they execute apoptosis by proteolytically cleaving a variety of cellular death substrates. Executioner caspases form a homodimer both before and after activation by intrachain cleavage. Caspases are also characterized by a preference for recognition sites in their substrates, as determined by studies using synthetic peptides and/or peptide libraries (5Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A.

These two caspases, which are generally expressed in mammals, were reported to show similar functions in vitro and homology in their inherent substrate preference. The three-dimensional structures of dimeric procaspase-7, active caspase-7, and substrate-bound forms of active caspase-7 have been resolved (8Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P.

The structure of substrate-bound forms of dimeric active caspase-3 was also reported and shows many similarities to that of active caspase-7 (11Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Bai X.

Both caspase-3 and caspase-7 were shown to have grooves for directly binding to their substrates, and these grooves bear a close resemblance in structure (13Wei Y. Fox T. Chambers S.P. Sintchak J.

The groove is constructed of four surface loops, L1, L2, L3, and L4 (8Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P.

L2 contains a site of cleavage by initiator caspases in apoptosis. amino acid cycloheximide double knockdown p-nitroanilide. In caspase-3 and caspase-7 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, caspase-3 and caspase-7 have been shown to have some overlapping (but some different) roles in apoptosis (14Lakhani S.A.

Science. 2006; 311: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar); however, the precise relationship between their structure and function in apoptosis has not been clear. Here, we identified functional regions defining differences in caspase-3 and caspase-7 in the selection of a partner for dimerization and execution of apoptosis within cells, indicating that the structural regions responsible for defining the two types of activity are essentially the same. Human HeLa and Jurkat cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Anti-human Fas mAb CH-11 was obtained from MBL Co. (Nagoya, Japan) (15Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide (CHX) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque. Cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 for 1 h and subsequently with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was extensively washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 0.3 μg/ml FLAG-peptide for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (16Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study were those for caspase-3 and lamin A/C (Cell Signaling), caspase-7 (4G2) and cleaved SETβ (MBL Co.), FLAG tag (M2) and HA tag (12CA5) (Sigma), and actin (C4) (Chemicon). For the expression of exogenous caspase-3, caspase-7, and chimeric caspases in double knockdown (DKD) cells, we utilized cDNAs with silent mutations in the target nucleotides of the shRNAs used in the generation of DKD cells. All of the cDNAs with silent mutations were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). cDNAs for chimeric caspases were generated using a PCR-driven overlap extension method as described (17Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) and/or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Lentiviral vectors (provided by H. Miyoshi, RIKEN) were prepared as described (18Tahara-Hanaoka S. Sudo K. Ema H. Miyoshi H. Nakauchi H. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Gyobu H. Tsuji T. Suzuki Y. Ohkuri T. Chamoto K. Kuroki M. Miyoshi H. Kawarada Y. Katoh H. Takeshima T. Nishimura T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, and the chimeric constructs, their cDNA fragments were inserted into pCSII-EF-MCS. For gene silencing with the RNAi system, we used a lentivirus-based shRNA expression vector, CSII-U6 (provided by Y. Satou and M. Matsuoka, Kyoto University), and CSII-U6-puro vectors. The target sequences of the shRNAs were as follows: GATCGTTGTAGAAGTCTAA for caspase-3 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number NM_004346) and GTACCGTCCCTCTTCAGTA for caspase-7 cDNA (accession number NM_001227). The shRNA-encoding DNA oligonucleotide inserts were generated using the Insert Design Tool for pSilencer vectors (Applied Biosystems). For transient transfection, HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, cultured for 1 day, and then transfected with various expression vectors (0.7 μg/each well) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DEVDase activity was measured using the APOPCYTO caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit (MBL Co.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were incubated with 4 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml; Wako) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 4 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml; Wako) for 1 h at 56 °C. After electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, DNA fragmentation was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. To examine the role of caspase-3 and caspase-7 within human cells, we generated double knockdown cells in which expression of both caspase-3 and caspase-7 was down-regulated (DKD cells). The expression of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in human HeLa and Jurkat cells was down-regulated by the expression of shRNAs using lentiviral vectors (Fig. 1A). In Fas-stimulated DKD HeLa cells, apoptotic morphological change was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1B). In addition, the activity cleaving a low molecular weight compound, DEVD-p-nitroanilide (pNA), in vitro (in vitro DEVDase activity) and the activity cleaving lamin A and SETβ within cells, observed during apoptosis, were also dramatically suppressed (Fig. 1, C and D). Lamin A was reported to be directly cleaved by caspase-6, which is a direct target of caspase-3, whereas SETβ is a direct target of caspase-3 and/or caspase-7 (20Ruchaud S. Korfali N. Villa P. Kottke T.J. Dingwall C. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21Morita A. Suzuki N. Matsumoto Y. Hirano K. Enomoto A. Zhu J. Sakai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In DKD Jurkat cells, the formation of a DNA ladder was also remarkably inhibited (Fig. 1E), indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis is inhibited in DKD Jurkat cells. Taken together, not only cell death but also cleavage of the death substrates and the formation of a DNA ladder were shown to be dependent on caspase-3 and caspase-7 in Fas-stimulated human cells. To compare the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7 as executioner caspases within cells, we next generated DKD cells expressing an almost equal amount of exogenous FLAG-tagged caspase-3 or caspase-7 with silent mutations in the target nucleotides of the shRNAs (Fig. 2A). These cells made it possible for the first time to avoid the influence of different expression levels of caspase-3 and caspase-7 when comparing their enzymatic activities within human cells. In FLAG-caspase-3-expressing DKD HeLa cells, in vitro DEVDase activity recovered to relatively higher levels than in parental cells (Fig. 2B), and the cleaving activity for the cellular death substrates within cells also recovered (Fig. 2C). In DKD Jurkat cells, the expression of FLAG-caspase-3 recovered the DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2D). In FLAG-caspase-7-expressing DKD HeLa cells, however, in vitro DEVDase activity did not significantly increase compared with that in DKD cells and was much weaker than that in FLAG-caspase-3-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). The cleaving activity for cellular death substrates within the Fas-stimulated cells was not sufficiently recovered in FLAG-caspase-7-expressing DKD HeLa cells, although both FLAG-procaspase-3 and FLAG-procaspase-7 disappeared after stimulation of Fas probably through autocleavage (Fig. 2C). In DKD Jurkat cells, the expression of FLAG-caspase-7 could not sufficiently recover the DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2D). All of these results indicate that human caspase-3 and caspase-7 (produced and activated in human cells) differ in the cleavage of cellular death substrates within cells, DNA ladder formation, and in vitro DEVDase activity. These results essentially coincide with the previously reported results showing different activity in vitro of caspase-3 and caspase-7 produced in bacteria (22Walsh J.G. Cullen S.P. Sheridan C. Lüthi A.U. Gerner C. Martin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12815-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 and caspase-7 differ distinctly in activities within cells, and the difference would be caused by different aa sequences. To identify the regions important for their different activities, we generated various chimeric constructs. When generating chimeric executioner caspases, however, it is necessary to keep intact the homodimer-forming activity of the precursor forms because both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 form homodimers, and the dimerization is necessary to exert sufficient protease activity in their cleaved active forms (23Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 24Piana S. Sulpizi M. Rothlisberger U. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8720-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, before examining their activities, it was necessary to reveal aa regions determining the specific partner for dimerization in procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 within human cells. We first analyzed the accuracy of the formation of the homodimer in procaspase-3 and procaspase-7. HA-procaspase-3 and HA-procaspase-7 were simultaneously expressed in DKD HeLa cells together with FLAG-caspase-3 or FLAG-caspase-7, and a co-immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-FLAG antibody was carried out. HA-procaspase-3 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-procaspase-3 but not with FLAG-procaspase-7. Similarly, HA-procaspase-7 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-procaspase-7 but not with FLAG-procaspase-3 (Fig. 3A). Thus, both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 form only homodimers within cells. We then analyzed the regions important for determining the specificity with which procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 select a dimerization partner. We generated and analyzed various chimeric constructs by combining 21 separate blocks of aa sequences (Fig. 3B) and analyzed which blocks are necessary for the selection of a partner. We identified five important regions named A, B, C, I, and II (Fig. 3B). A procaspase-7-based chimera in which regions A, B, C, I, and II were replaced with those of procaspase-3, designated procaspase-7(ABCD I II), could form a homodimer and a dimer with procaspase-3 but not with procaspase-7 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a procaspase-3-based chimera in which regions I and II of procaspase-3 were replaced with those of procaspase-7, designated procaspase-3(I II), could form a dimer with both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7. In contrast, procaspase-7(ABC) could form a dimer with both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7, whereas procaspase-7(I II) could form a dimer with neither (Fig. 3A). We could not analyze either procaspase-7(I II) or procaspase-3(ABCD I II) because the expression levels of these molecules were too low to be detected. Taken together, procaspase-3 seems to be able to form a dimer with molecules containing regions A, B, and C of procaspase-3, and procaspase-7 seems to be able to form a dimer with molecules containing regions I and II of procaspase-7. Regions A, B, C, I, and II are scattered throughout the primary aa sequence (Fig. 3B). We highlighted these regions in the tertiary structure of procaspase-7 (Protein Data Bank code 1GQF) (Fig. 3C) (10Riedl S.J. Fuentes-Prior P. Renatus M. Kairies N. Krapp S. Huber R. Salvesen G.S. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14790-14795Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Regions I and II, derived from both partners, are located near each other and occupy a position straddling the homodimer interface. Similarly, regions A, B, and C, derived from both partners, are also located close together, occupying a position straddling the homodimer interface on the opposite side of regions I and II. We designated the three-dimensional structural regions composed of regions I and II and of regions A, B, and C as structural region I II and structural region ABC, respectively. Interestingly, these two structural regions are located on the opposite sides of procaspase, separated by a curtain composed of 12 β-sheets. We next analyzed which is most important among regions A, B, and C of procaspase-3 in the formation of a dimer with procaspase-3. Whereas procaspase-7(ABC I II) could interact with procaspase-3 but not with procaspase-7, procaspase-7(ABC) could bind to both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7. We then examined whether procaspase-7(A I II), procaspase-7(B I II), and procaspase-7(C I II) can form a dimer with procaspase-3. Only procaspase-7(B I II) could bind to procaspase-3 (Fig. 3D and data not shown), indicating region B to be the most important. Procaspase-3(B I II) could not bind procaspase-3 but could bind procaspase-7, whereas procaspase-3(I II) could interact with both procaspase-3 and procaspase-7, supporting the idea that region B is the most important in the formation of a homodimer with procaspase-3. We then succeeded in narrowing down the range of regions B and II to b and ii, respectively. Procaspase-7(b I ii) could form a dimer with caspase-3 but not with caspase-7 (Fig. 3E). Regions b and I ii are located at the center of structural regions ABC and I II, respectively, in the three-dimensional structure of procaspase-7 (Fig. 3F). All of the results indicate that the center of structural regions ABC and I II exhibits the most important effect on the selection of a partner for dimerization. We generated caspase-7-based chimeric constructs with various regions of caspase-3 and analyzed their DEVDase activity in vitro. We exogenously expressed almost equal amounts of FLAG-caspase-3, FLAG-caspase-7, and the chimeras in DKD HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) and identified important regions of caspase-3 required for strong DEVDase activity in vitro. Two caspase-7-based chimeric constructs, caspase-7(D) and caspase-7(ABC) (Fig. 3B), showed stronger DEVDase activity than FLAG-caspase-7 (Fig. 4B). In the primary aa sequence, region D is located next to loop L3, which was previously reported to be spatially positioned near the active center (11Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Bai X.

The difference in region D between caspase-3 and caspase-7, which contains residues for direct binding to DEVD-pNA, would affect their distinct in vitro DEVDase activity. Interestingly, region ABC is identical to those regions important for selecting a partner for dimerization. Region B contains one of the cleavage sites of the procaspase, and both cleaved parts of region B were reported to change their spatial allocation during activation. Caspase-7(ABC) showed almost equal activity to caspase-7(ABC) (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), indicating that regions A, b, and C are important for caspase-3 to reveal strong DEVDase activity in vitro. Region b is located on the small subunit side of region B, which was reported to move and make loop bundles together with previously reported loops L2 and L4 of the other subunit in the proform during caspase activation. To examine whether formation of the loop bundles is important for caspase-3 to effectively cleave DEVD-pNA, we generated caspase-7 knockdown HeLa cells expressing a much larger amount of mutant caspase-3 than endogenous caspase-3, in which both Cys163 and Arg207 at the active center and Asp175 at the site of cleavage between the large and small subunits were replaced with Ala and Ala and with Glu, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2A) (25Denault J.B. Békés M. Scott F.L. Sexton K.M. Bogyo M. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In these cells, expression of the caspase-3 mutant was expected to inhibit the formation of a homodimer of endogenous caspase-3 and to form a heterodimer between endogenous wild-type and mutant caspase-3. The heterodimer showed much weaker DEVDase activity in vitro than another heterodimer between wild-type and mutant caspase-3 in which the active center was inactivated but the intercleavage site was intact (supplemental Fig. S2B). These results suggest that the sufficient in vitro DEVDase activity of caspase-3 is provided through formation of the loop bundles with the small subunit side of region B (region b) in the partner in the proform. Taken together, region b would be important for caspase-3 not only in selecting its partner but also in exerting strong DEVDase activity depending on the formation of the loop bundles. To kinetically reveal the different enzymatic activities of caspase-3, caspase-7, and the chimeras, we analyzed their DEVD-pNA-cleaving activity in vitro using the Michaelis-Menten equation and calculated Km and Vmax parameters with Eadie-Hofstee plots (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Vmax values differed significantly among caspase-3, -7, -7(D), and -7(ABC), consistent with their DEVDase activity, whereas Km values were similar. The different levels of DEVDase activity were indicated to depend on different reaction rates. We then generated DKD HeLa cells expressing caspase-7(ABCD) and analyzed DEVDase activity in vitro (Fig. 4, C and D). Caspase-7(ABCD) showed much higher and sufficiently higher levels of activity than caspase-7 and caspase-3, respectively, indicating the difference in DEVDase activity between caspase-3 and caspase-7 to depend on the difference in regions A, B, C, and D. Next, we examined whether the chimeric constructs caspase-7(D), -7(ABC), and -7(ABCD) cleave cellular substrates in a similar manner to caspase-3 within cells. Surprisingly, all of the chimeras showed much lower activity levels than caspase-3 for the cleavage of SETβ and caspase-6-mediated cleavage of lamin A (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that in vitro DEVDase activity is not equivalent to intracellular cleaving activity and that regions other than A, B, C, and D must be involved in the cleavage of cellular substrates within cells. To identify regions important for the difference in activity in cleaving cellular substrates between caspase-3 and caspase-7, we generated new chimeric constructs based on caspase-7(ABCD). Finally, we found that caspase-7(ABCD I II III) expressed in DKD HeLa cells showed caspase-3-like activity in the cleavage of lamin A and SETβ within cells as well as the cleavage of DEVD-pNA in vitro (Fig. 5, A–C). In addition, caspase-7(ABCD I II III) was shown to induce the formation of a DNA ladder as well as caspase-3 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, regions A, B, C, D, I, II, and III of caspase-3 are all required for caspase-7 to exert strong caspase-3-like activity to cleave not only DEVD-pNA in vitro but also cellular substrates within cells (Fig. 5B). We investigated the molecular basis for the difference in activity of executioner caspases using DKD cells expressing almost equal amounts of caspase-3, caspase-7, or chimeric constructs. This is a powerful way to analyze the different activities of analogous molecules within cells. Hence, we could closely compare caspase-3, caspase-7, and the chimeras and found that the caspases differ in protease activity and that the difference depends on seven regions designated A, B, C, D, I, II, and III. In addition, it is worth noting that the regions important for the selection of specific partners are among those crucial to the difference in protease activity between caspase-3 and caspase-7. Caspase-3 and caspase-7 differed in activity in cleaving cellular substrates within cells as well as a low molecular weight substrate, DEVD-pNA, in vitro. To our astonishment, although replacing regions A, B, C, and D of caspase-7 with those of caspase-3 was sufficient to convert the in vitro DEVDase activity of caspase-7 to that of caspase-3, it was not sufficient to convert the cellular substrate-cleaving activity of caspase-7 to that of caspase-3 within cells. The difference in substrate-cleaving activity within cells was clearly shown to be dependent on regions I, II, and III in addition to regions A, B, C, and D. Whereas regions A, B, C, and D would be responsible for determining the preference for peptides such as DEVD and the reaction rate of DEVDase activity in vitro (supplemental Fig. S3), regions I, II, and III may determine additional substrate specificity, which has not been clarified. These results are consistent with the observation that the preferred peptide sequence of caspase-3 is not identical to the peptide sequences in preferred cellular substrates of caspase-3 (3Timmer J.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Mahrus S. Trinidad J.C. Barkan D.T. Sali A. Burlingame A.L. Wells J.A. Cell. 2008; 134: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Regions A, B, C, D, I, II, and III in caspase-3 and caspase-7 could be classified into three groups by position in the tertiary structure: structural region ABC, structural region I II III, and region D. Structural regions ABC and I II III each straddle the dimer interface by interacting with the same structural region of the partner. These two structural regions lie on the opposite sides of caspases separated by a curtain of β-sheets. Meanwhile, region D, which is situated away from the dimer interface in the three-dimensional structure, is not engaged in homodimer formation. Because region D and structural region ABC had a synergistic effect on DEVDase activity, they would function differently to regulate the DEVDase activity. Region D may influence the DEVDase activity by directly affecting the binding of the substrate DEVD-pNA and/or its reaction intermediate. For both the selection of a partner for dimerization and DEVDase activity in vitro, the most important part of region B was region b. When cleaved executioner caspases bind to their substrates, the small subunit side of region B containing region b reportedly assembles the so-called “loop bundle” together with loops L2 and L4 of the partner. Because the loop bundle has been considered to be important to the protease activity of executioner caspases, structural region ABC may affect DEVDase activity by regulating its formation. In addition, the part of region B containing region b was reported to bury a central cavity located at the center of structural region ABC in both caspase-3 and caspase-7 (10Riedl S.J. Fuentes-Prior P. Renatus M. Kairies N. Krapp S. Huber R. Salvesen G.S. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14790-14795Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The central cavity was reported to be open when the catalytic groove is occupied by a substrate, but closed when the groove is empty (9Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Cell. 2001; 107: 399-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The burying of the central cavity in structural region ABC may be involved in the regulation of in vitro DEVDase activity. Structural regions ABC and I II III have several structural and functional characteristics in common. It has been unclear how structural region I II III, which does not contribute to DEVDase activity, contributes to the cellular substrate-cleaving activity within cells. A cavity other than the central cavity was reported to be located at the center of structural region I II III in caspase-7 but not in caspase-3 (28Agniswamy J. Fang B. Weber I.T. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4752-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the central cavity is observed in both caspase-3 and caspase-7. The caspase-7-specific cavity in structural region I II III of caspase-7 might be involved in the impaired cellular substrate-cleaving activity within cells during apoptosis. Recently, a non-redundant function of caspase-7 was reported in LPS-induced apoptosis (29Lamkanfi M. Moreira L.O. Makena P. Spierings D.C. Boyd K. Murray P.J. Green D.R. Kanneganti T.D. Blood. 2009; 113: 2742-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that caspase-7 and caspase-3 infrequently show independent apoptosis-inducing functions in vivo. Structural region I II III of caspase-7 containing the caspase-7-specific cavity may be involved in the specific function of caspase-7 in apoptosis. In this study, the biological functions and structural characteristics of executioner caspases caspase-3 and caspase-7 during apoptosis were examined by generating and analyzing chimeras. The structural analysis of our chimeric caspases will lead to further clarification of the apoptotic cascade by resolving the relation between the structure and functions of executioner caspases caspase-3 and caspase-7.

https://openalex.org/W2068546126,"Cell transformation by the v-rel oncogene is mediated by the aberrant expression of genes that are normally tightly regulated by other Rel/NF-kappaB family members. Although a number of genes inappropriately activated or suppressed by v-Rel have been identified, their contributions to the v-Rel transformation process have been poorly characterized. Here, we examine the role of individual AP-1 proteins in v-Rel-mediated transformation. v-Rel-transformed cells exhibit elevated RNA and protein expression of c-Fos, c-Jun and ATF2 and sustained repression of Fra-2. c-Fos and c-Jun are essential in both the initiation and maintenance of v-Rel-mediated transformation, whereas Fra-2 is dispensable. By employing a c-Jun dimerization mutant, we further identified Fos/Jun heterodimers as major contributors to the v-Rel transformation process. The inability of c-Rel to induce the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun contributes to its weaker oncogenic potential relative to v-Rel. Our studies also demonstrate that v-Rel may induce AP-1 members by directly upregulating gene expression (c-fos and ATF2) and by activating pathways that stimulate AP-1 activity. Although elevated expression of ATF2 is also required for v-Rel-mediated transformation, its ectopic overexpression is inhibitory. Investigating the mode of ATF2 regulation revealed a positive feedback mechanism whereby ATF2 induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation to further induce its own activity. In addition, these studies identified Ha-Ras as an effector of v-Rel-mediated transformation and reveal a novel role for ATF2 in the inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Overall, these studies reveal distinct and complex roles of AP-1 proteins in Rel/NF-kappaB oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082638702,"Agrin isoforms with different bioactivities are synthesized by the nerve and the muscle. Neural agrin containing an 8-amino acid insert (z8) introduced by alternative splicing is the active form that induces synaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction. In addition to alternative splicing, extracellular calcium is also required for the activity of neural agrin. To understand better how the activity of agrin is regulated by alternative splicing, we have applied alanine substitution mutagenesis to the z8 insert and the calcium binding site in the minimally functional AgG3z8 fragment. Single alanine substitutions in the 4th through the 7th amino acid of the z8 splice insert significantly reduced the function of agrin, in terms of acetylcholine receptor clustering activity and the affinity for binding to the muscle surface. Mutation of the asparagine at the 4th position drastically reduces bioactivity such that it is equivalent to that of muscle form AgG3z0. These reduced activity mutants also show reduced magnitudes of the calcium-induced CD spectrum change from that observed in AgG3z8 fragments, indicating that cross-talk between calcium and the z8 insert is critical for the normal activity of agrin. However, removal of Ca2+ binding via mutation of both aspartic acids in the calcium binding site did not totally eliminate the activity of AgG3z8. These results suggest a model wherein the z8 insert is a Ca2+-responsive allosteric element that is essential in forming an active conformation in neuronal agrin.

Recent study indicates that the downstream signaling in the neuromuscular junction is mediated by a receptor complex in myotubes containing the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, MuSK, and LRP4, a member of the LDL receptor family. LRP4 knock-out mice exhibit severe neuromuscular defects similar to those found in mutant animals deficient in MuSK or neural agrin (10Weatherbee S.D. Anderson K.V. Niswander L.A.

Alternative splicing at the Z site introducing an 8-amino acid insert (ELTNEIPA, z8 insert) is required for the synapse-forming activity of agrin, and this z8 isoform is only produced by neurons (13Rüegg M.A. Tsim K.W.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3535-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 21-kDa fragment of neural agrin, which consists of the third globular domain with the z8 insert (AgG3z8), is necessary and sufficient for inducing the formation of AChR clusters in vitro under standard physiological conditions (15Ferns M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition to z8 insertion, extracellular calcium is also critical for the activity of agrin. It is required for the activation of MuSK as well as the induction and maintenance of AChR clustering (18Bloch R.J. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2670-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wallace B.G. J.

The AgG3 domain is homologous to the globular (LG5) domain of α2 laminin, which binds calcium through the side chains of two aspartic acids and two main chain carbonyls (21Hohenester E. Tisi D.

Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These aspartate residues are conserved in the AgG3 domain, and structural studies indicate that these Asp residues similarly mediate calcium binding in agrin (23Stetefeld J. Alexandrescu A.T.

The AgG3 also belongs to the LNS (laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding globulin) domain family that typically displays a β-sandwich folding motif. The z8 insert is part of a surface loop on the same edge of the β-sandwich as the Ca2+ binding site (Fig. 1, A and B) (23Stetefeld J. Alexandrescu A.T. Maciejewski M.W. Jenny M. Rathgeb-Szabo K. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Frank S. Rüegg M.A. Kammerer R.A. Structure. 2004; 12: 503-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Ca2+ binding induces a significant change in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of AgG3z8 but not AgG3z0 (24Tseng C.N. Zhang L. Cascio M. Wang Z.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17236-17245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the z8 insert mediates the signaling bioactivity of this alternatively spliced isoform of neural agrin is not clear. Alanine scanning studies are a widely used approach to examine structural and functional effects of regions of proteins and have been utilized in this study to examine the role of Ca+2 binding sites and the z8 insert on agrin function (25Sidhu S.S. Kossiakoff A.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have investigated the correlation of the receptor-clustering activity of agrin with the ability of the AgG3 domain to be allosterically responsive to Ca2+ in CD studies of z8 mutants. In the alanine scanning studies conducted in this study, a single point mutation in the z8 insert, an N4A substitution, resulted in elimination of AChR clustering activity, marked reduction in binding affinity to myotubes, and a failure to undergo Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Importantly, the effect of N4A mutation is more severe than abrogating Ca2+ binding via mutagenesis of the Ca2+ binding site, suggesting a distinct accessory role for Ca2+ from that of the z8 insert. Our findings support a model wherein the z8 insert is required for agrin signaling as it is an allosteric responsive element necessary for neural signaling activity and its active conformation is favored by calcium binding. Restriction and modification enzymes for DNA cloning were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Invitrogen. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers and synthetic z8 peptide were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA) and Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA), respectively. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal-affinity resin was the product of Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Rhodamine-α-bungarotoxin was purchased from Molecular Probes. General chemicals were purchased from Sigma. cDNA sequences encoding the rat AgG3 domain of neural (amino acids 1756–1948, AgG3z8) or muscle agrin (amino acids 1756–1940, AgG3z0) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pPICZαA as described before (24Tseng C.N. Zhang L. Cascio M. Wang Z.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17236-17245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into agrin cDNA in the pPICZαA expression plasmid using the QuikChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the mutation was introduced into AgG3z8 by 18-cycle PCR using 50 ng of pPICZαA-AgG3z8 plasmid as the template and a pair of complimentary mutagenesis primers (125 ng each). After degradation of original template by DpnI digestion, the reaction mixture was electroporated into TOP 10 cells. Plasmids with the mutation were purified from Zeocin-resistant colonies using a minipreparation kit (Bio-Rad) and confirmed by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotide primers used for the mutagenesis purpose are shown in Fig. 1C. The agrin expression construct was linearized by PmeI digestion and transformed into Pichia pastoris KM71 strain by electroporation. Positive clones were selected on YPD plates with Zeocin (0.1 mg/ml). A single colony was used to inoculate a 50-ml overnight culture in buffered glycerol-complex medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 1% glycerol). The initial culture was then expanded to 1 liter in buffered methanol-complex medium (BMMY, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.4 mg/liter biotin). Methanol was added daily to the BMMY medium at a final concentration of 0.75% to induce and maintain protein expression. On the 4th day of induction, the culture supernatant was collected, and proteins were salted out in 70% ammonium sulfate by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were dissolved in 40 ml of binding buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)), loaded onto a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed consecutively with 40 ml of binding buffer and 40 ml of washing buffer (250 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, (pH 7.4)), and finally eluted in 40 ml of PBS containing 250 mm imidazole. After the imidazole was removed by dialysis against 2 liters of 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the eluent was concentrated by gentle dehydration using Aquacide II (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). C2C12 myoblast cultures were maintained in the growth medium (DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.5% chick embryo extract (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin). Differentiation was induced by switching myoblasts with 70% confluences to the fusion medium (DMEM containing 5% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine), and the medium was refreshed daily. AChR clusters were induced by adding recombinant agrin fragments to fully differentiated myotube cultures. Five h later, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (5 min), stained with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin, rinsed in PBS, and viewed under a 400 × lens of an Olympus IX-70 fluorescent microscope. Ten random fields were photographed with a SPOT-2e camera in each experiment. The digital photographs of the stained myotubes from each field were converted to grayscale mode and analyzed by using the public domain Image program (National Institutes of Health). Background signals were eliminated by adjusting the threshold. The mean gray value of each photograph was used to represent the degree of AChR clustering on the cell surface. Recombinant agrin proteins were iodinated using the chloramine T method (26Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was carried out by adding 1 mCi of 125I-Na (Amersham Biosciences) to 0.5 mg of protein in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction was started with 20 μl of a chloramine T solution (2 mg/ml). After 45 s, 20 μl of 2 mg/ml Na2S2O5 was added to terminate the labeling reaction. Free 125I was separated from labeled proteins by gel filtration on Sepharose G-25 columns. Approximately 85% of the proteins were recovered after gel filtration. The biological activity of neural agrin was retained after iodination as shown by their ability to induce AChR clustering in cultured C2C12 myotubes. Iodinated agrin proteins were added at concentrations indicated to C2C12 myotubes grown on 35-mm dishes in the fusion medium. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, cells were rinsed four times with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and lysed with 0.2 m NaOH. Bound radioactivity was counted using a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was measured by including an excess amount (500×) of each unlabeled ligand in the reaction and was subtracted from the total binding. In competition studies with agrin mutant proteins, the concentration of 125I-AgG3z8 was kept constant at 10 nm. Ligand binding activity in the absence of unlabeled competitors was normalized to 100%, and the amount of bound ligands was calculated from the reduction in 125I-AgG3z8 binding. KI values were calculated from the IC50 concentration of competing ligands by the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (46Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were collected at 25 °C on an Aviv 202 spectrometer. Protein was diluted in 6 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl to ∼0.2 mg/ml to reduce low UV absorbance. At least six scans/sample were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 280 to 195 nm with 1-s integration time. Protein concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Mean residue ellipticity values [θ] were calculated based on the protein sequences and concentration determinations. The composition of protein secondary structures was analyzed by using CDPro program (47Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar, 48Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Calcium titration curves were conducted by measuring [θ]215 at constant protein concentrations with varying concentrations of Ca2+ introduced using a syringe driven pump assembly. The recombinant C-terminal ∼21-kDa fragment of the AgG3 domain containing the z8 splice insert is the minimal agrin domain necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of AChR clusters in cultured myotubes. The same domain of muscle agrin, which lacks the z8 insert, binds poorly to muscle membrane, and has no AChR clustering activity (27Deyst K.A. McKechnie B.A. Fallon J.R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 110: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Gesemann M. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Rüegg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Bowen D.C. Sugiyama J. Ferns M. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3791-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the z8 insert itself is able to bind directly to the agrin receptor and to regulate AChR clustering, synthetic z8 peptide (ELTNEIPA) was applied to differentiated C2C12 myotubes, and the extent of AChR clustering was examined by staining with rhodamine-α-bungarotoxin. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that few spontaneous AChR clusters formed on the plasma membrane in control myotubes or myotubes treated with muscle form agrin AgG3z0 (Fig. 2, A and B). Incubation of myotubes with the z8 peptide at a concentration of either 1 or 100 μg/ml (∼1.2 mm and 120 mm, respectively) did not induce formation of more receptor aggregates (Fig. 2, C, D, and G). In contrast, application of neural form agrin (AgG3z8, 1 μg/ml, ∼50 nm) induced significant aggregation of AChR on the cell surface (Fig. 2, E and G). Thus, the z8 peptide alone is insufficient to activate signaling through the agrin receptor. However, it might bind the receptor but not activate it. If this was the case, the peptide should act as a competitive antagonist of neural agrin. Therefore we treated myotube culture with excess z8 peptide (100 μg/ml) 1 h before adding the recombinant AgG3z8 protein (1 μg/ml) and incubated it for an additional 5 h. The z8 peptide had no apparent effect on the AChR clustering activity of neural agrin (Fig. 2, F and G). Therefore, in agreement with previous studies using a synthetic chick ortholog of the z8 sequence (17Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Rüegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the z8 insert alone does not bind the agrin receptor with any measureable affinity in the absence of other parts of AgG3 domain. To determine the functional significance of each amino acid in the z8 insert, we substituted each of the first seven residues (ELTNEIP) with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1C). Alanine is tolerated in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments, and it does not alter the main chain conformation, nor does it impose extreme electrostatic or steric effects (30Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Introducing alanine into this region is not likely to affect the correct folding of the protein. Mutant recombinant AgG3z8 proteins were expressed as secretory proteins using yeast P. pastoris and purified to homogeneity as described previously (24Tseng C.N. Zhang L. Cascio M. Wang Z.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17236-17245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each mutant protein was added at 1 μg/ml concentration (∼50 nm) to C2C12 myotubes, and 5 h later the levels of AChR clustering were measured. Mutations in the first three amino acids (ELT) weakly, but not significantly, reduced the AChR clustering activity of AgG3z8 (Fig. 3, B–D and J). Importantly, substitution of the 4th residue in z8, an asparagine, appeared to eliminate the activity of neural agrin, reducing the degree of receptor clustering to that of control myotubes (Fig. 3, F and J; p > 0.05, n = 4). Mutation of the 5th, 6th, and 7th amino acids (EIP) significantly reduced the AChR clustering activity of AgG3z8 (p < 0.01, n = 4), but to a lesser extent than the N4A mutation (Fig. 3, G–J). These results show that the 4th to 7th amino acids of the z8 insert are functionally critical in neural agrin signaling, with the asparagine at position 4 playing a particularly critical role. To determine whether mutations within the z8 sequence changes the binding affinity of AgG3z8 to myotubes, competition binding assays using C2C12 myotubes were conducted. The binding of iodinated AgG3z8 protein (5 nm) to myotubes cultured on 35-mm dishes was competed by unlabeled mutant proteins containing single alanine substitutions in the z8 insert. Alanine substitutions in the z8 sequence reduced the binding affinity of AgG3z8 to different degrees (Fig. 4). Similar to the effects of z8 mutations to the AChR clustering activities seen in Fig. 3, the affinity of AgG3z8 was slightly reduced by mutations of the first three z8 sequences, moderately affected by mutations of the 5th to 7th amino acids, and severely abolished by N4A substitution (Fig. 3). The dissociation constant (KI) was 4.6, 6.2, and 39 nm, for E1A, L2A, and T3A mutant proteins, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, the N4A mutant showed a strikingly low affinity (KI = 2.1 μm), similar to that of muscle agrin (AgG3z0, KI = 1.8 μm). Substitution at the 5th, 6th, or 7th residue reduced the protein binding affinity, but the effect was much less severe (KI = 85, 110, 74 nm for E5A, I6A, and P6A mutants, respectively). Thus, mutations of z8 residues resulted in parallel reduction in the signaling activity and surface affinity of AgG3z8 protein.TABLE 1KI of AgG3z8 mutant proteins obtained by competition binding assaysLigandKIInmE1A4.6L2A6.2T3A39N4A2,100E5A85I6A110P7A74AgG3z01,800 Open table in a new tab The AChR clusters readily appeared on C2C12 myotube treated with wild-type AgG3z8 at concentration as low as 0.1 μg/ml and reached plateau at 5 μg/ml (∼25 nm; Fig. 5A). This efficacy is comparable with that of a chick AgG3 fragment expressed in COS and HeLa cells (EC50 ∼ 13 nm) (17Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Rüegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Both muscle agrin AgG3z0 and the N4A AgG3z8 mutant failed to induce receptor aggregation at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml (Fig. 5A). To test whether the N4A mutation inactivates AgG3z8 by disrupting the structure of this domain, comparative CD studies were conducted to analyze the net secondary structure of AgG3z8 and AgG3z8N4A protein. The CD spectrum of the N4A mutant was very similar to that of the wild-type AgG3z8 (Fig. 5B), indicating the two proteins had similar net secondary structures. Deconvolution of the spectra indicated that they both had ∼30% β-sheet, 25% β-turn, and 2% α-helix. These results suggest that the reduced activity of the N4A mutation is not attributable to any gross changes in protein structure. Extracellular calcium is critically required for the induction of AChR clustering by motoneurons or by agrin in cultured myotubes (18Bloch R.J. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2670-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Borges L.S. Lee Y. Ferns M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 50: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). AgG3z8 is homologous to the globular (LG5) domain of α2 laminin, which binds calcium through the side chains of two aspartic acids and two main chain carbonyls (21Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). AgG3 domain also contains this conserved, low affinity Ca2+ binding site formed by the side chains of Asp1820 and Asp1889 (Fig. 1A) (23Stetefeld J. Alexandrescu A.T. Maciejewski M.W. Jenny M.

In a previous study (24Tseng C.N. Zhang L. Cascio M. Wang Z.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17236-17245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we found Ca2+-induced conformational changes in AgG3z8, but not in AgG3z0, suggesting that the z8 insert imparts conformational sensitivity to the binding of Ca2+ at its distinct binding site and implicates a functional allosteric role for this neural-specific splice insert. Therefore, we tested whether this conformational sensitivity to Ca2+ is abrogated in the N4A mutant by comparing the effect of titrated Ca2+ on the CD spectra of AgG3z8, AgG3z0, and the N4A mutant. In the absence of added Ca2+, all three AgG3 proteins show similar typical β-rich CD spectra with the deep minima at 215 nm (Fig. 6, A–C). As reported before, calcium induced prominent changes in the CD spectrum of AgG3z8 (Fig. 6A). A change in the magnitude of the mean residue ellipticity at 215 nm ([θ]215) was readily observed in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+. A further reduction in the ellipticity at this wavelength was observed when the calcium concentration was raised to 100 mm to saturate the Ca2+ binding site. Plotting the net change of [θ]215 (Δ[θ]215) against calcium concentration gave an apparent KD of ∼10 mm for the Ca2+-induced allosteric effect (Fig. 6D). Deconvolution analysis of the averaged spectrum for AgG3z8 determined that Ca2+ binding resulted in an ∼11% increase in the content of β-sheet (p < 0.01, n = 4) with a concomitant reduction in the unordered structure of AgG3z8. Calcium caused a different effect on the CD spectra of AgG3z0, resulting in noticeable reductions around 230 nm. In contrast, the CD spectra of AgG3z8N4A exhibited virtually no change in response to increasing Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 6, C and D). These results indicate that the N4A mutation results in loss of a conformational sensitivity to added Ca2+ and suggest that the Asn4 residue is critical for Ca2+-induced conformational changes in neural agrin. The finding that Ca2+-induced conformational changes (Δ[θ]215) only occur in active neural AgG3 implies that this conformational change might be critical in its AChR clustering activity. To test this hypothesis, we determined the Ca2+-induced conformational changes of all z8 Ala-substituted mutants using CD spectroscopy. These mutant pro"
