https://openalex.org/W2995971356,"Genetic influences on psychiatric disorders transcend diagnostic boundaries, suggesting substantial pleiotropy of contributing loci. However, the nature and mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We performed analyses of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls from genome-wide studies of anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genetic correlation analyses revealed a meaningful structure within the eight disorders, identifying three groups of inter-related disorders. Meta-analysis across these eight disorders detected 109 loci associated with at least two psychiatric disorders, including 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more disorders and 11 loci with antagonistic effects on multiple disorders. The pleiotropic loci are located within genes that show heightened expression in the brain throughout the lifespan, beginning prenatally in the second trimester, and play prominent roles in neurodevelopmental processes. These findings have important implications for psychiatric nosology, drug development, and risk prediction."

Its full characterization requires a deep exploration of the organ-wide orchestration of gene expression with a single-cell spatial resolution. Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages and that maps cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression.

Finally, we generated a publicly available web resource of the human developing heart to facilitate future studies on human cardiogenesis. The heart is the first solid organ in the human embryo that becomes functional. It originates from the mesoderm and develops into the cardiac tube, which starts to beat around 21 days after conception (Sylva et al., 2014Sylva M. van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F.

The deployment of cell lineages that form the mammalian heart.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2018; 15: 705-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cardiac tube then loops, forming the four individual cardiac chambers (i.e., left and right atria and left and right ventricles) and the epicardium after about 30 days. Subsequently, the outflow tract (OFT) differentiates, and the outer part of the ventricular myocardium transforms into the compact myocardium and the septum. Eventually, the OFT divides into the aorta and the pulmonary artery, and most of the cardiac compartments are complete by the end of the first trimester. These complex events are the result of intricate and well-timed gene expression interactions related to the spatial and functional programs acting in each part of the developing heart. Rapid advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled the use of single-cell transcriptional profiling to explore cellular heterogeneity within the heart, advancing our knowledge of cardiac differentiation processes. For example, studies on embryonic (DeLaughter et al., 2016DeLaughter D.M. Bick A.G. Wakimoto H. McKean D. Gorham J.M. Kathiriya I.S. Hinson J.T. Homsy J. Gray J.

Moreover, prior knowledge of the spatial locations of cardiac cells has been pivotal to revealing both chamber-specific genes and distinct spatiotemporal cardiomyocyte populations in the embryonic mouse heart (DeLaughter et al., 2016DeLaughter D.M.

However, there are differences between murine and human cardiac development; temporal scRNA-seq studies have revealed human-specific genes that are expressed during development (Cui et al., 2019Cui Y.

A common feature to transcriptome-wide scRNA-seq studies is that they do not resolve the spatial patterns of cardiac gene expression. We therefore need alternative methods that can provide positional information on the different cell types involved in the process, which is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of developmental dynamics (Regev et al., 2017Regev A.

Given the complexity and incomplete understanding of human cardiac development, we considered it important to establish a molecular approach that enables simultaneous analysis of spatial cardiac gene expression patterns and cellular heterogeneity. We hypothesized that such an approach could be developed using spatial transcriptomics (ST) (Ståhl et al., 2016Ståhl P.L. Salmén F. Vickovic S. Lundmark A. Navarro J.F. Magnusson J. Giacomello S.

McDermott G.P. Zhu J. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar), and in situ sequencing (ISS) (Ke et al., 2013Ke R. Mignardi M. Pacureanu A. Svedlund J. Botling J. Wählby C. Nilsson M.

ST is an untargeted technology that determines the quantitative spatial distribution of polyadenylated transcripts in a tissue section using barcoded oligo-dT arrays and standard histological brightfield imaging. It generates data-driven spatial maps and has broad applicability (Giacomello et al., 2017Giacomello S. Salmén F. Terebieniec B.K. Vickovic S. Navarro J.F. Alexeyenko A. Reimegård J. McKee L.S.

Among other things, it has been used to analyze organs including the brain (Ståhl et al., 2016Ståhl P.L. Salmén F. Vickovic S. Lundmark A. Navarro J.F. Magnusson J. Giacomello S. Asp M. Westholm J.O.

Andrusivová Ž. Saarenpää S. Saiz-Castro G. et al.Spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Science. 2019; 364: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Conversely, ISS is a targeted approach that uses padlock probes and rolling circle amplification in tissue sections to target known genes (Ke et al., 2013Ke R. Mignardi M. Pacureanu A. Svedlund J.

It facilitates analysis with subcellular resolution to confirm regional markers and cell type identifications based on ST and scRNA-seq. Here, we present a spatiotemporal atlas that systematically describes the spatial archetypes and cellular heterogeneity of the developing human heart at three developmental stages in the first trimester: 4.5–5, 6.5, and 9 post-conception weeks (PCW) (Figure 1). We created this resource by exploiting the spatial exploratory power of ST, the deconvolution capabilities of scRNA-seq, and the subcellular targeted accuracy of ISS. Finally, we visualized our results by integrating the spatial information to generate three-dimensional (3D) transcriptional maps. We initially obtained a spatiotemporal overview of human heart development by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tissue sections from human embryonic cardiac samples collected at 4.5–5, 6.5, and 9 PCW (Figures 2A–2C). This revealed that the free walls and septa of the left and right ventricles, and the left and right atria (TNNT2), consist of compact and trabecular ventricular myocardium at all time points. Additionally, smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) staining showed that the formation of the aorta and pulmonary artery had begun in the 4.5–5 PCW heart and had advanced in the 6.5 and 9 PCW hearts. DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining revealed a thin epicardial border enveloping the heart at all three time points. However, the atrioventricular (AV) subepicardial mesenchyme, from which the coronary arteries form (ACTA2), was only visible at the upper end of the AV sulcus at the 6.5 and 9 PCW stages. Finally, at the end of the pericardial cavity, where the large arteries pass into the mediastinum, we observed a considerable amount of mediastinal tissue with pulmonary veins (ACTA2) that was only visible in the 6.5 and 9 PCW hearts. In summary, IHC staining clearly revealed spatiotemporal protein expression patterns during human heart development. However, the analysis was limited by the use of a panel of preselected antibodies. To expand our study in an unbiased manner, we used ST to explore global spatiotemporal gene expression dynamics during human heart development. Specifically, we collected four, nine, and six tissue sections along the dorsal-ventral axis from the 4.5–5, 6.5, and 9 PCW heart tissues, respectively (Figure S1A; Table S1A). The joint dataset consisted of a total pool of 3,115 individual spots (i.e., data points equivalent to microdissections containing ∼30 cells each (Figures S1L–S1O) with an average of ∼1,700 genes and ∼3,800 unique transcripts per spot after filtering (Figures S1B and S1C). We examined similarities between technical replicates by determining Pearson correlations and found that all time points were comparable (Figures S1D–S1G) with regard to gene expression levels. To investigate the biological differences between the three time points, we calculated the gene expression correlation between the samples, revealing that the overall bulk gene expression patterns at all developmental stages were quite similar (Figures S1H–S1J). We then performed dimensionality reduction and clustering on the joint spatial (spot) gene expression profiles of all three stages. We identified ten spatiotemporally conserved clusters (Figure 2D) and mapped the clustered spots back to their original coordinates in the tissue sections. Strikingly, the clusters corresponded to defined anatomical regions in all three hearts (Figures 2E–2G; see Data S1 at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zkzvyprd5z/draft?a=c3021f62-a7af-4824-b89d-d7fbfec67902). The main myocardial regions (clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) were shared across all time points and appeared to reflect the heart’s growth because the numbers of spots in these clusters increased with age (Figure S1K). The OFT and larger vessels (cluster 5) were underrepresented in the 4.5–5 PCW tissue in comparison to the other two ages and were mainly represented by AV mesenchyme (cluster 6). Moreover, cavities with blood and immune cells (cluster 8) were only represented by spots from the 6.5 PCW tissue, which contained more blood than the other two hearts (see STAR Methods). We performed differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between anatomical regions (Figure 2H; Table S2) and gene set enrichment analysis of each cluster’s upregulated genes (Figure S2A). Gene ontology (GO) characteristics related to muscle contraction and development were detected across all myocardial clusters (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), whereas the compact myocardium (cluster 0) was enriched in metabolism. The three trabecular clusters (1, 2, and 3) could be distinguished by their enrichment in conduction (clusters 1 and 2) and oxidative metabolism (cluster 3) (Figure S2A). In addition, cluster 2 exhibited differential expression of MB and NPPA (Figure 2H), which is associated with enhanced oxygen transport and endocrine activity (Lin et al., 1990Lin L. Sylvén C. Sotonyi P. Somogyi E. Kaijser L. Jansson E. Myoglobin content and citrate synthase activity in different parts of the normal human heart.J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 69: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, the different trabecular myocardial clusters may correspond to distinct components of the trabeculi, such as wall-related, papillary muscle, or Purkinje fibers. The atrial myocardium (cluster 4) also displayed differential expression of NPPA (indicating endocrine activity) (Figure 2H), as well as genes related to conduction and heart rate regulation (Figure S2A). On the other hand, the OFT, the AV and mediastinal mesenchyme, and the epicardium (clusters 5, 6, 7, and 9) exhibited similar GO characteristics; they were enriched in terms related to the extracellular matrix and different degrees of vasculature and artery morphogenesis. Clusters 5, 6, and 7 were also enriched in characteristics related to heart valve and septum development (Figure S2A). Cluster 9 demonstrated expression of the epicardial markers ALDH1A2 (Moss et al., 1998Moss J.B. Xavier-Neto J. Shapiro M.D. Nayeem S.M. McCaffery P. Dräger U.C. Rosenthal N. Dynamic patterns of retinoic acid synthesis and response in the developing mammalian heart.Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), LRP2, and ITLN1, and the epicardium and epicardium-derived cell (EPDC) marker TBX18 (Cai et al., 2008Cai C.L. Martin J.C. Sun Y. Cui L. Wang L. Ouyang K. Yang L. Bu L. Liang X. Zhang X. et al.A myocardial lineage derives from Tbx18 epicardial cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2013Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Regan J.N. Su C. Majesky M.W. Tbx18 regulates development of the epicardium and coronary vessels.Dev. Biol. 2013; 383: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Figure 2H; Table S2). A deeper exploration of the OFT cluster (cluster 5), which was detected primarily in samples from the two later developmental time points (6.5 and 9 PCW), revealed enrichment in fibroblast-related extracellular matrix gene expression (such as ELN, SPARC, and OGN) and the expression of smooth muscle-related genes such as ACTA2 and MYH11 (Figure 2H). These markers were expressed much less strongly in the distal part of the AV mesenchyme of the earlier 4.5–5 PCW tissue (Figure S2B), implying that while the OFT grows out of the AV mesenchyme, its muscularization and the formation of the larger vessels start developing more distally, where cardiac neural crest cells are found. In general, these results suggest that within the studied time window (4.5-9 PCW), spatial gene expression is established early on and maintained throughout embryonic development, and that differences in gene expression between regions within the heart are more pronounced than those between time points. Because the ST spots contained gene expression signatures of ∼30 cells on average (Figures S1L–S1O), we used scRNA-seq to dissect the gene expression heterogeneity of the 6.5 PCW tissue sample. Specifically, we examined a biological replicate (i.e., a second human embryonic cardiac tissue sample) of the 6.5–7 PCW sample because IHC staining indicated that the intermediate time point displayed anatomical features identified in the other two stages. The tissue was dissected into two regionally distinct fractions: one containing the OFT, the AV structures, and most of the atria and another containing the ventricles. This facilitated cellular dissociation while retaining information on whether the studied cells derived from the upper or lower part of the heart. Using a 10X Genomics Chromium workstation, we generated 3,717 single-cell transcriptional profiles with an average of ∼2,900 genes and ∼11,000 unique transcripts per cell after quality trimming and filtering (Figures S3A–S3C; Table S1B). To verify that this 6.5 PCW heart sample could be considered a biological replicate of the 6.5 PCW heart analyzed by ST, we compared the two samples’ scRNA-seq and ST bulk gene expression similarities. A strong correlation was observed (r = 0.93; Figure 3A), justifying the biological comparison. We identified 18,046 genes shared between the two 6.5 PCW samples, while 2,027 were expressed only in the scRNA-seq sample and 1,174 were unique to the ST sample. Most of the genes uniquely detected in the ST sample were Y-linked genes (e.g. TTTY14, TTTY15, and ZFY), a result of different gender representation. This was further confirmed by the overexpression of the XIST gene in the scRNA-seq sample (Ray et al., 1997Ray P.F. Winston R.M.L. Handyside A.H. XIST expression from the maternal X chromosome in human male preimplantation embryos at the blastocyst stage.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when inspecting genes found only in the scRNA-seq sample, we observed genes related to immune responses (e.g. FCGR2B and IL6) and cellular proliferation and apoptosis (IL1B), indicating the activation of these processes during the dissociation step prior to single-cell library preparation. Finally, we performed dimensionality reduction and clustering of the gene expression profiles of the two single-cell fractions and identified 15 cell clusters (Figure 3B), which we categorized into cell types based on marker gene expression (Table S3). We were able to identify known cardiac cell types, ranging from cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts to smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Moreover, we detected three types of cardiomyocytes, cardiac neural crest cells, Schwann progenitor cells, epicardial cells, EPDCs (Masters and Riley, 2014Masters M. Riley P.R. The epicardium signals the way towards heart regeneration.Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2014; 13: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Sylva et al., 2014Sylva M. van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Development of the human heart.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2014; 164A: 1347-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), two types of endothelial cells, and four types of fibroblast-like cell types. Certain cell clusters were only detected in cell fraction (i) (Figure 3C), suggesting rich cell diversity in the upper part of the heart, which contains the OFT, the main part of the atria, the AV sub-epicardial mesenchyme, the valvular apparatus, and the mediastinal tissue with the pulmonary veins. To clarify the spatial distribution of the different cell types present in the human embryonic heart and the heterogeneity of its spatial domains, we exploited the subcellular spatial resolution of ISS by applying it to the three cardiac tissues analyzed by ST, enabling a spatiotemporal analysis of gene expression with single-cell resolution. To this end, we designed a gene panel that leveraged information from the ST and scRNA-seq analysis of the two matched 6.5–7 PCW biological samples. Specifically, half of the initial gene panel consisted of key spatial marker genes identified by ST, and the other half consisted of marker genes for each scRNA-seq cluster (except for immune cells) to dissect cell-type heterogeneity. We subsequently added genes previously reported to be important for cardiac development, resulting in a final panel of 69 genes (Tables S4A and S4B). Upon re-clustering the scRNA-seq dataset using only the 69 genes included in the panel, we were able to assign the majority of cells to their original clusters; the sole exception was cluster 13, where the panel contained no specific marker genes (Figures S4A–S4C). We performed ISS experiments on all three hearts in replicates (Table S4C; Figure S4D) and observed high correlation within temporal stages (R2 = 0.85–0.99). We also cross-validated three ISS gene probe results using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (Figure 4), which generated patterns similar to those observed by sequencing.Figure 4Validation of ISS Data by smFISHShow full caption(A) A tissue section from the 6.5 PCW heart sample analyzed by smFISH and showing spatial distribution of the MYH7, TBX18, and OGN genes.

Thus, ASAP3 and ULoVE enable high-speed optical recording of electrical activity in genetically defined neurons at deep locations during awake behavior. The ability to optically record electrical activity in individual genetically labeled neurons within behaving animals would greatly facilitate efforts to understand how nervous systems process information (Lee et al., 2006Lee A.K. Manns I.D. Sakmann B. Brecht M. Whole-cell recordings in freely moving rats.Neuron. 2006; 51: 399-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fluorescent genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) can reveal non-spiking electrical activity and resolve spike timing with sub-millisecond resolution, tasks that cannot be performed by fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (Lin and Schnitzer, 2016Lin M.Z. Schnitzer M.J. Genetically encoded indicators of neuronal activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1142-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Multiphoton microscopy, by selectively exciting fluorescence only within a focal point, suppresses the generation of background fluorescence and enables the segregation of signals between cells at deeper locations than one-photon microscopy, and thus has been essential for imaging GECIs in many regions of the brain (Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006Svoboda K. Yasuda R. Principles of two-photon excitation microscopy and its applications to neuroscience.Neuron. 2006; 50: 823-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The unique capabilities of GEVIs and multiphoton microscopy, however, have yet to be combined for single-trial voltage recordings in individual neurons within the mammalian brain. Indeed, fast multiphoton voltage recording has been considered exceedingly difficult or impractical. Multiphoton recording of GECIs is typically performed by raster scanning an entire plane at sampling rates of ≤30 Hz, suitable for detecting calcium transients, which persist for hundreds of milliseconds. However, GEVIs that are fast enough to track somatically generated spikes, or action potentials (APs), which persist for only a few milliseconds, would require sampling rates 1–2 orders of magnitude faster. If raster scanning were sped up, then laser power would need to be increased to maintain photon flux per voxel. Furthermore, as GEVIs reside in the membrane rather than in the cytosol, the number of GEVI molecules in an optical section is typically fewer than for GECIs, reducing the integrated signal per neuron (Brinks et al., 2015Brinks D. Klein A.J. Cohen A.E. Two-photon lifetime imaging of voltage indicating proteins as a probe of absolute membrane voltage.Biophys.

Optical recording of action potentials and other discrete physiological events: a perspective from signal detection theory.Physiology (Bethesda). 2007; 22: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These considerations have led to predictions that extremely high illumination powers would be required for multiphoton voltage imaging, leading to rapid photodamage and photobleaching (Brinks et al., 2015Brinks D. Klein A.J. Cohen A.E. Two-photon lifetime imaging of voltage indicating proteins as a probe of absolute membrane voltage.Biophys.

Voltage imaging: pitfalls and potential.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 5171-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) Given these constraints, the development of GEVIs with large responses and optimized kinetics is crucial for maximizing the chance of detecting electrical events in neurons. Currently, the GEVIs with the largest responses to both subthreshold changes and APs are based on two domains for voltage sensing: seven-transmembrane helix opsins and four-transmembrane helix voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). Opsin-based GEVIs have been used in vivo with one-photon excitation to report the electrical activity of superficially located neurons (Gong et al., 2015Gong Y. Huang C. Li J.Z. Grewe B.F. Zhang Y.

J. 2015; 109: 914-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Chamberland et al., 2017Chamberland S. Yang H.H. Pan M.M. Evans S.W. Guan S. Chavarha M. Yang Y. Salesse C.

In contrast, ASAP family GEVIs, composed of a circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP) variant inserted within the fourth transmembrane helix VSD of G. gallus voltage-sensing phosphatase (Figure 1A), are fully responsive under two-photon excitation (Brinks et al., 2015Brinks D.

In particular, ASAP2s demonstrates the largest response per AP of fluorescent protein-based GEVIs, although its kinetics are slower than earlier ASAP variants (Chamberland et al., 2017Chamberland S. Yang H.H. Pan M.M. Evans S.W. Guan S. Chavarha M. Yang Y. Salesse C. Wu H. Wu J.C. et al.Fast two-photon imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics in neuronal tissue with genetically encoded indicators.eLife. 2017; 6: e25690Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification of an improved indicator, ASAP3, from rapid library generation and electrical screening in mammalian cells. ASAP3 features the largest response among brightly fluorescent GEVIs to either steady-state voltages or APs under either one- or two-photon excitation, favorable kinetics for both AP timing and detection, and efficient membrane localization. In addition, we introduce an ultrafast local volume excitation (ULoVE) strategy for two-photon microscopy to selectively excite large membrane areas at sampling rates of up to 15 kHz per cell. Applying soma-localized ASAP3-Kv and ULoVE two-photon microscopy in awake head-fixed mice, we detect APs and subthreshold voltage dynamics of cortical and hippocampal neurons in single trials, with submillisecond temporal resolution, over durations of minutes and across multiple days. Finally, we use ASAP3-Kv and ULoVE to illustrate cell-type-specific modulation of subthreshold voltage by locomotion in the visual cortex. Screening for GEVI improvements has been hindered by the lack of rapid and reliable methods to impose known membrane potentials as cells are imaged. We hypothesized that electroporation could serve as a high-throughput method for changing membrane potential. We found that ASAP1 transiently expressed in HEK293-Kir2.1 cells responded to electroporation, with the expected fluorescence dimming (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C). Further validating this method, we found that ASAP1 and ArcLight responses to electroporation matched those of voltage steps from −70 to 0 mV under voltage clamp electrophysiology (Figure 1A; Table 1). As expected from its faster kinetics, ASAP1 responses reached steady state more quickly than ArcLight (Table S1).Table 1Characteristics of GEVIs Used for Single-Trial Imaging in Mammalian BrainArcLight Q239aValues from Jin et al.

We expressed GEVI variants in cells by transfection in multi-well plates, as possession of the GEVI gene before its expression removes the need to retrieve cells after screening. Imaging multiple cells in one well for each variant also improves performance assessment. To speed up GEVI construction and expression, we devised a protocol for PCR construction of full-length genes and direct transfection of PCR products (Figures 1B and S1D–S1F). In contrast, other GEVI screens use plasmid transfection, which introduces the costly and time-consuming steps of plasmid assembly, transformation, picking, culturing, and purification (Abdelfattah et al., 2016Abdelfattah A.S.

Unlike other GEVI screens, we produced all of the mutants deterministically, e.g., mutating two sites to all 400 possible amino acid combinations. This eliminated the need for oversampling to account for Poisson distributions, further improving screening efficiency. Finally, we devised MATLAB routines to perform electroporation, image capture, and image analysis (Figures 1C, S1G, and S1H). This successfully distinguished sensors with distinct responsivity and kinetics (Figure S1I). Automated screening and analysis enabled the evaluation of thousands of mutants daily, two orders of magnitude faster than patch-clamp electrophysiology. To generate an optimal ASAP family template for mutagenesis and library-based screening, we first explored combining known beneficial mutations. ASAP2f differs from ASAP1 by a shorter S3-cpGFP linker and is more responsive to hyperpolarization (Yang et al., 2016aYang H.H. St-Pierre F. Sun X. Ding X. Lin M.Z. Clandinin T.R. Subcellular imaging of voltage and calcium signals reveals neural processing in vivo.Cell. 2016; 166: 245-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ASAP2s differs from ASAP1 by the mutation of Arg-415 to Gln (R415Q) and is more responsive to depolarization, but it is reduced in speed (Table 1; Table S1) (Chamberland et al., 2017Chamberland S. Yang H.H. Pan M.M. Evans S.W. Guan S. Chavarha M. Yang Y. Salesse C. Wu H. Wu J.C. et al.Fast two-photon imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics in neuronal tissue with genetically encoded indicators.eLife. 2017; 6: e25690Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The combined mutant, ASAP2f R414Q (where amino acid 414 corresponds to 415 in ASAP2s), exhibited responsivity similar to ASAP2s and slightly slower kinetics (Figures S2A and S2B; Table S1). This construct was chosen as the mutagenesis template because its shorter S3-cpGFP linker reduces the sequence search space while potentially enabling tighter conformational coupling between the VSD and cpGFP domains. In GCaMP, deprotonation of the cpGFP chromophore underlies fluorescence enhancement by calcium (Wang et al., 2008Wang Q. Shui B. Kotlikoff M.I. Sondermann H.

We postulated that voltage also modulates fluorescence by regulating chromophore protonation in ASAP. Specifically, conformational changes in the VSD may be transduced from the S3-cpGFP linker through the first three positions of cpGFP to influence the position of His-151 (His-148 in wild-type GFP), which normally stabilizes the deprotonated (blue-absorbing) state of the chromophore via hydrogen bonding. We thus decided to target amino acids 146–151, beginning in the S3-cpGFP linker and ending at His-151 (Figure 1D), choosing one or two sites for saturation mutagenesis in each round. Over five rounds of screening, four of which involved combinatorial mutagenesis at two positions (Figures 1E, 1F, S2, S3, and S4), we obtained a variant that responded to depolarization from −70 to +30 mV, with a fluorescence change (ΔF/F) of −50.9% ± 1.1% (mean ± SEM, n = 10 cells). This is the largest fluorescence response among fluorescent protein-based voltage indicators characterized so far, representing a 46% improvement over the −34.9% ± 1% response (n = 6 cells) of ASAP2f R414Q (Figure 1G). We designated this variant, which differs from ASAP2f by the mutations L146G S147T N149R S150G H151D R414Q, as ASAP3.Figure S4The Third to Fifth Rounds of Combinatorial Saturation Mutagenesis, Targeting Ser-150 and His-151, Then Thr-206, and Then Phe-148 and Asn-149, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Results of the third round of electrical screening.

https://openalex.org/W2995063445,"Summary Marine bacteria and archaea play key roles in global biogeochemistry. To improve our understanding of this complex microbiome, we employed single-cell genomics and a randomized, hypothesis-agnostic cell selection strategy to recover 12,715 partial genomes from the tropical and subtropical euphotic ocean. A substantial fraction of known prokaryoplankton coding potential was recovered from a single, 0.4 mL ocean sample, which indicates that genomic information disperses effectively across the globe. Yet, we found each genome to be unique, implying limited clonality within prokaryoplankton populations. Light harvesting and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways were numerous across lineages, highlighting the value of single-cell genomics to advance the identification of ecological roles and biotechnology potential of uncultured microbial groups. This genome collection enabled functional annotation and genus-level taxonomic assignments for >80% of individual metagenome reads from the tropical and subtropical surface ocean, thus offering a model to improve reference genome databases for complex microbiomes."

The metastatic process is complex and affects diverse organs (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

Obenauf A.C. Metastatic colonization by circulating tumour cells.Nature. 2016; 529: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). As most cancer patients die of metastases at distant sites developing from disseminated tumor cells with primary or acquired resistance to therapy, a comprehensive and unbiased detection of disseminated tumor cells and tumor targeting drugs within the entire body is crucial (de Jong et al., 2014de Jong M. Essers J. van Weerden W.M. Imaging preclinical tumour models: improving translational power.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such technology would help to explore mechanisms affecting tumor metastasis and drug targeting in preclinical mouse models much more reliably, hence substantially contributing to the development of improved therapeutics. So far, such efforts have been hampered by the lack of (1) imaging technologies to reliably detect all individual metastases and disseminating tumor cells in mouse bodies, and (2) algorithms to quickly and accurately quantify large-scale imaging data. Here, we developed an analysis pipeline that allows us to efficiently overcome these limitations. First, we built upon recently developed tissue clearing methods for entire fixed mice (Cai et al., 2019Cai R. Pan C. Ghasemigharagoz A. Todorov M.I. Forstera B. Zhao S. Bhatia H.S. Parra-Damas A.

Single-cell phenotyping within transparent intact tissue through whole-body clearing.Cell. 2014; 158: 945-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) to address the imaging problem. Typically, fluorescent labeling of cancer cells in vitro or in vivo is achieved by endogenous expression of fluorescent proteins such as GFP, YFP, and mCherry, which emit light in the visible spectrum. However, many tissues in the mouse body show high autofluorescence in this range (Tuchin, 2016Tuchin V.V. Editor’s Introduction: Optical Methods for Biomedical Diagnosis.in: Handbook of Optical Biomedical Diagnostics. Second Edition. Spie Press, 2016Google Scholar, Zipfel et al., 2003Zipfel W.R. Williams R.M. Christie R. Nikitin A.Y. Hyman B.T. Webb W.W. Live tissue intrinsic emission microscopy using multiphoton-excited native fluorescence and second harmonic generation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7075-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), which hinders reliable detection of single cancer cells or small cell clusters in mouse bodies based on their endogenous fluorescent signal. To circumvent this problem, we chose to implement the vDISCO technology (Cai et al., 2019Cai R. Pan C. Ghasemigharagoz A. Todorov M.I. Forstera B. Zhao S. Bhatia H.S. Parra-Damas A. Mrowka L. Theodorou D. et al.Panoptic imaging of transparent mice reveals whole-body neuronal projections and skull-meninges connections.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which enhances the signal of fluorescent proteins of cancer cells more than 100-fold in cleared tissues, enabling reliable imaging not only of large metastases but also micrometastases throughout the entire body. Second, systematic analysis of metastasis in adult mouse bodies requires quantitative information such as location, size, and shape of all individual metastases. Manual detection and segmentation of numerous metastases in highly resolved full body scans is an extremely laborious task that may take several months per mouse for an expert annotator. In addition, automation by filter-based 3D object detectors is not reliable, as different body tissues have different levels of contrast (Pan et al., 2016Pan C. Cai R. Quacquarelli F.P. Ghasemigharagoz A. Lourbopoulos A. Matryba P. Plesnila N. Dichgans M. Hellal F. Erturk A. Shrinkage-mediated imaging of entire organs and organisms using uDISCO.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), causing a high rate of false-positive and false-negative metastasis detections. Recent studies have demonstrated the high efficacy of deep learning-based analysis of biomedical images, compared to filter-based or manual segmentation methods (Camacho et al., 2018Camacho D.M.

To enable automated, robust, and fast mapping of all metastases in transparent mice, we developed an efficient deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimized it for vDISCO imaging data and metastasis distribution patterns. Resolving these two bottlenecks allowed us to build an integrated, highly automated pipeline for analysis of metastasis and tumor-targeting therapeutics, which we named DeepMACT (deep learning-enabled metastasis analysis in cleared tissue). Using DeepMACT, we detected cancer metastases and even individual disseminated tumor cells in mouse bodies, including many metastases previously overlooked by human annotators. Furthermore, this enabled analyzing the targeting efficiency of a therapeutic antibody against carbonic anhydrase XII on the level of individual metastases. As a scalable, easily accessible, fast, and cost-efficient method, DeepMACT enables a wide range of studies on cancer metastasis and therapeutic strategies. To facilitate adoption of DeepMACT, a step-by-step handbook (Methods S1), the protocols for clearing and imaging, the deep learning algorithm, the training data, and the trained model are available online to address diverse questions in cancer research. Focusing on a clinically relevant tumor model, we transplanted human MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells, expressing mCherry and firefly luciferase, into the mammary fat pad of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice and allowed the tumors to grow and metastasize for 6–10 weeks (Figure 1A; Iorns et al., 2012Iorns E.

Furthermore, we injected the fluorescently tagged 6A10 therapeutic antibody that has been shown to reduce tumor burden in this model (Gondi et al., 2013Gondi G. Mysliwietz J. Hulikova A. Jen J.P.

Cancer. 2018; 143: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To comprehensively assess cancer cell dissemination and therapeutic antibody targeting in mouse bodies at the level of individual micrometastases, we developed DeepMACT. In short, we transcardially perfused the animals using standard PFA fixation and applied the vDISCO method to enhance the fluorescent signal of tumor cells. After light-sheet microscopy, the 3D image stacks of entire transparent mouse bodies were analyzed using deep learning algorithms. The DeepMACT pipeline consists of (1) vDISCO panoptic imaging of cancer metastases in transparent mice, and (2) deep learning-based analysis of cancer metastasis and antibody drug targeting (Figure 1B). We previously developed the vDISCO technology to image single fluorescent cells in mouse bodies through intact bones and skin (Cai et al., 2019Cai R. Pan C. Ghasemigharagoz A. Todorov M.I. Forstera B. Zhao S. Bhatia H.S. Parra-Damas A. Mrowka L. Theodorou D. et al.Panoptic imaging of transparent mice reveals whole-body neuronal projections and skull-meninges connections.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The vDISCO method utilizes bright fluorescent dyes conjugated with nanobodies to enhance the fluorescent signal of the cells that is weakened during the fixation and clearing process. Here, we first applied vDISCO to increase the fluorescence signal of mCherry-expressing cancer cells. By enhancing the tumor cell fluorescence with anti-mCherry or anti-GFP nanobodies conjugated to Atto-594 or Atto-647N dyes, we found that nanobodies can increase the signal strength of cancer cells over 100 times compared to imaging the endogenous mCherry signal after clearing (Figure S1). Owing to this significant enhancement in signal contrast, we could readily detect micrometastases buried in centimeters-thick mouse bodies (Figures S1F–S1L) e.g., in deep brain and spinal cord regions through the intact skull and vertebrae (Figures S1F and S1I, yellow arrowheads). To confirm the specificity of vDISCO enhancement of the signal from mCherry expressing cancer cells, we performed the following experiments: (1) we stained control mice without a tumor transplant, thereby lacking mCherry expression, and found no labeling in any of the analyzed organs (Figure S2A); and (2) we analyzed the primary tumors and lung metastases from the mouse bodies by staining them using a specific anti-luciferase antibody, which confirmed that endogenous mCherry fluorescence co-localized with both the signals from nanobodies and from the anti-luciferase antibody (Figures S2B and S2C).Figure S2Confirmation of the Specificity of Nanobody-Enhanced Staining in Mice Bearing mCherry-Expressing Tumors, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Comparison between an animal bearing an mCherry expressing tumor and a C57BL/6N control animal, which were both enhanced with an anti-mCherry nanobody conjugated to Atto647N (magenta) and imaged by light-sheet microscopy.

Because the detection of smaller-sized tumor cell clusters, which may represent dormant cancer cells or incipient metastatic nodules, is critical, we next tested if vDISCO allows imaging cancer micrometastases in mouse bodies. In order to compare our approach to conventional methods, we also acquired bioluminescence images of mice before applying DeepMACT. In line with previous findings (Iorns et al., 2012Iorns E. Drews-Elger K. Ward T.M. Dean S. Clarke J. Berry D. El Ashry D. Lippman M. A new mouse model for the study of human breast cancer metastasis.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47995Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we detected the earliest large metastasis of transplanted MDA-MB-231 cells at the axillary lymph node of mice by bioluminescence (Figures 2A and S3). However, bioluminescence imaging did not reveal any detailed information such as size or shape and failed to show the presence of micrometastases.Figure S3Examples of Tumor Metastasis Detection in Mice Using Bioluminescence Imaging versus vDISCO and Epifluorescence Microscopy, Related to Figure 2Show full captionMice were transplanted in the mammary fat pad with mCherry and firefly luciferase expressing MDA-MB-231 cells and imaged with bioluminescence followed by vDISCO clearing and epifluorescence imaging.(A-D) We found that bioluminescence imaging with normal exposure is not sufficiently sensitive to detect all the metastases in low tumor load mice. For example, the mice in (A and B) and (C and D) had very similar bioluminescence images with normal exposure. Applying vDISCO to these mice, we found no tumor metastases in one case (A and B) and a large metastasis (red arrowhead) in axillary lymph nodes (A.L.N. metastasis) (C and D) using a fluorescence stereo microscope. Although the signal from the primary tumor is strong in both normal and high exposure bioluminescence images (A and C, yellow box), metastases in lungs (A and C, red boxes) are not visible, but are detected by epifluorescence imaging (D, yellow arrowhead). In epifluorescence images, the tumors (A647N-labeled) are shown in magenta and the background, scanned in 488 nm, is shown in green.(E-H) In mice with high tumor load, a bulk heatmap of metastatic distribution can be obtained by bioluminescence imaging, without detailed shape and size information. In contrast, vDISCO resolved single micrometastases in whole mouse bodies even with a fluorescence stereo microscope. Especially in the lungs, even micrometastases with a diameter smaller than 100 μm could be resolved in intact mice (F, yellow arrowhead).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mice were transplanted in the mammary fat pad with mCherry and firefly luciferase expressing MDA-MB-231 cells and imaged with bioluminescence followed by vDISCO clearing and epifluorescence imaging.

For example, the mice in (A and B) and (C and D) had very similar bioluminescence images with normal exposure.

After bioluminescence assessment, we applied vDISCO using anti-mCherry signal enhancing nanobodies conjugated to Atto-647N and imaged the mouse bodies first using epifluorescence in 2D (Figures 2B–2G), then using light-sheet microscopy in 3D (Figures 2H–2L). In epifluorescence, we could readily see both the primary tumor (Figure 2F) and the major metastases at the axillary lymph node (Figure 2D), which were also detected by bioluminescence imaging (Figure 2A), albeit as a bulk signal, lacking information on real size and shape. Importantly, our approach allowed the visualization of several micrometastases in the lungs with conventional epifluorescence imaging, which were not visible in bioluminescence (compare the magenta marked regions in Figures 2A with 2B, and red arrowheads in 2E; more examples shown in Figure S3). Thus, vDISCO followed by epifluorescence imaging, which can be completed within minutes, already provided greater details and sensitivity compared to bioluminescence imaging. Next, we imaged entire fixed transparent mice using a light-sheet microscope (Cai et al., 2019Cai R. Pan C. Ghasemigharagoz A. Todorov M.I. Forstera B. Zhao S. Bhatia H.S. Parra-Damas A. Mrowka L. Theodorou D. et al.Panoptic imaging of transparent mice reveals whole-body neuronal projections and skull-meninges connections.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in 3D to detect individual micrometastases throughout the body (Figure 2H). In the chest area, we could see various metastases not only in the lungs (yellow segmented region in Figure 2I) and lymph nodes, but also at the base of the neck and surrounding tissues (Figures 2J–2L; Video S1). Importantly, light-sheet microscopy scanning allowed us to image even single disseminated tumor cells in the mouse body. Examples of single disseminated tumor cells resolved in full body scans are shown in Figure 2M (see also Video S2), which were further verified by high-magnification light-sheet microscopy imaging showing the colocalization of each single tumor cells with a single nucleus stained by PI (Figure 2N). Thus, our approach allows for the first time to detect micrometastases in full body scans of mice in 3D down to the size of individual cells. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5NjFhNWM0N2M4YzZkZDhjNmU5NTMyZDI3NjI4ZmU0MiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MTk0NjIxfQ.iOA0ta_Nk7LwbNLL6gjySX9KZUqhXXWMNTL3YjN7K9QN7SoOQOCPM5HraqhVXYOe2bWiHbAlpXIG4_8Geqh-kXs8JcjBcfFL_k80vh6AzpGHnlZlNq8hOjfDPqV0YN4PVNvxdD-ngXpcgYomEjcvUFFAJCVB_xSuQFLdcvP97FbrOcYfAaWE8fNyRZeKJVDYwOD5kSfWZeZnH2GbdD3VwNTz6V8yRvL1V93e0Vy0WdJd6fMsLuvUD7nsE-UCr44TGMUq5v3mW-kr-GFa9UnhEBpbth9ulapRxnA3gH2ZXbxFKLAJLzvCVlZMcGxOMJJyNSTBIj_CDBl9EfuYPOaneA Download .mp4 (15.73 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. 3D Reconstruction of a Mouse Torso Scanned by Light-Sheet Microscopy, Related to Figure 2The left side shows the segmented view, in which the torso is represented in gray, the lungs in yellow and the heart in green.

We developed an optimized deep learning-based approach to detect and segment all cancer metastases in full-body scans of mice. This framework solves the 3D task of detecting and segmenting metastases in volumetric scans with CNNs that process 2D projections of small sub-volumes (Figure 3A). In brief, we first derived three 2D maximum intensity projections (aligned with the x, y, and z axes) for each sub-volume in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We fed the resulting projections to the CNN and obtained 2D probability maps, in which each pixel value represents the estimated probability that this pixel identifies a metastasis under the given projection. We then reconstructed a 3D segmentation from the three projections observing increased reliability in detecting true positive metastases while safely ignoring non-metastatic tissue that would produce false positives in the individual projections. For example, in Figure 3B, the green arrows show successful detection of a real metastasis and the red arrows show successful ignoring of a structure that could be mistaken for a metastasis from a single 2D projection. This approach was highly effective in detecting and segmenting metastases in the imaging data, yielding a binary mask for all metastases in the body. The core of our architecture makes use of CNNs (Figure 3C), structurally similar to the established U-net (Ronneberger et al., 2015Ronneberger O. Fischer P. Brox T. U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation. Springer International Publishing, 2015Crossref Scopus (32829) Google Scholar), which learn to distinguish metastases from the background signal. This is achieved by using a deep stack of encoding units, which detect characteristic cancer features, and a corresponding stack of decoding units, which segment each metastasis at pixel-level. Each encoding unit performs two convolutions, extracting information about the environment for each pixel and representing that information in a third dimension—the feature channels. Before being passed on to the next encoding unit, the image is spatially down-sampled. Together, this means that the neural network is steadily increasing the feature channels and steadily decreasing the spatial resolution, enforcing the network to learn even more abstract representations of the data (i.e., features) in the deeper layers, before mapping the information relevant to cancer cells back to the original resolution in the decoding upward path. This happens by up-sampling the abstract, low-resolution information from lower layers and concatenating it with the less abstract, but higher-resolution information from the encoding path via skip connections (some exemplary visualizations of the computational stages are presented in Figures S4A–S4C). To assess the reliability of our automated deep learning architecture, we applied it to a fresh test set of a full-body scan, which was neither used for training the CNNs nor to optimize hyperparameters. The datasets were manually annotated by human experts and any disagreements between experts were jointly rev"

A better understanding of cortico-subcortical circuits in individuals will aid in development of personalized treatments. Using precision functional mapping-individual-specific analysis of highly sampled human participants-we investigated individual-specific functional connectivity between subcortical structures and cortical functional networks. This approach revealed distinct subcortical zones of network specificity and multi-network integration. Integration zones were systematic, with convergence of cingulo-opercular control and somatomotor networks in the ventral intermediate thalamus (motor integration zones), dorsal attention and visual networks in the pulvinar, and default mode and multiple control networks in the caudate nucleus. The motor integration zones were present in every individual and correspond to consistently successful sites of deep brain stimulation (DBS; essential tremor). Individually variable subcortical zones correspond to DBS sites with less consistent treatment effects, highlighting the importance of PFM for neurosurgery, neurology, and psychiatry."
https://openalex.org/W2995522508,"During cell division, newly replicated DNA is actively segregated to the daughter cells. In most bacteria, this process involves the DNA-binding protein ParB, which condenses the centromeric regions of sister DNA molecules into kinetochore-like structures that recruit the DNA partition ATPase ParA and the prokaroytic SMC/condensin complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of a ParB-like protein (PadC) that emerges to tightly bind the ribonucleotide CTP. The CTP-binding pocket of PadC is conserved in ParB and composed of signature motifs known to be essential for ParB function. We find that ParB indeed interacts with CTP and requires nucleotide binding for DNA condensation in vivo. We further show that CTP-binding modulates the affinity of ParB for centromeric parS sites, whereas parS recognition stimulates its CTPase activity. ParB proteins thus emerge as a new class of CTP-dependent molecular switches that act in concert with ATPases and GTPases to control fundamental cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2995253087,"Spermiogenesis is a highly orchestrated developmental process during which chromatin condensation decouples transcription from translation. Spermiogenic mRNAs are transcribed earlier and stored in a translationally inert state until needed for translation; however, it remains largely unclear how such repressed mRNAs become activated during spermiogenesis. We previously reported that the MIWI/piRNA machinery is responsible for mRNA elimination during late spermiogenesis in preparation for spermatozoa production. Here we unexpectedly discover that the same machinery is also responsible for activating translation of a subset of spermiogenic mRNAs to coordinate with morphological transformation into spermatozoa. Such action requires specific base-pairing interactions of piRNAs with target mRNAs in their 3' UTRs, which activates translation through coupling with cis-acting AU-rich elements to nucleate the formation of a MIWI/piRNA/eIF3f/HuR super-complex in a developmental stage-specific manner. These findings reveal a critical role of the piRNA system in translation activation, which we show is functionally required for spermatid development."

Better control over deriving all islet cell types is limited by incomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving endocrine lineage specification. hPSC-derived islets (SC-islets) show glucose-responsive insulin release and cure diabetic rodents, yet they lack the full magnitude of responsiveness shown by mature islets in vivo. Mature responsiveness develops postnatally as insulin secretion capacity and the glucose threshold for secretion increase (Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2006Aguayo-Mazzucato C. Sanchez-Soto C.

Weaning triggers a maturation step of pancreatic β cells.Dev. Cell. 2015; 32: 535-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). While factors promoting islet maturation have been described (e.g., MAFA and NEUROD1), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear (Liu and Hebrok, 2017Liu J.S. Hebrok M. All mixed up: defining roles for β-cell subtypes in mature islets.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we use epigenome analyses to better understand mechanisms driving human islet differentiation and maturation. We define regulatory landscapes, the putative pioneer factors that establish them, and their state dynamics throughout islet development. We find that enhancer turnover occurs mainly upon lineage commitment, which is foreshadowed by widespread yet dynamic enhancer priming. Accordingly, we show that priming of α-cell-specific enhancers steers PH toward an α-cell fate. Modeling core regulatory circuits (CRCs) across islet differentiation and maturation stages captures both known and unexpected regulators such as LMX1B, which we validate as critical for generating endocrine cells. Finally, contrasting regulatory landscapes in SC-β and mature β cells reveals a role for circadian rhythms in fostering mature glucose responsiveness. Entrainment to daily feeding/fasting cycles activates islet clocks and elicits rhythmic transcription of energy metabolism and insulin synthesis/transport/release genes, triggering metabolic rhythms and cyclic insulin responses with a higher glucose threshold, thus recapitulating an aspect of postnatal maturation. Clock-entrained SC-islets gain stable epigenetic changes at genes enabling mature insulin responses and sustain function from as early as 3 days after in vivo transplantation. These data, available via an online resource (http://meltonlab.rc.fas.harvard.edu/data/pancreatic_enhancers/), reveal mechanisms controlling human islet development and illustrate how clock modulation can be harnessed to further functional maturation of a stem-cell-derived product. We exploited the stepwise differentiation of islets from ∼108 hPSCs (Millman et al., 2016Millman J.R. Xie C. Van Dervort A. Gürtler M. Pagliuca F.W. Melton D.A.

These included early and late pancreatic progenitors (PP1 and PP2) and endocrine progenitors (ENs), isolated based on known markers, and we found that DPP4/CD26 labels glucagon+ cells, allowing sorting live SC-β from PH. hPSC-derived and primary α/β cells were then subjected to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for two histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), and directional total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In total, we generated ∼200 datasets with ∼12 billion reads aligned to the human genome (Table S1). Replicate epigenome and transcriptome measurements showed high consistency and independently recapitulate the stepwise development of the islet lineage from hPSCs (Figure 1B). Epigenome and total RNA maps reveal major switches upon endocrine commitment. Profiling enhancer/promoter histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W.

Despite consistent genome coverage and marking levels across differentiation stages, >75% of H3K27ac/H3K4me1 sites are detected in at most 3 stages (Figures S1B–S1E). These dynamic chromatin sites are mostly distal to promoters and are overrepresented in EN and α/β cells, suggesting widespread remodeling of enhancers. Moreover, total RNA maps detect, among ∼2,000 genes with differential isoform usage (Table S2), an endocrine switch toward DNMT3A and TET1 isoforms generated from alternative promoters (Figure 1C) that confer distinct subnuclear localization/biochemical activities (Chen et al., 2002Chen T. Ueda Y. Xie S. Li E. A novel Dnmt3a isoform produced from an alternative promoter localizes to euchromatin and its expression correlates with active de novo methylation.J. Biol.

Cell. 2016; 64: 1062-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DNA methylation dynamics further reveal substantial endocrine remodeling. We detect >125,000 differentially methylated regions across stage transitions, comprising distal intergenic sites with focal H3K27ac/H3K4me1 (Figures 1D and S1G; Table S3). Hypermethylation is highest upon pluripotency exit and reflects stable chromatin silencing (Figures 1D and 1E, top). Hypomethylation, by contrast, reflects stage-specific chromatin activation and is most prevalent upon pancreatic/endocrine specification (Figures 1D and 1E, bottom). Indeed, hypomethylation co-occurs with focal H3K27ac/H3K4me1 and ATAC gain (Figure 1F), shows greater stage specificity than hypermethylation (Figure S1H), and occurs at sites enriched for binding of factors that regulate the respective stage (Figure S1E). Critically, hyper-/hypomethylation concurs with silencing/activation of the nearest gene (Figures 1I and S1I). These data chart epigenome dynamics throughout islet lineage progression, linking them to the control of stage-specific gene expression. We used H3K27ac enrichment outside promoters to define >34,000 putative enhancer domains active during islet differentiation (Figures 1G and S1J; Table S4). These are broad H3K27ac regions that often overlap the gene with which they were associated (Figures S1K–S1M) and show striking stage specificity. For example, the SOX17 domain is specific to endoderm, the NGN3 domain is specific to EN, and the MAFA domain is specific to mature β cells (Figure 1G). In all, 85% of enhancer domains change activity across stage transitions, eliciting changes in DNA openness, H3K4me1 marking, and RNA production (Figure 2A). Notably, differential enhancer activity concurs with differential expression of the overlapping/nearest gene (Figure 2B). Enhancer establishment, marked by H3K4me1 deposition, co-occurs with focal DNA opening and methylation loss (Figures S2A and S2B), consistent with targeting by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) (Felsenfeld et al., 1996Felsenfeld G.

Gaidatzis D. et al.DNA-binding factors shape the mouse methylome at distal regulatory regions.Nature. 2011; 480: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). A stepwise acquisition of these marks can be seen at key lineage-specifying TF loci. For instance, NGN3 distal enhancers gain ATAC and H3K4me1 marking in PP1, prior to H3K27ac gain and NGN3 expression in EN (Figure 1H). Similar conclusions can be drawn for master regulators of other differentiation stages (SOX17, PDX1, and NKX6.1). Thus, stepwise epigenetic changes can forecast gene programs that drive developmental transitions (see below). Clustering enhancers by epigenome/RNA dynamics (Figures 2C–2E) reveals 10 groups: I–II share enhancers formed before pancreatic specification, II–IV cluster enhancers formed in committed pancreatic progenitors, and V–VIII comprise enhancers formed upon endocrine specification and activated in progenitor/terminally differentiated endocrine cells. We also found sets of enhancers (group IX) that are lost from hPSCs and re-form upon islet cell maturation, including loci specifically active in β cells (e.g., MAFA, UCN3, and SIX3) (Figure S2C). Dissecting enhancer turnover shows that only 10% of islet lineage enhancers are preset in hPSCs. We investigated at which stage enhancers are gained/lost between hPSC and differentiated progeny (Figures 2F and S2D). Strikingly, most (∼60%) enhancers gained in PP1 or EN form in the first lineage progenitor, with reduced formation upon subsequent differentiation. Similarly, enhancer loss and activation/deactivation are highest at the pancreatic/endocrine lineage branching points (Figure S2E). These data define enhancer dynamics from pluripotent to postmitotic islet cells, revealing that enhancer potential is largely reset upon lineage commitment. The competence to execute specific cell fates following inductive cues can be linked to a gain of H3K4me1 before H3K27ac deposition at lineage-specific enhancers (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M.

Dynamic transformations of genome-wide epigenetic marking and transcriptional control establish T cell identity.Cell. 2012; 149: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We find that only 10%–20% of enhancers activated across stage transitions gain H3K4me1 in the preceding stage, enriching for critical effectors of the subsequent one (Figures 2D and S3A). However, up to 60% of newly activated enhancers are H3K4me1 marked in earlier stages and show dynamic H3K4me1 gain/loss prior to activation (Figures 3A and S3C), revealing H3K4me1-premarking to be pervasive but substantially plastic. Importantly, H3K27ac and RNA levels are higher at H3K4me1-premarked versus de novo enhancers (Figures 3B and S3B), compatible with a transcriptionally primed epigenetic state. We investigated to which extent enhancer priming reflects lineage potential. Primed-to-active enhancer transitions between EN and α/β are comparable, supporting EN multipotency, whereas SC-β priming is biased toward β-specific enhancers (Figure S3D). Intriguingly, PHs are biased toward α-specific enhancers (Figure 3C), suggesting predisposition to become α cells, which they resemble more closely than β cells (Veres et al., 2019Veres A. Faust A.L. Bushnell H.L. Engquist E.N. Kenty J.H. Harb G. Poh Y.C. Sintov E. Gürtler M. Pagliuca F.W. et al.Charting cellular identity during human in vitro β-cell differentiation.Nature. 2019; 569: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (Figure 3D). To test this, we capitalized on our ability to purify PH and SC-β and transplanted them alone or in combination under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice (Figures 3E and S3E). Unlike mice receiving SC-β cells, those receiving comparable numbers of PH could not sustain robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Kidney grafts were then retrieved and stained for insulin/glucagon. Unlike SC-β grafts, which contain mainly insulin+ monohormonal cells, PH grafts contain mainly insulin− glucagon+ cells (Figures 3E and S3F), demonstrating α-cell resolution. Thus, an epigenetic program steers PH toward an α-cell fate. Developmental competence is endowed by chromatin-opening pioneer factors (Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014Iwafuchi-Doi M. Zaret K.S. Pioneer transcription factors in cell reprogramming.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2679-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We find that newly opened chromatin sites during islet differentiation enrich for binding sites of known pioneer TFs (Figures S4A and S4B) and show focal demethylation (Figures S4C and S4D), in line with pioneer activity. We identify pioneer FOXA/GATA and HNF/MEIS factors in PP1 and PP2, RFX/NEUROD in EN, and MAF factors in islet cells, along with unexpected TFs such as NHLH1/2 in EN and IRF1, ELF3, and AP-1 components (FOS, FOSL2, and JUNB) in β cells (Figure 4A; Table S5). Stage-specific expression patterns (Figure S4E) support roles for these factors in directing islet lineage progression. To predict maturation pioneers, we surveyed DNA openness over a 4-week in vitro time course during which SC-β cells gain glucose responsiveness (Figures 4B and S4F). Robust function (GSIS >2 μIU/103 cells and >1.5-fold stimulation) was seen by week 3, reflecting gains in both insulin content and secretory capacity. With this transition, we detect newly opened sites overlapping/near insulin as well as genes regulating its processing and secretion (e.g., CADPS, SYT4, and STX2), in SC-β cells, but not PHs (Figures 4C and S4G). Surprisingly, these sites feature the core circadian clock activators (CLOCK and ARNTL/BMAL1) among the top-enriched TF binding motifs (Figure 4D; Table S5; see below). Conversely, known controllers MAFA and NEUROD1 only appear by week 4, suggesting an incomplete maturation process. To examine changes upon further maturation in vivo, we transplanted SC-β into immunocompromised rats, which enabled recovery of enough cells for ATAC-seq (Figures 4E and S4H). Engrafted SC-β cells more closely resemble β cells (Figure 1B), gaining >40,000 open chromatin sites, overrepresented at TF (e.g., ISL1 and PAX6) and secretory genes (e.g., UCN3 and SLC30A8), which are often shared by both (Figure S4I; Table S5). These sites enrich for MAFA/NEUROD1 binding motifs, among other unexpected TFs (e.g., IRF1 and ELF3) (Figure 4D). These data reveal putative pioneer TFs throughout islet development, highlighting potential regulators of the onset and refinement of β cell function. Stable cell states are reportedly set by TFs via autoregulatory loops involving joint formation of extended or superenhancers (SEs) (Gaulton et al., 2010Gaulton K.J. Nammo T. Pasquali L. Simon J.M.

A cell’s CRC can thus be modeled by finding SE-driven TFs in interconnected autoregulatory loops (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G.

Using this logic, we generated CRC models that effectively capture master pancreatic/endocrine regulators (Figure 5; Table S6). For example, PP2 CRCs contain PDX1, NKX6.1, SOX9, and ONECUT1/HNF6, while β CRCs contain MAFA, PAX6, and ISL1. Binding among CRC factors is supported by immunoprecipitation studies (not shown), and depleting a given TF triggers selective depletion of the others in its CRC (Figure S5A), verifying strong interconnectivity. How are CRCs remodeled during development? We reasoned that lineage-inductive cues could trigger activation of new CRC-forming TF sets that in turn reprogram cell sate. Indeed, lineage-specifying CRC factors show high stage specificity (Figure 5C). For example, endoderm-specifying (GSC, EOMES, and SOX17) and pancreatic-specifying (PDX1, SOX9, and ONECUT1) TFs are highly endoderm and PP1 specific, respectively, verifying earlier studies (Oliver-Krasinski and Stoffers, 2008Oliver-Krasinski J.M. Stoffers D.A. On the origin of the beta cell.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1998-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This analysis also points to unanticipated TFs such as LMX1B (specific to EN) and the circadian factors BHLHE40/SHARP2, BHLHE41/SHARP1 (specific to β cells), and HLF (specific to α cells). These show high interconnectivity (Figure S5C), including with key TFs that partake in CRCs at multiple stages (PDX1, NKX6.1, and PAX6) (Figure 5D), suggesting that stage-specific TFs rewire otherwise stable CRCs during development. We tested whether LMX1B regulates the EN state. Depleting LMX1B during in vitro endocrine induction limited the pool of EN progenitors and hampered endocrine gene activation (Figures S5D and S5E). We thus disrupted LMX1B using an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system (González et al., 2014González F. Zhu Z. Shi Z.D. Lelli K. Verma N. Li Q.V. Huangfu D. An iCRISPR platform for rapid, multiplexable, and inducible genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) in independent hPSC lines (Figures 5E and S5F). LMX1B−/− lines differentiated normally up to EN progenitor formation, yet subsequent SC-β and PH generation was drastically impaired, with median <1% SC-β cells formed (Figures 5E and S5G). RNA profiling consistently reveals hampered induction of EN CRC TFs (PAX4, INSM1, and MAFB), pan-endocrine TFs (NEUROD1 and PAX6), secretory proteins (CHGA and SCG5), and hormones (insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin) (Figures 5F and S5H). Conversely, TFs (ONECUT/HES) and signaling pathways (Wnt, Notch, and Bmp) selective for pancreatic progenitors (Sharon et al., 2019Sharon N. Vanderhooft J. Straubhaar J. Mueller J. Chawla R. Zhou Q. Engquist E.N. Trapnell C. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A.

Thus, LMX1B is critical for in vitro endocrine cell differentiation. Circadian clocks are vital for attuning insulin secretion to daily feeding/fasting cycles (Bass and Takahashi, 2010Bass J. Takahashi J.S. Circadian integration of metabolism and energetics.Science. 2010; 330: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, Gamble et al., 2014Gamble K.L. Berry R. Frank S.J. Young M.E. Circadian clock control of endocrine factors.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2014; 10: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Clock controllers are linked to islet maturation by their chromatin and expression patterns (Figures S4E and S5B), footprint at regulatory sites gained as SC-β cells raise insulin production/secretion (Figure 4D), and interconnections with maturity-linked factors in the β cell CRC (Figure 5D). We thus asked if clock entrainment can foster in vitro islet maturation. First, we verified that insulin responses of cadaveric and SC-islets can be entrained by a single metabolic shock (Figure S6A), as seen in rodents (Perelis et al., 2015Perelis M. Marcheva B. Ramsey K.M. Schipma M.J. Hutchison A.L. Taguchi A. Peek C.B. Hong H. Huang W. Omura C. et al.Pancreatic β cell enhancers regulate rhythmic transcription of genes controlling insulin secretion.Science. 2015; 350: aac4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After recovery from shock, cultures grown in constant medium show time-of-day variation in insulin content and stimulated secretion, with peak production/secretion 12 h post-recovery. Fold-stimulation is modestly increased relative to parallel mock-treated cultures at this time (Figure S6B). Entrainment to daily feeding/fasting rhythms using various stimuli (glucose, arginine, forskolin, and insulin), however, can boost insulin stimulation capacity by as much as 6-fold (Figures 6A, S6C, and S6D). Surprisingly, this reflects lower responses to basal (2.8 mM) glucose (Figure 6B) without significant change in overall responses to stimulatory (20 mM glucose/ 30 mM KCL) conditions or overall insulin content (Figure S6E). Enhanced responsiveness reflects new cellular states, as individual circadian-entrained islet cells flux significantly more calcium than most (∼75%) mock-treated counterparts (Figure 6C). We then tested our optimized entrainment method in SC-islets. The results in Figures 6D and S6F show cyclic insulin produ"

Mortality in CF patients is mostly due to respiratory sequelae. Challenges with gene delivery have limited attempts to treat CF using in vivo gene therapy, and low correction levels have hindered ex vivo gene therapy efforts. We have used Cas9 and adeno-associated virus 6 to correct the ΔF508 mutation in readily accessible upper-airway basal stem cells (UABCs) obtained from CF patients. On average, we achieved 30%-50% allelic correction in UABCs and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from 10 CF patients and observed 20%-50% CFTR function relative to non-CF controls in differentiated epithelia. Furthermore, we successfully embedded the corrected UABCs on an FDA-approved porcine small intestinal submucosal membrane (pSIS), and they retained differentiation capacity. This study supports further development of genetically corrected autologous airway stem cell transplant as a treatment for CF."
https://openalex.org/W2994837387,"Beta-caryophyllene is an odoriferous bicyclic sesquiterpene found in various herbs and spices. Recently, it was found that beta-caryophyllene is a ligand of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2). Activation of CB2 will decrease pain, a major signal for inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that beta-caryophyllene can affect wound healing by decreasing inflammation. Here we show that cutaneous wounds of mice treated with beta-caryophyllene had enhanced re-epithelialization. The treated tissue showed increased cell proliferation and cells treated with beta-caryophyllene showed enhanced cell migration, suggesting that the higher re-epithelialization is due to enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration. The treated tissues also had up-regulated gene expression for hair follicle bulge stem cells. Olfactory receptors were not involved in the enhanced wound healing. Transient Receptor Potential channel genes were up-regulated in the injured skin exposed to beta-caryophyllene. Interestingly, there were sex differences in the impact of beta- caryophyllene as only the injured skin of female mice had enhanced re-epithelialization after exposure to beta-caryophyllene. Our study suggests that chemical compounds included in essential oils have the capability to improve wound healing, an effect generated by synergetic impacts of multiple pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2995115404,"Ontario, Canada introduced a publicly-funded 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for infants in 2010, replacing the 10-valent (PCV10, 2009-2010) and the 7-valent (PCV7, 2005-2009) conjugate vaccine programs; a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has been available for older adults since 1996. We examined the epidemiology and serotype distribution of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Ontario in the context of provincial immunization programs.We included confirmed IPD cases reported in Ontario between 2007 and 2017. We grouped serotypes according to Ontario's current immunization program (PCV13, PPV23, and non-vaccine-preventable) and calculated incidence rates (per 100,000 population) using population data.Between 2007 and 2017, annual incidence of IPD in Ontario ranged between 7.3 and 9.7/100,000 per year. Measures of illness severity were high throughout the period of surveillance. After PCV13 program implementation in 2010, incidence due to PCV13 serotypes decreased significantly across all age groups, with the greatest reductions in children <5 years and adults ≥65 years. Conversely, incidence due to PPV23 unique serotypes increased significantly between 2007 and 2017, with the greatest increases observed in adults 50-64 years (1.4 to 3.5/100,000) and ≥65 years (2.3 to 7.2/100,000). Similar increases were observed in incidence due to non-vaccine-preventable serotypes among all age groups, except infants <1 year. Within specific serotypes, incidence due to serotypes 3 (0.42 to 0.98/100,000) and 22F (0.31 to 0.72/100,000) increased significantly between 2007 and 2017, while incidence due to serotypes 19A and 7F decreased significantly during the PCV13 period (2010-2017).Eight years after PCV13 implementation in Ontario, our data suggest both direct and indirect effects on serotype-specific incidence in young children and older adults. However, overall provincial rates have remained unchanged, and IPD continues to be a severe burden on the population. The rising incidence of IPD due to PPV23 unique and non-vaccine-preventable serotypes, and the growing burden of serotypes 3 and 22F, require further study."
https://openalex.org/W2995039455,"Economic choice proceeds from evaluation, in which we contemplate options, to selection, in which we weigh options and choose one. These stages must be differentiated so that decision makers do not proceed to selection before evaluation is complete. We examined responses of neurons in two core reward regions, orbitofrontal (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), during two-option choice with asynchronous offer presentation. Our data suggest that neurons selective during the first (presumed evaluation) and second (presumed comparison and selection) offer epochs come from a single pool. Stage transition is accompanied by a shift toward orthogonality in the low-dimensional population response manifold. Nonetheless, the relative position of each option in driving responses in the population subspace is preserved. The orthogonalization we observe supports the hypothesis that the transition from evaluation to selection leads to reorganization of response subspace and suggests a mechanism by which value-related signals are prevented from prematurely driving choice."
https://openalex.org/W2903828121,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using delta-radiomics to predict overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas treated by concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery and bevacizumab, and to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for delta-radiomics feature selection and building classification models. Methods The pre-treatment, one-week post-treatment, and two-month post-treatment T1 and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI were acquired. 61 radiomic features (intensity histogram-based, morphological, and texture features) were extracted from the gross tumor volume in each image. Delta-radiomics were calculated between the pre-treatment and post-treatment features. Univariate Cox regression and 3 multivariate machine learning methods (L1-regularized logistic regression [L1-LR], random forest [RF] or neural networks [NN]) were used to select a reduced number of features, and 7 machine learning methods (L1-LR, L2-LR, RF, NN, kernel support vector machine [KSVM], linear support vector machine [LSVM], or naïve bayes [NB]) was used to build classification models for predicting OS. The performances of the total 21 model combinations built based on single-time-point radiomics (pre-treatment, one-week post-treatment, and two-month post-treatment) and delta-radiomics were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results For a small cohort of 12 patients, delta-radiomics resulted in significantly higher AUC than pre-treatment radiomics (p-value<0.01). One-week/two-month delta-features resulted in significantly higher AUC (p-value<0.01) than the one-week/two-month post-treatment features, respectively. 18/21 model combinations were with higher AUC from one-week delta-features than two-month delta-features. With one-week delta-features, RF feature selector + KSVM classifier and RF feature selector + NN classifier showed the highest AUC of 0.889. Conclusions The results indicated that delta-features could potentially provide better treatment assessment than single-time-point features. The treatment assessment is substantially affected by the time point for computing the delta-features and the combination of machine learning methods for feature selection and classification."
https://openalex.org/W2996756368,"A major function of GPCRs is to inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter release, requiring ligand-activated receptors to couple locally to effectors at terminals. The current understanding of how this is achieved is through receptor immobilization on the terminal surface. Here, we show that opioid peptide receptors, GPCRs that mediate highly sensitive presynaptic inhibition, are instead dynamic in axons. Opioid receptors diffuse rapidly throughout the axon surface and internalize after ligand-induced activation specifically at presynaptic terminals. We delineate a parallel regulated endocytic cycle for GPCRs operating at the presynapse, separately from the synaptic vesicle cycle, which clears activated receptors from the surface of terminals and locally reinserts them to maintain the diffusible surface pool. We propose an alternate strategy for achieving local control of presynaptic effectors that, opposite to using receptor immobilization and enforced proximity, is based on lateral mobility of receptors and leverages the inherent allostery of GPCR-effector coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2996554880,"The treatment of glioblastoma is challenging for the clinician, due to its chemotherapeutic resistance. Recent findings suggest that targeting glioblastoma using anti-cancer natural polyphenols is a promising strategy. In this context, curcumin and berberine have been shown to have potent anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects against several malignancies. Due to the poor solubility and limited bioavailability, these compounds have limited efficacy for treating cancer. However, use of a formulation of curcumin with higher bioavailability or combining it with berberine as a co-treatment may be proving to be more efficacious against cancer. Recently, we demonstrated that solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCPs) provided more bioavailability and anti-cancer effects in cultured glioblastoma cells than did natural curcumin. Interestingly, a combination of curcumin and berberine has proven to be more effective in inhibiting growth and proliferation of cancer in the liver, breast, lung, bone and blood. However, the effect of combining these drugs for treating glioblastoma, especially with respect to its effect on activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways has not been studied. Therefore, we decided to assess the co-treatment effects of these drugs on two different glioblastoma cell lines (U-87MG and U-251MG) and neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) derived from human tissue. In this study, we compared single and combination (1:5) treatment of SLCP (20 μM) and berberine (100 μM) on measures of cell viability, cell death markers, levels of c-Myc and p53, along with biomarkers of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways after 24-48 h of incubation. We found that co-treatment of SLCP and berberine produced more glioblastoma cell death, more DNA fragmentation, and significantly decreased ATP levels and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential than did single treatments in both glioblastoma cells lines. In addition, we observed that co-treatment inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway more efficiently than their single treatments. Our study suggests that combination treatments of SLCP and berberine may be a promising strategy to reduce or prevent glioblastoma growth in comparison to individual treatments using either compound."
https://openalex.org/W2981937324,"Background The triage of patients in prehospital care is a difficult task, and improved risk assessment tools are needed both at the dispatch center and on the ambulance to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients. This study validates a machine learning-based approach to generating risk scores based on hospital outcomes using routinely collected prehospital data. Methods Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016–2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Composite risk scores were generated based on the models and compared to National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) and actual dispatched priorities in a prospectively gathered dataset from 2018. Results A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016–2018. Concordance indexes (or areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51–0.66, while those for NEWS ranged from 0.66–0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.70–0.79 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79–0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS. Conclusions Machine learning-based risk scores outperformed a widely-used rule-based triage algorithm and human prioritization decisions in predicting hospital outcomes. Performance was robust in a prospectively gathered dataset, and scores demonstrated adequate calibration. Future research should explore the robustness of these methods when applied to other settings, establish appropriate outcome measures for use in determining the need for prehospital care, and investigate the clinical impact of interventions based on these methods."

Our results directly demonstrate (1) that transforming DNA efficiently integrates into the genome as single-stranded DNA, (2) that the resulting heteroduplexes are resolved by chromosome replication and segregation, and (3) that integrated DNA is rapidly expressed prior to cell division.

Thus, beyond the genetic acquisition of novel DNA sequences, NT can also promote the nongenetic inheritance of traits during this conserved mechanism of horizontal gene transfer. Microbes can acquire new genetic material from neighboring organisms via a process termed horizontal gene transfer (HGT). One mechanism for HGT is natural transformation (NT), which is a process whereby some microbial species can take up free DNA from the environment and subsequently integrate it into their genome by homologous recombination. NT is broadly conserved in diverse bacterial species (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994Lorenz M.G. Wackernagel W. Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment.Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 563-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including in many bacterial pathogens where it can promote the acquisition and spread of antibiotic-resistance determinants and virulence factors (Blokesch, 2016Blokesch M.

(Lond.). 1928; 27: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), many aspects of DNA integration during this process remain unclear. During NT, cells generally interact with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the environment, but only a single strand of this DNA is translocated into the cytoplasm (Gabor and Hotchkiss, 1966Gabor M.

Upon uptake into the cytoplasm, this single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is rapidly bound by proteins including DprA and the recombination protein RecA (Kidane and Graumann, 2005Kidane D. Graumann P.L.

Prior work provides molecular evidence to suggest that this ssDNA can be directly integrated into the genome (Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971Dubnau D. Davidoff-Abelson R.

Thus, the ssDNA-RecA complex likely undergoes a homology search with the genome, and RecA subsequently promotes strand invasion to generate a three-stranded D-loop intermediate.

Following branch migration, it is hypothesized that this three-stranded complex is then processed by an unresolved mechanism to generate a stable heteroduplex between the integrated transforming DNA (tDNA) and the genome. This heteroduplex could then be subjected to repair (e.g., via the mismatch repair system) or resolved by chromosome replication and segregation. Direct evidence for many of the steps in this model of recombination, however, remains lacking. Here, we develop and employ cell biological markers to test this model and extend our mechanistic understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of DNA integration during NT in single cells. Furthermore, this analysis has revealed that, beyond the actual horizontal transfer of DNA, NT promotes an unappreciated mechanism for nongenetic inheritance that has broad implications for the spread of traits by this mode of HGT. There are currently no tools available to determine when cells are actively undergoing homologous recombination during NT, which has limited our understanding of this process. Fluorescent fusions to RecA do not fulfill this need because RecA interacts with ssDNA immediately upon uptake (Kidane and Graumann, 2005Kidane D. Graumann P.L.

Also, recent work highlights the use of fluorescently labeled DNA to track the progress of DNA uptake and integration during NT (Boonstra et al., 2018Boonstra M. Vesel N. Kuipers O.P.

Recent work from our group has demonstrated that ComM is a hexameric helicase that promotes branch migration during NT in Vibrio cholerae (Nero et al., 2018Nero T.M. Dalia T.N. Wang J.C. Kysela D.T. Bochman M.L. Dalia A.B. ComM is a hexameric helicase that promotes branch migration during natural transformation in diverse Gram-negative species.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 6099-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We found that purified ComM only formed hexamers in vitro in the presence of ATP and ssDNA (Nero et al., 2018Nero T.M. Dalia T.N. Wang J.C. Kysela D.T. Bochman M.L. Dalia A.B. ComM is a hexameric helicase that promotes branch migration during natural transformation in diverse Gram-negative species.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 6099-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that ComM may form active multimeric complexes specifically at the site of tDNA integration in vivo. To test this, we assessed the localization of a functional fluorescent fusion of ComM (Nero et al., 2018Nero T.M. Dalia T.N. Wang J.C. Kysela D.T. Bochman M.L. Dalia A.B. ComM is a hexameric helicase that promotes branch migration during natural transformation in diverse Gram-negative species.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 6099-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in a constitutively competent strain of V. cholerae that exhibits high rates of NT (transformation frequencies of up to ∼50%) (Ellison et al., 2018Ellison C.K. Dalia T.N. Vidal Ceballos A. Wang J.C. Biais N. Brun Y.V. Dalia A.B. Retraction of DNA-bound type IV competence pili initiates DNA uptake during natural transformation in Vibrio cholerae.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which is necessary for this type of cell biological analysis. In the absence of any tDNA, GFP-ComM remained diffusely localized in the cytoplasm. In the presence of tDNA, however, GFP-ComM formed transient foci (Figures 1A–1C). We hypothesized that these foci represented the site of homologous recombination—specifically, sites of branch migration downstream of RecA-mediated strand invasion. Consistent with this, we did not observe any GFP-ComM foci in ΔrecA or ΔdprA mutant backgrounds when cells were incubated with tDNA. Next, we wanted to further test whether ComM foci represented the site of homologous recombination during NT. To that end, we used two orthologous ParB/parS systems (Nielsen et al., 2006Nielsen H.J. Ottesen J.R. Youngren B. Austin S.J. Hansen F.G. The Escherichia coli chromosome is organized with the left and right chromosome arms in separate cell halves.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to mark distinct locations of the V. cholerae genome. Cells in this assay constitutively expressed two distinct fluorescent ParB fusion proteins (yGFP-ParB1 and CFP-ParB2), which can specifically bind to their corresponding parS sites (parS1 and parS2, respectively). Binding of ParB to parS forms a fluorescent focus that demarcates the location of the chromosomal parS locus within the cell. A parS1 site was integrated proximal to the terminus, while a parS2 site was integrated proximal to the origin. V. cholerae adopts a longitudinal ori-ter configuration during cell division (David et al., 2014David A. Demarre G. Muresan L. Paly E. Barre F.X. Possoz C.

A dynamic, mitotic-like mechanism for bacterial chromosome segregation.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3269-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); thus, this labeling scheme provides maximal spatial separation between the two parS foci. Next, we incubated cells with tDNA that would integrate in close proximity to (∼10 kb away from) the parS2 site (Figure 1D). If ComM foci formed at the site of homologous recombination, we would expect fluorescent ComM foci to colocalize with the parS2 focus. Indeed, ∼91% of the time, ComM foci colocalized with the parS2 site (Figures 1E and 1F). The few events where ComM foci formed distal to the parS2 site (Figure S1A) may represent attempts at illegitimate recombination, formation of ComM foci on tDNA independent of recombination, and/or a local loss of DNA compaction that results in spatial separation of the ComM and parS2 foci. In some instances, ComM foci exhibited colocalized movement with the parS2 site (Figure S1B), which further supported the hypothesis that ComM foci formed at the site of DNA integration. Also, we performed the reciprocal experiment by incubating cells with tDNA that would integrate in close proximity (∼10 kb away from) to the parS1 site. As expected, ComM foci colocalized with the parS1 site ∼90% of the time (Figures S1C–S1E). Cumulatively, these results indicate that fluorescent ComM foci demarcate the site of homologous recombination during NT. Furthermore, these data establish that cell biological tracking of ComM and orthologous ParB/parS systems provides a robust spatiotemporal readout for homologous recombination in single cells. It is currently unclear how efficacious the process of homologous recombination is during NT (i.e., how often does homologous recombination succeed after the process is initiated?). In fact, this is relatively poorly understood in most models of recombination. Above, we demonstrated that the formation of each ComM focus likely results from an independent attempt at branch migration after RecA-mediated strand invasion. These ComM foci do not, however, indicate whether these attempts were ultimately successful at integrating DNA or not. We hypothesized that if we could quantify the cells where integration succeeded, we would have a powerful metric to assess the efficacy of integration during NT. To assess successful tDNA integration, we used a strain that constitutively expressed CyPET-ParB1 and initially lacked a cognate parS1 site, which resulted in diffuse CyPET-ParB1 localization. We then transformed these cells with tDNA that would integrate a parS1 site into the genome. Following homologous recombination of tDNA with the genome and formation of a double-stranded parS1 site (Pillet et al., 2011Pillet F. Sanchez A. Lane D. Anton Leberre V. Bouet J.Y. Centromere binding specificity in assembly of the F plasmid partition complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 7477-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a CyPET-ParB1 focus can form to demarcate successful tDNA integration. These cells also expressed a GFP-ComM fusion. Thus, in this experiment, we could assess attempts at tDNA integration by tracking the formation of GFP-ComM foci and identify cells where tDNA integration succeeded by tracking the formation of CyPET-ParB1 foci. First, we incubated cells with tDNA that would insert a 148 bp parS1 site into the genome (i.e., Δ0kb::parS1). We found that ∼80% of cells generated at least one ComM focus during the duration of the experiment (Figures 2A–2C); however, only a subset of these cells produced a ParB1 focus (Figure 2A), indicating that many attempts (as assessed by ComM foci) ultimately failed to successfully integrate tDNA. Based on this, we could calculate a success rate for tDNA integration. The success rate on a per-cell basis, defined as the percentage of cells that attempted to integrate tDNA (i.e., formed at least one ComM focus) and ultimately succeeded (i.e., formed a ParB1 focus), was ∼45% (Figure 2D). However, many cells produced more than one ComM focus throughout the duration of the experiment (Figures 2A–2C). If we assume that only a single ComM focus is required for successful tDNA integration, we can also calculate the success rate on a per-attempt (i.e., per focus) basis. This is defined as the percentage of cells that formed a ParB1 focus relative to the total number of ComM foci observed. The success rate per attempt observed was ∼25% (Figure 2D). Interestingly, there was no difference in the duration of GFP-ComM foci when we compared cells that ultimately succeeded versus failed to integrate tDNA (Figure 2E). This suggests that the duration of the ComM-dependent branch migration complex does not predict successful integration. We did, however, observe a slight increase in the number of ComM foci produced in cells that ultimately succeeded to integrate tDNA (Figure 2F). The transformation frequency for introducing large insertions and deletions by NT is lower than when integrating smaller mutational cargo (Dalia et al., 2014Dalia A.B. McDonough E. Camilli A. Multiplex genome editing by natural transformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8937-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). If ComM foci truly represent attempts at DNA integration, we hypothesized that, when using tDNA that would introduce a large deletion, the number of ComM foci formed (i.e., the number of attempts) would remain unchanged while the success rate would be reduced. To test this, we performed an assay using cells where the targeted integration site already contained an ∼1.5 kb chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) cassette. Thus, integration of the parS1 site would require cells to delete the 1.5 kb CmR cassette and replace it with the parS1 site (i.e., Δ1.5kb::parS1), while the cells used in the prior experiment had to insert a parS1 site into the genome without any corresponding deletion (i.e., Δ0kb::parS1). For Δ1.5kb::parS1, we found that cells generated just as many ComM foci as for Δ0kb::parS1, indicating that cells were attempting to integrate tDNA at the same rate (Figures 2B–2D). Importantly, the arms of homology in the tDNA were identical in both experiments. Thus, this result is consistent with RecA-mediated strand invasion in one arm of homology occurring at equal efficiencies regardless of the nature of the mutation being introduced. The duration of ComM foci and the number of foci generated per cell were not markedly different between Δ1.5kb::parS1 and Δ0kb::parS1 (Figures S2, 2E, and 2F). The success rate, however, was approximately half for Δ1.5kb::parS1 compared to Δ0kb::parS1 (Figure 2D). Thus, deletion of ∼1.5 kb results in an ∼2-fold reduction in the success rate for integration. Because the number of attempts at DNA integration was equivalent between Δ1.5kb::parS1 and Δ0kb::parS1, the success rate calculated here is indicative of the processes that must occur downstream of RecA-mediated strand invasion, which include ComM-dependent branch migration. We also used this experimental setup to test the efficacy for integration of point mutations during NT. Specifically, we generated strains that harbored an inactivated parS1 site (via two transition point mutations) that cannot bind to ParB (i.e., parS1∗). We then incubated these cells with tDNA that would repair these two point mutations to restore the parS1 site. We found that, while these cells exhibited a similar number of ComM foci compared to Δ0kb::parS1 and Δ1.5kb::parS1 (Figures 2B, 2C, 2G, and 2H), the success rate for tDNA integration was markedly reduced for parS1∗ (Figure 2D). We hypothesized that this reduction in the success rate may be attributed to the mismatch repair system as is the case in other naturally transformable species (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994Lorenz M.G. Wackernagel W. Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment.Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 563-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, we assessed the success rates for repair of point mutations in a ΔmutS mismatch repair mutant background (i.e., parS1∗ ΔmutS). The number of ComM foci for parS1∗ ΔmutS was similar to parS1∗, while the success rates were markedly higher for parS1∗ ΔmutS (Figures 2B–2E and S2). These results are consistent with mismatch repair limiting the integration of point mutations into the genome during NT. Loss of mismatch repair did not affect integration of a de novo parS1 site into the genome (i.e., compare Δ0kb::parS1 ΔmutS to Δ0kb::parS1) (Figures 2B–2E and S2), which is consistent with large insertions and deletions being poorly recognized by the mismatch repair system (Modrich, 1991Modrich P. Mechanisms and biological effects of mismatch repair.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In the experiments described above, formation of the ParB1 focus (i.e., the indicator for successful tDNA integration) was temporally delayed from the formation of ComM foci. Integration of ssDNA, as hypothesized for NT, might account for this delay because a single-stranded parS site is not sufficient to bind to parB (Pillet et al., 2011Pillet F. Sanchez A. Lane D. Anton Leberre V. Bouet J.Y. Centromere binding specificity in assembly of the F plasmid partition complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 7477-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, we would expect that a ParB1 focus would only form after the parS1 site is converted into dsDNA (e.g., via chromosome replication). Consistent with this hypothesis, we consistently observed that only one of the two daughter cells inherited a ParB1 focus, and in the subsequent round of division, both daughter cells inherited a ParB1 focus (Figure 2A). We therefore hypothesized that tDNA integrates as ssDNA and that the resulting heteroduplex is resolved by chromosome replication, which we test further below. Decades of research has provided molecular evidence that tDNA likely integrates into the genome as ssDNA during NT (Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971Dubnau D. Davidoff-Abelson R.

Use of a cloned DNA fragment to analyze the fate of donor DNA in transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To provide more direct and quantitative evidence for this, we started with cells that constitutively expressed yGFP-ParB1/CFP-ParB2 and contained a single parS2 site. We then transformed these cells with tDNA that would replace the parS2 site with a parS1 site. If ssDNA integrates during NT, then in the absence of repair (which generally cannot act on these types of insertions and/or deletions), we would expect chromosome replication to generate two genomes, where one has a parS1 site and the other has a parS2 site. This would be observed experimentally as predivisional cells that contain both green ParB1 and cyan ParB2 foci (Figure 3A). Alternatively, if tDNA is integrated as dsDNA into the genome, we should only observe cells that exclusively have ParB1 or ParB2 foci (Figure S3A). When we performed this experiment, we found that ∼93% of cells exhibited a phenotype consistent with the integration of ssDNA (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B; Video S1). For cells that exhibited ssDNA integration, we found that cells faithfully replicated their chromosomes in the next round of division (i.e., the daughter cell that inherited the parS1 site in the first round of division then replicated to form two parS1 foci in the subsequent round of chromosome replication) (Figure 3B). The observation of dsDNA integration in ∼7% of cells may be the result of uptake and integration of multiple tDNA molecules that replace both the leading and lagging strands of the endogenous genome. This is not unprecedented because it is well established that naturally transformable species can take up and integrate multiple independent tDNA molecules in a process termed congression or cotransformation (Dalia et al., 2014Dalia A.B.

Cells in this experiment constitutively expressed yGFP-parB1/CFP-parB2 and contained a parS2 site in the genome. Cells were then transformed with tDNA that would replace the parS2 site with a parS1 site. For a schema of the experimental setup see Figure 3A. This experiment was repeated independently two times with similar results. The capture interval is 3 min between frames. Scale bar is 2 μm. Previously, we used insertion of a parS1 site to identify cells that successfully integrated DNA (Figure 2A). Because cells integrate ssDNA, however, they only generated a ParB1 focus after chromosome replication, which delayed the readout for successful integration from the time that integration actually occurred. To test whether we could generate a more sensitive temporal indicator of tDNA integration, we used a modified experimental approach by assessing the disruption of an established parS site (Figure S4A). We started with cells that constitutively expressed yGFP-ParB1/CFP-ParB2 and harbored parS1 and parS2 sites in close proximity (∼10 kb apart) on the chromosome, with the parS1 site disrupting a gfp gene. These strains also contained an mCherry-ComM fusion expressed at the native locus. We then transformed these cells with tDNA that would delete the parS1 site and restore the gfp gene. Thus, we can assess the spatiotemporal relationship between ComM activity (i.e., mCherry-ComM foci) and tDNA integration (i.e., loss of the ParB1 focus). The presence of a constant ParB2 focus served as a control for local rearrangements of the genome (which should disrupt both ParB1 and ParB2 foci), while specific tDNA integration should only result in loss of the ParB1 focus. As a secondary indicator of successful tDNA integration (beyond the loss of the ParB1 focus), transformed cells should express high levels of GFP above the baseline fluorescence of the yGFP-ParB1 construct once the gfp gene is restored.

In the accompanying paper, we report structures of core and complete vRNAP complexes of the prototypic Vaccinia poxvirus (Grimm et al., 2019; in this issue of Cell). Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Vaccinia vRNAP in the form of a transcribing elongation complex and in the form of a co-transcriptional capping complex that contains the viral capping enzyme (CE). The trifunctional CE forms two mobile modules that bind the polymerase surface around the RNA exit tunnel. RNA extends from the vRNAP active site through this tunnel and into the active site of the CE triphosphatase. Structural comparisons suggest that growing RNA triggers large-scale rearrangements on the surface of the transcription machinery during the transition from transcription initiation to RNA capping and elongation. Our structures unravel the basis for synthesis and co-transcriptional modification of poxvirus RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2994848104,"Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF1 gene, which is mutated in Rasopathy disease neurofibromatosis type I. Defects in NF1 lead to aberrant signaling through the RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway due to disruption of the neurofibromin GTPase-activating function on RAS family small GTPases. Very little is known about the function of most of the neurofibromin protein; to date, biochemical and structural data exist only for its GAP domain and a region containing a Sec-PH motif. To better understand the role of this large protein, here we carried out a series of biochemical and biophysical experiments, including size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation, indicating that full-length neurofibromin forms a high-affinity dimer. We observed that neurofibromin dimerization also occurs in human cells and likely has biological and clinical implications. Analysis of purified full-length and truncated neurofibromin variants by negative-stain EM revealed the overall architecture of the dimer and predicted the potential interactions that contribute to the dimer interface. We could reconstitute structures resembling high-affinity full-length dimers by mixing N- and C-terminal protein domains in vitro . The reconstituted neurofibromin was capable of GTPase activation in vitro , and co-expression of the two domains in human cells effectively recapitulated the activity of full-length neurofibromin. Taken together, these results suggest how neurofibromin dimers might form and be stabilized within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2995147324,"Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is expressed at the surface of human hepatocytes and functions as an entry receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Recently, we have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in NTCP-mediated viral internalization during the cell entry process. Here, we analyzed which function of EGFR is essential for mediating HBV internalization. In contrast to the reported crucial function of EGFR-downstream signaling for the entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV), blockade of EGFR-downstream signaling proteins, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), had no or only minor effects on HBV infection. Instead, deficiency of EGFR endocytosis resulting from either a deleterious mutation in EGFR or genetic knockdown of endocytosis adaptor molecules abrogated internalization of HBV via NTCP and prevented viral infection. EGFR activation triggered a time-dependent relocalization of HBV preS1 to the early and late endosomes and to lysosomes in concert with EGFR transport. Suppression of EGFR ubiquitination by site-directed mutagenesis or by knocking down two EGFR-sorting molecules, signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) and lysosomal protein transmembrane 4β (LAPTM4B), suggested that EGFR transport to the late endosome is critical for efficient HBV infection. Cumulatively, these results support the idea that the EGFR endocytosis/sorting machinery drives the translocation of NTCP-bound HBV from the cell surface to the endosomal network, which eventually enables productive viral infection."

We have investigated the metabolic and immune status of human macrophages after infection with the intracellular trypanosomatid parasites Leishmania donovani, L. amazonensis and T. cruzi and their capacity to respond to a classical polarizing stimulus (LPS and IFN-γ). We found that macrophages infected with Leishmania preferentially upregulate oxidative phosphorylation, which could be contributed by both host cell and parasite, while T. cruzi infection did not significantly increase glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. Leishmania and T. cruzi infect macrophages without triggering a strong inflammatory cytokine response, but infection does not prevent a potent response to LPS and IFN-γ. Infection appears to prime macrophages, since the cytokine response to activation with LPS and IFN-γ is more intense in infected macrophages compared to uninfected ones. Metabolic polarization in macrophages can influence infection and immune evasion of these parasites since preventing macrophage cytokine responses would help parasites to establish a persistent infection. However, macrophages remain responsive to classical inflammatory stimuli and could still trigger inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2995686890,"Although 90% of BRD relapses are reported to receive retreatment with a different class of antimicrobial, studies examining the impact of antimicrobial selection (i.e. bactericidal or bacteriostatic) on retreatment outcomes and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are deficient in the published literature. This survey was conducted to determine the association between antimicrobial class selection for treatment and retreatment of BRD relapses on antimicrobial susceptibility of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Pathogens were isolated from samples submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from January 2013 to December 2015. A total of 781 isolates with corresponding animal case histories, including treatment protocols, were included in the analysis. Original susceptibility testing of these isolates for ceftiofur, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin was performed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Data were analyzed using a Bayesian approach to evaluate whether retreatment with antimicrobials of different mechanistic classes (bactericidal or bacteriostatic) increased the probability of resistant BRD pathogen isolation in calves. The posterior distribution we calculated suggests that an increased number of treatments is associated with a greater probability of isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Furthermore, the frequency of resistant BRD bacterial isolates was greater with retreatment using antimicrobials of different mechanistic classes than retreatment with the same class. Specifically, treatment protocols using a bacteriostatic drug first followed by retreatment with a bactericidal drug were associated with a higher frequency of resistant BRD pathogen isolation. In particular, first treatment with tulathromycin (bacteriostatic) followed by ceftiofur (bactericidal) was associated with the highest probability of resistant M. haemolytica among all antimicrobial combinations. These observations suggest that consideration should be given to antimicrobial pharmacodynamics when selecting drugs for retreatment of BRD. However, prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical relevance to antimicrobial stewardship programs in livestock production systems."
https://openalex.org/W2998248655,"Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), also referred to as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, is a recently described disorder triggered by wheat/gluten ingestion. NCWS elicits a wide range of symptoms including diarrhoea, intestinal discomfort, and fatigue in analogy with other wheat/gluten-related disorders and celiac disease in particular. From the pathological standpoint, NCWS patients only have a slight increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes, while antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and villous atrophy, otherwise diagnostic features of celiac disease, are absent. To date, the diagnosis of NCWS relies on symptoms and exclusion of confounding diseases, since biomarkers are not yet available. Here, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were examined in duodenal biopsies and peripheral blood leukocytes collected from newly diagnosed patients with NCWS and, as controls, from patients with celiac disease and gluten-independent gastrointestinal problems. We identified a few miRNAs whose expression is higher in the intestinal mucosa of patients affected by NCWS in comparison to control patients affect by gluten-independent dyspeptic symptoms (Helicobacter pylori-negative) and celiac disease. The present study provided the first evidence that NCWS patients have a characteristic miRNA expression patterns, such peculiarity could be exploited as a biomarker to the diagnosis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2995581437,"The motile-sessile transition is critical for bacterial survival and growth. Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) plays a central role in controlling this transition and regulating biofilm formation via various effectors. As an effector of c-di-GMP in Escherichia coli and related species, the PilZ domain–containing protein YcgR responds to elevated c-di-GMP concentrations and acts on the flagellar motor to suppress bacterial motility in a brakelike fashion, which promotes bacterial surface attachment. To date, several target proteins within the motor, MotA, FliG, and FliM, along with different regulatory mechanisms have been reported. However, how YcgR acts on these components remains unclear. Here, we report that activated YcgR stably binds to MotA at the MotA-FliG interface and thereby regulates bacterial swimming. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that c-di-GMP rearranges the PilZ domain configuration, resulting in the formation of a MotA-binding patch consisting of an R XXX R motif and the C-tail helix α3. Moreover, we noted that a conserved region in the YcgR-N domain, which is independent of MotA interaction, is necessary for motility regulation. On the basis of these findings, we infer that the YcgR-N domain is required for activity on other motor proteins. We propose that activated YcgR appends to MotA via its PilZ domain and thereby interrupts the MotA-FliG interaction and simultaneously interacts with other motor proteins via its YcgR-N domain to inhibit flagellar motility. Our findings suggest that the mode of interaction between YcgR and motor proteins may be shared by other PilZ family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2995687123,"Myosin regulatory light chain (LC20) phosphorylation plays an important role in vascular smooth muscle contraction and cell migration. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates LC20 (its only known substrate) exclusively at S19. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) have been implicated in the regulation of LC20 phosphorylation via direct phosphorylation of LC20 at T18 and S19 and indirectly via phosphorylation of MYPT1 (the myosin targeting subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase, MLCP) and Par-4 (prostate-apoptosis response-4). Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T696 and T853 inhibits MLCP activity whereas phosphorylation of Par-4 at T163 disrupts its interaction with MYPT1, exposing the sites of phosphorylation in MYPT1 and leading to MLCP inhibition. To evaluate the roles of MLCK, ROCK and ZIPK in these phosphorylation events, we investigated the time courses of phosphorylation of LC20, MYPT1 and Par-4 in serum-stimulated human vascular smooth muscle cells (from coronary and umbilical arteries), and examined the effects of siRNA-mediated MLCK, ROCK and ZIPK knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on these phosphorylation events. Serum stimulation induced rapid phosphorylation of LC20 at T18 and S19, MYPT1 at T696 and T853, and Par-4 at T163, peaking within 30–120 s. MLCK knockdown or inhibition, or Ca2+ chelation with EGTA, had no effect on serum-induced LC20 phosphorylation. ROCK knockdown decreased the levels of phosphorylation of LC20 at T18 and S19, of MYPT1 at T696 and T853, and of Par-4 at T163, whereas ZIPK knockdown decreased LC20 diphosphorylation, but increased phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T696 and T853 and of Par-4 at T163. ROCK inhibition with GSK429286A reduced serum-induced phosphorylation of LC20 at T18 and S19, MYPT1 at T853 and Par-4 at T163, while ZIPK inhibition by HS38 reduced only LC20 diphosphorylation. We also demonstrated that serum stimulation induced phosphorylation (activation) of ZIPK, which was inhibited by ROCK and ZIPK down-regulation and inhibition. Finally, basal phosphorylation of LC20 in the absence of serum stimulation was unaffected by MLCK, ROCK or ZIPK knockdown or inhibition. We conclude that: (i) serum stimulation of cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells results in rapid phosphorylation of LC20, MYPT1, Par-4 and ZIPK, in contrast to the slower phosphorylation of kinases and other proteins involved in other signaling pathways (Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and HSP27), (ii) ROCK and ZIPK, but not MLCK, are involved in serum-induced phosphorylation of LC20, (iii) ROCK, but not ZIPK, directly phosphorylates MYPT1 at T853 and Par-4 at T163 in response to serum stimulation, (iv) ZIPK phosphorylation is enhanced by serum stimulation and involves phosphorylation by ROCK and autophosphorylation, and (v) basal phosphorylation of LC20 under serum-free conditions is not attributable to MLCK, ROCK or ZIPK."
https://openalex.org/W2998169119,"In this study we propose the use of text mining and machine learning methods to predict and detect Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) using textual descriptions of surgeries and post-operative patients' records, mined from the database of a high complexity University hospital. SSIs are among the most common adverse events experienced by hospitalized patients; preventing such events is fundamental to ensure patients' safety. Knowledge on SSI occurrence rates may also be useful in preventing future episodes. We analyzed 15,479 surgery descriptions and post-operative records testing different preprocessing strategies and the following machine learning algorithms: Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Nearest Centroid, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classification (SVC). For prediction purposes, the best result was obtained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method (79.7% ROC-AUC); for detection, Logistic Regression yielded the best performance (80.6% ROC-AUC)."
https://openalex.org/W2995128100,"Direct effects of human disturbance on animal populations are well documented across habitats, biomes, and species, but indirect effects of diel have received less attention. An emerging field in applied ecology involves behavioral avoidance of or attraction to humans and their trappings. We posit trophic consequences, in terms of relative risk, for four species of mammals, each of which strongly avoids human activity, in urban reserves of coastal southern California. Two species, one predator and one prey, avoid human activity via a temporal shift to become “more nocturnal”—the species’ activity is centered near dawn on days without human activity but nearer to midnight on days with human activity. Diel shifts have brought the species into greater overlap, respectively, with a key prey and a key predator, overlap that may increase encounter rate and thus increase relative risk of predation, with potential consequences for trophic dynamics and cascades: increased risk of predation may depress prey population, either directly (e.g., mortality) or indirectly (e.g., “landscape of fear”). Human use of reserves, especially in high population density regions, needs to be reconsidered either to reduce access or to restrict access entirely to areas that may provide refuge to both predators and prey."
https://openalex.org/W2996621546,"It has become critical to detect Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection due to the link to gastric cancer with some strains. These strains are also increasing in resistance to antibiotics with clarithromycin leading the way as the first line treatment. Resistance to clarithromycin has been shown to correlate with the A2142G, A2142C, and A2143G mutations on the rrl gene. In the last few decades, non-invasive specimens, such as stool, have been a reliable alternate to gastric biopsy for immunoassay tests. More recently, it has been proven feasible for stool to be used in molecular based tests. Many of the core laboratories in the United States need a high throughput sample preparation to run this test. Here, a high throughput assay is compared to a previously published manual sample prep H. pylori molecular based assay. Using the Magna Pure 96 (Roche), at least 96 stool species and 96 biopsy specimens can be tested in an 8-hour shift of a clinical lab. The high throughput sample prep had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 87% compared to the manual sample prep using the same testing configuration. The genotype predictions from the high throughput assay matched genotype predictions from the manual sample prep with the same stool sample 92% of the time. A concordance rate of 89% was observed with genotype predictions from the high throughput assay of the same patient stool and biopsy. In stool samples from the high throughput assay, there was 100% concordance between the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-derived genomic prediction and DNA sequencing data. The high throughput workflow can get more patients tested faster in addition to detection of mutations associated with clarithromycin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2994669164,"Main objective The inconsistent results on the effects of vitamin D on muscle strength reported by intervention trials may partly be explained by inclusion of vitamin D sufficient individuals. The main objective was to study whether vitamin D supplementation will improve muscle strength in men and women with low serum vitamin D status, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) at baseline. Methods 417 men and women aged 40–80 years were included and randomized to receive a loading dose of 100 000 IU (2500 ug) vitamin D3 followed by 20 000 IU (500 ug)/week, or placebo. Muscle strength was tested by dynamometers at baseline and after four months. Results Serum 25(OH)D levels increased from 32.6±11.1 nmol/l to 88.8±19.4 nmol/l (p<0.01) in the vitamin D group, while remaining low in the placebo group (baseline and final levels at 35.1±13.6 nmol/l and 30.7 ±9.7 nmol/l respectively). Muscle strength (hip flexion, biceps flexion, pectorals and handgrip strength) did not change in any of the groups. The results were the same in analyses stratified on sex, 25(OH)D above/below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml); smoking status; and BMI above/below 27 kg/m2. Conclusion These data does not support vitamin D supplementation for improving muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W2997334703,"Recent studies have shown that sediments of temperate and tropical lakes are sinks for organic carbon (OC), but little is known about OC burial in subtropical lakes. There are questions regarding the ability of subtropical lakes to store OC, given their relatively warmwater temperatures, lack of ice cover, frequent water-column mixing, and labile carbon forms. We used 210Pb-dated sediment cores from 11 shallow Florida (USA) lakes to estimate OC burial, i.e. net OC storage, over the last ~100 years. Shallow Florida water bodies average ~30% OC content in their sediments and displayed rates of net OC accumulation (63–177 g C m-2 a-1) that are similar to natural temperate lakes, but lower than temperate agricultural impoundments. We considered the influence of lake morphometry on OC storage in our study lakes, but did not observe an inverse relationship between lake size and OC burial rate, as has been seen in some temperate lake districts. We did, however, find an inverse relation between mean water depth and OC sequestration. Despite recent cultural eutrophication and the associated shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance in the Florida study lakes, overall OC burial rate increased relative to historic (pre-1950 AD) values. Lakes cover >9000 km2 of the Florida landscape, suggesting that OC burial in sediments amounts to as much as 1.6 Mt a-1. The high rate of OC burial in Florida lake sediments indicates that subtropical lakes are important for carbon sequestration and should be included in models of global carbon cycling."
https://openalex.org/W3013195547,"A common problem when analyzing models, such as mathematical modeling of a biological process, is to determine if the unknown parameters of the model can be determined from given input-output data. Identifiable models are models such that the unknown parameters can be determined to have a finite number of values given input-output data. The total number of such values over the complex numbers is called the identifiability degree of the model. Unidentifiable models are models such that the unknown parameters can have an infinite number of values given input-output data. For unidentifiable models, a set of identifiable functions of the parameters are sought so that the model can be reparametrized in terms of these functions yielding an identifiable model. In this work, we use numerical algebraic geometry to determine if a model given by polynomial or rational ordinary differential equations is identifiable or unidentifiable. For identifiable models, we present a novel approach to compute the identifiability degree. For unidentifiable models, we present a novel numerical differential algebra technique aimed at computing a set of algebraically independent identifiable functions. Several examples are used to demonstrate the new techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2995017058,"Chloroplast development and photosynthesis require the proper assembly and turnover of photosynthetic protein complexes. Chloroplasts harbor a repertoire of proteases to facilitate proteostasis and development. We have previously used an Arabidopsis leaf variegation mutant, yellow variegated2 ( var2 ), defective in thylakoid FtsH protease complexes, as a tool to dissect the genetic regulation of chloroplast development. Here, we report a new genetic enhancer mutant of var2 , enhancer of variegation3–1 ( evr3–1 ). We confirm that EVR3 encodes a chloroplast metalloprotease, reported previously as ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient and yellow-green1 (EGY1)/ammonium overly sensitive1 (AMOS1). We observed that mutations in EVR3 / EGY1 / AMOS1 cause more severe leaf variegation in var2–5 and synthetic lethality in var2–4 . Using a modified blue-native PAGE system, we reveal abnormal accumulations of photosystem I, photosystem II, and light-harvesting antenna complexes in EVR3 / EGY1 / AMOS1 mutants. Moreover, we discover distinct roles of VAR2 and EVR3/EGY1/AMOS1 in the turnover of photosystem II reaction center under high light stress. In summary, our findings indicate that two chloroplast metalloproteases, VAR2/AtFtsH2 and EVR3/EGY1/AMOS1, function coordinately to regulate chloroplast development and reveal new roles of EVR3/EGY1/AMOS1 in regulating chloroplast proteostasis in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2995960782,"Diphylla ecaudata is a hematophagous bat endemic of South America, with food preference for bird blood. Given the lack of information about the reproductive activity of this species, this study aimed to describe the testicular morphology and histomorphometry of D. ecaudata in order to understand its reproductive biology, specially spermatogenesis. The animals were collected in Lajes city, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Following euthanasia, the testes were histologically processed for morphological, morphometric, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses. Their average body weight was 24.64g, with a gonadosomatic index of 0.49%, tubulesomatic index of 0.47%, and a total of 32.20m of seminiferous tubules per gram of testis. The pre-meiotic, meiotic, and post-meiotic phases accounted for 56.20%, 9.30%, and 34.50% of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, respectively. The ultrastructure of spermiogenesis was similar to that described in other mammals and the perforatorium was not observed in the sperm. Androgen receptors were detected in Sertoli cell nuclei and Leydig cell cytoplasm, while aromatase enzyme was detected only in Sertoli cell nuclei. FGF2 and BCL-2 activities were detected in the cytoplasm of zygotene and pachytene primary spermatocytes, as well as round and elongated spermatids. D. ecaudata showed testicular pattern similar to other mammals and characteristics common to other bat species. This species stood out for its high efficiency of Sertoli cells, which presented high capacity to support germ cells, besides the highest sperm production rates among those already recorded. This study is the first step towards the knowledge of D. ecaudata reproduction and the first description of its spermatogenesis."

Structural MRI and [18F]THK-5351 PET were performed within a 2-month interval. Cortical volume and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were calculated from MRI and PET images, respectively, for 35 FreeSurfer-derived cortical regions. Pearson's correlation coefficients between SUVR and cortical volume were calculated for the same regions, and correlated regions were compared according to disease severity and β-amyloid PET positivity.No significantly correlated regions were found in the normal controls. Negative correlations between SUVR and cortical volume were found in the MCI and AD groups, mainly in limbic locations in MCI and isocortical locations in AD. The AD group exhibited stronger correlations (r = -0.576-0.781) than the MCI group (r = 0.368-0.571). Hippocampal atrophy did not show any correlation with SUVR in the β-amyloid PET-negative group, but negatively correlated with SUVR (r = -0.494, P = .012) in the β-amyloid PET-positive group.Regional THK-5351 uptake correlated more strongly with cortical atrophy in AD compared with MCI, thereby demonstrating a close relationship between the neuro-pathologic process and cortical atrophy. Hippocampal atrophy was associated with both β-amyloid and THK-5351 uptake, possibly reflecting an interaction between β-amyloid and tau deposition in the neurodegeneration process."

https://openalex.org/W2996700538,"Despite being a staple of our science, the process of pre-publication peer review has few agreed-upon standards defining its goals or ideal execution. As a community of reviewers and authors, we assembled an evaluation format and associated specific standards for the process as we think it should be practiced. We propose that we apply, debate, and ultimately extend these to improve the transparency of our criticism and the speed with which quality data and ideas become public. Despite being a staple of our science, the process of pre-publication peer review has few agreed-upon standards defining its goals or ideal execution. As a community of reviewers and authors, we assembled an evaluation format and associated specific standards for the process as we think it should be practiced. We propose that we apply, debate, and ultimately extend these to improve the transparency of our criticism and the speed with which quality data and ideas become public. The peer-review process can be an inefficient part of the scientific endeavor. A recent study estimates that 15 million hours of effort are squandered each year in the process of peer review (Rubriq, 2013Rubriq Peer Review: How We Found 15 Million Hours of Lost Time.2013https://www.aje.com/arc/peer-review-process-15-million-hours-lost-time/Google Scholar). This is most likely a dramatic underestimate. A large portion of this delay may be attributed to peer reviewers’ insistence on proposing “reviewer experiments,” which take time and effort to complete and often fail to fundamentally alter a manuscript’s conclusions (Ploegh, 2011Ploegh H. End the wasteful tyranny of reviewer experiments.Nature. 2011; 472: 391Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Delays are also magnified by pressures for authors to draw profound conclusions from data, which will often fall short of “proof beyond the shadow of a doubt” (Kaelin, 2017Kaelin Jr., W.G. Publish houses of brick, not mansions of straw.Nature. 2017; 545: 387Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The inability to then unambiguously support a “game-changing” conclusion and extend it to all scenarios leads reviewers to feel the need to require new experiments in an attempt to warrant such grandiose conclusions. The primary roles of the peer-review process should be to vet the quality of the data using field-specific criteria and to request a balanced discussion of its validity and meaning. Peer review is also important insofar as we have “tiers” of journals. Here, it is ultimately used for gatekeeping, and reviews become more subjective, focusing upon the extensibility of data and its possible impact. In the worst cases, peer review takes the form of a diabolical game in a contest of ideas—a fruitless diversion in the long term and one that hinders the airing of data and/or opinions that disagree or appear to disagree with previous ideas. Frequently, we individually feel that comments of a certain nature (e.g., the legendary “reviewer #3”) should not be permitted, but we as a community have not adequately defined general guidelines for what is appropriate or “fair game” in manuscript reviews. The absence of an agreed-upon process thus frustrates us and weakens scientific progress, which depends on the timely release of reasonably defined experimental results for others to explore further. Here, we propose possible solutions to these issues through collective adoption of a community-defined evaluation format and associated standards: (1) a universal template that provides a means by which reviewers and authors can distinguish critiques related to “quality” from those related to “perceived impact” in a way that should provide portability across journals and/or tiers of journals and (2) scientist-driven standards of what a review should not do, providing authors and editors with sensible reasons to dismiss capricious or poorly thought-out criticism. Peer review has many benefits. For example, it provides additional “eyes” that can help identify technical issues that lead to mistaken conclusions, and it ensures that field-specific standards are applied (e.g., the performance and reporting of replicate experiments and application of statistical tests). These types of functions limit the extent to which our field wastes energy or resources by limiting undue focus upon fully unsubstantiated statements and results that for one reason or another cannot be replicated. Reviewers can also suggest alternative interpretations of the data, leading to alterations in discussion. Ideally, this latter function would rarely lead to an outright delay or blockade of publication, although both a journal and an author will best be wary of publishing work where alternative interpretations are far stronger than the authors’ favored conclusions. Peer review also has taken on a role in prioritizing work to be published in the most prestigious journals. Most favorably viewed, this helps the field and others to direct attention toward ideas and data that are likely to have long-term importance or dramatically advance the field. Assessments of the possible importance of a result can thus place a paper in a journal; that then helps readers evaluate and choose which of the thousands of papers published each week deserve their first attention. In this way, peer review does serve as the first step of evaluation in a contest of ideas. This function is certainly the most troublesome and difficult; it is highly subjective and toys with scientific egos, since it forces the reviewer to credit the author with something that not all studies of equivalent effort will produce. It represents the opinion of a small collection of scientists. Journal editors use our opinions in this area to attempt to provide high-quality content that brings readers back to their journal each week. (Somewhat ironically, we send elite journals our most cutting-edge work in spite of their often longer review processes that can delay publication.) It is arguably the delays associated with the application of our most subjective metrics—the performance of reviewer experiments—that most magnifies the delays for the bulk of the community to share in the work we consider most exciting. A collection of 65 mid-career immunologists recently gathered to discuss the future of our discipline. Among these, not a single one had been given unambiguous or consistent descriptions by mentors or through other guidance as to what a peer review should entail. Although journal editors have proposed helpful comments to us, such as to perform reviews in a timely manner (NCB, 2017NCBPrinciples of refereeing.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), they are not necessarily complete in scope nor coming from the right source. As scientists, it is us whose lives and discipline are most impacted by the peer-review process—as readers and as authors—and we provide the service of peer review. It is therefore our actions that most need correction and a higher degree of principled discipline guided by us. Here, we propose a first iteration of a universal principled review (UP) template, which would provide principles of feedback such as field-specific standards for data quality, completeness and reproducibility, and fair discussion of meaning. Like experiments we undertake in the lab, this one can be assessed and modified in future iterations. Its value may well be in the tens of millions of our own hours spent on peer review, as well as in the success and speed with which our findings are converted into real-world benefits. A primary principle of a template for standards seeks the idea of reciprocity in the golden rule—that we define the kinds of rules for publication that we would like others to apply to our work. A universal scoresheet for review will ideally capture all of the principles above and provide a transparent message of a reviewer’s stance on the “publish-ability” of a manuscript and its scientific value. It will also make simpler the assessment of cost-benefit of any additional experiments. We propose six categories as the basis for consideration and outline, along with some of their details, in Box 1.Box 1UP Review CategoriesObjective Criteria (Quality)1Quality: Experiments (1–3 scale)•Figure by figure, do experiments, as performed, have the proper controls?•Are specific analyses performed using methods that are consistent with answering the specific question?•Is there the appropriate technical expertise in the collection and analysis of data presented?•Do analyses use the best-possible (most unambiguous) available methods quantified via appropriate statistical comparisons?•Are controls or experimental foundations consistent with established findings in the field?

What work (scope and expected time) and/or discussion would improve this score, and what would this improvement add to the conclusions of the study? Care should be taken to avoid casually suggesting experiments of great cost (e.g., “repeat a mouse-based experiment in humans”) and difficulty that merely confirm but do not extend (see Bad Behaviors, Box 2). For the first three “Quality” considerations (“Experiments,” “Completeness,” and “Reproducibility”), we propose a three-point scale: “1” or possibly “2” would be considered necessary to publish in any journal, with “3” being unacceptable. Quality considerations represent questions of data integrity and logic whose scores should be similar regardless of the journal where a paper is being considered. These are meant to encompass the fundamental scientific demand of rigor. A fourth “Quality” category (“Scholarship”) contains what are sometimes called minor critiques and should never be a substantial basis for a decision to publish, as they largely should be addressed with strong editing. We all recognize that scholarship, however, clearly affects how a work is perceived and how quickly it is accepted. The last two evaluations (“Novelty” and “Extensibility,” together sometimes called “Impact”) are more subjective. Acceptable scores for publication may be journal specific; we imagine a score of “1” being consistent with a general-interest (highest-tier) journal, “2” being a top-tier journal within a discipline, and “3” being a highly field-specific journal and an additional category of “4” being added, representing very limited potential readership. A journal-agnostic score for these are clearly the reviewer’s opinion and would be expected to vary the most between reviewers. “Experiments,” “Completeness,” “Reproducibility,” and “Scholarship” scores are absolute values based on best practices and are meant to be the least subjective. “Extensibility” and “Novelty” represent the more subjective measures and are judgements in the contest of ideas, and this is overtly acknowledged. A journal editor will of course have the final say in deciding how that score will translate into acceptance or rejection. However, scoring using this rubric would always be universal—whether one’s peers consider the quality acceptable should not vary according to which journal solicited the review. A transparent adoption of these principles suggests a template similar to those from NIH study sections where strengths and weaknesses are called out. Importantly, where weaknesses are found, paragraphs that follow from the score must be specific. Additionally, if we as reviewers propose experiments or changes in text, we should be required to provide our own assessment as to how an experiment will increase the score in this category and how long it will take. Generally, if the score is short of a “1,” reviews must indicate what is necessary to get the score higher and estimate its timing, typically within 1 month, 3 months, or beyond. Anything beyond 1 year should not be proposed or indicated as such. The goal of this is to indicate how this work (not another paper entirely) would be suitable for publication in any journal, if that is possible. In the interest of transparency, we believe that all comments should be to the author directly; no scientific comments should be hidden in confidential comments to editors. A corollary to the need for principles is that malfeasance by reviewers needs to be clearly defined by our community so that it may be minimized or neutralized. To be fair, when queried, all authors of this article acknowledged to having been sometimes lazy or snarky when serving as reviewers. Without published norms, this will happen more often. We suggest the need to reverse a trend whereby some reviewers appear to try to act as the gatekeepers or owners of ideas. Our greatest value is to ensure overall quality. Too many papers are rejected based on a conflict of concepts. We posit that it should be the duty of broad readership, performing experiments over time rather than precedence, that quickly determines winners in the contest of ideas. It is fair to point out where an experiment fails to support a conclusion (“Quality”) or where an idea fails to be a sufficient advance, but the latter in particular needs solid documentation to support the viewpoint. This is an area for the golden rule, and there seem to be clearly identifiable reasons to fire a reviewer and dismiss poor criticism. We outline a few of these on which we all agree in Box 2.Box 2Identifiable Bad Behaviors•Blanket statements that lack justification (e.g., “I don’t believe the data”) indicate that the reviewer is not an active reader or a careful judge. A review should call out concrete experiments, controls, etc. to address their issues.

A review should seek to pull meaning from the labors of others wherever possible.•Claims of non-novelty based on papers that are non-synonymous, reviews, or cartoons (not primary data) are bases for eliminating a review or a score in that category. In particular, if a reviewer suggests that something is known, but no clear experiments that definitely show it have been performed, then their comment is false. Due to the proliferation of review articles and journals dedicated to reviews, many ideas may have been conceived but not experimentally demonstrated. The data need to be shown, and such experiments are very valuable. Further, the claims by a reviewer of non-novelty or “known” may not be shared by the broader community.

The conclusions we hold dear from past papers might be based on data or experimental approaches that would not meet our current standards.

A general guideline should be for a reviewer to simply respond yes or no as to whether an author’s increased discussion, modification of text, or added experiment addresses the questions raised in a primary review. As a collective, we argue that an author, on seeing reviews with those features, should have the right to request that a reviewer be replaced (“We submit that Critique #3 by Reviewer #1 is in violation of our community’s UP guidelines. We respectfully decline to address some/all aspects of this critique in our revised manuscript.”). Alternatively, editors would reconnect with the reviewer to seek an improved critique. When journals share completed reviews among the collection of reviewers, as they should, bad behaviors should be called out (and of course, this also provides the ability of reviewers to concur or “rescue” comments that are actually meritorious). We would hope that editors, on observing a scientist writing this kind of text, should quickly cease to solicit reviews from these individuals. In short, there needs to be benchmarks that everyone agrees upon, given the importance of letting ideas and associated data loose for broad consideration. Given the large number of journals in a field, experimenting with UP does not initially require buy-in from all journals, although we would hope that editors will take the community’s needs into account. Box 1 represents a template that can be used in any journal—we will simply paste the text into the author’s text box. As authors of this document, each of us is agreeing (1) to try UP categories in their reviews over the next year and (2) to support editors who act upon the bad-behavior exclusions of UP. For their part, journals could use our design to set realistic and clear expectations of what they emphasize and demand. For example, a top-tier immunology-specific journal might suggest: “Our journal requires average ‘Quality’ scores of 1.5, but ‘Extensibility’ can be ≤3.” They can also state their willingness to remove reviewers and/or request changes when significant poor behavior is witnessed, as described above. We also note that the nature of scientific publishing itself is in flux with the useful appearance of pre-publication websites that allow first glimpses of data pre-peer review. UP, having an element of portability, could allow a model wherein scientific societies move the reviewing process entirely away from journal-specific administration and can allow journals to “bid,” including for papers that are already being more widely considered on a pre-publication website. Journals could make the effort to transfer the review to the subsequent journal and share the identity of the reviewer on demand and with their assent. Different journals might also list discrete rules as to whether three total positive reviews are required as compared to concurrence of the first three, which is a current norm. If a journal requests the first three for concurrence, we believe they should allow a large number of reviewers to be excluded by the author. Finally, an UP review needn’t only apply to papers at the time of peer review and could also be applied to historical manuscripts, should our community devise a mechanism for posting these in an accessible and meaningful way. All who have ever acted as mentors know well the phenotype of the student who, afraid to fail in his or her first experiment in a series, simply does no experiments and continues to only read journal papers and contemplate the possibilities. We all know full well that no advances are made without jumping in. In proposing that our community adopt and ultimately refine a framework like UP, we are well aware that iterations will be required. First experiments may work in some areas but not in others, and unintended consequences may well result. This platform of principles will not guarantee that the work you consider your best makes it through to the highest-impact journals. However, we submit it as an improvement on the status quo, and we as a community will have opportunities to refine this in subsequent iterations. Obtaining metrics to guide the process, just as in any experiment, is key. A few strong journals could help collect data to serve their readership. The primary guide for this should not be impact factor, an imprecise measure, but simply the time to publication experienced by investigators and the overall ease of the process. We cannot know the result of changes such as these outlined here unless we try, and as a small community, we hope that others will join us in improving our discipline’s dissemination of important results and ideas and embrace this experiment. In the meantime, we believe the following should be our ethos on review:•There is no need to “guard the field” but rather to provide balance and ensure the dissemination of high-quality experiments that provide sufficient detail for reproduction.•We all need to train the next generation to practice peer review in a responsible way during journal clubs. Too many training institutions teach that a critique should emphasize weaknesses; include trainees in your process by asking them to help when appropriate and mentoring them on principles from the beginning of the process to the end.•Review criteria will not be one-size-fits-all. What we propose above seems to us a reasonable framework by which to operate. We welcome future revisions or better alternatives.•Finally, and most simply, write each review as if you will sign your name next to it. We hope this attempt to mildly codify our peer-review process will improve the entire scientific endeavor.

https://openalex.org/W3013345667,"Mutations in the epithelial polarity gene crumbs (crb) lead to retinal degeneration in Drosophila and in humans. The overall morphology of the retina and its deterioration in Drosophila crb mutants has been well-characterized, but the cell biological origin of the degeneration is not well understood. Degenerative conditions in the retina and elsewhere in the nervous system often involve defects in degradative intracellular trafficking pathways. So far, however, effects of crb on the endolysosomal system, or on the spatial organization of these compartments in photoreceptor cells have not been described. We therefore asked whether photoreceptors in crb mutants exhibit alterations in endolysosomal compartments under pre-degenerative conditions, where the retina is still morphologically intact. Data presented here show that, already well before the onset of degeneration, Arl8, Rab7, and Atg8-carrying endolysosomal and autophagosomal compartments undergo changes in morphology and positioning with respect to each other in crb mutant retinas. We propose that these changes may be early signs of the degeneration-prone condition in crb retinas."

Combined ketamine and xylazine injections are often used in rats for less invasive surgery, possibly with spontaneous breathing and without airway management. However, there are important pitfalls to be avoided by special precautions and monitoring, as shown subsequently.Observational study.Twenty-four anaesthetic procedures for bile duct ligation, sham operation or carotid artery dilatation in 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats, preoperatively weighing between 440 and 550 g.Intolerable high mortality rates occurred in the first 7 postoperative days while establishing a new experimental model in rats using ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia. Rats were spontaneously breathing ambient air during the first 12 surgeries without airway management. An observed high mortality rate in these animals led to a change in the trial protocol: the insufflation of 2 litres of oxygen per minute via nose cone during the following 12 rat surgeries. Retrospective comparison of the outcome (without oxygen vs. with oxygen insufflation) was conducted.The perioperative mortality rate could be significantly reduced from 58% (7/12) to 17% (2/12) (p = 0.036) by oxygen insufflation via nose cone. Significantly different levels of intraoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2; 89 ± 4% [without oxygen] vs. 97 ± 0.5% [with oxygen], p < 0.0001), but no significant differences in heart rate (HR; 267 ± 7 beats minute-1 [bpm] [without oxygen] vs. 266 ± 6 bpm [with oxygen], p = 0.955) were observed.In summary, rats under ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia are susceptible to hypoxia. This may lead to increased delayed mortality related to hypoxia induced lung failure. Apparently, this is an underestimated problem. We highly recommend using additional oxygen insufflation in spontaneously breathing rats under ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia with basic monitoring such as measurement of oxygen saturation."
https://openalex.org/W2995532483,"Collective behaviors of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are critical to the development of neural networks needed for vision. Signaling cues and pathways governing retinal cell fate, migration, and functional organization are remarkably conserved across species, and have been well-studied using Drosophila melanogaster. However, the collective migration of heterogeneous groups of RPCs in response to dynamic signaling fields of development remains incompletely understood. This is in large part because the genetic advances of seminal invertebrate models have been poorly complemented by in vitro cell study of its visual development. Tunable microfluidic assays able to replicate the miniature cellular microenvironments of the developing visual system provide newfound opportunities to probe and expand our knowledge of collective chemotactic responses essential to visual development. Our project used a controlled, microfluidic assay to produce dynamic signaling fields of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) that stimulated the chemotactic migration of primary RPCs extracted from Drosophila. Results illustrated collective RPC chemotaxis dependent on average size of clustered cells, in contrast to the non-directional movement of individually-motile RPCs. Quantitative study of these diverse collective responses will advance our understanding of retina developmental processes, and aid study/treatment of inherited eye disease. Lastly, our unique coupling of defined invertebrate models with tunable microfluidic assays provides advantages for future quantitative and mechanistic study of varied RPC migratory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2996156726,"Body ownership relies on spatiotemporal correlations between multisensory signals and visual cues specifying oneself such as body form and orientation. The mechanism for the integration of bodily signals remains unclear. One approach to model multisensory integration that has been influential in the multisensory literature is Bayesian causal inference. This specifies that the brain integrates spatial and temporal signals coming from different modalities when it infers a common cause for inputs. As an example, the rubber hand illusion shows that visual form and orientation cues can promote the inference of a common cause (one's body) leading to spatial integration shown by a proprioceptive drift of the perceived location of the real hand towards the rubber hand. Recent studies investigating the effect of visual cues on temporal integration, however, have led to conflicting findings. These could be due to task differences, variation in ecological validity of stimuli and/or small samples. In this pre-registered study, we investigated the influence of visual information on temporal integration using a visuo-tactile temporal order judgement task with realistic stimuli and a sufficiently large sample determined by Bayesian analysis. Participants viewed videos of a touch being applied to plausible or implausible visual stimuli for one's hand (hand oriented plausibly, hand rotated 180 degrees, or a sponge) while also being touched at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. Participants judged which stimulus came first: viewed or felt touch. Results show that visual cues do not modulate visuo-tactile temporal order judgements. This is not in line with the idea that bodily signals indicating oneself influence the integration of multisensory signals in the temporal domain. The current study emphasises the importance of rigour in our methodologies and analyses to advance the understanding of how properties of multisensory events affect the encoding of temporal information in the brain."

Tau normally functions as a microtubule-associated protein promoting the formation and stability of microtubules, which are critical to neuronal function. In AD, tau is abnormally phosphorylated, provoking its accumulation and aggregation (3Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Tau pathology and neurodegeneration.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12 (23684085): 609-62210.1016/S1474-4422(13)70090-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The pathological spreading of these tau aggregates correlates with cognitive decline in AD in accordance with our understanding of AD progression, suggesting that propagation of tau aggregates contributes to neuronal loss (4Braak H.

There is a definitive need for a systematic understanding of how and where tau aggregates initially form and how they spread in AD. Dissecting these molecular signatures could reveal novel targets for much needed therapeutic intervention. Alzheimer's disease familial frontotemporal dementia endosomal sorting complex required for transport multivesicular body CRISPR interference. To characterize the phenomenon of tau aggregate formation and spreading, cellular models have been used to determine the minimum amount of tau required to propagate aggregation from the outside to the inside of the cell, establishing the idea of the tau seed (5Mirbaha H. Holmes B.B. Sanders D.W. Bieschke J. Diamond M.I. Tau trimers are the minimal propagation unit spontaneously internalized to seed intracellular aggregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25887395): 14893-1490310.1074/jbc.M115.652693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To further study tau seed propagation and aggregation, Chen et al. have modified a previously established a FRET-based procedure that emits fluorescence proportionally to the quantity of tau aggregation in the cytoplasm. They created two tau constructs, each with one half of a FRET pair. When tau aggregation occurs, the FRET pair is brought together, resulting in a fluorescent signal. This cell-based model follows from a previous in vivo experiment where tau seeding was measured in an AD-mouse model, suggesting that the in vitro model may have physiological significance (6Holmes B.B. Furman J.L. Mahan T.E. Yamasaki T.R. Mirbaha H. Eades W.C. Belaygorod L. Cairns N.J. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Proteopathic tau seeding predicts tauopathy in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To learn more about the steps between uptake of tau seeds and subsequent aggregation, Chen et al. use their modified FRET-based tau aggregation assay in a CRISPRi-based screen to identify regulators of tau uptake and propagation. They first confirmed that they could observe a prion-like propagation of tau aggregation within the cell using seed material of recombinant aggregated tau or aggregates purified from AD patient brains (7Chen J.J. Nathaniel D.L. Raghavan P. Nelson M. Tian R. Tse E. Hong J.Y. See S.K. Mok S.-A. Hein M.Y. Southworth D.R. Grinberg L.T. Gestwicki J.E. Leonetti M.D. Kampmann M. Compromised function of the ESCRT pathway promotes endolysosomal escape of tau seeds and propagation of tau aggregation.J. Biol.

As in previous studies, the authors observed tau uptake into the cell, presumably via endocytosis, followed by release into the cytosol, where propagation of tau aggregation occurs. The authors then undertook a comprehensive genetic screen using CRISPRi to disrupt genes that might be involved in this process. They focused on genes encoding the proteostasis machinery, anticipating that these cellular factors are most likely to regulate seeding and aggregation. The screen identified two hits, both involved in endosome function, CHMP6 and VPS13D, which enhanced tau aggregation. This suggests that the corresponding proteins might serve as key points of regulation. CHMP6 is a core component of the ESCRT-III complex, which, along with ESCRT-I/II, coordinates the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These critical organelles regulate protein degradation via routing to the lysosome. The ESCRT-III complex drives a membrane scission event, freeing vesicle cargoes from the endosome into the lumen of the MVB. The identification of CHMP6 as a regulator of tau propagation places this highly conserved and fundamental machinery at the heart of tau pathology. Similarly, VPS13D is involved in membrane integrity and trafficking via its function in nonvesicular transfer of phospholipids (8Anding A.L. Wang C. Chang T.K. Sliter D.A. Powers C.M. Hofmann K. Youle R.J. Baehrecke E.H. Vps13D encodes a ubiquitin-binding protein that is required for the regulation of mitochondrial size and clearance.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 (29307555): 287-295.e610.1016/j.cub.2017.11.064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The authors confirmed that CHMP6 and VPS13D are involved in tau propagation using single guide RNAs, observing that independent CHMP6 and VPS13D knockdown accelerated tau aggregation within the cytoplasm. This acceleration was not due to increased uptake of tau. High-content imaging analysis confirmed that knockdown significantly increased tau aggregation within 48 h post-seeding. Aggregates could be seen in CHMP6 knockdown cells within 12 h post-seeding, but not upon VPS13D knockdown, identifying phenotypic differences in the rate of tau aggregation between the two genes. CHMP6 knockdown clearly propagated tau aggregation faster than VPS13D knockdown. To gain mechanistic insight into this process, Chen et al. next monitored the effect of tau aggregation on the health of the endosomal-lysosomal system. ESCRTIII has recently been implicated in the resealing of damaged endolysosomal membranes (9Skowyra M.L. Schlesinger P.H. Naismith T.V. Hanson P.I. Triggered recruitment of ESCRT machinery promotes endolysosomal repair.Science. 2018; 360 (29622626): eaar507810.1126/science.aar5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The possible implications of these findings suggest that tau seeds endocytosed into the cell may compromise endolysosomal integrity. The authors observed co-localization of tau fibrils and late endosomal and lysosomal markers RAB7A and LAMP1, respectively, demonstrating that tau fibrils are rapidly taken up into endosomes to be potentially degraded via the lysosome. However, when CHMP6 is reduced, the co-localization between tau fibrils and endosomal-lysosomal markers was greatly decreased; instead, tau aggregates formed in the cytosol. Chen et al. argue that efficient uptake and degradation of tau fibrils via lysosomes minimize the potential interaction between tau seeds and cytosolic tau. In this scenario, CHMP6 knockdown destabilizes endosomal-lysosomal integrity, and tau fibrils then leak into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). This proposal was reinforced through knockdown of other components of the ESCRT pathway. Simultaneous genetic reduction of the redundant ESCRT-III subunits CHMP2A and CHMP2B causes tau aggregation in the FRET assay. Additionally, knockdown of Vps4, the ATPase driving disassembly of ESCRT-III, also induces tau aggregation. Although CHMP2A and CHMP2B function as redundant proteins, mutations in CHMP2B are known to cause FTD (10Skibinski G. Parkinson N.J. Brown J.M. Chakrabarti L. Lloyd S.L. Hummerich H. Nielsen J.E.

Genet. 2005; 37 (16041373): 806-80810.1038/ng1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), albeit a form of FTD that is negative for tau aggregation, reinforcing the importance of the ESCRT machinery in maintaining neuronal integrity. The authors also tested the effects of l-leucyl-l-leucine-o-methyl ester, which destabilizes endosomal/lysosomal compartments, and demonstrate that this compound phenocopies CHMP6 knockdown, accelerating the propagation of tau aggregation. This work systematically addresses how tau seeds spread in a cellular system and places the highly conserved ESCRT recycling pathway in the center of its regulation. In a world of high-profile failed drug trials for AD, this work introduces an alternative therapeutic strategy to that of removing or inhibiting tau. We might now instead design compounds that preserve and promote the integrity of the endolysosomal system. Compromised function of the ESCRT pathway promotes endolysosomal escape of tau seeds and propagation of tau aggregationJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 50PreviewIntercellular propagation of protein aggregation is emerging as a key mechanism in the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, we lack a systematic understanding of the cellular pathways controlling prion-like propagation of aggregation. To uncover such pathways, here we performed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in a human cell-based model of propagation of tau aggregation monitored by FRET. Our screens uncovered that knockdown of several components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, including charged multivesicular body protein 6 (CHMP6), or CHMP2A in combination with CHMP2B (whose gene is linked to familial FTD), promote propagation of tau aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2997911744,"Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation of IDUA gene. IDUA codes for α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), a lysosomal hydrolase that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. GAGs are structural and signalling molecules that have a crucial role in controlling a variety of cell functions and their interaction with the extracellular matrix. Because of GAG’s widespread action in cellular metabolism, MPS I is a progressive and disabling multisystemic disorder. Nowadays, the therapies available allowed patients to reach the adult life and the consequences of the disease in their reproductive system are mostly unknown. We aimed to investigate whether IDUA disruption influences sexual behaviour and sexual steroid production in male and female MPS I mice. We used 3 and 6-month-old male and 3-month-old female Idua+/_ and Idua-/- mice to evaluate typical rodent copulatory behaviours. In males we observed the frequency and latency of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations. In females, we evaluated the lordosis quotient. We also analysed the locomotor capacity of mice in the open field test, since mobility is essential for copulatory behaviour. We also quantified steroidal hormonal levels in plasmatic samples. We detected an increase in the latencies of intromissions in Idua-/- males when compared to Idua+/_. However, the number of intromissions was not statistically different between groups. No parameter of female sexual behaviour was statistically different between control and knockout females. In both sexes, we detected diminished mobility in Idua-/- mice. Plasma hormone levels did not differ between Idua+/_ and Idua-/- mice, both in males and females. Although the motor disability predicted to MPS I animals, we concluded that in the considered time point of MPS I progression studied, mice are able to perform sexual behaviour."

Consequently, harnessing these molecules for the treatment of metastatic cancer could have significant clinical impact. In the present study, we set out to identify metastasis-specific microRNAs which drive metastatic colonization of distant organs. Using a murine model of metastatic breast cancer, we employed a directed approach in which we screened for microRNAs that are differentially expressed between the primary tumors and metastatic lesions but concordantly expressed in all of the metastatic lesions irrespective of the tissue that is colonized. Of the identified targets, we focused on miR-710, which was consistently and significantly downregulated in the metastatic lesions relative to the primary tumors. The level of downregulation was independent of the distant organ that is involved, suggesting that miR-710 plays a fundamental role in metastatic colonization. Computational target prediction suggested a pleiotropic role for miR-710 in apoptosis, migration and invasion, and stemness. Using a previously validated oligonucleotide delivery system, we introduced miR-710 mimics into 4T1 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells and assessed the resultant phenotypic effects. We demonstrated significant inhibition of cell viability, migration, and invasion. We also showed that the treatment profoundly enhanced cell senescence, reduced stemness, and influenced markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as evidenced by enhanced E-cadherin and reduced vimentin expression. This knowledge represents a first step towards harnessing a similar approach to discover novel microRNA targets with therapeutic potential in metastasis."

Employing NCCIT and HCT116 cells, having high endogenous Wnt signaling, we observed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) and Frizzled class receptor 10 (FZD10) and increases in β-catenin, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), CD44 molecule (CD44), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1). siRNA-induced knockdown of these receptors antagonized TOPflash reporter activity and spheroid growth in vitro and elevated Wnt-inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) activity. Elevated mRNA and protein levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10 paralleled expression of WNT2b and WNT4 in colonic crypts at days 6 and 12 post-infection with Citrobacter rodentium (CR) and tended to decline at days 20–34. The CR mutant escV or the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 attenuated these responses. A three-dimensional organoid assay in colonic crypts isolated from CR-infected mice revealed elevated levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10 and β-catenin co-localization with enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2). Co-immunoprecipitation in the membrane fraction revealed that axin associates with LRP5/6 in CR-infected crypts, and this association was correlated with increased β-catenin. Colon tumors from either CR-infected ApcP Min /+ or azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-treated mice had high LRP5/6 or FZD10 levels, and chronic Notch blockade through the γ-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine down-regulated LRP5/6 and FZD10 expression. In CR-responsive CT-26 cells, siRNA-induced LRP5/6 or FZD10 knockdown antagonized TOPflash reporter activity. Elevated miR-153-3p levels correlated with LRP5/6 and FZD10, and miR-153-3p sequestration via a plasmid-based miR inhibitor system attenuated Wnt signaling. We conclude that infection-induced signals from the plasma membrane epigenetically regulate Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2996338923,"The global burden estimate of hypertension is alarming and results in several million deaths annually. A high incidence of sudden deaths from cardiovascular diseases in the civil workforce in Nigeria is often reported. However, the associations between Dietary Patterns (DPs), individual, and workplace characteristics of hypertension among this workforce have not been fully explored. This study aimed to identify DP in the Bida and Wushishi Communities of Niger State and establish its relationship with hypertension along with other individual and workplace characteristics. Factor analysis was used to establish DP, Chi-square test to identify their relationships with hypertension, and logistic regression to determine the predictor risk factors. The prevalence of hypertension was 43.7%; mean weight, height, and body fat were: 72.8±15 kg, 166±8.9 mm and 30.4%, respectively. Three DPs: “Efficient Diet,” “Local diet,” and “Energy Boost Diet” were identified. The factor loading scores for these factors were divided into quintiles Q1–Q5; none of them had a significant effect on hypertension status. Conversely, increase in age, the Ministry, Department, and Agency (MDA) of employment, frequency of eating in restaurants, and obesity were identified as significant risk factors. After adjusting for confounders (age, body mass index, MDA, and eating habits), a high score (Q5) in “efficient diet pattern” was significantly related to a lower likelihood of hypertension than a low score (Q1). The prevalence of hypertension among the participants was relatively very high. An increase in age and working in educational sector were risk factors associated with hypertension. Therefore, it is recommended that civil servants engage in frequent exercise and undergo regular medical checkups, especially as they get older. These findings highlight the need for large-scale assessment of the impact of variables considered in this study on hypertension, among the civil workforce across Niger state and Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2996670585,"The lovastatin hydrolase PcEST from the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum exhibits enormous potential for industrial-scale applications in single-step production of monacolin J, the key precursor for synthesis of the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin. This enzyme specifically and efficiently catalyzes the conversion of lovastatin to monacolin J but cannot hydrolyze simvastatin. Understanding the catalytic mechanism and the structure–function relationship of PcEST is therefore important for further lovastatin hydrolase screening, engineering, and commercial applications. Here, we solved four X-ray crystal structures, including apo PcEST (2.3 Å), PcEST in complex with monacolin J (2.48 Å), PcEST complexed with the substrate analog simvastatin (2.4 Å), and an inactivated PcEST variant (S57A) with the lovastatin substrate (2.3 Å). Structure-based biochemical analyses and mutagenesis assays revealed that the Ser 57 (nucleophile)–Tyr 170 (general base)–Lys 60 (general acid) catalytic triad, the hydrogen-bond network (Trp 344 and Tyr 127 ) around the active site, and the specific substrate-binding tunnel together determine efficient and specific lovastatin hydrolysis by PcEST. Moreover, steric effects on nucleophilic attack caused by the 2′,2-dimethybutyryl group of simvastatin resulted in no activity of PcEST on simvastatin. On the basis of structural comparisons, we propose several indicators to define lovastatin esterases. Furthermore, using structure-guided enzyme engineering, we developed a PcEST variant, D106A, having improved solubility and thermostability, suggesting a promising application of this variant in industrial processes. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the mechanism and structure–function relationship of lovastatin hydrolase and providing insights that may guide rapid screening and engineering of additional lovastatin esterase variants."
