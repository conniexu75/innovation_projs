https://openalex.org/W2171093931,"Photosystem II is the site of photosynthetic water oxidation and contains 20 subunits with a total molecular mass of 350 kDa. The structure of photosystem II has been reported at resolutions from 3.8 to 2.9 Å. These resolutions have provided much information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors but are insufficient to reveal the detailed structure of the catalytic centre of water splitting. Here we report the crystal structure of photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å. From our electron density map, we located all of the metal atoms of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, together with all of their ligands. We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn4CaO5 cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer. Some of them formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. The determination of the high-resolution structure of photosystem II will allow us to analyse and understand its functions in great detail. Photosystem II (PSII), found in photosynthetic plants, algae and cyanobacteria, is a large multi-subunit enzyme that harnesses light energy to drive a series of electron-transfer reactions that splits water to produce molecular oxygen. Several medium-resolution structures of PSII have been reported, but the catalytic centre composed of a Mn4CaO5 cluster has proved recalcitrant because of structural distortion caused by X-rays during data collection. This obstacle has now been overcome. Umena et al. present the X-ray structure of PSII at 1.9 Å, sufficient for the assignment of protein subunits and the geometric arrangement of the Mn4CaO5 cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2146957741,"Chronic inflammation characterized by T cell and macrophage infiltration of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a hallmark of obesity-associated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Here we show a fundamental pathogenic role for B cells in the development of these metabolic abnormalities. B cells accumulate in VAT in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, and DIO mice lacking B cells are protected from disease despite weight gain. B cell effects on glucose metabolism are mechanistically linked to the activation of proinflammatory macrophages and T cells and to the production of pathogenic IgG antibodies. Treatment with a B cell-depleting CD20 antibody attenuates disease, whereas transfer of IgG from DIO mice rapidly induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Moreover, insulin resistance in obese humans is associated with a unique profile of IgG autoantibodies. These results establish the importance of B cells and adaptive immunity in insulin resistance and suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for managing the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2166628699,"Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are remarkably similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, but recent reports indicate that there may be important differences between them. We carried out a systematic comparison of human iPS cells generated from hepatocytes (representative of endoderm), skin fibroblasts (mesoderm) and melanocytes (ectoderm). All low-passage iPS cells analysed retain a transcriptional memory of the original cells. The persistent expression of somatic genes can be partially explained by incomplete promoter DNA methylation. This epigenetic mechanism underlies a robust form of memory that can be found in iPS cells generated by multiple laboratories using different methods, including RNA transfection. Incompletely silenced genes tend to be isolated from other genes that are repressed during reprogramming, indicating that recruitment of the silencing machinery may be inefficient at isolated genes. Knockdown of the incompletely reprogrammed gene C9orf64 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 64) reduces the efficiency of human iPS cell generation, indicating that somatic memory genes may be functionally relevant during reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2034253224,"The incidence of melanoma is increasing more than any other cancer, and knowledge of its genetic alterations is limited. To systematically analyze such alterations, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 14 matched normal and metastatic tumor DNAs. Using stringent criteria, we identified 68 genes that appeared to be somatically mutated at elevated frequency, many of which are not known to be genetically altered in tumors. Most importantly, we discovered that TRRAP harbored a recurrent mutation that clustered in one position (p. Ser722Phe) in 6 out of 167 affected individuals (∼4%), as well as a previously unidentified gene, GRIN2A, which was mutated in 33% of melanoma samples. The nature, pattern and functional evaluation of the TRRAP recurrent mutation suggest that TRRAP functions as an oncogene. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive map of genetic alterations in melanoma to date and suggests that the glutamate signaling pathway is involved in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2047756822,"T-helper cells that produce interleukin-17 (T(H)17 cells) are a recently identified CD4(+) T-cell subset with characterized pathological roles in autoimmune diseases. The nuclear receptors retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors α and γt (RORα and RORγt, respectively) have indispensible roles in the development of this cell type. Here we present SR1001, a high-affinity synthetic ligand-the first in a new class of compound-that is specific to both RORα and RORγt and which inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation and function. SR1001 binds specifically to the ligand-binding domains of RORα and RORγt, inducing a conformational change within the ligand-binding domain that encompasses the repositioning of helix 12 and leads to diminished affinity for co-activators and increased affinity for co-repressors, resulting in suppression of the receptors' transcriptional activity. SR1001 inhibited the development of murine T(H)17 cells, as demonstrated by inhibition of interleukin-17A gene expression and protein production. Furthermore, SR1001 inhibited the expression of cytokines when added to differentiated murine or human T(H)17 cells. Finally, SR1001 effectively suppressed the clinical severity of autoimmune disease in mice. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting the orphan receptors RORα and RORγt to inhibit specifically T(H)17 cell differentiation and function, and indicate that this novel class of compound has potential utility in the treatment of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1964903539,"Cancer cell molecular mimicry of stem cells (SC) imbues neoplastic cells with enhanced proliferative and renewal capacities. In support, numerous mediators of SC self-renewal have been evinced to show oncogenic potential. We have recently reported that short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal gene NANOG significantly reduced the clonogenic and tumorigenic capabilities of various cancer cells. In this study, we sought to test the potential pro-tumorigenic functions of NANOG, particularly, in prostate cancer (PCa). Using qRT–PCR, we first confirmed that PCa cells expressed NANOG mRNA primarily from the NANOGP8 locus on chromosome 15q14. We then constructed a lentiviral promoter reporter in which the −3.8-kb NANOGP8 genomic fragment was used to drive the expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP). We observed that NANOGP8-GFP+ PCa cells showed cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics such as enhanced clonal growth and tumor regenerative capacity. To further investigate the functions and mechanisms of NANOG in tumorigenesis, we established tetracycline-inducible NANOG-overexpressing cancer cell lines, including both PCa (Du145 and LNCaP) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. NANOG induction promoted drug resistance in MCF-7 cells, tumor regeneration in Du145 cells and, most importantly, castration-resistant tumor development in LNCaP cells. These pro-tumorigenic effects of NANOG were associated with key molecular changes, including an upregulation of molecules such as CXCR4, IGFBP5, CD133 and ALDH1. The present gain-of-function studies, coupled with our recent loss-of-function work, establish the integral role for NANOG in neoplastic processes and shed light on its mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2021980639,"Notch signalling is a key intercellular communication mechanism that is essential for cell specification and tissue patterning, and which coordinates critical steps of blood vessel growth. Although subtle alterations in Notch activity suffice to elicit profound differences in endothelial behaviour and blood vessel formation, little is known about the regulation and adaptation of endothelial Notch responses. Here we report that the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 acts as an intrinsic negative modulator of Notch signalling in endothelial cells. We show that acetylation of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) on conserved lysines controls the amplitude and duration of Notch responses by altering NICD protein turnover. SIRT1 associates with NICD and functions as a NICD deacetylase, which opposes the acetylation-induced NICD stabilization. Consequently, endothelial cells lacking SIRT1 activity are sensitized to Notch signalling, resulting in impaired growth, sprout elongation and enhanced Notch target gene expression in response to DLL4 stimulation, thereby promoting a non-sprouting, stalk-cell-like phenotype. In vivo, inactivation of Sirt1 in zebrafish and mice causes reduced vascular branching and density as a consequence of enhanced Notch signalling. Our findings identify reversible acetylation of the NICD as a molecular mechanism to adapt the dynamics of Notch signalling, and indicate that SIRT1 acts as rheostat to fine-tune endothelial Notch responses."

https://openalex.org/W1999341037,"Variation in cell-surface levels and expression of the major histocompatibility complex component HLA-C have been implicated in the control of HIV viral load and progression to AIDS. The microRNA miR-148a is now shown to regulate the expression of HLA-C expression and its effects on HIV. The discovery of a role for a microRNA in this process raises the possibility of new approaches to immunotherapy. The HLA-C locus is distinct relative to the other classical HLA class I loci in that it has relatively limited polymorphism1, lower expression on the cell surface2,3, and more extensive ligand–receptor interactions with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors4. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of HLA-C (rs9264942; termed −35) associates with control of HIV5,6,7, and with levels of HLA-C messenger RNA transcripts8 and cell-surface expression7, but the mechanism underlying its varied expression is unknown. We proposed that the −35 SNP is not the causal variant for differential HLA-C expression, but rather is marking another polymorphism that directly affects levels of HLA-C7. Here we show that variation within the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of HLA-C regulates binding of the microRNA hsa-miR-148 to its target site, resulting in relatively low surface expression of alleles that bind this microRNA and high expression of HLA-C alleles that escape post-transcriptional regulation. The 3′ UTR variant associates strongly with control of HIV, potentially adding to the effects of genetic variation encoding the peptide-binding region of the HLA class I loci. Variation in HLA-C expression adds another layer of diversity to this highly polymorphic locus that must be considered when deciphering the function of these molecules in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1994120808,"The use of brain machine interfaces for neuroprosthetic control is known to change the tuning properties of neurons directly projecting the interface. Here the authors report that there are also tuning changes to indirectly projecting neurons, which are stable, but relatively small when compared with changes in the directly projecting neurons. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a framework for studying cortical dynamics and the neural correlates of learning. Neuroprosthetic control has been associated with tuning changes in specific neurons directly projecting to the BMI (hereafter referred to as direct neurons). However, little is known about the larger network dynamics. By monitoring ensembles of neurons that were either causally linked to BMI control or indirectly involved, we found that proficient neuroprosthetic control is associated with large-scale modifications to the cortical network in macaque monkeys. Specifically, there were changes in the preferred direction of both direct and indirect neurons. Notably, with learning, there was a relative decrease in the net modulation of indirect neural activity in comparison with direct activity. These widespread differential changes in the direct and indirect population activity were markedly stable from one day to the next and readily coexisted with the long-standing cortical network for upper limb control. Thus, the process of learning BMI control is associated with differential modification of neural populations based on their specific relation to movement control."

https://openalex.org/W2061489284,"Generalized anxiety is thought to result, in part, from impairments in contingency awareness during conditioning to cues that predict aversive or fearful outcomes. Dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain exhibit heterogeneous responses to aversive stimuli that are thought to provide a critical modulatory signal to facilitate orientation to environmental changes and assignment of motivational value to unexpected events. Here we describe a mouse model in which activation of dopamine neurons in response to an aversive stimulus is attenuated by conditional genetic inactivation of functional NMDA receptors on dopamine neurons. We discovered that altering the magnitude of excitatory responses by dopamine neurons in response to an aversive stimulus was associated with impaired conditioning to a cue that predicts an aversive outcome. Impaired conditioning by these mice was associated with the development of a persistent, generalized anxiety-like phenotype. These data are consistent with a role for dopamine in facilitating contingency awareness that is critical for the prevention of generalized anxiety."

https://openalex.org/W2033574123,"The rewarding properties of drugs contribute to the development of abuse and addiction. We developed a new assay for investigating the motivational properties of ethanol in the genetically tractable model Drosophila melanogaster. Flies learned to associate cues with ethanol intoxication and, although transiently aversive, the experience led to a long-lasting attraction for the ethanol-paired cue, implying that intoxication is rewarding. Temporally blocking transmission in dopaminergic neurons revealed that flies require activation of these neurons to express, but not develop, conditioned preference for ethanol-associated cues. Moreover, flies acquired, consolidated and retrieved these rewarding memories using distinct sets of neurons in the mushroom body. Finally, mutations in scabrous, encoding a fibrinogen-related peptide that regulates Notch signaling, disrupted the formation of memories for ethanol reward. Our results thus establish that Drosophila can be useful for understanding the molecular, genetic and neural mechanisms underling the rewarding properties of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2136830681,"Chronic inflammation of the airways is associated with remodeling and fibrosis, leading to a progressive decline in lung function in people with severe asthma. Michael Croft and his colleagues report that in mouse models of allergic lung inflammation expression of the TNF family member LIGHT is induced. Blockade of LIGHT prevents remodeling, providing a therapeutic strategy to prevent asthmatic airway remodeling. Individuals with chronic asthma show a progressive decline in lung function that is thought to be due to structural remodeling of the airways characterized by subepithelial fibrosis and smooth muscle hyperplasia. Here we show that the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member LIGHT is expressed on lung inflammatory cells after allergen exposure. Pharmacological inhibition of LIGHT using a fusion protein between the IgG Fc domain and lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) reduces lung fibrosis, smooth muscle hyperplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of chronic asthma, despite having little effect on airway eosinophilia. LIGHT-deficient mice also show a similar impairment in fibrosis and smooth muscle accumulation. Blockade of LIGHT suppresses expression of lung transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), cytokines implicated in remodeling in humans, whereas exogenous administration of LIGHT to the airways induces fibrosis and smooth muscle hyperplasia, Thus, LIGHT may be targeted to prevent asthma-related airway remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2040567024,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized by two different pathways, the Lands cycle and the Kennedy pathway. The recently identified key enzymes of the Lands cycle, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 and 2 (LPCAT1 and -2), were reported to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and to function in lung surfactant production and in inflammation response. Here, we show in various mammalian cell lines that both enzymes additionally localize to lipid droplets (LDs), which consist of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipid, mainly PC. This dual localization is enabled by the monotopic topology of these enzymes demonstrated in this study. Furthermore, we show that LDs have the ability to locally synthesize PC and that this activity correlates with the LPCAT1 and -2 expression level.

LDs are very dynamic organelles, which grow in size upon neutral lipid synthesis, lipogenesis, or shrink, when the stored lipids are mobilized during lipolysis. The necessary coordinated change of LD volume and surface is dynamically controlled by an unknown mechanism (15Ohsaki Y. Cheng J. Suzuki M. Shinohara Y. Fujita A. Fujimoto T. Biochim. Biophys.

We have recently shown that TAG biosynthesis can take place directly at the surface of LDs (17Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This activity is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), which localizes to the LD surface (17Kuerschner L.

However, evidence for a concomitant local synthesis of the main LD surface lipids, in particular PC, is lacking. Two conserved major biochemical pathways contribute to the synthesis of PC as follows: the Kennedy pathway for de novo PC synthesis and the Lands cycle for remodeling of the fatty acid composition of PC species (19Carman G.M. Han G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S69-S73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A third pathway, which operates by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to PC, is restricted to liver cells (21Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the Kennedy pathway, choline phosphate is activated with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and transferred to diacylglyceride (DAG) to form PC. The enzymes to catalyze these reactions are the cytoplasmic CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and the membrane-embedded cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) or choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase (CEPT) (22Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Lands cycle includes the removal of fatty acids at the sn-2 position of PC by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to yield lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) followed by re-acylation by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCATs) (24Lands W.E.

LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 belong to the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) family, characterized by the presence of four conserved motifs (31Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and possess a C-terminal KKXX ER retention motif. In contrast, LPCAT3 and LPCAT4 lack LPAAT motifs and are related to proteins of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family (32Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which include the cholesterol acyltransferase ACAT1/SOAT1 and the DAG acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). LPCAT1 is highly expressed in lung tissue, especially in type II alveolar cells (26Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

The activity and expression of LPCAT1 is independent of any inflammatory stimulation, in contrast to LPCAT2. Upon acute inflammation LPCAT2 transfers acetyl-CoA to lyso-platelet-activating factor to form platelet-activating factor. Under resting conditions, it participates in membrane remodeling through insertion of arachidonyl-CoA into PC (28Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J.

Additionally, we demonstrate that both proteins are monotopic membrane proteins and that their expression level correlates with LD-associated LPCAT activity. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against the C-terminal peptide of human LPCAT1 CNSDAGRKPVRKKLD, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and against purified recombinant His6-hLPCAT2(310–545), His6-hACSL3(504–721), and His6-hNSDHL(1–211) were raised by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and were affinity-purified against the respective antigen. The specificity and sensitivity of the LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 antibodies were evaluated by Western blotting against overexpressed tagged proteins and against lysates of nonoverexpressing A431 cells. Antiserum against human tail interacting protein 47 (TIP47) was a kind gift of Stefan Hoening (Cologne University), and antiserum against ACAT1 (DM10 (37Chang C.C. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D.

We used anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb clone F-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-calnexin and anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody (StressGen), Alexa 555-coupled goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 647-coupled goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa 488-coupled goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), and HRP-coupled polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dianova). The lipids 16:0-lysophosphatidic acid (16:0-LPC) and CDP-choline were from Fluka, and oleoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and dioleoyl-DAG were from Sigma. Synthetic lipid standards were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), Larodan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden), and Sigma. [14C]CDP-choline was from Biotrend, and [3H]oleate was from Hartmann Analytic. [3H]Acyl-CoAs were synthesized as described previously (38Taylor D.C. Weber N. Hogge L.R. Underhill E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Human LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 were amplified by PCR from full-length ESTs and cloned into pCDNA3.1 vectors (Clontech) with or without inserted N- or C-terminal HA3 tags or pEGFP vectors (Clontech) with C- or N-terminally enhanced GFP fusion protein. For immunization, a fragment of LPCAT2 was cloned behind a His6 tag into the bacterial expression vector pHAT2. The supplemental Table 1 contains detailed information, including primer sequences and restriction sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. siRNA sequences were from Ambion. Sequences and siRNA IDs are listed in supplemental Table 1. Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen, and INTERFERinTM was from Peqlab. A431 and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen 31966) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), HuH7 cells in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen 31870) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% FCS. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. If indicated, normal FCS was replaced by delipidated FCS, prepared by solvent extraction as described previously (39Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). For transfection with siRNA, cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at 5000 cells per well and treated with siRNA (9 nm) using INTERFERinTM according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, oleic acid was added to the cells to a final concentration of 50 μm and grown for a further 24 h. Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes in medium supplemented with 50–100 μm oleate for 16 h, washed, and scraped in ice-cold disruption buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose) followed by homogenization in a cooled EMBL cell cracker (HGM, Heidelberg, Germany) with 5 strokes using a maximum clearance of 18 μm. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was adjusted to 1.1 m sucrose. Four ml of the post-nuclear supernatants were loaded to the bottom of a 13-ml centrifuge tube and overlaid with ice-cold disruption buffer. The gradients were centrifuged in a swing-out rotor at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Fractions were taken from the top as follows: top 2 ml, LD fraction; next 3.5 ml, intermediate fraction; next 4 ml, including the phase boundary between 0.25 and 1.1 m sucrose, floating membranes; and last 3.5 ml, bottom fraction. Whole cell lysates (15 μl, adjusted to 200 μl with disruption buffer) or LD fractions from sucrose gradient centrifugation (200 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 μm oleoyl-CoA, 10 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 1 μCi/ml each of [3H]oleoyl-CoA, [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, and [3H]myristoyl-CoA). For the LPAAT assay 100 μm sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-lyso-PA and for the LPCAT assay 100 μm sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-lyso-PC (final concentration) were added followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The assays for LPCAT overexpression or knockdown experiments were performed with 100 μm sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-lyso-PC and 6.5 μm oleoyl-CoA and 3 μCi/ml [3H]oleoyl-CoA (final concentration). These conditions ensure substrate saturation and linearity with respect to the amount of added enzyme, as determined in separate experiments (data not shown). Reactions were stopped by shaking with a mixture of 700 μl of chloroform/methanol, 1:3, and 400 μl of water. The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the chloroform phase was analyzed by TLC in ethanol/triethylamine/chloroform/water, 50:35:35:10 (17Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Plates were sprayed with scintillant and exposed to x-ray film at −78 °C. Signals were quantified by scraping from TLC plate and scintillation counting or from the scanned x-ray films with Fiji software, corrected for total protein content, and normalized to the respective control. Whole A431 cell lysates (50 μl, adjusted to 200 μl with disruption buffer) or a mixture of bottom (50 μl) and floating membrane fractions (50 μl) (adjusted to 200 μl with disruption buffer) or LD fractions from sucrose gradient centrifugation (200 μl in disruption buffer) were mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm dioleoyl-DAG, 0.5 μCi of [14C]CDP-choline, 200 μm CDP-choline) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The same procedure as described for acyltransferase assay was followed. A standard assay adopted from Arden et al. (40Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used for quantification of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) activity. LD fraction or lysates of HuH7, A431, or COS7 cells (200 μl) were added to 100 μl of RB buffer (20 mm sodium tartrate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) either with or without 100 mm glucose 6-phosphate. As a standard for free phosphate, different amounts of sodium dihydrogen phosphate were used. The samples were incubated for 5 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 60 μl of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were mixed with 250 μl of color reagent (1 part 4.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 5 m HCl and 2 parts 0.2% (w/v) malachite green in H2O). The absorbance at 650 nm was used to calculate the amounts of free phosphate formed using the standard curve. A431 cells (8 × 10-cm dishes) were grown as above and supplemented with 100 μm oleate for the final 16 h. Cells were lysed, and LDs were purified exactly as described above with the exception of the addition of Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) to all buffers. Proteins from pooled LD fractions were precipitated using chloroform/methanol (41Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar), subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (10% gel), and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The lane was cut into 34 bands that were separately digested with trypsin, and recovered peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer as described previously (42Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3554) Google Scholar). For transfection with expression vectors, cells were grown on glass coverslips to 80% confluency, transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and further cultivated. If indicated, media were supplemented with 100 μm oleate. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, blocked, and permeabilized for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% saponin (blocking buffer, BB). If indicated, saponin in the BB was replaced by 0.001% digitonin (Applichem A1905,0100). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h in BB, washed three times with BB, incubated with secondary antibody in BB, washed two times in BB and two times in PBS, and counterstained with Bodipy 493/503 in PBS, followed by three washes in PBS. After rinsing in water, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a 100× NA 1.3 oil objective using laser excitation at 488, 543, and 633 nm. A431 cells were grown in 3-cm glass bottom dishes and co-transfected with pDsRed2-ER (Clontech) and either pLPCAT1-EGFP, pEGFP-LPCAT1, pLPCAT2-EGFP, or pEGFP-LPCAT2. Cells were washed two times in KHM buffer (110 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 2 mm MgCl2). The dish was placed on the microscope stage and incubated with 60 μm digitonin in KHM buffer for 1 min, and an image was recorded. Buffer was exchanged for KHM buffer containing 50 μg/ml proteinase K or 125 μg/ml trypsin (1:40 dilution of 10× trypsin, Sigma T4174). Immediately after, images were recorded every 10 s for 2 min. In Fig. 3C, images taken after 30 s are shown. Images were acquired at a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 with a 63× NA 1.2 objective. N-terminally HA3-tagged LPCAT1 or LPCAT2 was expressed in A431 cells for 16 h. Cells were lysed, and microsomes were collected by centrifugation. Microsomes were incubated in PBS and treated as indicated in Fig. 3D using 50 μg/ml proteinase K in PBS for 60 min. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 10 mm PMSF. Samples were boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. LD-associated proteins were isolated from A431 cells, separated by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A), and analyzed by protein mass spectrometry (42Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3554) Google Scholar). Identified proteins (supplemental Fig. 1B) include the abundant PAT protein TIP47, the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), and the sterol dehydrogenase NAD(P)-dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), which were observed in previous studies of LDs (4Brasaemle D.L.

No additional long chain acyltransferases were identified with the exception of much less abundant LPAAT-θ/AGPAT9, which is a distant relative of LPCAT1 and LPCAT2.

To study the subcellular localization of the endogenous proteins, we produced specific antibodies against human LPCAT1 and LPCAT2. Western blot analysis of different cell lines showed high expression levels of both LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 in A431 cells, whereas COS7 and HuH7 cells expressed much lower amounts of both LPCATs or only LPCAT1, respectively (Fig. 1). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of A431 cells revealed a distinct localization to LDs and ER structures for both endogenous and overexpressed LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 (Figs. 2A and 3B). Also in COS7 cells, both proteins localized to LDs (Fig. 2B). Unlike in A431 cells, where continuous rings around LDs were seen, the staining in COS7 cells showed discrete patches on LDs, likely a consequence of the lower expression levels of endogenous LPCAT1 and LPCAT2.FIGURE 2Endogenous LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 localize to LDs. A, A431 cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% of either delipidated FCS (DL), normal FCS (FCS), or normal FCS + 100 μm oleate (Ole). Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using Bodipy 493/503 to stain neutral lipids (lipid droplets) and anti-LPCAT1 (LPCAT1, upper panels) or anti-LPCAT2 (LPCAT2, lower panels) to stain endogenous LPCAT proteins. In the merged pictures, Bodipy 493/503 staining is in green and anti-LPCAT in red. Scale bar, 10 μm. B, COS7 cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% normal FCS + 100 μm oleate. Fixation, staining, and imaging were performed as described for A. C, lysates of A431 cells, grown in DMEM/FCS + 100 μm oleate, or HuH7 cells, grown in supplemented RMPI/FCS + 100 μm oleate, were subjected to floatation in a sucrose density gradient. The gradient was fractionated from the top into LDs, intermediate, floating membranes, and bottom fractions. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting for LPCAT1 and LPCAT2, the known integral LD proteins ACSL3 and NSDHL, the peripheral LD proteins TIP47 and ADRP, and the integral ER membrane proteins ACAT1 and calnexin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization to the vicinity of LDs could represent direct localization to the LD surface but also to adjacent organelles, in particular to ER structures that surround LDs. To address this issue, we separated LDs from other membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugation and analyzed the fractions by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). In A431 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel), a significant fraction of both LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 was floating with the LD marker proteins NSDHL, ACSL3, and TIP47 to the top of the gradient, which in turn was devoid of immunoreactivity against the ER membrane proteins calnexin and ACAT1 (37Chang C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2070440163,"Amanda Spurdle and colleagues report results of a genome-wide association study of endometrial cancer. They identify a risk variant near HNF1B that has previously been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries. To identify genetic variants associated with endometrial cancer risk, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,265 individuals with endometrial cancer (cases) from Australia and the UK and 5,190 controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We compared genotype frequencies in cases and controls for 519,655 SNPs. Forty seven SNPs that showed evidence of association with endometrial cancer in stage 1 were genotyped in 3,957 additional cases and 6,886 controls. We identified an endometrial cancer susceptibility locus close to HNF1B at 17q12 (rs4430796, P = 7.1 × 10−10) that is also associated with risk of prostate cancer and is inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1998872597,"Despite the initial effectiveness of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib against HER2 gene-amplified breast cancers, most patients eventually relapse after treatment, implying that tumors acquire mechanisms of drug resistance. To discover these mechanisms, we generated six lapatinib-resistant HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. In cells that grew in the presence of lapatinib, HER2 autophosphorylation was undetectable, whereas active phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were maintained. To identify networks maintaining these signaling pathways, we profiled the tyrosine phosphoproteome of sensitive and resistant cells using an immunoaffinity-enriched mass spectrometry method. We found increased phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and putative Src substrates in several resistant cell lines. Treatment of these resistant cells with Src kinase inhibitors partially blocked PI3K-Akt signaling and restored lapatinib sensitivity. Further, SFK mRNA expression was upregulated in primary HER2+ tumors treated with lapatinib. Finally, the combination of lapatinib and the Src inhibitor AZD0530 was more effective than lapatinib alone at inhibiting pAkt and growth of established HER2-positive BT-474 xenografts in athymic mice. These data suggest that increased Src kinase activity is a mechanism of lapatinib resistance and support the combination of HER2 antagonists with Src inhibitors early in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers in order to prevent or overcome resistance to HER2 inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2080897541,"Heat causes oligomerization and targeting of the ER-based calcium sensor STIM1 to ER–plasma membrane junctions but prevents the functional coupling between STIM1 and the calcium-permeable Orai1 ion channel, resulting in a unique heat off-response of calcium entry. Intracellular Ca2+ is essential for diverse cellular functions. Ca2+ entry into many cell types including immune cells is triggered by depleting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+, a process termed store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). STIM1 is an ER Ca2+ sensor. Upon Ca2+ store depletion, STIM1 clusters at ER–plasma membrane junctions where it interacts with and gates Ca2+-permeable Orai1 ion channels. Here we show that STIM1 is also activated by temperature. Heating cells caused clustering of STIM1 at temperatures above 35 °C without depleting Ca2+ stores and led to Orai1-mediated Ca2+ influx as a heat off-response (response after cooling). Notably, the functional coupling of STIM1 and Orai1 is prevented at high temperatures, potentially explaining the heat off-response. Additionally, physiologically relevant temperature shifts modulate STIM1-dependent gene expression in Jurkat T cells. Therefore, temperature is an important regulator of STIM1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2004387560,"We introduce an approach for detection of drug-protein interactions that combines a new yeast three-hybrid screening for identification of interactions with affinity chromatography for their unambiguous validation. We applied the methodology to the profiling of clinically approved drugs, resulting in the identification of previously known and unknown drug-protein interactions. In particular, we were able to identify off-targets for erlotinib and atorvastatin, as well as an enzyme target for the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine. We demonstrate that sulfasalazine and its metabolites, sulfapyridine and mesalamine, are inhibitors of the enzyme catalyzing the final step in the biosynthesis of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. The interference with tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism provides an explanation for some of the beneficial and deleterious properties of sulfasalazine and furthermore suggests new and improved therapies for the drug. This work thus establishes a powerful approach for drug profiling and provides new insights in the mechanism of action of clinically approved drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2138725180,"The plant stem cells in the shoot apical meristem provide a self-renewable reservoir for leaf, stem and flower organogenesis and are generally protected against stresses and disease. The molecular basis of this immunity has now been discovered. The CLV3 peptide (CLV3p) signal — which is secreted by stem cells in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem and which normally controls stem-cell homeostasis through CLV1 and CLV2 receptors — also triggers innate immune signalling through the bacterial flagellin peptide receptor kinase FLS2. The CLV3p–FLS2 signalling acts independently from the stem-cell signalling pathway. These findings suggest co-evolution in peptide–receptor signalling for development and immunity. Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of plants are the self-renewable reservoir for leaf, stem and flower organogenesis1,2. In nature, disease-free plants can be regenerated from SAM despite infections elsewhere, which underlies a horticultural practice for decades3. However, the molecular basis of the SAM immunity remains unclear. Here we show that the CLAVATA3 peptide (CLV3p), expressed and secreted from stem cells and functioning as a key regulator of stem-cell homeostasis in the SAM of Arabidopsis1,2,4, can trigger immune signalling and pathogen resistance via the flagellin receptor kinase FLS2 (refs 5, 6). CLV3p–FLS2 signalling acts independently from the stem-cell signalling pathway mediated through CLV1 and CLV2 receptors1,2,4, and is uncoupled from FLS2-mediated growth suppression5,6. Endogenous CLV3p perception in the SAM by a pattern recognition receptor for bacterial flagellin, FLS2, breaks the previously defined self and non-self discrimination in innate immunity6,7. The dual perception of CLV3p illustrates co-evolution of plant peptide and receptor kinase signalling for both development and immunity. The enhanced immunity in SAM or germ lines may represent a common strategy towards immortal fate in plants and animals1,2,8."
https://openalex.org/W2120343721,"There has been growing interest among the public and scientists in dichloroacetate (DCA) as a potential anticancer drug. Credible evidence exists for the antitumor activity of this compound, but high concentrations are needed for significant therapeutic effect. Unfortunately, these high concentrations produce detrimental side effects involving the nervous system, thereby precluding its use for cancer treatment. The mechanistic basis of the compound's antitumor activity is its ability to activate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. As the compound inhibits the kinase at micromolar concentrations, it is not known why therapeutically prohibitive high doses are needed for suppression of tumor growth. We hypothesized that lack of effective mechanisms for the entry of DCA into tumor cells may underlie this phenomenon. Here we show that SLC5A8 transports DCA very effectively with high affinity. This transporter is expressed in normal cells, but expression is silenced in tumor cells by epigenetic mechanisms. The lack of the transporter makes tumor cells resistant to the antitumor activity of DCA. However, if the transporter is expressed in tumor cells ectopically, the cells become sensitive to the drug at low concentrations. This is evident in breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells. Normal cells, which constitutively express the transporter, are however not affected by the compound, indicating tumor cell-selective therapeutic activity. The mechanism of the compound's antitumor activity still remains its ability to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and force mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. As silencing of SLC5A8 in tumors involves DNA methylation and its expression can be induced by treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors, our findings suggest that combining DCA with a DNA methylation inhibitor would offer a means to reduce the doses of DCA to avoid detrimental effects associated with high doses but without compromising antitumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2139017414,"Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is clinically active in patients with breast cancer positive for HER2 amplification. The mechanism of this anti-tumor action has remained unclear, however. We have now investigated the effects of lapatinib in HER2 amplification-positive breast cancer cells with or without an activating PIK3CA mutation. Lapatinib induced apoptosis in association with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) through inhibition of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway in breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of BIM inhibited lapatinib-induced apoptosis, implicating BIM induction in this process. The pro-apoptotic effect of lapatinib was less pronounced in cells with a PIK3CA mutation than in those without one. Lapatinib failed to inhibit AKT phosphorylation in PIK3CA mutant cells, likely because of hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway by the mutation. Depletion of PIK3CA (a catalytic subunit of PI3K) revealed that survivin expression is regulated by the PI3K pathway in these cells, suggesting that insufficient inhibition of PI3K-survivin signaling is responsible for the limited pro-apoptotic effect of lapatinib in HER2 amplification-positive cells with a PIK3CA mutation. Consistent with this notion, depletion of survivin by RNAi or treatment with a PI3K inhibitor markedly increased the level of apoptosis in PIK3CA mutant cells treated with lapatinib. Our results thus suggest that inhibition of both PI3K-survivin and MEK-ERK-BIM pathways is required for effective induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1965891152,"Erythropoiesis is a coordinated process by which RBCs are produced. Erythropoietin, a kidney-derived hormone, and iron are critical for the production of oxygen-carrying mature RBCs. To meet the high demands of iron during erythropoiesis, small intestinal iron absorption is increased through an undefined mechanism. In this study, erythropoietic induction of iron absorption was further investigated. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) signaling was activated in the small intestine during erythropoiesis. Genetic disruption of HIF-2α in the intestine abolished the increase in iron absorption genes as assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses. Moreover, the increase in serum iron following induction of erythropoiesis was entirely dependent on intestinal HIF-2α expression. Complete blood count analysis demonstrated that disruption of intestinal HIF-2α inhibited efficient erythropoiesis; mice disrupted for HIF-2α demonstrated lower hematocrit, RBCs, and Hb compared with wild-type mice. These data further cement the essential role of HIF-2α in regulating iron absorption and also demonstrate that hypoxia sensing in the intestine, as well as in the kidney, is essential for regulation of erythropoiesis by HIF-2α. Erythropoiesis is a coordinated process by which RBCs are produced. Erythropoietin, a kidney-derived hormone, and iron are critical for the production of oxygen-carrying mature RBCs. To meet the high demands of iron during erythropoiesis, small intestinal iron absorption is increased through an undefined mechanism. In this study, erythropoietic induction of iron absorption was further investigated. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) signaling was activated in the small intestine during erythropoiesis. Genetic disruption of HIF-2α in the intestine abolished the increase in iron absorption genes as assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses. Moreover, the increase in serum iron following induction of erythropoiesis was entirely dependent on intestinal HIF-2α expression. Complete blood count analysis demonstrated that disruption of intestinal HIF-2α inhibited efficient erythropoiesis; mice disrupted for HIF-2α demonstrated lower hematocrit, RBCs, and Hb compared with wild-type mice. These data further cement the essential role of HIF-2α in regulating iron absorption and also demonstrate that hypoxia sensing in the intestine, as well as in the kidney, is essential for regulation of erythropoiesis by HIF-2α."
https://openalex.org/W2040709804,"Tamoxifen (Tam) treatment is a first-line endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-α-positive breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, resistance frequently occurs and is often related with overexpression of the membrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2. This is the rationale behind combined treatments with endocrine therapy and novel inhibitors that reduce HER2 expression and signaling and thus inhibit Tam-resistant breast cancer cell growth. In this study, we show that activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), by the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or the synthetic agonist GW4064, inhibited growth of Tam-resistant breast cancer cells (termed MCF-7 TR1), which was used as an in vitro model of acquired Tam resistance. Our results demonstrate that CDCA treatment significantly reduced both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced growth in MCF-7 TR1 cells. Furthermore, results from western blot analysis and real-time reverse transcription–PCR revealed that CDCA treatment reduced HER2 expression and inhibited EGF-mediated HER2 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in these Tam-resistant breast cancer cells. Transient transfection experiments, using a vector containing the human HER2 promoter region, showed that CDCA treatment downregulated basal HER2 promoter activity. This occurred through an inhibition of nuclear factor-κB transcription factor binding to its specific responsive element located in the HER2 promoter region as revealed by mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Collectively, these data suggest that FXR ligand-dependent activity, blocking HER2/MAPK signaling, may overcome anti-estrogen resistance in human breast cancer cells and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat breast cancer patients that develop resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2091199878,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Expression of the WWOX tumor suppressor is absent or reduced in a large proportion of breast tumors suggesting that loss of WWOX may contribute to breast tumorigenesis. Wwox-deficient mice die by 3–4 weeks of age precluding adult tumor analysis. To evaluate the effect of WWOX-altered expression on mammary tumor formation, the Wwox-heterozygous allele was back crossed onto the C3H mammary tumor-susceptible genetic background (WwoxC3H+/−) and incidence of mammary tumor formation was evaluated. Although 50% of the female WwoxC3H+/− mice developed mammary carcinomas, only 7% of WwoxC3H+/+ mice did. Intriguingly, mammary tumors in WwoxC3H+/− mice frequently lost WWOX protein expression suggesting a genetic predisposition toward mammary tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical staining of hormone receptors revealed loss of estrogen receptor-α (ER) and progesterone receptor in the majority of these tumors. In vitro, depletion of WWOX in MCF7 ER-positive cells led to reduced ER expression and reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen and estrogen treatment and was associated with enhanced survival and anchorage-independent growth. Finally, cDNA array analyses of murine normal mammary epithelial cells and mammary tumors identified 163 significantly downreguated and 129 upregulated genes in the tumors. The majority of differentially expressed genes were part of pathways involved in cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation and cell death. These changes in gene expression of mouse mammary tumors in WwoxC3H+/− mice resemble, at least in part, human breast cancer development. Our findings demonstrate the critical role that the WWOX tumor suppressor gene has in preventing tumorigenesis in breast cancer."

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important virulence factor in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exerting direct endotoxic effects (1Ernst R.K. Hajjar A.M. Tsai J.H. Moskowitz S.M. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6618-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). LPS is composed of the proximal lipid A moiety, the core oligosaccharide linker, and the distal capping polysaccharide, of which P. aeruginosa synthesizes two glycoforms: one capped by homopolymeric A-band common polysaccharide and the other by heteropolymeric O-specific B-band O-antigen (O-Ag), 3The abbreviations used are: O-AgO-antigenTMStransmembrane segment(s)PLperiplasmic loopUndPPundecaprenyl pyrophosphate. the latter being the immunodominant cell surface antigen that differentiates this species into 20 serotypes (4King J.D.

These processes are mediated by the integral inner membrane proteins Wzx (5Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 973-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Wzy (6de Kievit T.R. Dasgupta T. Schweizer H. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Wzz1/Wzz2 (7Daniels C. Griffiths C. Cowles B. Lam J.S. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and WaaL (8Abeyrathne P.D. Daniels C. Poon K.K. Matewish M.J. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3002-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), respectively, with their assembly roles mainly characterized via genetic evidence. However, their precise mechanisms of function remain poorly understood. O-Ag subunit polymerization by Wzy has recently been demonstrated in vitro (9Woodward R. Yi W. Li L. Zhao G. Eguchi H. Sridhar P.R. Guo H. Song J.K. Motari E. Cai L. Kelleher P. Liu X. Han W. Zhang W. Ding Y. Li M. Wang P.G. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but characterization of the reaction mechanism has yet to take place. Recently, our group mapped the topology of Wzx, Wzy, and WaaL from P. aeruginosa PAO1; instead of relying on in silico topology prediction algorithm outputs to dictate the location of α-helical transmembrane segments (TMS), we used an unbiased experimental approach (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This resulted in the identification of previously undetected motifs in the TMS, as well as in the cytoplasm and periplasm for each protein. Wzy was found to contain 14 TMS, with two large periplasmic loops (PL) of comparable size localized between TMS5–6 (PL3) and TMS9–10 (PL5), each containing an RX10G tract of amino acids (supplemental Fig. S1) (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alignment of the peptide sequences of the two loops via ClustalW2 revealed a high degree of conservation for structurally and/or functionally equivalent amino acid residues (see Fig. 1). To further explore the functional significance of this finding, we analyzed the charge nature of both PL3 and PL5. Significant differences in the isoelectric point (pI) of each loop were observed despite the high degree of sequence conservation. Furthermore, we created site-directed mutants of conserved charged residues between PL3 and PL5, subsequently identifying key Arg residues required for the O-Ag subunit polymerization reaction; certain of these residues highlighted the importance of the guanidinium functional group of Arg in O-Ag polymerization as Lys-substituted variants simply maintaining an analogous charge at the same position were unable to restore function. This is the first investigation to examine the function of a Wzy protein within the context of a rigorously defined topological structure and in so doing provides evidence for the “catch-and-release” mechanism for Wzy function we have previously proposed (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and herein refined. QuikChange (Agilent) site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a previously created template encoding Wzy fused with a C-terminal His8-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) moiety (Wzy-GFP-His8). This fusion tag does not affect wild type O-Ag polymerase function and provides the additional advantage of displaying GFP fluorescence upon expression induction (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This fusion construct was contained in an arabinose-inducible pHERD26T vector, selected by LB supplementation with 90 μg/ml tetracycline (11Qiu D. Damron F.H. Mima T. Schweizer H.P. Yu H.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 7422-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated with a GenElute miniprep kit (Sigma). PCR amplifications for mutagenesis were carried out using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen). The oligonucleotide primer sequences used to create the various mutants are available upon request. The in vivo function of each mutant construct was assayed by using the mutant genes to complement B-band LPS deficiency in a P. aeruginosa PAO1 wzy chromosomal knock-out mutant created by our group; this mutant was previously demonstrated to be deficient in B-band LPS production while maintaining the production of A-band LPS (6de Kievit T.R. Dasgupta T. Schweizer H. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Wzy coding sequence from P. aeruginosa PAO1 has revealed the presence of numerous rare codons, with many immediately downstream of the start codon (6de Kievit T.R. Dasgupta T. Schweizer H. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Coyne Jr., M.J. Goldberg J.B. Gene. 1995; 167: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This characteristic likely contributes to the low expression levels of the protein (13Abeyrathne P.D. Lam J.S. Can. J. Microbiol. 2007; 53: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To avoid dose-dependent overexpression artifacts of a given Wzy mutant, cells containing the various constructs were grown to stationary phase by overnight incubation at 37 °C, shaking in tetracycline-supplemented LB medium without expression induction. The potential for overexpression artifacts was monitored through the measurement of GFP fluorescence for each of the overnight samples processed for LPS analysis; these levels did not register above the background fluorescence detected for the pHERD26T empty vector control, indicating that all mutant constructs were also expressed at background plasmid levels (data not shown). LPS was extracted from bacteria after the complementation experiment and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting as described previously (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Abeyrathne P.D. Lam J.S. Mol.

Immun. 1987; 55: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures of P. aeruginosa PAO1 Δwzy (25 ml) expressing various Wzy-GFP-His8 mutants were grown overnight with 0.1% l-arabinose, equilibrated to A600 of 1.5, and sedimented at 4000 × g. To minimize mechanical loss of samples during processing, equilibrated cell pellets were permeabilized by using the vortex and resuspending the cell materials in 3 ml of B-PER II protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) with 2× Complete protease inhibitor mixture lacking EDTA (Roche Applied Science) followed by shaking incubation at 30 °C (260 rpm, 30 min). Sample volume was increased by the addition of 2 ml 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 2× Complete protease inhibitor lacking EDTA, after which crude debris and inclusion bodies were sedimented at 12,000 × g in a Beckman super-speed centrifuge (30 min). The resultant supernatant was sedimented at 120,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (1 h) to obtain the membrane pellet, which was subsequently resuspended directly in the ultracentrifuge tube in 130 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer using a Dounce homogenizer plunger. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, with 25 μl resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel; the full-range ECL Plex Fluorescent Rainbow Marker (GE Healthcare) protein standard was used. In-gel fluorescence scans were obtained using a Typhoon 9410 imager and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). The Blue2(488), Green(532), and Red(633) excitation lasers as well as the 526SP, 580BP, and 670BP emission filters were used to detect GFP, Cy3, and Cy5 fluorescence, respectively, after which final densitometry analysis of full-length Wzy-GFP-His8 fluorescence was performed in quadruplicate using the ImageJ software. Upon calculation of the pI for PL3 and PL5 of Wzy using the ExPASy proteomics server, strikingly distinct results were obtained. The pI values for PL3 and PL5 were 8.59 and 5.49, respectively (Fig. 1). Even when the two loops were compared by accounting for only the conserved residues, pI values of 9.99 and 5.96 were calculated, respectively (Fig. 1, highlighted residues). As the pH of the periplasm has been demonstrated to match that of the extracellular environment (16Wilks J.C. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5601-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), at a physiological pH of ∼7.4, this would indicate a significant net-positive charge on PL3 and a net-negative charge on PL5 (Fig. 1) despite the high level of sequence equivalence between the two. This compositional equivalence was previously demonstrated to confer similar helical secondary structure propensity patterning between PL3 and PL5 (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, construction of knowledge-based tertiary structure models of these highly conserved amino acid sequences using the I-TASSER platform (17Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar) revealed strikingly similar three-dimensional folding models for PL3 and PL5. Each of these structures contained two antiparallel helices of similar length with a flexible intervening loop region (supplemental Fig. S2). Based on the experimentally derived topology map of Wzy (supplemental Fig. S1), site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace specific residues within PL3 and PL5 with alanine to detect those that are important for polymerase function. Each mutant construct was assayed for its ability to complement a P. aeruginosa PAO1 wzy knock-out mutant and restore the synthesis of B-band LPS. Constructs containing changes to amino acid residues not essential for function should positively complement the wzy mutant and restore B-band production; in contrast, constructs containing changes to amino acid residues essential for function should not be able to complement Wzy deficiency. Individual substitution of the Arg residues in PL3 (positions 175, 176, and 180) to Ala adversely affected the ability of Wzy to restore B-band LPS biosynthesis (Fig. 2A). Incidentally, these positively charged residues correspond to the 1st, 2nd, and 6th amino acids contained within the RX10G tract of PL3, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). Complete loss of B-band O-Ag was observed for Wzy with the R176A substitution, whereas only trace amounts were detected for substitutions R175A and R180A (Fig. 2A), indicating the importance of these amino acids in Wzy function. Substitutions of F165A and D168A located at the base of PL3 (supplemental Fig. S1) did not affect the function of the protein (Fig. 2A), suggesting that these residues do not form part of the tertiary structure that contributes to O-Ag subunit polymerization. Site-directed mutations R290A and R291A of Wzy, both within the RX10G motif of PL5, resulted in a complete abrogation of B-band LPS biosynthesis in the complementation assay (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the aforementioned site-directed mutations made in PL3. These 2 residues correspond to the 1st and 2nd amino acids within the PL5 RX10G motif (supplemental Fig. S1) and align with Arg175 and Arg176 from PL3 (Fig. 1). Substitution of F279A in PL5, a residue in an analogous position to Phe165 of PL3 (Fig. 1), did not affect Wzy function, similar to substitutions E275A, H276A, E277A, and R316A (Fig. 2B) located near the PL5-membrane interface (supplemental Fig. S1). The D304A change in PL5 did not affect restoration of B-band LPS biosynthesis in the complementation assay, suggesting that Asp304 may not be involved in the tertiary structure environment of Wzy required for function (Fig. 2B). This observation is similar to the aforementioned PL3 changes, F165A and D168A. The presence of the above mentioned substitutions of Arg resulting in a loss of Wzy function did not prevent membrane insertion of the respective mutant constructs as levels of GFP fluorescence comparable with the native construct were detected from membrane fractions isolated from cultures expressing each mutant construct (supplemental Fig. S3). This was a necessary verification as alteration of positive charge in loop domains can potentially affect membrane insertion of TMS in multispanning inner membrane proteins (18Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, generation of three-dimensional folding structures using the I-TASSER platform for variants of PL3 and PL5 corresponding to the above mentioned Arg mutants with demonstrated functional deficiencies were obtained (supplemental Fig. S4); these were shown to be nearly identical to those of the native sequences (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating similar folding propensities. The conserved Gly and Ser residues between PL3 and PL5 (Gly186/Ser193/Gly196 and Gly301/Ser308/Gly311, respectively) (Fig. 1) were substituted with Val, prompted by a report of a functionally important Gly residue from Wzy of Francisella tularensis LVS (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of the six mutants screened, only Gly301 in PL5 was found to be important for function; all other Gly and Ser substitutions did not display any discernable deficiencies in B-band LPS production (Fig. 2). The overall importance of positive charge at the various RX10G Arg positions in PL3 and PL5 was examined through their respective substitutions with Lys. Following B-band LPS analysis, only the R175K and R180K substitutions in PL3 were able to restore Wzy function to native levels (Fig. 3). Substitutions R176K, R290K, and R291K were all unable to restore Wzy function (Fig. 3), yielding B-band LPS profiles equivalent to those seen for the respective Ala substitutions (Fig. 2). These results highlighted the essential nature of positive charge for PL3 function, as well as the importance of the various Arg-specific guanidinium side chains in PL3 and PL5 function. The Wzy-dependent pathway is required for the synthesis of various virulence-associated polysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Thus far, it has been implicated in the biogenesis of LPS capped with heteropolymeric O-Ag, as well as in the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen and various capsular polysaccharides (20Cuthbertson L. Mainprize I.L. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, although the polymerase function of Wzy has recently been demonstrated in vitro (9Woodward R. Yi W. Li L. Zhao G. Eguchi H. Sridhar P.R. Guo H. Song J.K. Motari E. Cai L. Kelleher P. Liu X. Han W. Zhang W. Ding Y. Li M. Wang P.G. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the mechanism of O-Ag subunit polymerization has yet to be discovered. As it is difficult to obtain three-dimensional structural data of inner membrane proteins via standard crystallographic approaches, topology mapping of Wzy proteins has been attempted to uncover domains that may contribute to the function of the protein (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Daniels C. Vindurampulle C. Morona R. Mol.

However, of the three published topologies for Wzy proteins, two relied on topology prediction algorithms to first specify the locations of TMS followed by attempts to experimentally validate the prediction (21Daniels C. Vindurampulle C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Mazur A. Król J.E. Marczak M. Skorupska A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The most recent Wzy topology investigation, published by our group, was able to experimentally determine the topology of the protein without relying on initial in silico algorithm analysis (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As such, we were able to obtain an unbiased map, and in so doing, we were able to uncover previously unidentified characteristics of the protein (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Those properties led to a proposed mechanism of Wzy function, which we have further characterized and supported in the current investigation. Previously, it has been suggested that Wzy and WaaL proteins may share a similar mechanism of function as they are both involved in the addition of UndPP-linked O-Ag to a sugar acceptor (23Schild S. Lamprecht A.K. Reidl J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25936-25947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Conserved domain BLAST comparisons and alignment of WaaL amino acid sequences from Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica, as well as the Wzy amino acid sequence from Shigella flexneri, revealed a common sequence denoted as HX10G, containing a catalytically essential His residue predicted to be in the periplasm (23Schild S.

Intriguingly, this specific motif was found to be absent from Wzy in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The HX10G motif was found to be equally important for WaaL function in P. aeruginosa PAO1. However, a H303R site-directed mutant protein was fully functional. Therefore, substitution of His with Arg effectively created an RX10G tract (14Abeyrathne P.D. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we revisited the primary structure of Wzy, and within the context of the topology map, we localized RX10G motifs in each of PL3 and PL5 loops that align with each other (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These RX10G motifs have now been shown to contain Arg residues that are essential for Wzy function in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 2), but which are located in local environments that possess significantly different net charge characteristics (Fig. 1). Rather than a lack of membrane localization for these constructs (supplemental Fig. S3), the specific loss of key guanidinium functional groups contributed by Arg residues is a plausible reason for the abrogation of protein function as maintenance of a positive charge via Lys substitution was unable to preserve Wzy function in three of the five mutants (Fig. 3). Consistent with the importance of Arg residues in the RX10G tracts of PL3 and PL5 described above, analyses of Protein Data Bank (PDB)-deposited structures solved in complex with bound substrate indicate that Arg is one of the two most widely observed residues present in the binding sites of carbohydrate- and sugar-binding proteins (24Elumalai P. Rajasekaran M. Liu H.L. Chen C. Protoplasma. 2010; 247: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Malik A. Ahmad S. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The guanidinium group itself of the Arg side chain has been shown to play a direct role in sugar binding as substitution of Arg with Lys, although maintaining the structure of a protein and a positive charge at a given location, may not be sufficient to maintain function (26Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with our findings for the Arg residues in PL3 and PL5 of Wzy (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, based on existing structures in the PDB, UDP-glucuronate (co-crystallized in the structure of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; PDB ID 2QG4) was indicated as the top-ranked ligand following I-TASSER binding site prediction for the R180A tertiary structure folding model (supplemental Fig. S4A), lending further support to the proposed sugar binding capacities of PL3 and PL5. Recently, wzy from F. tularensis LVS (wzyFt) was identified by Kim et al. (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), who subjected the translated amino acid sequence (409 amino acids) of the protein to in silico topology prediction algorithm analysis, yielding a model containing 11 TMS. This low number of TMS is significantly different from the experimentally derived topological map of Wzy from P. aeruginosa PAO1 (438 amino acids), which showed that the protein contained 14 TMS (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The authors' initial attempt to perform sequence alignment of Wzy proteins from various bacteria did not reveal conserved regions; however, restriction of the alignment to eight other γ Proteobacteria identified the conserved residue Gly323 (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on the in silico-derived WzyFt topology map, these authors proposed that Gly323 was localized to the terminus of a second large PL. No effect on polymerization was observed upon Ala substitution. However, introduction of extraneous charges/polarities (via Glu, Arg, Asp, Gln, Ser, Tyr) or bulky/kink-inducing residues (via Leu, Pro) at that position yielded compromised WzyFt function. Consequently, the authors alluded to the potential importance of periplasmic Gly abundance in WzyFt function (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kim et al. (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also randomly selected 17 charged residues for Ala substitution, and their results revealed that Asp177 was important for function of WzyFt, with this residue predicted to be located at the terminus of the first large predicted PL. Amino acids adjacent to Asp177 (Gly176, Gly178) and Gly323 (Tyr324, but not Ile322), all purportedly periplasmic, were subjected to Ala substitution, with no effect on protein function. Only upon similar charge perturbation (as described above for Gly323) was protein function compromised for Gly176 and Tyr324, whereas substitution of Gly178 showed no effect (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, as the topology model of WzyFt was derived from in silico predictions with no experimental data obtained to validate the map, the subcellular localization of the residues mutated by Kim et al. (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) cannot be confirmed. Interestingly, the proposed model of WzyFt suggested that the C terminus of the protein is localized in the periplasm, yet the authors went on to create a full-length C-terminal fusion to GFP and were able to detect fluorescence (19Kim T.H. Sebastian S. Pinkham J.T. Ross R.A. Blalock L.T. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This is contradictory to published knowledge as GFP is widely used as a reporter for cytoplasmic residue localization due to its inability to fluoresce when expressed as part of a periplasmic fusion to a membrane protein (27Feilmeier B.J. Iseminger G. Schroeder D. Webber H. Phillips G.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4068-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As such, the proposed in silico algorithm-derived topological model for WzyFt clearly requires revision. To test the catalytic importance of potentially similar residues in Wzy from P. aeruginosa PAO1, the mutually conserved residues from PL3 and PL5 (Fig. 1) were examined. However, because Gly, Ala, and Ser residues may be interchangeable in certain membrane protein motifs (29Walters R.F. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a standard Ala-scanning approach was avoided. Instead, to minimize obvious tertiary structure disturbances while not introducing foreign charges at these locations, these 6 residues were individually subjected to steric hindrance mutagenesis by substitution with Val, resulting in the addition of two methyl groups (as compared with Ala substitution) (30Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the only substitution that affected B-band LPS biosynthesis was G301V, the last position of the RX10G motif in PL5; all other substitutions showed no effect on the LPS phenotype (Fig. 2), indicating that these residues do not play a catalytic role in the polymerization of O-Ag by Wzy from P. aeruginosa PAO1. Based on the topological structure of Wzy from P. aeruginosa PAO1 (supplemental Fig. S1) (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the presence of two similar sites of proposed substrate binding is initially consistent with the entirely conceptual ribosome-like model of O-Ag polymerization proposed by Bastin et al. (31Bastin D.A. Stevenson G. Brown P.K. Haase A. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the high degree of PL3-PL5 sequence equivalence we have uncovered (Fig. 1), the above demonstrated importance of charged residues in PL3 and PL5, as well as the context of the local environments in which they are located (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), are consistent with the mechanism of O-Ag polymerase function in P. aeruginosa PAO1 that we have previously proposed (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and herein refined. Wzy of P. aeruginosa is required to interact with the negatively charged O-Ag units of this species (supplemental Fig. S5), linked to UndPP, in two different ways. As growth of O-Ag heteropolymers has been demonstrated to occur at the reducing terminus of the glycan chain (32Robbins P.W. Bray D. Dankert B.M. Wright A. Science. 1967; 158: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), one mode of Wzy-substrate interaction would constitute retention of the growing O-Ag chain after it has been extended (Fig. 4A). The concurrent second interaction scenario would entail the capture and recruitment of a single UndPP-linked O-Ag subunit to be used for the next polymerization reaction (Fig. 4B). As PL3 and PL5 share such a high degree of physicochemical conservation (Fig. 1), it is intriguing to observe that although each contains identical key residues, the two periplasmic loops possess distinct net charge properties. Therefore, we propose that each functions in one of the two capacities described above. Considering the significant net-positive charge on PL3, the positive charge dependence of Arg175 and Arg180, as well as the functional importance of the Arg176 guanidinium side chain in the RX10G motif (Figs. 2A and 3), it is conceivable that this periplasmic loop would function as the capture arm of Wzy; this would serve to “catch” incoming negatively charged O-Ag subunits (Fig. 4B), allowing for subsequent transfer to the retention site (Fig. 4C). The need for a consistent molecular framework with which to constantly recruit new O-Ag subunits is also reflected in the lack of variability in the tertiary structure modeling output based on PL3 amino acid sequence (supplemental Fig. S2A). Consequently, by virtue of its net-positive charge (Fig. 1) and important Arg residues (Figs. 2A and 3), this arm would provide sufficiently high capacity for Wzy to bind the negatively charged O-Ag subunits, as without initial recruitment (Fig. 4B), the subsequent polymerization reaction could not occur. PL5, containing its own functionally important RX10G tract but with its more negatively charged local environment, would provide a tertiary structure motif conducive to a relatively transient interaction with an O-Ag subunit, capable of constant breakage and reformation. As such, PL5 would be a more likely candidate for the retention arm of Wzy, serving as a site required for constant binding and “release” of the growing O-Ag chain (Fig. 4, C and D), thus performing a more catalytic role. In this manner, we propose that the polymerized chain linked to UndPP would remain at the retention site (Fig. 4A) until the addition of a new UndPP-linked subunit from the recruitment arm was catalyzed (Fig. 4, B and C). This would result in loss of the UndPP formerly anchoring the growing chain at the retention site (Fig. 4D). Moreover, this would be more thermodynamically favorable as it would preclude the need for the back-and-forth-and-back-again transfer of the growing chain (with loss of the UndPP) from the retention site to the recruitment site and then back again to the retention site for each new subunit addition, as suggested by the concept developed by Bastin et al. (31Bastin D.A. Stevenson G. Brown P.K. Haase A. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The demonstrated essential nature of the Arg290 and Arg291 side chains to the function of Wzy (Figs. 2B and 3), as well as their negatively charged local environment (Fig. 1), support the proposed release mechanism for PL5 with respect to its interaction with O-Ag subunits (Fig. 4C). This dynamic potential is also reflected in the more varied relative helix positions possible for the tertiary structure models of PL5 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Furthermore, PL5, which is located toward the latter half of the protein, is larger than PL3 (supplemental Fig. S1), and contains a GX3G (GASRight) helix-packing motif (29Walters R.F. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in the downstream TMS; these are all analogous situations to the principal PL of WaaL from P. aeruginosa PAO1 required for transfer of O-Ag from UndPP to the core sugar acceptor linked to lipid A (10Islam S.T. Taylor V.L. Qi M. Lam J.S. mBio. 2010; 1 (e00189-10)Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As polymerization of the O-Ag chain continues, the O-Ag becomes associated with either Wzz1 or Wzz2, the chain-length regulator proteins in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (7Daniels C. Griffiths C. Cowles B. Lam J.S. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This association appears to stabilize the interaction of the growing O-Ag chain with Wzy as removal of Wzz1 and Wzz2 function results in a complete loss of higher molecular weight B-band LPS and instead yields lower molecular weight banding patterns, indicative of significantly shorter lengths of heteropolymeric O-Ag chains ligated to lipid A-core (7Daniels C. Griffiths C. Cowles B. Lam J.S. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this investigation is the first to characterize Wzy polymerase function within the context of a rigorously validated and experimentally defined topological model of the protein. Considering the above mentioned results, taken together with the unbiased topology map for Wzy, the charge differences and functional importance of PL3 and PL5 would support a putative catch-and-release mechanism for the polymerization of O-Ag subunits, with both arms playing separate yet integral roles in the O-Ag assembly process.

https://openalex.org/W1989619965,"Aggregation of Tau into amyloid-like fibrils is a key process in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer. To understand how natively disordered Tau stabilizes conformations that favor pathological aggregation, we applied single-molecule force spectroscopy. Intramolecular interactions that fold polypeptide stretches of ~19 and ~42 amino acids in the functionally important repeat domain of full-length human Tau (hTau40) support aggregation. In contrast, the unstructured N terminus randomly folds long polypeptide stretches >100 amino acids that prevent aggregation. The pro-aggregant mutant hTau40ΔK280 observed in frontotemporal dementia favored the folding of short polypeptide stretches and suppressed the folding of long ones. This trend was reversed in the anti-aggregant mutant hTau40ΔK280/PP. The aggregation inducer heparin introduced strong interactions in hTau40 and hTau40ΔK280 that stabilized aggregation-prone conformations. We show that the conformation and aggregation of Tau are regulated through a complex balance of different intra- and intermolecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2077775580,"O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr), produced by the Sir2-catalyzed NAD(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylase reaction, regulates diverse biological processes. Interconversion between two OAADPr isomers with acetyl attached to the C-2″ and C-3″ hydroxyl of ADP-ribose (ADPr) is rapid. We reported earlier that ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3), one of three ARH proteins sharing structural similarities, hydrolyzed OAADPr to ADPr and acetate, and poly(ADPr) to ADPr monomers. ARH1 also hydrolyzed OAADPr and poly(ADPr) as well as ADP-ribose-arginine, with arginine in α-anomeric linkage to C-1″ of ADP-ribose. Because both ARH3- and ARH1-catalyzed reactions involve nucleophilic attacks at the C-1″ position, it was perplexing that the ARH3 catalytic site would cleave OAADPr at either the 2″- or 3″-position, and we postulated the existence of a third isomer, 1″-OAADPr, in equilibrium with 2″- and 3″-isomers. A third isomer, consistent with 1″-OAADPr, was identified at pH 9.0. Further, ARH3 OAADPr hydrolase activity was greater at pH 9.0 than at neutral pH where 3″-OAADPr predominated. Consistent with our hypothesis, IC(50) values for ARH3 inhibition by 2″- and 3″-N-acetyl-ADPr analogs of OAADPr were significantly higher than that for ADPr. ARH1 also hydrolyzed OAADPr more rapidly at alkaline pH, but cleavage of ADP-ribose-arginine was faster at neutral pH than pH 9.0. ARH3-catalyzed hydrolysis of OAADPr in H(2)(18)O resulted in incorporation of one (18)O into ADP-ribose by mass spectrometric analysis, consistent with cleavage at the C-1″ position. Together, these data suggest that ARH family members, ARH1 and ARH3, catalyze hydrolysis of the 1″-O linkage in their structurally diverse substrates."

Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gélinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The common shortcoming of the current strategies to disrupt latent infection is their adherence to well known mechanisms of latent HIV reactivation (such as histone remodeling and NF-κB activation) and low-to-medium throughput testing of agents available for research studies (26Yang H.C. Xing S. Shan L. O'Connell K. Dinoso J. Shen A. Zhou Y. Shrum C.K. Han Y. Liu J.O. Zhang H. Margolick J.B. Siliciano R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3473-3486PubMed Google Scholar). It is more efficient to perform a high-throughput screen (HTS) of available large chemical libraries to discover novel agents capable of reactivating latent HIV infection. To discover novel HIV latency activators, we developed a robust cell-based assay adaptable to HTS (27Micheva-Viteva S. Pacchia A.L. Ron Y. Peltz S.W. Dougherty J.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 5185-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the optimization and utilization of our latency model in an HTS of a library of small molecules that led to identification of compounds capable of reactivating latent HIV-1. In addition, we present data demonstrating that one of the reactivating compounds requires NFAT activity for early gene expression while affecting RNA stability. 24STNLSG, SupT1, ACH-2, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (HyClone), 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 mm glutamine. TNFα was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). VA and trichostatin A were purchased from Sigma. HIV-1 p24 Gag protein ELISA kits were purchased from ZeptoMetrix (Buffalo, NY). SEAP detection kits were purchased from BD Biosciences. SEAP readings were performed using a ViewLux CCD imager (10-s read time), and the plates were imaged to quantify signal output. RNA polymerase II antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and NFAT1 antibody, c-Jun antibody, and NFκB p65 antibody were purchased from Abcam. VIVIT and FK506 were purchased from EMD4biosciences and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. The ActivityBase software package (IDBS, Guildford, Surrey, UK) was used to manage HTS data. After completion of a daily screen, data were automatically uploaded into Oracle through ActivityBase protocols that convert the raw data into percentage of activation. Templates were designed for each screen to calculate the activation value for the standard control activator (TNFα) and the Z-factor for each plate. Thus, the reliability of the data was assessed immediately and compared from plate-to-plate and day-to-day. A full statistical analysis was conducted with the final set of data utilizing the software packages from Spotfire (28Ahlberg C. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Pipeline Pilot (SciTegic, San Diego, CA) to determine the fitness and the level of statistical significance of the assay. HTS “hits” with statistically significant activity were considered those that produced an activation signal three standard deviations or greater from the mean of the assay run. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the percentage of GFP-expressing cells after compound treatment. A total of 1 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To analyze the efficiency of quiescent CD4+ T cell enrichment, 1 × 105 cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 2 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-CD4+ antibodies (CD4+-FITC) and 4 μl of phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-HLA-DR (HLA/DR-PE) antibodies or 4 μl of CD69-PE. Stained cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan (Becton Dickinson) equipped with CellQuest Pro (Macintosh, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay was performed using the Great EscAPe SEAP chemiluminescence detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative light units were measured with an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (DYNEX Technologies). Resting CD4+ T cells were purified by first isolating PBMCs on a Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) gradient. CD4+ T cells were then isolated by negative selection using Dynabeads® UntouchedTM human CD4+ T cells (Invitrogen) antibody-coated magnetic beads. Activated CD4+ T cells were removed using CD25 and HLA-DR microbeads (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Recovered cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. Virus was generated by transfecting 293T cells with transducing plasmid, NLRlucRFP, an HIV-1-based vector containing Renilla luciferase (rluc) and red fluorescent protein (rfp) expression cassettes, pCMV-ΔR8.2 packing vector, and HXB2 expression vector pCMS-IVS-HXB2 by CaPO4 precipitation (16Edelstein L.C.

Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3934) Google Scholar). At 48–72 h after transfection, viral supernatants were filtered and then supplemented with PEG-it (Systems Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and refrigerated overnight. The viral supernatants were concentrated 100-fold and added to the resting CD4+ T cells, which were then centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 2 h. Three days after infection, cells were treated as indicated for 24 h. Finally, total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). rfp mRNA levels were quantified using a one-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), normalized to β-actin. No-template and no-RT qRT-PCR controls were also performed. DNA synthesis, measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation 72 h after compound treatment, was used to assess cell proliferation. PBMCs (2 × 105) were incubated for 8 h with [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml) and harvested onto glass fiber filters. Thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Cellular toxicity was determined using Cell Titer GloR reagent (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative light units were measured with MLX microtiter plate luminometer (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Additionally, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined via flow cytometric analysis of cells using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, APO-AF (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. SupT1 or THP-1 nuclear extracts (40 μg) were incubated with 1 mm HDAC assay substrate (HDAC assay kit, colorimetric detection, Upstate Biotech Millipore, Temecula, CA) in the absence or presence of 1 μm trichostatin A, 1 mm VA, or 10 μm AV6. Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 untreated or treated cells using the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was subsequently treated with RQ1 DNase kit (Promega) to remove any traces of DNA. Two-step qRT-PCR was performed for relative quantification of viral RNA. cDNA was synthesized with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents and oligo(dT)16 following the protocol supplied by Applied Biosystems (Roche Applied Science). qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR master mix and run in a DNA Engine Opticon 2 (MJ Research) detector with Opticon Monitor Analysis software, version 1.4. The following primers were used in the qRT-PCR reactions: EEF1A1, forward, (5′-TAGCTGGATCCGCTGACTTT-3′) and EEF1A1, reverse, (5′-AACAGTACTTGCCCGTGTCC-3′); β-actin, forward, (5′-CTGGAACGGTGAAGGTGACA-3′) and β-actin, reverse, (5′-AAGGGACTTCCTGTAACAATGCA-3′); total HIV1 RNA, forward, (5′-CTGACCTTTGGATGGTGCTA-3′) and total HIV1 RNA, reverse, (5′-TGAAATGCTAGGCGGCTGTC-3′); Tat, forward, (5′-CGAAGAGCTCATCAGAACAGTCA-3′) and Tat, reverse, (5′-CTTCCTCATTGATGGTCTC-3′); Gag, forward, (5′-CGACCAGGACTCGGC-3′) and Gag, reverse, (5′-CTTCCTCATTGATGGTCTC-3′). For each primer set, amplification efficiencies were determined by obtaining a standard curve with 2-fold serial dilutions of cDNA. A dissociation curve was generated for each primer pair to confirm amplification of a single product. The sizes of the amplified products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the specificity of the products was confirmed by sequencing. Reactions were completed in duplicate, and no-template and no-reverse transcriptase controls were included for each primer pair. qRT-PCR to measure viral mRNA levels in Fig. 4D was performed using tat-specific primers (5′-GCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTCTATTCCTTCGGGCCTGT-3′). Two hours after treating 5 × 106 J-lat 9.2 cells with AV6 plus or minus inhibitors, total RNA was isolated from each sample followed by qRT-PCR using a combination of the SuperScript® VILOTM cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and Maxima® SYBR Green (Fermentas). Data were normalized to Ct values obtained from the same samples utilizing β-globin gene primers (5′-CCCTTGGACCCAGAGGTTCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGCACTTTCTTGCCATGA-3′). All the data are averages from three independent samples. For each sample, 5 × 106 J-lat 9.2 cells were treated employing the Abcam cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation (X-ChIP) protocol with slight modification. Briefly, after 6 min of sonication, cell lysates were treated with antibody for NFAT1, c-Jun, RNA polymerase II, or NFκB p65 overnight. Following immunoprecipitation with G-protein agarose beads and washing, chromatin was isolated and reverse-cross-linked with proteinase K overnight. The chromatin was then purified with phenol-chloroform followed by precipitation of DNA fragments with ethanol. Isolate was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using primers (5′-CCGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAA-3′ and 5′-GTCGAGAGATCTCCTCTGGCTTTACT-3) and a probe (5′-/6FAM/TTCGCTTTCAAGTCCCTGTTCGG/Iowa Black FQ/-3′) corresponding to the LTR U5 region. All data were normalized to Ct values obtained from the same samples utilizing β-globin gene primers (5′-CCCTTGGACCCAGAGGTTCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGCACTTTCTTGCCATGA-3′). Each data point represents an average from three separate samples. We previously established a human CD4+ T cell latency model in which the lymphoid cell lines harbor a single copy of a latent HIV-1 provirus containing two marker genes that can be used for screening (27Micheva-Viteva S. Pacchia A.L. Ron Y. Peltz S.W. Dougherty J.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 5185-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The marker gene secretable alkaline phosphatase (seap) provides a highly sensitive chemiluminescent assay amenable for HTS and, given its position in the viral genome, serves as an indicator of late gene expression (Fig. 1A). These cells, designated 24STNLSG, have a low background of SEAP activity and a high degree of inducibility, which provided excellent assay reliability in a 96-well format as reflected by the Z-factor value (27Micheva-Viteva S. Pacchia A.L. Ron Y. Peltz S.W. Dougherty J.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 5185-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Z-factor is a commonly used measurement of assay performance and reliability, and a score between 0.5 and 1.0 is an indication of an excellent assay. We used the 24STNLSG cell line to establish optimal conditions for latent HIV-1 activation in a 384-well format and obtained a Z-factor of 0.7 when TNFα was used as an activator (Fig. 1B). The excellent assay reliability proved that the system could be utilized in HTS of a small molecule library to identify HIV-1 latency activators. Initially, a validation screening was performed to test the latency system in an HTS format run against a representative set of 3,300 compounds. During the validation screen, 10 plates were tested where each plate carried 64 wells dedicated to negative (0.5% DMSO-treated) and positive (TNFα-induced) controls, with the latter in serial dilution. The screening was carried out at 7.5 μm for each compound, and the SEAP activity was measured 24 h after treatment and resulted in three hits. The low hit rate is not unexpected for HTS to identify activators where usually the highly cytotoxic compounds that contribute to the false positive hits in inhibition assays are eliminated. Another reason for the low hit rate from the HIV-1 latency validation screen could be the short time of compound exposure, which selected only for the strongest and fastest acting inducers of late viral gene expression. Identification of three compounds from the validation screen that could reactivate the latent provirus demonstrated that the system could be scaled up for full HTS. Therefore, HTS was carried out using a chemical library of 200,000 compounds. This chemical library is an accurate reflection of the chemical diversity that is obtainable, and each individual compound in the screening library has at least 25 structurally related “neighbors” that, although not in the library, may also be acquired and examined in hit follow-up. The compounds ultimately chosen for inclusion into the library have also been evaluated to reduce redundancy of scaffold types while permitting rapid analog identification, have been prescreened for pharmacological potential through the elimination of known toxophoric moieties, and have been reviewed to ensure that the collection possessed many of the favorable characteristics of known orally active drugs. The screening process was similar to that of the validation assay, but the compound exposure was extended to 48 h. Fig. 1C represents the varied intensity of SEAP induction by some of the primary hits. HTS hits with statistically significant activity were defined as those compounds that increased reporter gene expression three standard deviations or more from the mean of the assay run. Generally, the cutoff that was used for up-regulation of gene expression was about 2-fold. With a 5-fold cutoff from the mean value of the no-compound controls, a total of 172 primary hits were identified, resulting in a hit rate of ∼0.1%. The primary hits were tested again in a 384-well format assay in a two-point dose response in duplicate. A total of 27 hits were reconfirmed to induce SEAP activity in 24STNLSG cells with a 2-fold cutoff above the background signal. Among those hit compounds, some demonstrated a higher selective index (CC50/EC50), and those reaching 25 hits will be used in consequent steps of chemical modifications aimed at improved pharmacokinetics. The compound designated AV6 consistently induced HIV-1 production from latently infected cell lines and was chosen from the pool of confirmed HTS hits for more detailed analysis (Fig. 2A). AV6 is a 4-3′,4′-dichloroanilino-6-methoxyquinoline compound. In 24STNLSG cells, AV6 produced dose-dependent activation of latent provirus with maximum induction at 12 μm and activity decreasing at higher concentrations, probably due to increasing cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Although significantly less potent than TNFα, AV6 achieved a maximal level of induction that was 2–3-fold greater than that produced by optimal concentrations of the HDAC inhibitor VA. This effect was manifested both in 24STNLSG cells and in the ACH-2 model of latency, the latter harboring a replication-competent provirus (31Duh E.J. Maury W.J. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Rabson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 5974-5978Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). A quantitative analysis of virus reactivation by AV6 was performed, monitoring GFP production via flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2D, the compound was equally efficient at virus activation in two different SupT1-derived clonal cell lines each harboring latent NE−S-G virus integrated at different genomic locations (27Micheva-Viteva S. Pacchia A.L. Ron Y. Peltz S.W. Dougherty J.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 5185-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that activation was independent of the site of provirus integration (Figs. 1A and 2D). Taken together, the results obtained from our studies show that AV6 reproducibly acts as an HIV-1 latency antagonist in different model systems. To assay the efficacy of AV6 in primary, infected cells, we utilized resting primary CD4+ T cells infected with the NLRlucRFP, an HIV-1-based vector that contains expression cassettes for Renilla luciferase (rluc) and red fluorescent protein (rfp) (16Edelstein L.C. Micheva-Viteva S. Phelan B.D. Dougherty J.P. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2009; 25: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This latency system allows one to monitor activation of latent virus using autologous, relevant primary cells. Although researchers do employ patient samples, when doing so, MHC mismatched CD4+ T cells are typically added to the cultures to allow expansion of the virus, so it is unclear whether allogeneic reactivity might contribute to virus activation. Viral particles enveloped with the CXCR4-tropic envelope integrate into the genomes of resting CD4+ T cells and result in a latent infection, as early as 3 days after infection, which can be reactivated by various stimuli including IL-7 and CD3/CD28 stimulation (32Agosto L.M.

PBMCs from whole blood were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and then subjected to negative selection to isolate resting CD4+ T cells. The cells were mixed with viral supernatant containing PEG-concentrated NLRlucRFP vector virus, displaying the CXCR4-tropic envelope of the HXB2 strain, and spinoculated for 2 h. Three days after infection, the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα or AV6 at concentrations of 4 or 8 μm for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, and the level of rfp RNA was measured by qRT-PCR. The levels of rfp expression in untreated mock-infected cells and untreated NLRlucRFP-infected cells were comparable, showing that the population of resting CD4+ T cells harbors latent virus (Fig. 3A). Comparing the level of rfp mRNA in TNFα- or 8 μm AV6-treated cells with untreated cells revealed approximately a 250- and a 100-fold induction of viral expression, respectively (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that AV6 activates latent virus in primary cells of a relevant cell type. It has been reported that T cell proliferation simultaneously induces latent HIV (4Finzi D. Hermankova M.

https://openalex.org/W2006157977,"COPI (coat protein I) and the clathrin-AP-2 (adaptor protein 2) complex are well-characterized coat proteins, but a component that is common to these two coats has not been identified. The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), ARFGAP1, is a known component of the COPI complex. Here, we show that distinct regions of ARFGAP1 interact with AP-2 and coatomer (components of the COPI complex). Selectively disrupting the interaction of ARFGAP1 with either of these two coat proteins leads to selective inhibition in the corresponding transport pathway. The role of ARFGAP1 in AP-2-regulated endocytosis has mechanistic parallels with its roles in COPI transport, as both its GAP activity and coat function contribute to promoting AP-2 transport."
https://openalex.org/W2010046121,"Photoreactive derivatives of the general anesthetic etomidate have been developed to identify their binding sites in γ-aminobutyric acid, type A and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. One such drug, [3H]TDBzl-etomidate (4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzyl-[3H]1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate), acts as a positive allosteric potentiator of Torpedo nACh receptor (nAChR) and binds to a novel site in the transmembrane domain at the γ-α subunit interface. To extend our understanding of the locations of allosteric modulator binding sites in the nAChR, we now characterize the interactions of a second aryl diazirine etomidate derivative, TFD-etomidate (ethyl-1-(1-(4-(3-trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate). TFD-etomidate inhibited acetylcholine-induced currents with an IC50 = 4 μm, whereas it inhibited the binding of [3H]phencyclidine to the Torpedo nAChR ion channel in the resting and desensitized states with IC50 values of 2.5 and 0.7 mm, respectively. Similar to [3H]TDBzl-etomidate, [3H]TFD-etomidate bound to a site at the γ-α subunit interface, photolabeling αM2-10 (αSer-252) and γMet-295 and γMet-299 within γM3, and to a site in the ion channel, photolabeling amino acids within each subunit M2 helix that line the lumen of the ion channel. In addition, [3H]TFD-etomidate photolabeled in an agonist-dependent manner amino acids within the δ subunit M2-M3 loop (δIle-288) and the δ subunit transmembrane helix bundle (δPhe-232 and δCys-236 within δM1). The fact that TFD-etomidate does not compete with ion channel blockers at concentrations that inhibit acetylcholine responses indicates that binding to sites at the γ-α subunit interface and/or within δ subunit helix bundle mediates the TFD-etomidate inhibitory effect. These results also suggest that the γ-α subunit interface is a binding site for Torpedo nAChR negative allosteric modulators (TFD-etomidate) and for positive modulators (TDBzl-etomidate).

The Torpedo nAChR is composed of four homologous subunits (α2βγδ) that assemble around an axis perpendicular to the membrane, forming a cation-conducting channel. Each subunit is made up of three structural domains; that is, an N-terminal extracellular domain, with the two ACh binding sites at the interfaces between the α-γ and α-δ subunits (8Corringer P.J. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), a transmembrane domain made up of a loose bundle of four transmembrane helices (M1-M4), and a cytoplasmic domain between the M3 and M4 helices (M3-M4 loop). Amino acids on one face of each M2 helix form the lining of the ion channel, and the M1, M3, and M4 helices form an outer ring that is in contact with membrane lipids (4Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Muscle or neuronal nAChRs are targets for drugs potentially useful for treatment of myasthenia gravis and CNS disorders, including nicotine addiction, Alzheimer disease, and schizophrenia (10Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In an attempt to develop drugs with strong selectivity for subtypes of muscle or neuronal nAChRs, screens of natural products and synthetic libraries have identified many drugs that act either as positive or negative allosteric modulators (11Romanelli M.N. Gratteri P. Guandalini L. Martini E. Bonaccini C. Gualtieri F. Chem. Med. Chem. 2007; 2: 746-767Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Arias H.R. Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2010; 80: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, there is limited information about the diversity of allosteric modulator binding sites or whether positive and negative modulators can bind to the same site, as occurs, for example, at the benzodiazepine site in the GABAAR (13Sigel E. Med. Chem. Rev. 2005; 2: 251-256Google Scholar). In addition to binding sites for non-competitive antagonists within the ion channel (14Arias H.R. Bhumireddy P. Bouzat C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1254-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the transmembrane domain contains potential drug binding sites within each subunit helix bundle and at the interfaces between subunits. Several uncharged, hydrophobic nAChR inhibitors bind in a state-dependent manner within the δ subunit helix bundle (15Arevalo E. Chiara D.C. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Biol.

Studies with photoreactive analogs of the general anesthetic etomidate (Fig. 1) led to the identification of binding sites within the transmembrane domain for negative ([3H]azietomidate) and positive ([3H]TDBzl-etomidate) allosteric nAChR modulators (17Husain S.S.

Trifluoromethyldiazirinyl-etomidate (TFD-etomidate), another etomidate derivative, has a general anesthetic potency similar to etomidate but lower efficacy as a positive modulator of GABAAR responses while producing, at anesthetic concentrations, significant inhibition of the Torpedo nAChR and the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor (21Husain S.S. Stewart D. Desai R. Hamouda A.K. Li S.G. Kelly E. Dostalova Z. Zhou X. Cotten J.F. Raines D.E. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. Forman S.A. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2010; 53: 6432-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TFD-etomidate contains the same photoreactive 3-trifluoromethyl-3- phenyl diazirine group as TDBzl-etomidate, which can react with most amino acid side chains (22Sigrist H. Mühlemann M. Dolder M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1990; 7: 277-287Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this report we characterize the interactions of TFD-etomidate with the Torpedo nAChR by use of radioligand binding assays and by direct identification of the nAChR amino acids photolabeled by [3H]TFD-etomidate. Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes were isolated from Torpedo californica electric organs (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA) as described previously (23Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Racemic ethyl 1-(1-(4-(3-((trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate (p-trifluoromethyldiazirinyl-etomidate (TFD-etomidate)) and [3H]TFD-etomidate (40 Ci/mmol) were synthesized as described (21Husain S.S. Stewart D. Desai R. Hamouda A.K. Li S.G. Kelly E. Dostalova Z. Zhou X. Cotten J.F. Raines D.E. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. Forman S.A. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2010; 53: 6432-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). [3H]Phencyclidine ([3H]PCP; 27 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]tetracaine (30 Ci/mmol) was from Sibtech (Newington, CT). [3H]ACh (1.9 Ci/mmol) was synthesized from choline and [3H]acetic anhydride. Staphylococcus aureus glutamyl endopeptidase Glu-C (V8 protease) was from MP Biomedical (Solon, OH), and endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C) was from Roche Diagnostics. l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington Biomedical (Freehold, NJ). Effects of TFD-etomidate on the equilibrium binding of [3H]PCP, [3H]tetracaine, and [3H]ACh to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes were determined using a centrifugation assay. TFD-etomidate was prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in methanol and diluted to final concentrations in Torpedo physiological saline (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). For [3H]PCP and [3H]tetracaine binding, nAChR-rich membranes at 0.7 mg of protein/ml (0.8 μm ACh binding sites) in 200 μl of Torpedo physiological saline were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with [3H]PCP (6 nm) or [3H]tetracaine (9 nm) in the absence or presence of the agonist carbamylcholine (Carb) and in the absence or presence of TFD-etomidate. For [3H]ACh, membrane suspensions (1 ml, 0.25 mg of protein/ml, 40 nm ACh binding sites) were pretreated with 0.5 mm diisopropyl-phosphofluoridate to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, then incubated for 1 h with [3H]ACh (15 nm) in the absence or presence of TFD-etomidate. Bound and free 3H were separated by centrifugation (18,000 × g for 1 h) and then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The nonspecific binding of [3H]ACh, [3H]tetracaine, or [3H]PCP to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes was determined in the presence of 1 mm Carb, tetracaine, or proadifen, respectively. The concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]PCP or [3H]tetracaine binding by TFD-etomidate was fit using a single site model f(x) = {f0/(1 + (x/IC50))} + fns, where f(x) is binding in the presence of TFD-etomidate at concentration x, f0 is specific binding in the absence of TFD-etomidate, fns is nonspecific binding, and IC50 is the concentration of competitor that inhibits the specific binding by 50%. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques were used to characterize the effects of TFD-etomidate and etomidate on wild type Torpedo nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Stage V and VI oocytes were obtained from anesthetized adult Xenopus frogs in accordance with local and federal guidelines for animal care. Torpedo nAChR was expressed as described (24Sullivan D.A. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12651-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with ∼25 ng of total subunit mRNA at a ratio of 2α:1β:1γ:1δ and used 24–72 h after injection. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −50 mV (Warner Instrument Oocyte Clamp OC-725C) and perfused continually at ∼2 ml/min with ND96 (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). Oocytes were exposed to ACh alone or to ACh and inhibitor for 20 s, and oocytes were washed for ∼3 min between each application. Data were collected using a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using Clampex/Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instruments). TFD-etomidate was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mm, with the final concentration of DMSO at <0.05% at the highest TFD-etomidate concentration used. Etomidate (IV grade) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was obtained from Ben Venue Laboratories, Bedford, OH. Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes at 2 mg of protein/ml in Torpedo physiological saline supplemented with 1 mm oxidized glutathione were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with 1 μm [3H]TFD-etomidate in the absence or presence of other drugs. For photolabeling on an analytical or preparative scale, 75-μl (150 pmol of ACh binding sites in a 96-well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plate) or 5-ml aliquots (15 nmol of ACh sites in 5-cm plastic Petri dishes) were irradiated on ice with a 365-nm UV lamp (Model EN-16, Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NJ) for 30 min at a distance of less than 2 cm. Electrophoresis sample buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCL, 2% SDS, 8% sucrose, 1% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) was added to samples photolabeled on an analytical scale, and the polypeptides were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 0.33% bisacrylamide gels. [3H]TFD-etomidate photoincorporation into the membrane polypeptides was visualized by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare) using Eastman Kodak Co. BIOMAX XAR film (exposure for 4–6 weeks at −80 °C), and 3H incorporation into individual polypeptide bands was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of excised gel bands (23Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For experiments on the preparative scale, the photolabeled membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (18,000 × g for 1 h) and then resuspended in sample buffer for electrophoresis. The β, γ, and δ subunits were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gels and recovered by passive elution, concentrated to a final volume of 300 μl by centrifugal filtration (Vivaspin 15 mr 5000 concentrators; Vivascience, Stonehouse, UK), and then acetone-precipitated (75% acetone at −20 °C overnight) and resuspended in digestion buffer (15 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.1). The band containing the nAChR α subunit was excised from the stained gel, soaked in overlay buffer (5% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-HCL, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8) for 30 min, and then transferred to the wells of a 15% acrylamide mapping gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with 100 μg of V8 protease to generate fragments of 20 kDa (αV8-20), 18 kDa (αV8-18), and 10 kDa (αV8-10) (25White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the α subunit fragments, visualized by staining with GelCode Blue (Pierce), were recovered from the gel bands and resuspended in digestion buffer as described above. αV8-20 (∼30 μg) and the δ subunits (∼150 μg) were digested with EndoLys-C (0.5–1 units) for 2 weeks at room temperature. Aliquots of αV8-10 (30 μg) and β subunit (∼150 μg) were diluted with 0.5% Genapol in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.1, to reduce SDS concentration (<0.02%) and then digested with trypsin (1:1 protein to enzyme ratio) in the presence of 0.4 mm CaCl2 for 12 h (β subunit) or for 2 days (αV8-10). The proteolytic digests of αV8-20 and αV8-10 as well as intact αV8-18 were then fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (rpHPLC). The trypsin digest of β subunit and the EndoLys-C digest of δ subunit were fractionated on small pore (16.5% T, 6% C) Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). For the β subunit digest, fragments beginning near the N termini of βM2 and βM4 were isolated for sequence analysis by rpHPLC from material eluted from gel bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼10 and ∼7 kDa, respectively (27White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the δ subunit digests, fragments beginning near the N termini of δM1 and δM2 were isolated by rpHPLC from material migrating with a apparent molecular mass of 10–14 kDa (16Garcia 3rd, G. Chiara D.C. Nirthanan S. Hamouda A.K. Stewart D.S. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10296-10307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To examine [3H]TFD-etomidate photoincorporation within subunit M2-M3 loops and M3 segments, aliquots (∼150 μg) of β, γ, and δ subunits were digested overnight with V8 protease (200 μg). The digests were fractionated by rpHPLC, and the hydrophobic peaks of 3H were pooled and sequenced as described below. rpHPLC was performed on an HP 1100 binary system using a Brownlee Aquapore BU-300 column (70 μm, 100 × 2.1 mm; PerkinElmer #0711-0064) and Brownlee Newguard RP-2 guard column at 40 °C. Solvent A was composed of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, and solvent B was 0.05% TFA in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol. A nonlinear elution gradient at 0.2 ml/min was employed (25% to 100% solvent B in 100 min), and fractions were collected every 2.5 min. The elution of peptides was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm, and the elution of 3H associated was monitored by liquid scintillation counting of a 10% aliquot. For sequence analysis, rpHPLC fractions containing the αM4 and δM1 segments were loaded onto PVDF filters using Prosorb® sample preparation cartridges (Applied Biosystems #401950) as recommended by the manufacturer. All other samples were drop-loaded onto Micro TFA filters (Applied Biosystems #401111) at 45 °C, with the filters treated with Biobrene after sample loading. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems PROCISETM 492 protein sequencer. For each cycle of Edman degradation, ⅙ was used for amino acid identification/quantification, and ⅚ was used for 3H counting. The mass of amino acid detected was quantified from its peak height then fit (shown as a dotted line in FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9) using SigmaPlot 11 to the equation f(x) = I0Rx, where I0 was the initial amount of the peptide sequenced (in pmol), R was the repetitive yield, and f(x) was the pmol detected in cycle x. Amino acids Ser, His, Trp, and Cys were excluded from the fits due to known inaccuracies in their quantification. Photolabeling efficiency in cpm/pmol at a specific residue was calculated by (cpmx − cpm(x − 1)/5IoRx.FIGURE 6[3H]TFD-etomidate photolabels amino acids in γM3 (γMet-295 and γMet-299) but not in βM3 or δM3. Shown are 3H (○,▿) and PTH-amino acids (□, ◊) released during sequencing through the M2-M3 loop and M3 helix of the nAChR γ (A), δ (B), and β (C) subunits isolated from nAChRs from the photolabeling of Fig. 5 in the absence (○, □) or presence (▿, ◊) of tetracaine. The major 3H peaks from rpHPLC fractionations of V8 protease digests of γ, δ, and β subunits (supplemental Fig. S4) were sequenced with OPA treatment at cycle 6 of Edman degradation (indicated by an arrow), which prevents further sequencing of peptides not containing a proline at this cycle and chemically isolates the subunit fragments beginning at γThr-276, δThr-281, and βThr-273, respectively. A, after treatment with OPA, sequencing continued for the fragment beginning at γThr-276 (I0 = 26 and 20 pmol; -and +Tet) and for the equivalent, contaminating δ subunit fragment, (δThr-281; I0 ∼3 pmol). In the cycles before OPA treatment, sequences were also present beginning at γIle-209 and γAsn-439 (each at ∼ 20 pmol), with OPA reducing those levels by >95%. The peaks of 3H release in cycles 20 and 24 indicated photolabeling of γMet-295 (7 cpm/pmol) and γMet-299 (5 cpm/pmol) in the absence and presence of tetracaine. B, after OPA treatment in cycle 6, the primary sequence began at δThr-281 (−Tet, I0 = 30 pmol) is shown. Based upon the levels of 3H release, photolabeling of any amino acid, if it occurred, was at <0.5 cpm/pmol. C, after OPA treatment, sequencing continued for fragments beginning at βThr-273 (□) and the contaminating fragment beginning at δ-Thr281 (8 pmol each). Photolabeling of any amino acids in βM3, if it occurred, would be at <0.5 cpm/pmol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Agonist-enhanced [3H]TFD-etomidate photolabeling within αM2, βM2, and δM2. 3H (○, ●) and PTH-amino acids (□, ■) released during sequence analysis of nAChR subunit fragments beginning at the N termini of αM2 (A), βM2 (B), and δM2 (C) isolated from nAChRs photolabeled on a preparative scale with 0. 8 μm [3H]TFD-etomidate in the absence (○, □) or presence (●, ■) of 1 mm Carb. Tricine-PAGE and rpHPLC fractionations of the subunit digests are shown in supplemental Fig. S1B, S2, B and D, and S3, B and D.

Shown are 3H (○, ●) and PTH-amino acids (□, ■) released during sequencing of subunit fragments from the photolabeling experiment of Fig. 7 of nAChRs in the absence (○, □) or presence (●, ■) of 1 mm Carb. A and B, photoincorporation within the M2-M3 loop and M3 helix was determined, as in Fig. 6, by sequence analysis of the major peaks of 3H recovered when V8 protease digests of γ (A) and δ (B) subunits were fractionated by rpHPLC with OPA treatment at cycle 6 of Edman degradation (indicated by arrow). A, after treatment with OPA in cycle 6, sequencing continued for the fragment beginning at γThr-276 (I0 = 12 (□) and 16 (■) pmol), with the equivalent, contaminating δ subunit fragment (δThr-281, I0 ∼ 4 pmol, both conditions) as a secondary sequence. The peaks of 3H release in cycles 20 and 24 indicated photolabeling (−Carb/+Carb, in cpm/pmol) of γMet-295 (11/6) and γMet-299 (7/4). B, after treatment with OPA in cycle 6, sequencing continued for the fragment beginning at δThr-281 (I0 = 17 (□) and 23 (■) pmol). The major peak of 3H release in cycle 8, seen only in the +Carb sample, indicated agonist-induced labeling of δIle-288 (+Carb, 3.7 cpm/pmol) in the δM2-M3 loop. C, the fragment beginning at δPhe-206 (□, -Carb, 25 pmol; ■, +Carb, 23 pmol), containing the δM1 helix was isolated by Tricine SDS-PAGE and rpHPLC from EndoLys-C digests of δ subunits (from an experiment with nAChRs photolabeled at 0.4 μm [3H]TFD-etomidate). The fragment beginning at δPhe-206 was recovered by rpHPLC from the same 10/14-kDa gel band as the δM2 fragment, with the δPhe-206 and δMet-257 fragments eluting at ∼50 and 70% organic, respectively (supplemental Fig. 3, C and D). Because the fragment beginning at δPhe-206 contains a proline at cycle 20, the sequencing filter was treated with OPA at cycle 20 to ensure that any 3H release after this cycle originated from the δM1 helix. The peaks of 3H release in cycles 27 and 31 in the +Carb sample indicated agonist-induced labeling of δPhe-232 and δCys-236 at 0.5 cpm/pmol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9Agonist-insensitive [3H]TFD-etomidate photolabeling in αM4 (top) and βM4 (bottom).

The peaks of 3H release in cycles 13 and 15 indicated photolabeling labeling (−Carb/+Carb, in cpm/pmol) of αCys-412 (35/30) and αMet-415 (11/6) at the lipid-exposed face of αM4. Bottom, the fragment beginning at βAsp-427 (□, −Carb, 3.5 pmol; ■, +Carb, 1.8 pmol) containing the βM4 helix (indicated by the bar), was isolated by rpHPLC fractionation of polypeptides eluted from a gel band with apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa from a Tricine SDS-PAGE fractionation of trypsin digests of the β subunit. Each sample also contained the fragment beginning at βLys-216 before βM1 (3 pmol each condition). The 3H release at cycle 15 indicated photolabeling of βTyr-441(−Carb/+Carb, 17/16 cpm/pmol), as no 3H release was seen in cycle 15 when other fractions more enriched in the βLys-216 fragment were sequenced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To chemically isolate during sequence analysis the nAChR subunit fragments produced by V8 protease that begin at βThr-273, γThr-276, or δThr-281 within the M2-M3 loops (16Garcia 3rd, G.

https://openalex.org/W2147928876,"Vibrio fischeri, a bioluminescent marine bacterium, exists in an exclusive symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, whose light organ it colonizes. Previously, it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or free lipid A of V. fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the juvenile squid's light organ that occur upon colonization. To investigate the structural features that might be responsible for this phenomenon, the lipid A from V. fischeri ES114 LPS was isolated and characterized by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). A microheterogeneous mixture of mono- and diphosphorylated diglucosamine disaccharides was observed with variable states of acylation ranging from tetra- to octaacylated forms. All lipid A species, however, contained a set of conserved primary acyl chains consisting of an N-linked C14:0(3-OH) at the 2-position, an unusual N-linked C14:1(3-OH) at the 2′-position, and two O-linked C12:0(3-OH) fatty acids at the 3- and 3′-positions. The fatty acids found in secondary acylation were considerably more variable, with either a C12:0 or C16:1 at the 2-position, C14:0 or C14:0(3-OH) at the 2′-position, and C12:0 or no substituent at the 3′-position. Most surprising was the presence of an unusual set of modifications at the secondary acylation site of the 3-position consisting of phosphoglycerol (GroP), lysophosphatidic acid (GroP bearing C12:0, C16:0, or C16:1), or phosphatidic acid (GroP bearing either C16:0 + C12:0 or C16:0 + C16:1). Given their unusual nature, it is possible that these features of the V. fischeri lipid A may underlie the ability of E. scolopes to recognize its symbiotic partner.

Given their unusual nature, it is possible that these features of the V. fischeri lipid A may underlie the ability of E. scolopes to recognize its symbiotic partner. The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri exists in a symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. Colonization of the juvenile squid's light organ by V. fischeri begins within hours of hatching (1Nyholm S.V. Stabb E.V. Ruby E.G. McFall-Ngai M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10231-10235Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). From the complex bacterial community present in seawater, V. fischeri, which represents less than 1% of the bacterial population, is exclusively recruited by E. scolopes in a multistep winnowing process (2Nyholm S.V. McFall-Ngai M.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 632-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). As the colonization of the juvenile's light organ progresses, a series of developmental changes occur in the tissues. The most dramatic of these morphogenetic events is the loss of a superficial ciliated field of cells important for the initial recruitment of V. fischeri. This process occurs over the ∼96–120 h following initial colonization by the symbiont (2Nyholm S.V. McFall-Ngai M.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 632-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and does not occur without interactions with the symbiont in the deep crypt regions of the organ. Once the colonization is established, the squid continues to maintain a population of V. fischeri in its light organ, with cycles of daily flushing and repopulation by residual bacteria. The selection process that leads to the exclusive symbiotic relationship between V. fischeri and E. scolopes involves the interaction of bacterial surface components with host tissues. Previously, we showed that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A can induce early stage apoptosis in the cells of the ciliated field of the juvenile squid's light organ (3Foster J.S. Apicella M.A. McFall-Ngai M.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 226: 242-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the effect was not species-specific, suggesting that a conserved portion of the lipid A may be the responsible component of the LPS structure (3Foster J.S. Apicella M.A. McFall-Ngai M.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 226: 242-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In later stages of the colonization process, bacterial peptidoglycan acts synergistically with LPS to induce most, if not all, of light organ morphogenesis (4Koropatnick T.A. Engle J.T. Apicella M.A. Stabb E.V. Goldman W.E. McFall-Ngai M.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). How the developmental signals of bacterial LPS and peptidoglycan, which are presented by the symbionts in the deep crypts of the light organ, are conveyed to the superficial tissue remains unknown, but one piece of the puzzle has recently been discovered. At hatching, the light organ has high levels of nitric oxide (NO). Following symbiont colonization of the crypts, the levels of both NO and the enzyme that catalyzes its production, nitric-oxide synthase, are attenuated (5Davidson S.K. Koropatnick T.A. Kossmehl R. Sycuro L. McFall-Ngai M.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the system revealed that LPS and peptidoglycan work synergistically to turn down the NO/nitric-oxide synthase of the organ. In addition, this attenuation is critical for inducing the onset of the apoptotic program (6Altura M.A. Stabb E. Goldman W. Apicella M. McFall-Ngai M.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2011; 13: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data provide evidence that the LPS and peptidoglycan do not work by direct interactions with the superficial epithelium (i.e. by transport through the tissues to responsive sites) but rather exert their influence by intermediary molecules, including NO. Whether LPS and/or peptidoglycan are required for the other developmental events of the light organ remains to be determined. To further explore the role(s) of V. fischeri LPS in the host-bacterium interaction, we have initiated studies aimed at characterizing structural features of the LPS. Typical of Gram-negative bacteria, the LPS of V. fischeri consists of three domains: a membrane-associated lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-antigen moiety. However, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the LPS of V. fischeri showed only two bands rather than the ladder-like banding pattern typical of LPS with large O-antigen polysaccharides composed of multiple repeat units (7Pupo E. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Hardy E. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2156-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis suggested that the higher molecular weight LPS species bore a single O-antigen repeat unit, whereas the lower molecular weight forms contained only core sugars (7Pupo E. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Hardy E. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2156-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The details of these carbohydrate structures are currently being investigated. Focusing on the lipid A region of the LPS, we recently generated a series of V. fischeri mutants deficient in the secondary acyltransferases HtrB and MsbB (8Adin D.M. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Ruby E.G. McFall-Ngai M.J. Hall D.B. Stabb E.V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In pathogenic interactions, the acyl chains added to lipid A by secondary acyltransferases can be critical for colonization and virulence, and thus we were interested in assessing their importance in this symbiotic relationship. In V. fischeri, we identified one msbB gene and two paralogs of htrB, designated htrB1 and htrB2. Mutations in msbB and htrB2 did not impair symbiotic colonization, whereas the htrB1 mutant displayed a slight symbiosis-specific defect (8Adin D.M. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Ruby E.G. McFall-Ngai M.J. Hall D.B. Stabb E.V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Preliminary biochemical analyses of these mutants, as well as transgenic Escherichia coli carrying the V. fischeri htrB1, htrB2, and msbB genes, suggested that this MsbB adds a C12:0 fatty acid to lipid A, whereas HtrB1 and HtrB2 may decorate lipid A with C14:0(3-OH) or C14:0. Deciphering the precise role of these proteins was difficult because the structure of the wild-type lipid A had not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we report on the characterization of the lipid A from a wild-type strain of V. fischeri, strain ES114. Along the lines of recent studies by our group (9Phillips N.J.

V. fischeri ES114, a wild-type strain isolated from E. scolopes (18Boettcher K.J. Ruby E.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3701-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these studies. V. fischeri was grown in LBS (19Stabb E.V. Reich K.A. Ruby E.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or SWT medium (18Boettcher K.J. Ruby E.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3701-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) made with Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH). Bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteinase K-digested, phenol-extracted LPS was then extracted from the cells using a modified hot phenol/water method as described previously (20Apicella M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 431: 3-13PubMed Google Scholar). LPS from V. fischeri ES114 (∼2 mg) was hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 1% acetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. The sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was removed, and the lipid A pellet was washed with water (200 μl) and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. This crude lipid A pellet was then further purified by partitioning in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:5:6, v/v/v) where the bottom organic layer and interface were saved and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. To remove phosphate moieties from the LPS, ∼0.5 mg of V. fischeri LPS was treated with 50 μl of 48% aqueous HF for 48 h at 4 °C. HF was evaporated from the sample under a stream of nitrogen in a polypropylene desiccator attached to a water aspirator, with an in-line NaOH trap. The sample was then redissolved in 40 μl of deionized H2O and evaporated to dryness in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The dephosphorylated LPS was then hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid and processed as described above to obtain dephosphorylated lipid A. Small aliquots (∼50 μg) of the V. fischeri lipid A sample were treated with 120 μl of a solution consisting of CHCl3, MeOH, 0.6 n NaOH (2:3:1, v/v/v) to remove O-acyl groups with reaction times ranging from 1 min to 4 h (21Que-Gewirth N.L. Ribeiro A.A. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Bulach D.M. Adler B. Girons I.S. Werts C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25420-25429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 636 μl of CHCl3, MeOH, 0.1 n HCl (220 μl, 210 μl, 206 μl). After vortexing and centrifuging, the upper aqueous layers were removed, and the lower organic layers containing the O-deacylated lipid A samples were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Approximately 50 μg of the V. fischeri lipid A sample were treated with 0.5 ml of 10% (w/w) BF3-methanol (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA) and heated at 100 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was partitioned between 0.5 ml of saturated NaCl and 0.5 ml of HPLC grade hexanes (Aldrich). The aqueous layer was extracted a second time with 0.5 ml of hexanes, and the combined organic layers were back-extracted with 0.3 ml of H2O. The organic layer was then evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were dissolved in hexanes and analyzed by GC-MS in the electron impact mode using a Varian Saturn 2100T ion trap MS/MS interfaced with a Varian 3900 GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The injections were made with a 1:20 split, with the injector temperature set at 200 °C and the ion trap temperature at 195 °C. FAMEs were separated on a 30 m × 0.25-mm BPX70 column with a 0.25-μm film thickness (SGE, Inc., Austin, TX) using helium as the carrier gas (constant column flow, 1.0 ml/min). The initial oven temperature was 90 °C for 3.5 min, followed by a temperature gradient from 90 to 220 °C at 4 °C/min. A commercially available mixture of bacterial acid methyl esters (Matreya, LLC, Pleasant Gap, PA) was used as a GC-MS standard solution. For GC-MS/MS analysis, the instrument was run in the chemical ionization mode using MeOH as the reagent gas, with the isolation width parameter set to 2.0 for the selection of precursor ions. Approximately 1.0 mg of V. fischeri LPS was dephosphorylated by HF treatment as described above. To solubilize released acylglycerols and diacylglycerols, the dried sample was extracted three times with 100 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v). This extract was then evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and the components were peracetylated by treatment with 100 μl of acetic anhydride, pyridine (1:1, v/v) at 86 °C for 30 min (22Corcoran A.T. Annuk H. Moran A.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. For comparison, a commercially available phospholipid standard, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (Matreya, LLC, Pleasant Gap, PA) and an LPS from Salmonella typhimurium Ra mutant (Sigma-Aldrich) were subjected to the same dephosphorylation and peracetylation steps as the V. fischeri LPS. Two commercially available diacylglycerols, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL), were also peracetylated for use as standards. The samples were dissolved in hexanes and analyzed on the GC-MS instrument described above operating in chemical ionization mode outfitted with a 30 m × 0.25-mm FactorFour VF-5ht column, 0.1-μm film thickness (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). In this experiment, the initial oven temperature was 150 °C for 3.0 min, followed by a temperature gradient from 150 to 350 °C at 5 °C/min. Lipid A samples were analyzed by negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) on a Voyager DESTR Plus instrument equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser or on a 4800 TOF/TOF instrument with a 355-nm Nd:YAG laser (both instruments from AB Sciex, Foster City, CA). Spectra were obtained in linear mode using delayed extraction conditions (Voyager DESTR) or in reflectron mode (4800 TOF/TOF). Samples were dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (3:1, v/v) at a concentration of ∼0.1–0.5 μg/μl, mixed 1:1 with a saturated solution of 6-chloro-3-mercaptobenzothiazole in CHCl3/CH3OH (3:1, v/v), spotted on a stainless steel target, and allowed to air-dry. Approximately 100 laser shots were recorded for each sample. The spectra were processed with base-line correction and either Gaussian smoothing or noise correction (0.7). Mass calibration was done externally with a mixture consisting of angiotensin II, renin substrate tetradecapeptide, and insulin chain B (oxidized) (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The V. fischeri lipid A sample, dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v) at a concentration of ∼0.1–0.5 μg/μl, was analyzed by static or dynamic nanoelectrospray using either a LCQDeca quadrupole ion trap or an LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (both instruments from Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). In the dynamic nanoelectrospray mode, the needle voltage was typically set to 1.6–2.2 kV, the temperature of the heated capillary was at 140–180 °C, and the flow rate was 0.3–0.5 μl/min. In static nanoelectrospray mode, lower needle voltages of 1.0–1.5 kV were typically used. Ions were isolated for collision-induced dissociation with the isolation width parameter typically set to 3. As for the MALDI experiments described above, lipid A samples were dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (3:1, v/v), mixed 1:1 with saturated 6-chloro-3-mercaptobenzothiazole matrix solution in CHCl3/CH3OH (3:1, v/v), and then spotted on a 96-position stainless steel target plate. Spectra were acquired in both negative ion and positive ion modes on an LTQ linear ion trap outfitted with a vMALDITM ion source (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The intermediate vacuum (170 millitorr) MALDI ion source uses a 337-nm Si nitrogen laser with a frequency of 20 Hz and energy of ∼250 μJ/pulse. In MS mode, data were acquired using the high mass range option to observe the full profile of V. fischeri lipid A species (typically ranging from m/z 700 to 3000). For MSn spectra, the following parameters were used: precursor ion isolation width of 3, normalized collision energy of 40% (percentage of RF amplitude used to fragment ions), activation Q of 0.25, and activation time of 30 ms. Spectra were recorded using the automatic gain control and spectrum filter tools. To identify fatty acids present in the V. fischeri lipid A, a portion of the lipid A released from the LPS by mild acid hydrolysis was transesterified with BF3-MeOH to generate FAMEs. As shown in Fig. 1, the major fatty acids present in the sample were dodecanoic acid (C12:0), tetradecanoic acid (C14:0), hexadecanoic acid (C16:0), cis-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1), 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid (C12:0(3-OH)), and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (C14:0(3-OH)). Other minor constituents included trans-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1), octadecanoic acid (C18:0), and cis- and trans-octadecenoic acids (C18:1). In addition to these common fatty acids, an unknown constituent eluted at 26.07 min, shortly after the C14:0(3-OH) peak (Fig. 1). The electron impact-MS fragmentation pattern of this species was compared with the spectra of the FAMEs from C14:0(3-OH) (supplemental Fig. S1) and 3-hydroxy-(5Z)-tetradecenoic acid (23Weil K. Gruber P. Heckel F. Harmsen D. Schreier P. Lipids. 2002; 37: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which supported the presence of a hydroxyl group on the 3-position with a C4-C5 double bond (see inset of supplemental Fig. S1B). When analyzed by GC-MS under chemical ionization conditions, the unknown species gave an intense (M + H)+ ion at m/z 257, which, when selected for MS/MS analysis, produced a distinctive fragment ion at m/z 165 (C12H21), consistent with an ion series that is characteristic of unsaturated fatty acids (data not shown) (24Adams J. Gross M.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6915-6921Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Together, these data supported the assignment of this peak as a C14:1(3-OH) fatty acid. Using standard methods, the disaccharide core of the V. fischeri lipid A was shown by GC-MS analysis of alditol acetates to be composed of glucosamine (GlcN) (data not shown). To obtain a mass profile of the V. fischeri lipid A sample, the mixture was analyzed by MALDI MS in the negative ion mode. As seen in Fig. 2, the lipid A preparation was found to be highly heterogeneous, producing a group of major peaks in the m/z 1800–2500 range that could be assigned as hexa- to octaacylated forms, with additional species appearing at lower masses. In the high mass range, at least 18 major species were present, consisting of nine pairs of ions separated by 16 Da. These species could be further grouped into three major corresponding ion series separated by 182 Da (dodecanoic acid, C12:0). Within these series were subspecies differing by 80 Da (HPO3), 54 Da (C4H6), and 2 Da (H2). Thus, all of the major high mass species could be readily interrelated. To study the architecture and compositions of the core structures, the V. fischeri lipid A was analyzed by MSn, using both MALDI and electrospray ionization (ESI) methods. Fig. 3 shows two negative ion nanoelectrospray spectra of the V. fischeri lipid A mixture with ESI conditions optimized to produce either doubly and triply charged diphosphorylated lipid A forms (Fig. 3A) or singly charged monophosphorylated lipid A forms (Fig. 3B). Most of the singly charged species appearing in Fig. 3B were also observed in the corresponding m/z region of the MALDI MS (Fig. 2). To investigate the structural components of these molecular ion species in more detail, the singly charged tetraacylated species at m/z 1278.1 (see Fig. 3B) was selected for MSn analysis, as shown in Fig. 4. Characteristic of monophosphorylated lipid A structures with a free reducing terminus, the species at m/z 1278.1 readily underwent a cross-ring cleavage of the 0,2A2-type (25Costello C.E. Vath J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 738-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) to give the ion at m/z 992.6 (Fig. 4A). This 285-Da loss, which was found to be most abundant in species with no substituent at the 3-position, established the presence of an N-linked C14:0(3-OH) fatty acid at the 2-position of the diglucosamine disaccharide backbone. The species at m/z 1278.1 could also lose a C12:0(3-OH) fatty acid as either a free acid (m/z 1061.8) or a ketene (m/z 1079.7). This potential for dual fragmentation mechanisms for a fatty acid suggests that the fatty acid is located at the 3′-position, adjacent to a phosphate group at the 4′-position that can initiate a charge-driven fragmentation process (12Kussak A. Weintraub A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When the cross-ring fragment at m/z 992.6 was selected for further fragmentation (MS3), it also underwent a loss of the C12:0(3-OH) fatty acid as a free acid (m/z 776.5) or a ketene (m/z 794.5) (Fig. 4B). Further fragmentation of the species at m/z 776.5 resulted in the dominant loss of 60 Da (C2H4O2) to give the ion at m/z 716.5, in addition to the loss of a C14:0 fatty acid to give the ion at m/z 548.3 (Fig. 4C). Selection of the species at m/z 716.5 for MS5 analysis produced the corresponding ion for the loss of a C14:0 fatty acid as the base peak at m/z 488.3 (Fig. 4D) and an ion at m/z 282.1 corresponding to the loss of the entire acyloxyacyl group at the 2′-position as a ketene (−434.4 Da). This established that the N-linked fatty acid at the 2′-position in this core structure was the unusual C14:1(3-OH) fatty acid discovered in the GC-MS studies. A similar set of MSn experiments was also carried out on the species at m/z 1294.1 (see Fig. 3B), which is 16 Da higher in mass than the species at m/z 1278.1. From the species at m/z 1294.1, main fragment ions were seen at m/z 792.5, 1008.5, 1077.5, 1095.5, and 1275.5. When further fragmented at MS3 or MS4 stages, the ion at m/z 792.5 lost 60 Da (C2H4O2) to give a base peak at m/z 732.5 but also gave the ion at m/z 548.2, as seen in Fig. 4C, this time arising from the loss of a C14:0(3-OH) fatty acid in acyloxyacyl linkage to the N-linked fatty acid at the 2′-position (data not shown). Thus, the tetraacylated species at m/z 1278.1 and 1294.1 were found to differ only at the secondary acylation site on the 2′-position, bearing either a C14:0 or a C14:0(3-OH) fatty acid at that location, respectively. The two pentaacylated species at m/z 1476.1 and 1491.9 (see Fig. 3B) were investigated by MSn studies and found to be related to their corresponding tetraacylated species by the addition of a C12:0(3-OH) fatty acid at the 3-position. When selected for MS/MS, they both gave prominent ions for the loss of C12:0(3-OH) as a free acid and as a ketene but no intense 0,2A2 fragments (data not shown). Selecting either one of those species for further fragmentation (MS3) produced a second pair of C12:0(3-OH) losses, confirming the presence of a second C12:0(3-OH) fatty acid on the structures. Once this fatty acid was eliminated from the 3-position to give a C3-C4 double bond, intense fragment ions arising from the loss of 327 Da from the parent ions (0,4A2 cross-ring fragments) were present in the MS4 spectra. These results established the four fatty acids at the primary acylation sites on the V. fischeri lipid A and also showed microheterogeneity at the secondary acylation site on the 2′-position (Fig. 5). In addition to these core structures, there were substantial peaks that corresponded to tetraacylated and pentaacylated anhydro species in the ESI spectrum of the V. fischeri lipid A mixture (see Fig. 3B). All of these species (m/z 1259.9, 1275.9, 1458.1, and 1474.1) were thoroughly investigated by MSn. The MS/MS spectra of the two tetraacylated anhydro species (m/z 1259.9 and 1275.9) did not contain the abundant 0,2A2 cross-ring fragments characteristic of their corresponding intact species (m/z 1278.1 and 1294.1, respectively). Detailed MSn studies revealed that this was due to a preexisting C3-C4 double bond in the reducing terminal glucosamine ring, as shown for the species at m/z 1259.9 in supplemental Fig. S2. The pentaacylated anhydro species at m/z 1458.1 and 1474.1, however, did not have a C3-C4 double bond. Rather, these two species were shown by MSn analysis to bear a C12:1 fatty acid at the 3-position. Fragmentation evidence supporting this interpretation is presented for m/z 1458.1 in supplemental Fig. S3, and the full set of tetraacyl and pentaacyl structures identified in these studies is given in supplemental Fig. S4. As suggested by the structures, these low mass anhydro species appeared to arise from eliminations involving either the substituent on the secondary acylation site on the 3-position (m/z 1458.1 and 1474.1) or the entire group at the 3-position (m/z 1259.9 and 1275.9). In the next cluster of singly charged ions in the m/z 1600–1730 range (see Fig. 3B), a shift in mass of 182 or 236 Da from the pentaacylated lipid A species suggested the presence of a set of hexaacylated lipid A species. For example, the species at m/z 1658.2 and 1712.3 could be related to the pentaacylated species at m/z 1476.1 by the addition of a C12:0 (+182 Da) or a C16:1 (+236 Da) fatty acid. However, the major species at m/z 1630.1 and 1646.1 appeared to be related to the species at m/z 1476.1 and 1491.9, respectively, by the addition of a 154-Da moiety (or to the anhydro species at m/z 1458.1 and 1474.1 by the addition of 172 Da). This mass increment could in principle have arisen from the addition of a decanoic acid (C10:0) to these structures, but such a fatty acid was not detected in the GC-MS analysis (discussed above). To examine these structures more closely, the lipid A species at m/z 1630.1 and 1646.1 were selected for MS/MS analysis and produced two very distinctive spectra as shown in Fig. 6. Unlike the spectra for the tetraacylated and pentaacylated species described above, these spectra consisted of two main peaks: one arising from a loss of 172 Da from the parent ion and another from the loss o"

The molecular mechanisms that connect mutations in LMNA with different human diseases are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a Muscle-enriched A-type Lamin-interacting Protein, MLIP (C6orf142 and 2310046A06rik), a unique single copy gene that is an innovation of amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals). MLIP encodes alternatively spliced variants (23–57 kDa) and possesses several novel structural motifs not found in other proteins. MLIP is expressed ubiquitously and most abundantly in heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. MLIP interacts directly and co-localizes with lamin A and C in the nuclear envelope. MLIP also co-localizes with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies within the nucleus. PML, like MLIP, is only found in amniotes, suggesting that a functional link between the nuclear envelope and PML bodies may exist through MLIP. Down-regulation of lamin A/C expression by shRNA results in the up-regulation and mislocalization of MLIP. Given that MLIP is expressed most highly in striated and smooth muscle, it is likely to contribute to the mesenchymal phenotypes of laminopathies.

Lamins are intermediate filament proteins of the nuclear lamina that underlies the inner nuclear membrane of all multicellular eukaryotes. They are fundamentally important for nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, and transcriptional regulation of gene expression (1Cohen M. Lee K.K. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Trends Biochem.

However, beyond this, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transcriptional specificity and cellular commitment and differentiation are largely unknown. More than 400 different mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) 3The abbreviations used are: LMNA, lamin A/C; aa, amino acid; MLIP, muscle-enriched A-type lamin-interacting protein; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. gene have been described and result in a heterogeneous group of disorders that are collectively defined as laminopathies (6Muchir A.

The diseases caused by the wide spectrum of LMNA gene mutations are characterized by a diverse variability of clinical phenotypes; ranging from cardiac and skeletal myopathies to partial lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and premature aging. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been identified because mutations in the same codon can cause different diseases in unrelated families (7Charniot J.C. Pascal C. Bouchier C. Sébillon P.

A complete loss of A-type lamins resulted in a postnatal appearance of abnormal nuclear structures that manifests as muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (11Nikolova V. Leimena C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). A recent study used hierarchical cluster analysis for assembling laminopathies into classes based on organ system involvement. They uncovered a nonrandom relationship between the class of laminopathy and the mutation (13Hegele R. Clin. Genet. 2005; 68: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been proposed for the pathogenesis of laminopathies, and most research has been focused on the “mechanical stress” and “altered gene regulation” hypotheses. The structural integrity of the nucleus may be affected by the expression of mutant A-type lamins because mice that lack LMNA have varied nuclear morphologies with a significant redistribution of nuclear envelope proteins (12Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 14Raharjo W.H. Enarson P. Sullivan T. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4447-4457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragility of the nuclear envelope is believed to contribute (in part) to pathologies in tissues subjected to mechanical stresses, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. The complete loss of A-type lamins supports this hypothesis. The effect of autosomal dominant missense mutations on the structural integrity of the nucleus remains to be determined. Evidence in support of the altered gene regulation hypothesis include many of the proteins that are involved in chromatin organization, transcription, and binding to DNA are either directly or indirectly associated with the nuclear envelope. Chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation of gene expression are therefore affected in specific ways due to the disruption of the nuclear envelope (15Cockell M. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We know very little about the molecular pathogenesis from mutations in the LMNA gene to heart phenotypes. Therefore, the question is how these different pathologies arise from alterations in the same gene (LMNA) that is almost ubiquitously expressed in adult cells. To address this question we probed the first 230 amino acids of A-type lamin (rich in mutations associated with skeletal and cardiac muscle laminopathies) for new interactors. A muscle-enriched A-type lamin-interacting protein (MLIP, C6orf142) was identified in our laboratory. The MLIP gene encodes at least seven, alternatively spliced, LMNA-interacting factors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MLIP is a unique, single copy gene that is found only in the genomes of amniotes. MLIP may represent an innovation of amniotes. The bait-vector was constructed by subcloning human LMNA fragment (660 bp corresponding to the 1–230 aa) into EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The bait-vector was transformed into yeast (AH109). Yeast toxicity, autotranscription activation, and bait expression were all assessed. The bait-vector-transformed yeast were then mated with the pretransformed human heart library (MatchmakerTM, Clontech) and screened according to manufacture's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech). Bacterial expression plasmids for MLIP proteins and lamin A were constructed by subcloning MLIP cDNA into the His tag fusion vector pET100D (Invitrogen) and lamin A (1–230 aa) into the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare). Plasmids were transformed independently into the bacterial strain BL21 DE3(pLysS) and induced with 250 μm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h during exponential growth phase. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a mixture of protease (Sigma) inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The His6-MLIP supernatant was loaded on to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare), washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 25 mm imidazole buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mm imidazole in the presences of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl. The GST-lamin bacterial supernantants were run across a GSTrap 4B column (GE Healthcare) and washed, and the GST-lamin was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl + 20 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0. The fractions containing the His6-tagged MLIP proteins or GST-lamin were then dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The purity of each fusion protein was 95%, as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels. Various combinations of His6-MLIP and GST-lamin recombinant proteins were mixed together (as indicated) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05%Triton X-100. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads were added to each reaction mixture, and complexes were isolated and washed by centrifugation in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100. Complexes were eluted by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GST (Cell Signaling) and anti-MLIP polyclonal antibodies. A 1:10 dilution of the total starting material was run on the same gel. The assay was repeated two additional times with similar results. Mouse HL1 cell line were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in growth medium consisting of Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. C2C12 mouse myoblasts were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 in growth medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on sterile coverslips coated with gelatin in 12-well cell culture-treated dishes. MLIP cDNA fragment was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dCTP and hybridized to the human (Clontech) or mouse (Zyagen, San Diego, CA) multitissue Northern blot. A human β-actin cDNA fragment was random hexamer-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dCTP and used to probe the blots as an internal loading control. MLIP antibodies were raised in a rabbit against two synthetic peptides NH2-MEFGKHEPGSSLKRNKKNL-COOH and NH2-LRKDEEVYEPNPFSKYL-COOH (21st Century Biochemicals). Proteins were extracted using lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/7.0 ml; Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (0.1 ml/7.0 ml; Sigma). Cells were scraped from dishes and lysates pipetted into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For co-immunprecipitation experiments affinity purified (against MLIP COOH-terminal peptide NH2-LRKDEEVYEPNPFSKYL-COOH) was covalently coupled to an agarose bead according to the manufacturer's instructions (co-immunoprecipitation kit; Pierce). 20 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-MLIP resin or 20 μl of MLIP-peptide neutralized anti-MLIP resin (control) was added to 100 μg of precleared total mouse heart lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody-protein complexes were isolated and eluted from the antibody-resins according to the manufacturer's instructions (co-immunoprecipitation kit). Eluted protein complexes were resolved on a 15% 0.75-mm-thick SDS-Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gel (200 V) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) for 1 h at 100 V at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20. The MLIP primary antibody concentration used was 1:100,000. Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot signals were detected with a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent kit (Thermo Scientific) and visualized on x-ray film (Sigma). Total RNA was extracted from adult mouse hearts using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were DNase-treated prior to RT-PCR (Promega). RNA samples were assessed for quality using the Bioanalyzer Nano chips (Agilent Technologies). cDNA was reverse-transcribed using AffinityScript Multiple Temperature Reverse Transcriptase (Stratagene) from 1 μg of RNA with an oligo(dT) primer. MLIP DNA was amplified with primers for MLIP-5′-UTR (5′-ACC TCT CTC TCA TTC TTT CAC CAT G-3′) and mMLIP-3′-UTR (5′-CAC TTC CAC TCC AGC TTC C-3′). Gene amplification was carried out as follows: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 34 cycles in 3 steps, 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min, and 72 °C for 5 min using Taq DNA polymerase (NEB). PCR products were subsequently TA-cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). MLIP clones were then sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). 5′/3′-RACE was performed on cDNA isolated from mouse hearts as described in the 5′/3′-RACE kit, second generation (Roche Applied Sciences) using primers specific to MLIP exons 1, 3, and 9. HL1 and C2C12 cells were grown on gelatin/fibronectin-coated coverslips in 12-well cell culture-treated plates (Fisher Scientific). Cells were fixed using precooled methanol (−20 °C) for 20 min at −20 °C and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were further permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS + 5%FBS for 3 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS (5 min each). To reduce nonspecific binding, cells were then blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% FBS for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cells were then incubated with anti-MLIP (1:5,000), anti-lamin A/C (1:1,000), and anti-PML (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1.5% FBS/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected by fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000) Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Images were then visualized using fluorescent microscopy (Carl Zeiss AxioImager Z1 Microscope). Bleed-through control experiments were performed while acquiring images. There is no evidence of bleed-through under the conditions in which we acquired all of our immunofluorescence images (data not shown). Paraffin-embedded mouse tissue sections (5–7 μm thick) were stained for MLIP (1:1,000 dilution) or peroxiredoxin 3 (1:5,000; Abcam) using a Zyagen rabbit peroxidase detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Mouse LMNA-shRNAmir sequences in the pLKO vector were purchased from Open Biosystems. Sequences included TRCN0000089848 mature-sense CTTTCCTTGTATCTGCCTTAA. Lentiviral particles were generated using the TransLenti Viral Packaging Mix (Open Biosystems). C2C12 myoblasts were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. Transduced cells were analyzed after 72 h for lamin A and MLIP expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. To identify specific proteins that interact with the first 230 amino acids of lamins A and C that includes the N-terminal globular head domain (1–30 aa), coil 1A (31–66 aa), linker 1 (67–77 aa), coil 1B (78–220 aa), and part of linker 12 (221–239 aa) (16Herrmann H. Aebi U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen was utilized. A total of 232 positive interacting cDNA clones were isolated from the 3.5 × 106 independent clones screened in a human heart cDNA library. MLIP was identified in six independent clones of the initial 232 positive clones (Fig. 1A), and it was found to be homologous to C6orf142 (NM_138569) that maps to human chromosome 6p12.1 and spans 247 kb. To further validate and partially define the interaction domain between MLIP and lamin A/C, the original lamin A/C bait was mutagenized to generate a lamin-1a bait that encompasses residues 1–130 that includes the N-terminal globular head domain, coil 1A, linker L1, and the amino-terminal portion of coil 1B and a lamin-1b bait (residues 120–230) that includes coil 1B and part of linker 12. The ability of each of these lamin A/C baits to interact with MLIP was tested. The lamin-1a bait presented a positive interaction with MLIP whereas the lamin-1b bait failed to interact (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the MLIP interaction domain is between amino acids 1 and 130 of lamin A/C, which includes the amino-terminal globular head domain plus coil 1A, linker 1, and the first 43 amino acids of coil 1B. Phylogenetic analysis through comparisons of the deduced 895 amino acid of human MLIP protein or the nucleic acid sequence against the GenBank database revealed no substantial similarities with any other human or mouse gene. No MLIP homologs were identified in anamniotes (amphibians or fish), nor were they found in invertebrates. Homologous forms of MLIP in non-human, vertebrate genomes or expressed sequence tag databases were identified and were only observed in amniotes (mammals, reptiles, turtles, and birds) (Fig. 2A). The human MLIP gene maps to human chromosome 6p12.1 and is flanked by LRRC1 and TINAG with this genomic organization conserved in amniotes (Fig. 2A). The LRRC1 gene is conserved in euteleostomi (bony vertebrates including chimpanzees, dogs, cows, mice, rats, chickens, and zebra fish) whereas TINAG is conserved in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. By contrast, LMNA is observed in tetrapoda (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and euteleostomi (Fig. 2B) The significance of this observation is that there are no other reported examples of a nonhomologous, single copy, amniote gene. This suggests that MLIP is an amniote acquisition that may play an important regulatory or functional role that is unique to amniotes. Protein alignment of predicted full-length human, mouse, and chicken (Fig. 3A) MLIP defined at least five highly conserved MLIP domains. Domain 1 encompasses the lamin interaction domain (amino acids 1–147) and a putative type I sumoylation site (amino acids 123–129). Domains 2 and 3 have an unknown function (amino acids 380–397 and amino acids 448–467). Domain 4 includes a putative nuclear localization sequence (amino acids 725–775). Domain 5 is also of unknown function (amino acids 803–895) and contains a highly conserved putative tyrosine-phosphorylation site (amino acids 869–876) (Fig. 3B). None of these domains is present in any other gene or protein within anamniotes or invertebrates. The lamin-binding domain within MLIP was inferred to be within the 6 overlapping sequence of the MLIP clones that were identified in the original yeast-two hybrid screen (Fig. 1). All 6 clones included the N-terminal portion of MLIP, and we took the shortest positive clone, 120 bp, as containing the lamin-binding domain (Fig. 1A). This putative lamin-binding domain spans across exons 1 and 2 of the MLIP gene. This region of MLIP appears to interact with residues within the first 120 amino acids of lamin A/C (Fig. 1B). This region of lamin A/C includes the N-terminal globular head domain, coil 1A, linker 1, and the first 43 amino acids of coil 1B. Ongoing experiments are being performed to define further the specific interaction domains through which A-type lamins and MLIP interact. Preliminary experiments suggest that this interaction domain may comprise multiple sequence motifs whose tertiary structure may only be resolved by co-crystallization of the MLIP-lamin A/C proteins complex. The predicted secondary structure of human MLIP shows that 46% of the sequence is β-strand and 27% α-helices. The majority of the α-helices are located in the amino and carboxyl termini of MLIP. In contrast, the majority of β-strand is located between aa 425 and 706 where 62% is β-strand with only 4% α-helical (Fig. 3B). MLIP contains a highly conserved nuclear localization sequence (PENKKSKQ from amino acid 721 to 728 in humans and PENKKPKQ from amino acid 689 to 696 in the mouse) that matches the consensus of nuclear localization sequences found in the nuclear proteins v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ζ. Within the N-terminal homology domain of MLIP is a highly conserved putative type I sumoylation motif (ΨKXE) DLFKAE that is perfectly conserved among humans, mice, and chickens. The hydrophobic profile of MLIP, as determined by the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm, shows it to be primarily hydrophilic with no predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the MLIP-lamin A/C interaction identified by the yeast two-hybrid assay was direct, in vitro co-precipitation assays were then performed. Two major splice variants of MLIP were initially cloned from mouse hearts and fused in-frame with a His6 epitope tag. Various combinations of purified His6-MLIP and GST-lamin (residues 1–230) recombinant proteins were incubated together at room temperature. MLIP was co-precipitated with lamin, as detected by immunoblotting for the GST tag fused to lamin (Fig. 4A). Lamin did not pellet in the absence of MLIP (Fig. 4A), nor was GST alone able to be precipitated by MLIP (data not shown). To investigate endogenous MLIP protein further we generated anti-peptide antibodies to peptide sequences derived from amino and carboxyl termini of the mouse MLIP amino acid sequence as underlined (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of mouse heart lysate indicated that the anti-peptide antibodies recognized five distinct polypeptides clustered around molecular sizes of 32–45 kDa and one polypeptide migrating at ∼25 kDa (Fig. 4B, left panel). Neutralization of the antibodies with the peptide revealed that all six polypepties were MLIP-related because all immunostaining was totally abolished in the presence of peptide (Fig. 4B, right panel). Because we identified MLIP through its interaction with lamin A/C in the heart, we further explored this interaction in the mouse heart by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from total mouse heart lysates with the anti-MLIP peptide antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies specific to lamin A/C. The anti-lamin A/C recognized polypeptides of ∼70 kDa (lamin A) and ∼65 kDa (lamin C) in heart lysate (Fig. 4C, Input lane) which were immunoprecipitated by anti-MLIP antibodies (Fig. 4C, α-MLIP lane) but not control Ig (Fig. 4C, Control lane). Lamin A/C is primarily localized to the nuclear envelope as well as within the nucleus as part of branching intra- and trans-nuclear tubular structures (17Broers J.L. Machiels B.M. van Eys G.J. Kuijpers H.J. Manders E.M. van Driel R. Ramaekers F.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3463-3475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the MLIP antibody in immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemically was determined by peptide neutralization experiments where we observed a complete loss of signal in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Endogenous MLIP is localized to the nucleus and cytosol of C2C12 cells (Fig. 5, C, D, G, and H). MLIP specifically co-localizes with lamin A/C in the nuclear envelope and was revealed by co-staining for MLIP and A-type lamins and visualized by sequential confocal scanning (Fig. 5, B–D). In addition, MLIP was observed within the nucleus in a punctate pattern (Fig. 5, C and G) that is reminiscent of PML bodies (18Bernardi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 19Dellaire G. Bazett-Jones D.P. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Co-staining with anti-MLIP-specific antibody and anti-PML antibody revealed co-localization of MLIP within PML bodies in confocal images shown (Fig. 5, F–H). MILP did not co-localize with all PML-positive regions. The majority of MLIP is localized to the nuclear envelope and within the nucleus itself. To gain further insight into MLIP biology, MLIP mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis was performed. Two major MLIP RNA transcripts (3.5 and 1–2 kb in the mouse and 3.8 kb and 1.35–2.4 in the human) were observed in both mouse and human tissues (Fig. 6, A and B). MLIP transcripts were highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle from the mouse (Fig. 6A). A lower levels of MLIP expression were also observed in the lung and thymus (Fig. 6A). MLIP mRNA expression in human tissue was restricted primarily to the heart and the skeletal muscle with a detectable signal for MLIP also observed in the liver (Fig. 6B). Overall, the MLIP mRNA tissue distribution is very similar between human and mouse both in abundance and mRNA transcript size. Western blot analysis of endogenous MLIP protein expression across a variety of mouse tissues revealed at least seven MLIP-related polypeptides that range in size from 23 to 57 kDa (Fig. 6C). The distribution of these MLIP polypeptides differed between tissues (Fig. 6C). The heart has as many as seven forms of MLIP (26.6, 30.2, 32.5, 33.6, 34.9, 40.9, and 44.7 kDa), whereas the lung and liver express one dominant form of MLIP (23.7 and 44.7 kDa, respectively). Skeletal muscle expresses two major forms of MLIP (41 and 44.7 kDa) that are similar in size to the two larger forms found in the heart (Fig. 6C). Although Northern blots showed very little MLIP transcript expression in whole brain in mouse or human, Western blots showed that the brain expresses four forms of MLIP (27.7, 42.7, 47.9, and 56.9 kDa) that are not observed in any other tissue examined (Fig. 6C). Quantitative PCR of MLIP from RNA isolated from various adult mouse tissues was performed to quantify and verify our Northern and Western blot results in the mouse. A similar distribution of MLIP expression was observed in the mouse with smooth muscle > skeletal muscle > heart > kidney > brain (Fig. 6D). To study the expression of MLIP proteins in mouse tissues, we analyzed mouse brain, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and liver by histology. Using the polyclonal antibody that we raised in our laboratory, MLIP was observed to be restricted to a subpopulation of brain cells within the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 7, A–C). Within the dentate gyrus the subcellular localization of MLIP is observed within the cell body as well as in the periphery of a subpopulation cells (Fig. 7C, arrow). Similar to the brain, the heart (ventricle and atria) MLIP expression is observed within the cell body and nucleus both within the nucleus and nuclear envelope and cytosol of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7F). MLIP also appears in smooth muscle cells of the vasculature associated with the atria (Fig. 7I) and lung (Fig. 7R). Atrial cardiomyocytes are also positive for MLIP protein expression (Fig. 7, G and H). MLIP protein expression in skeletal soleus muscle displays a mosaic pattern (Fig. 7J) that may be indicative of fiber type. To test this, we stained serial sections of mouse soleus muscle for MLIP and peroxiredoxin-3, a thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase localized in the mitochondria (Fig. 7, S and T). Both MLIP and peroxiredoxin-3 co-stained the same fiber type, suggesting the MLIP-positive mosaic pattern to be fast oxidative muscle fibers, possibly type 2A. The signal was specific for MLIP because preincubation of"
https://openalex.org/W2143457216,"The enzyme fumarase catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to malate. The reaction catalyzed by fumarase is critical for cellular energetics as a part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which produces reducing equivalents to drive oxidative ATP synthesis. A catalytic mechanism for the fumarase reaction that can account for the kinetic behavior of the enzyme observed in both isotope exchange studies and initial velocity studies has not yet been identified. In the present study, we develop an 11-state kinetic model of the enzyme based on the current consensus on its catalytic mechanism and design a series of experiments to estimate the model parameters and identify the major flux routes through the mechanism. The 11-state mechanism accounts for competitive binding of inhibitors and activation by different anions, including phosphate and fumarate. The model is identified from experimental time courses of the hydration of fumarate to malate obtained over a wide range of buffer and substrate concentrations. Further, the 11-state model is found to effectively reduce to a five-state model by lumping certain successive steps together to yield a mathematically less complex representation that is able to match the data. Analysis suggests the primary reaction route of the catalytic mechanism, with fumarate binding to the free unprotonated enzyme and a proton addition prior to malate release in the fumarate hydration reaction. In the reverse direction (malate dehydration), malate binds the protonated form of the enzyme, and a proton is generated before fumarate is released from the active site."

One of the major features of this myosin is an N-terminal PDZ domain that is included in some of the predicted alternatively spliced products. To explore the biochemical properties of this protein, we engineered two minimal motor domain (MMD)-like constructs, one that contains the N-terminal PDZ (myosin-18 M-PDZ) domain and one that does not (myosin-18 M-ΔPDZ). These two constructs were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system. The results suggest that Drosophila myosin-18 is highly divergent from most other myosins in the superfamily. Neither of the MMD constructs had an actin-activated MgATPase activity, nor did they even bind ATP. Both myosin-18 M-PDZ and M-ΔPDZ proteins bound to actin with Kd values of 2.61 and 1.04 μm, respectively, but only about 50–75% of the protein bound to actin even at high actin concentrations. Unbound proteins from these actin binding assays reiterated the 60% saturation maximum, suggesting an equilibrium between actin-binding and non-actin-binding conformations of Drosophila myosin-18 in vitro. Neither the binding affinity nor the substoichiometric binding was significantly affected by ATP.

https://openalex.org/W2059775083,"Ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (OEAs) frequently exhibit constitutive activation of canonical WNT signaling, usually as a result of oncogenic mutations that stabilize and dysregulate the β-catenin protein. In previous work, we used microarray-based methods to compare gene expression in OEAs with and without dysregulated β-catenin as a strategy for identifying novel β-catenin/TCF target genes with important roles in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Among the genes highlighted by the microarray studies was MSX2, which encodes a homeobox transcription factor. We found MSX2 expression was markedly increased in primary human and murine OEAs with dysregulated β-catenin compared with OEAs with intact β-catenin regulation. WNT pathway activation by WNT3a ligand or GSK3β inhibitor treatment potently induced MSX2 and ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of TCF4 inhibited MSX2 expression in ovarian cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that β-catenin/TCF directly regulates MSX2 expression via binding to TCF binding elements in multiple regions of the MSX2 gene. Notably, ectopic MSX2 expression was found to promote neoplastic transformation of the rodent RK3E model epithelial cell line and to enhance the invasiveness of immortalized human ovarian epithelial cells in vitro and ovarian carcinoma cells in vivo. Inhibition of endogenous MSX2 expression in ovarian endometrioid cancer cells carrying a β-catenin mutation using shRNA approaches inhibited neoplastic properties of the cells in vitro and in vivo. Expression of MSX2 in selected ovarian carcinoma cells induced changes suggestive of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but based on analysis of ovarian cell lines and primary tumor tissues, effects of MSX2 on EMT appear to be complex and context-dependent. Our findings indicate MSX2 is a direct downstream transcriptional target of β-catenin/TCF and has a key contributing role in the cancer phenotype of OEAs carrying WNT/β-catenin pathway defects."

We confirmed the vital role of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C, a Th17 transcription factor, in the expression of IL-17. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a transcription factor overexpressed in all HTLV-1-infected cells, regulated IL-17 and IL-9 concomitantly. We further demonstrated a novel pathway for the regulation of Tax-induced cytokines, IL-9 and IL-6, through TAK1-mediated nuclear accumulation of c-Rel. A microarray analysis for IRF4 knocked down HuT-102 cells showed a significant up-regulation in the set of genes related to Th1, mainly IFN-γ and several transcription factors. T-bet and IRF1, but not STAT1 and IRF9, participated in counteracting the inhibitory effect of IRF4 on the production of IFN-γ. Finally, suppression of both IRF4 and c-Rel resulted in the reduced proliferation. Collectively, these findings indicate that TAK1-c-Rel and IRF4 pathways play distinct roles in the maintenance of IL-9-producing Th17 phenotype of HTLV-1-transformed cells."

Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) is a ubiquitous multifunctional sterol C27-hydroxylase that eliminates cholesterol and likely 7-ketocholesterol from the retina and many other tissues. We investigated the post-translational modification of this protein with isolevuglandins, arachidonate oxidation products. Treatment of purified recombinant CYP27A1 with authentic iso[4]levuglandin E2 (iso[4]LGE2) in vitro diminished enzyme activity in a time- and phospholipid-dependent manner. A multiple reaction monitoring protocol was then developed to identify the sites and extent of iso[4]LGE2 adduction. CYP27A1 exhibited only three Lys residues, Lys134, Lys358, and Lys476, that readily interact with iso[4]LGE2 in vitro. Such selective modification enabled the generation of an internal standard, 15N-labeled CYP27A1 modified with iso[4]LGE2, for the subsequent analysis of a human retinal sample.

https://openalex.org/W1992998679,"Gelsolin is a key actin cytoskeleton-modulating protein primarily regulated by calcium and phosphoinositides. In addition, low pH has also been suggested to activate gelsolin in the absence of Ca(2+) ions, although no structural insight on this pathway is available except for a reported decrement in its diffusion coefficient at low pH. We also observed ~1.6-fold decrease in the molecular mobility of recombinant gelsolin when buffer pH was lowered from 9 to 5. Analysis of the small angle x-ray scattering data collected over the same pH range indicated that the radius of gyration and maximum linear dimension of gelsolin molecules increased from 30.3 to 34.1 Å and from 100 to 125 Å, respectively. Models generated for each dataset indicated that similar to the Ca(2+)-induced process, low pH also promotes unwinding of this six-domain protein but only partially. It appeared that pH is able to induce extension of the G1 domain from the rest of the five domains, whereas the Ca(2+)-sensitive latch between G2 and G6 domains remains closed. Interestingly, increasing the free Ca(2+) level to merely ~40 nM, the partially open pH 5 shape ""sprung open"" to a shape seen earlier for this protein at pH 8 and 1 mm free Ca(2+). Also, pH alone could induce a shape where the g3-g4 linker of gelsolin was open when we truncated the C-tail latch from this protein. Our results provide insight into how under physiological conditions, a drop in pH can fully activate the F-actin-severing shape of gelsolin with micromolar levels of Ca(2+) available."

Indeed, mice lacking the gene encoding NET exhibit diminished NE clearance, tissue NE concentrations, and NE signaling as well as elevated extracellular NE levels (4Xu F. Gainetdinov R.R. Wetsel W.C.

NET contains 12 transmembrane domains with NH2 and COOH termini located intracellularly and shares significant homology with the recently reported high-resolution structure of the prokaryotic sodium-dependent leucine transporter (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). NET is expressed both in the CNS and periphery and is an important target for tricyclic antidepressants, and psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine (7Tatsumi M. Groshan K. Blakely R.D. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar).Cocaine binds to monoamine transporters and inhibits amine transport. These actions are implicated in the rewarding effects of cocaine and its abuse liability (8Markou A. Kosten T.R. Koob G.F.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to its abuse potential resulting from monoaminergic dysregulation, the use of cocaine during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for adverse intrauterine effects including growth restriction and placental abruption. NET binding sites are also increased in the placenta of pregnant dams following chronic cocaine exposure (12Shearman L.P. Meyer J.S. Eur. J.

Although it is clear that cocaine can alter NET function, knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating cocaine regulation of NET is limited.The amino acid sequence of NET contains potential phosphorylation sites for several kinases. Previously, we demonstrated that PKC activation stimulates NET internalization (16Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Threonine (Thr) 258 and serine (Ser) 259 phosphorylation contributes to this effect because their mutation to nonphosphorylatable alanines abolishes PKC-induced NET internalization (17Jayanthi L.D.

Here, we demonstrate that acute in vivo cocaine administration results in NET up-regulation as well as p38 MAPK activation in rat PFC. Using PFC synaptosomes and HTR-hNET cells, we find that in vitro application of cocaine stimulates NET function, surface expression, and phosphorylation in a manner sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition. We identify that cocaine up-regulates NET function by inhibiting transporter endocytosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence for cocaine-induced p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Thr30 dictating NET endocytosis and hence NE transport. These data demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism by which cocaine controls NE transport and provide new insights into the cocaine regulation of NET.DISCUSSIONThe rewarding and powerfully addictive effects of psychostimulants such as cocaine are attributed to their capacity to increase DA levels in terminal regions of mesolimbic neurons (39Koob G.F.

Studies using knock-out mice and/or pharmacological transporter blockade have provided strong evidence that extracellular DA clearance in the PFC is largely controlled by NET (41Carboni E. Tanda G.L.

In addition, a functional coupling exists between DA and NE transmission, and DA-related behavior at the transport level is linked to NET function (46Siuta M.A. Robertson S.D. Kocalis H. Saunders C. Gresch P.J. Khatri V. Shiota C. Kennedy J.P. Lindsley C.W. Daws L.C. Polley D.B. Veenstra-Vanderweele J. Stanwood G.D. Magnuson M.A. Niswender K.D. Galli A.

Methods. 2005; 143: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. The present study for the first time, documents acute cocaine-induced up-regulation of native NET in the PFC and provides new insights as to the motif and trafficking mechanisms as well as kinase/signaling pathway(s) involved in cocaine up-regulation of NET function.Acute intraperitoneal injection of cocaine stimulates NE transport and increases NET surface expression in rat PFC synaptosomes. Rat PFC and HTR cells express p38 MAPK as well as activated p38 MAPK (phospho-p38 MAPK). The MAPK pathway plays a key role in neuroadaptations induced by drugs of abuse (26Li G. Xiao Y. Zhang L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Gerdjikov T.V. Ross G.M. Beninger R.J. Behav.

Ther. 2009; 328: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that cocaine-induced NET up-regulation (increased NE transport and surface NET level) is p38 MAPK dependent. Thus, pretreatment of PFC synaptosomes or cells expressing hNET with PD169316 prevented cocaine-evoked increases in NE transport and NET surface expression. Cocaine-induced NET phosphorylation is also sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition. In addition, cocaine stimulated the levels of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-ATF2 in a PD169316-sensitive manner. These data collectively suggest that cocaine activates p38 MAPK, which in turn phosphorylates NET. Substrates and ligands for monoamine transporters regulate transporter phosphorylation and, thereby, transport function (31Cervinski M.A. Foster J.D. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40442-40449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol.

Previous reports have shown that cocaine by itself has no effect on the phosphorylation of serotonin transporter or dopamine transporter, although PKC-induced serotonin transporter phosphorylation and methamphetamine-induced dopamine transporter phosphorylation are blocked by cocaine (31Cervinski M.A. Foster J.D. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40442-40449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 51Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Amphetamine, which is a substrate for serotonin transporter, increases serotonin transporter basal phosphorylation that is sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition (18Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These results suggest that psychostimulant drugs have distinctly different effects in regulating monoamine transporter expression and phosphorylation that are transporter-specific.Transport function is determined by the number of transporters present on the cell surface, which in turn is dictated by transporter entry to the cell surface (exocytosis) and their exit from the surface (endocytosis). Here, we demonstrate that in HTR cells heterologously expressing hNET, cocaine-induced increases in NET function result from p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Thr30 and occur in concert with an increase in plasma membrane NET density. Our studies in heterologous cells demonstrate that cocaine-induced NET up-regulation is due to inhibition of NET endocytosis. Although cocaine inhibits both plasma membrane insertion/recycling and internalization of NET, inhibition of endocytosis is observed after both brief and more prolonged cocaine exposure, whereas inhibition of insertion is seen only after brief exposure (1 and 5 min). Cocaine failed to up-regulate NE transport function and surface expression of the T30A-hNET mutant. These data suggest that Thr30 is a potential phosphorylation site for cocaine-activated p38 MAPK. The analysis of inhibition constants for cocaine in HTR cells expressing WT-hNET or T30A-hNET revealed similar Ki values (WT, 0.25 ± 0.02 μm; T30A, 0.21 ± 0.04 μm). Thus, the inability of cocaine to up-regulate T30A-hNET cannot be attributed to altered affinity for cocaine. Although cocaine-induced inhibition of T30A-hNET plasma membrane recycling was intact, cocaine failed to alter T30A-hNET endocytosis and phosphorylation. Together these findings suggest that Thr30 phosphorylation by cocaine-linked/activated p38 MAPK dictates NET endocytosis and hence NET up-regulation. The N-terminal region of hNET has three threonine residues that can serve as potential phosphorylation sites for serine/threonine-directed kinases. Although these are not exact p38 MAPK motifs, the presence of several proline residues throughout the NET N-tail may render these sites suitable for proline-directed serine/threonine kinases such as p38 MAPK.Data from time course studies of cocaine on steady-state cell surface NET levels suggest that cocaine-induced up-regulation of WT-hNET is primarily due to its effect on NET endocytosis and that T30A mutation renders NET resistant to cocaine-induced inhibition of NET endocytosis. Brief cocaine exposure was effective in inhibiting NET plasma membrane insertion and this action was retained in the T30A-hNET mutant. Interestingly, NE uptake and steady-state surface NET levels were unaltered following a 5-min cocaine treatment. This suggests that following brief cocaine exposure, the effect of decreased transporter recycling could nullify the effect of reduced endocytosis (WT) or it is too small to detect (WT or T30A). It is clear, however, that the greater effect of cocaine on WT-hNET endocytosis (inhibition) contributes to the overall up-regulation observed at longer periods. We observed non-significant decreases in T30A cell surface expression following cocaine treatment in all our experiments. This may indicate that the efficacy of cocaine in decreasing plasma membrane recycling is maintained in the T30A mutant. However, this could not be measured because surface NET levels plateau at 30 min (16Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the present study demonstrates the altered trafficking mechanisms mediate cocaine-mediated NET up-regulation and identify Thr30 as the trafficking motif.Cocaine stimulated basal NET phosphorylation in a PD169316-sensitive manner both in a heterologous system and in native tissues. In cells, the ability of cocaine to phosphorylate hNET is prevented by T30A mutation. However, p38 MAPK inhibition alone had no significant effect on basal NET expression and phosphorylation. Although it is not known whether p38 MAPK directly phosphorylates NET, it is possible that when cocaine is bound to NET (cocaine bound NET), NET adopts a conformation that enables p38 MAPK itself or p38 MAPK-regulated kinases or phosphatases to act upon and alter NET phosphorylation, thereby, limiting NET endocytosis. Indeed, in the presence of cocaine, p38 MAPK inhibition not only blocked cocaine-induced up-regulation of NET surface expression, but also inhibited NET phosphorylation to a level lower than the basal level. This is not seen with the T30A-hNET mutant suggesting that when bound to cocaine, the T30A mutant may adopt a conformation not suitable for p38 MAPK to act upon.NET function is regulated by several signaling pathways that involve associated proteins, including the SNARE protein, syntaxin 1A, protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), PICK1, Hic-5, and PP2A anchoring subunit (PP2AAr) (53Sung U. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 54Sung U. Blakely R.D. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that, cocaine, via MAPK signaling, may induce Thr30 phosphorylation and inhibit constitutive NET endocytosis and stabilize cell surface NET. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether other cellular mechanisms such as dephosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and protein-protein interactions play a role in cocaine-induced NET up-regulation. Although the intermediary candidates or steps linking cocaine treatment to p38 MAPK activation await identification, it is clear that substrate/ligand modulation of transporter-mediated intracellular neurotransmitters can lead to direct activation of kinases (56Dipace C. Sung U. Binda F. Blakely R.D. Galli A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 57Ahmed B.A. Bukhari I.A. Jeffus B.C. Harney J.T. Thyparambil S. Ziu E. Fraer M. Rusch N.J. Zimniak P. Lupashin V. Tang D. Kilic F. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our findings that p38 MAPK mediates cocaine up-regulation of NET in the native neuronal model and heterologous system signify the role of endogenous NET regulation in cocaine modulation of catecholamine homeostasis with important physiological and therapeutic implications. IntroductionThe norepinephrine transporter (NET) 2The abbreviations used are: NETnorepinephrine transporterNEnorepinephrinePFCprefrontal cortexDMIdesipramineTfRtransferrin receptorMesNasodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate. is the primary determinant of synaptic norepinephrine (NE) levels (1Iversen L.L.

Indeed, mice lacking the gene encoding NET exhibit diminished NE clearance, tissue NE concentrations, and NE signaling as well as elevated extracellular NE levels (4Xu F. Gainetdinov R.R. Wetsel W.C.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8510-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NET contains 12 transmembrane domains with NH2 and COOH termini located intracellularly and shares significant homology with the recently reported high-resolution structure of the prokaryotic sodium-dependent leucine transporter (6Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). NET is expressed both in the CNS and periphery and is an important target for tricyclic antidepressants, and psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine (7Tatsumi M. Groshan K. Blakely R.D. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar).Cocaine binds to monoamine transporters and inhibits amine transport. These actions are implicated in the rewarding effects of cocaine and its abuse liability (8Markou A. Kosten T.R. Koob G.F. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1998; 18: 135-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 9Robinson T.E. Berridge K.C. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1993; 18: 247-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (5630) Google Scholar). NET binding sites are increased in the stria terminalis of non-human primates self-administering cocaine (10Macey D.J. Smith H.R. Nader M.A. Porrino L.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 12-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selective NET inhibitor reinstates compulsive cocaine seeking (11Platt D.M. Rowlett J.K. Spealman R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to its abuse potential resulting from monoaminergic dysregulation, the use of cocaine during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for adverse intrauterine effects including growth restriction and placental abruption. NET binding sites are also increased in the placenta of pregnant dams following chronic cocaine exposure (12Shearman L.P. Meyer J.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 386: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Placental NET is thought to shield the fetus from maternal catecholamines (13Jayanthi L.D. Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12178-12185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 207: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and fetomaternal complications associated with cocaine addiction have been attributed to alterations in placental NET function (15Levitt P. Harvey J.A. Friedman E. Simansky K. Murphy E.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 269-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that cocaine can alter NET function, knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating cocaine regulation of NET is limited.The amino acid sequence of NET contains potential phosphorylation sites for several kinases. Previously, we demonstrated that PKC activation stimulates NET internalization (16Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Threonine (Thr) 258 and serine (Ser) 259 phosphorylation contributes to this effect because their mutation to nonphosphorylatable alanines abolishes PKC-induced NET internalization (17Jayanthi L.D.

Moreover, PKC-induced phosphorylation is blunted in the hNET T258A,S259A mutation indicating that Thr258/Ser259 is a trafficking motif linked to PKC-induced phosphorylation (17Jayanthi L.D.

It is also apparent that other kinases, including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family can regulate NET function (18Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J.

https://openalex.org/W2129552156,"Many proteins contain a thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain fused with one or more partner domains that diversify protein function by the modular construction of new molecules. The Escherichia coli protein YbbN is a Trx-like protein that contains a C-terminal domain with low homology to tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. YbbN has been proposed to act as a chaperone or co-chaperone that aids in heat stress response and DNA synthesis. We report the crystal structure of YbbN, which is an elongated molecule with a mobile Trx domain and four atypical tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. The Trx domain lacks a canonical CXXC active site architecture and is not a functional oxidoreductase. A variety of proteins in E. coli interact with YbbN, including multiple ribosomal protein subunits and a strong interaction with GroEL. YbbN acts as a mild inhibitor of GroESL chaperonin function and ATPase activity, suggesting that it is a negative regulator of the GroESL system. Combined with previous observations that YbbN enhances the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system, we propose that YbbN coordinately regulates the activities of these two prokaryotic chaperones, thereby helping to direct client protein traffic initially to DnaK. Therefore, YbbN may play a role in integrating the activities of different chaperone pathways in E. coli and related bacteria."

Recent studies showed that mutations in the voltage sensor of the Shaker channel could disclose another ion permeation pathway through the voltage-sensing domain (S1–S4) of the channel, the ω-pore. In our studies we used the voltage-gated hKv1.3 channel, and the insertion of a cysteine at position V388C (Shaker position 438) generated a current through the α-pore in high potassium outside and an inward current at hyperpolarizing potentials carried by different cations like Na+, Li+, Cs+, and NH4+.

IntroductionThe human voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a member of the Shaker-related potassium channel family (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 131-143Google Scholar) and can be distinguished from the other members because of its characteristic C-type inactivation (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev.

Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar), another member of the Shaker-related family, we have a good picture about the architecture of the classical voltage-gated potassium channels. The channels consist of four subunits composed of six membrane-spanning segments, termed S1–S6. The region between the segments S5 and S6, with the pore helix (P) in-between (S5-P-S6), forms, together with three other subunits, the central ion conduction pathway, the α-pore, which is potassium-selective. The S4 segment is known as the voltage sensor, and the helices S1–S4 form the voltage-sensing domain, which surrounds the pore domain and controls the gates (1Hille B.

The substitution of the first S4 arginine (Arg-1) in the Shaker channel with smaller amino acids like serine or cysteine created a pathway for a leak current selective for monovalent cations, the ω-pore. This conductance pathway in the Shaker channel was located distinct from the central K+-conducting α-pore and ran through the voltage-sensing domain of the channel. The ω-current through the voltage-sensing domain was only observed at hyperpolarizing potentials when S4 was at rest and the α-pore closed (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In our studies we investigated a Shaker family member, the voltage-gated hKv1.3 channel, with a single point mutation V388C (Shaker position 438) located in the pore helix. The hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel showed a current behavior similar to the ω-current (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Due to these differences and due to our new proposed current pathway we will refer to our observed current as the “σ-current” and the pathway as the “σ-pore.”RESULTSThe single mutation V388C (Shaker position 438) in the pore-helix showed an extraordinary current behavior compared with the wild type but similar to the ω-current (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y.

Nature. 2007; 445: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), however, with different properties. In the following we characterize the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of this extraordinary current.The Cysteine Mutation at Position Val-388 in hKv1.3 Displays an Inward Current Similar to the ω-CurrentFig. 1A shows typical ramp currents through hKv1.3_wt channels in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o and [164.5 K+]o as external bathing solutions. As expected for a voltage-gated K+ channel, hardly any current was observed at potentials ranging from −200 to −60 mV because the channels were closed. As channels opened at potentials more positive than −40 mV an outward current was observed in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o and an inward current in [164.5 K+]o that turned into an outward current around 0 mV. In both bathing solutions ramp currents through hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels (Fig. 1B) showed only little outward current at potentials more positive than 0 mV. In [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o at potentials more negative than −100 mV a large inward current appeared (Fig. 1B), which resembled currents through inwardly rectifying Kir channels (28McCloskey M.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two experimental results argue against possible endogenously expressed Kir channels as an explanation for this inward current. First, the inward current was insensitive to 50 μm Ba2+ (Fig. 1C, n = 4), which should have been sufficient to completely block Kir inward currents at voltages more negative than −80 mV in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (28McCloskey M.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, in [164.5 K+]o we observed a decrease in current amplitude instead of an increase (Fig. 1B).In [164.5 K+]o the mutant channels (Fig. 1B) showed similar ramp currents compared with the wild type (compare Fig. 1, A and B) at least at potentials more negative than 0 mV with the little inward current dip starting at around −40 mV (see inset for a better view) and only little inward current at potentials ranging from −200 to −100 mV. At more depolarizing potentials the ramp currents of the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel showed only little outward current in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o and [164.5 K+]o bathing solutions compared with the wild type.We considered two possible explanations for the small size of the outward currents with hKv1.3_V388C. First, the α-pore was nonfunctional or the mutant channel was in the inactivated state. To determine whether the mutant channel showed C-type inactivation in the different bathing solutions and whether it is possible to measure current through the α-pore and the new observed inward current at hyperpolarizing potentials in one protocol we performed measurements as shown in Fig. 1, D–I. In the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (Fig. 1E) we observed an outward current at 40 mV through the α-pore that inactivated ∼20-fold faster (τinact_V388C ∼10 ms) than the wild type (τinact_wt ∼200 ms) as shown in Fig. 1D and an inward current at −180 mV. Therefore, it is most likely that the lack of outward current in the ramp in Fig. 1B was due to the fast inactivation we observed in Fig. 1E.In comparison, the hKv1.3_V388C mutant in [164.5 K+]o (Fig. 1H) showed slower inactivation at 40 mV compared with that in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o, and at hyperpolarizing potentials we could observe a current that deactivated slower compared with hKv1.3_wt (Fig. 1G), however, with little sustained inward current as seen in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o. Therefore, we conclude that the decaying phase of the current during hyperpolarization (Fig. 1H) was due to the current flowing through the α-pore. From the above described current behavior we conclude that potassium ions are able to carry current through the α-pore of the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel, demonstrating that the channels are functionally expressed. To test whether the inward current was also present in a channel without α-current we introduced a second mutation in the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel. The replacement of Trp with a Phe at position 384 should lead to channels without α-currents under physiological conditions as described for the identical mutation in the Shaker W434F mutant channel (29Starkus J.G. Kuschel L. Rayner M.D. Heinemann S.H. J. Gen Physiol. 1997; 110: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Starkus J.G. Kuschel L. Rayner M.D. Heinemann S.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As expected for the hKv1.3_W384F/V388C channel we could not observe current through the α-pore (Fig. 1F). Although a transient was observed in Fig. 1F, it likely represents capacitive current because (i) the traces were not leak-subtracted, (ii) similar sized transients were observed in Fig. 1, D and E, and (iii) the transient was independent of the composition of the external (Fig. 1I) and internal solution (data not shown). Even though we could not observe current through the α-pore of the hKv1.3_W384F/V388C channel, we were able to observe an inward current at −180 mV in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o as shown in Fig. 1F as in the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel (Fig. 1E) but which is not present in the wild-type channel (Fig. 1D) or in [164.5 K+]o (Fig. 1, H and I).Apparently, the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel conducted an inwardly rectifying current carried by sodium ions at potentials more negative than −100 mV even in a double mutant channel with no α-current. This and the fact that the current resembled the ω-current in the R1C/S Shaker mutant channel (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y.

Nature. 2007; 445: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) might indicate that the uncommon inward current might also pass the channel through a pathway other than through the central α-pore.Inward Currents Were Not Affected by Pore-blocking Drugs Acting at the External Vestibule of the ChannelBecause the V388C mutation in the hKv1.3 channel is far away from the ω-pore in the voltage-sensing domain and the current could be observed in the Kv1.3_W384F/V388C double mutant with no α-current, we considered two possible explanations for our observed inward current. The hKv1.3_V388C mutation could produce an abnormal opening of the central K+ pore, which is normally closed at voltages more negative than −40 mV, in combination with a malfunction of the selectivity filter. Alternatively, the inward current could flow through a pathway different from the central α-pore. We tested the first possibility with α-pore-blocking substances like KTX and CTX, peptide toxins that are known to block the extracellular mouth of the central pore (31Thompson J. Begenisich T.

Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The α-pore of the hKv1.3_wt channels would normally be blocked by KTX in the picomolar range (IC50 = 650 pm) (35Catterall W.A. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. The IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. IUPHAR Media, Leeds, UK2002: 74Google Scholar). The application of 1 μm KTX in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (Fig. 2A) showed no blocking effect of KTX on the σ-current. However, the application of 1 μm KTX in [164.5 K+]o resulted in a block of the K+ inward current (Fig. 2B) through the α-pore of the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel. We initially wondered why KTX did not reduce the outward current; however, when comparing the time course of inactivation of the mutant V388C channel shown in Fig. 1, D and E, it is easy to imagine that the channel did, during the first 300 ms of the 400-ms voltage ramp (showing the inward current), almost completely inactivate. Therefore, the outward current in the ramp current shown in Fig. 2B cannot go through that channel. We conclude that the outward current in Fig. 2B is either a nonspecific leak current or flows through some other endogenous channels in the cell, for example through chloride channels.FIGURE 2Effect of KTX and CTX on σ- and α-current in the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel. A and B, ramp currents through the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channel in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (A) and in[164.5 K+]o (B) before and after extracellular application of 1 μm KTX and with [KF]i as internal solution.

Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. The IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. IUPHAR Media, Leeds, UK2002: 74Google Scholar) at 40 mV showed results similar to those in the studies with KTX. The application of 200 nm CTX in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (Fig. 2C, n = 3) resulted in a block of the peak outward current through the K+-conducting α-pore at 40 mV but did not change the amplitude and kinetic of the inward current at −180 mV. Therefore, high doses of CTX and KTX did not affect the inward current carried by sodium in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o but inhibited the potassium current through the α-pore (Fig. 2, A–C). We considered the idea that the inward current also flows through the α-pore and that the lack of effect of CTX on the inward current might be attributed to a reduction in toxin-channel interaction at hyperpolarizing potentials. However, the observation that after hyperpolarization the fast inactivating outward current at depolarized potentials was still blocked by CTX suggested that even during hyperpolarization CTX was still bound to the α-pore of the channel. Because of these findings we suggest that the sodium inward current in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o was generated by ions flowing through a pathway distinct from the central K+ channel pore. We suppose, due to the different location of the mutation in the hKv1.3 channel compared with the ω-current promoting R1C/S mutation in the Shaker channel that the pathway of ion conduction for V388C was not through the ω-pore.To prove this hypothesis further we performed experiments with extra- and intracellularly applied TEA, which can block the α-pore from the extra- or the intracellular side (36Kavanaugh M.P. Varnum M.D. Osborne P.B. Christie M.J. Busch A.E. Adelman J.P. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7583-7587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). First, we determined the effect of extracellularly applied 30 mm TEA on α- and σ-current measured in different bathing solutions (Fig. 3A,B; n = 4). External TEA had an effect similar to that of KTX (Fig. 2, A and B), no reduction in σ-current at potentials more negative than −100 mV in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (Fig. 3A), but a reduction of inward α-current between −30 and 0 mV in [164.5 K+]o (Fig. 3B). Extracellularly applied TEA blocked current through the α-pore but not the σ-current. This result strengthened the hypothesis that the σ-current moved along the channel through a different pathway.FIGURE 3Effect of extra- and intracellularly applied TEA on currents through hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels. A and B, ramp currents through hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels elicited in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (A) and [164.5 K+]o (B) bathing solution with either 400-ms voltage ramps from −200 to +80 mV, every 30 s from a holding potential of −80 mV (A) or with 200-ms voltage ramps from −200 mV to +40 mV, every 30 s and a holding potential of −120 mV (B) to minimize the effect of decreasing α-pore current amplitude caused by inactivation, in the absence and presence of 30 mm extracellularly applied TEA.

D and G, enlargement of the currents elicited by the voltage steps from the experiment shown in C and F.

Therefore, we performed experiments shown in Fig. 3C. It shows Na+ tail currents through the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels with [NaF]i as internal solution and [164.5 Na+]o without K+ as external solution at different potentials. We performed the experiments in the absence of K+ to exclude possible disturbances caused by K+ currents through the α-pore of the hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels. As shown in Fig. 3C we could observe outward currents at potentials more positive than 0 mV and because of the absence of K+ we could classify them as Na+ currents. For Na+ currents we would expect a reversal potential of ∼0 mV because of the similar concentrations of Na+ in the intra- and extracellular solutions. To confirm the idea of Na+ outward currents we measured the tail current amplitude 5 ms after the hyperpolarizing pulse from the experiment shown in Fig. 3D, plotted these tail current amplitudes against the voltage, and could observe in this and similar experiments (n = 3) a reversal potential close to 0 mV. We assume that most of the current that reversed at zero are Na+ currents rather than leak currents because of the clear time dependence that we observed. After this experiment we wanted to see whether intracellular TEA might block the Na+ currents and to determine whether the observed Na+ current was going through the α-pore or passing the channel over an alternative pathway. To test this we repeated the above described experiments with 10 mm TEA applied intracellularly through the pipette solution and in the absence of K+. In control experiments testing the effect of TEAi on current through the α-pore in wild-type channels (data not shown) we determined an IC50 value of ∼1 mm for TEAi to block outward currents at 40 mV, close to the reported IC50 value of ∼0.6 mm (38Aiyar J. Nguyen A.N. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2261-2264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we would expect that 10 mm TEAi that we used in the pipette solution should block approximately 90% of the current through the α-pore. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3, F and G (n = 4), and like in the experiments without TEA (Fig. 3, A–C) we could observe Na+ outward currents in the presence of intracellularly applied TEA. We supposed that the sodium currents were not passing through the α-pore because then the currents should be blocked by TEA from the internal site. Because we could still observe Na+ currents, this suggested that Na+ passed the channel through a different pathway not identical to the α-pore.Ion Selectivity of the σ-CurrentTo characterize the σ-pore we examined which ions could generate the σ-current. A replacement of the main anion chloride by aspartate in the bathing solution as shown in Fig. 4A did not alter the inward current, indicating that the current was presumably not Cl−-selective. To test the possibility of a proton current we used [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o bathing solutions with varying pHo, keeping the internal solution constant. This resulted in a reduction of inward current with pHo 5.5 (Fig. 4B) and no change in current amplitude with pHo 8.0 (Fig. 4C). The decrease in inward current with pHo 5.5 is inconsistent with a proton current because the increase in [H+]o at pHo 5.5 should have increased proton current rather than decreased it. Therefore, we conclude that the σ-current is not carried by protons. An exchange of cations in the bathing solution altered the inward current (Fig. 4, D–F). The change from [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o to [Li+]o resulted in no big difference in current amplitude, but the change to [NH4+]o or [Cs+]o led to a marked decrease in current amplitude at potentials more negative than −100 mV. Ions like K+ and Rb+, which can pass through the α-pore in the wild-type channel, only generated a tiny inward current in the mutant channel. From these experiments we calculated the ratios (Ix+/INa+) of current amplitudes (I) as a measure of ion conductance using the size of the ramp currents (Fig. 4, D and E) at −180 mV. The calculations resulted in an ion permeation efficiency with the following order: Li+ (1.06) ∼ Na+ (1) > NH4+ (0.61) > Cs+ (0.3) > K+ (0.15) ∼ Rb+ (0.11). It was remarkable that ions with a low affinity to the α-pore like Na+ and Li+ generated a larger σ-current than ions with higher affinity like K+ and Rb+. Therefore, we suppose that the σ-pore is either selective against K+ and Rb+ or that the occupancy of K+ or Rb+ within the α-pore restricts the σ-pore although one could argue that 4.5 mm K+, present in the 160 mm Na+ solution, might already occupy the α-pore, thereby preventing σ-current. Under these conditions one might expect an increase in σ-current when the external K+ concentration is changed below 4.5 mm. This assumption, however, strongly depends on the affinity of the potassium binding site to be occupied. We assume that at a concentration of 4.5 mm external K+ this binding site is not occupied. We have performed experiments without K+ in the external solution and did not see an increase in σ-current. For example the ramp currents in Fig. 4D in 160 mm Na+ + 4.5 mm K+ compared with 164.5 mm Li+ without K+ had identical amplitudes. Therefore, reducing external K+ below 4.5 mm had little effect on σ-current amplitude.FIGURE 4Ion conduction in the hKv1. 3_V388C mutant channels. Ramp currents through hKv1.3_V388C mutant channels were elicited as described in the legend to Fig. 1 in different external bathing solutions. The main anions (A) and cations (D and E) in the bathing solution or the pH of the external bathing solution (B and C), or in the absence and presence of 5 mm di- or trivalent cations in [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o (F) are shown at each current trace.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Barium ions are known to enter the α-pore and to fit into the selectivity filter, thereby preventing current flow through the α-pore (39Jiang Y. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the hKv1.3 channel Ba2+ can even be trapped in the α-pore (40Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 609-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If occupancy of the α-pore prevents ion flux through the σ-pore, then the addition of Ba2+ to the external solution should have an impact on the current at potentials more negative than −100 mV. This was indeed the case (Fig. 4F) because Ba2+ reduced the inward current (n = 5). To determine whether this effect is specific for Ba2+ or whether divalent ions in general have a blocking effect we tested several other divalent cations like Ni2+ (Fig. 4F, n = 6), Mg2+, and Ca2+ (n = 4, experiments not shown) at a concentration of 5 mm in the bathing solution. The experiments showed no decrease in current amplitude, suggesting that the observed effect was specific for Ba2+.Next, we examined whether trivalent ions like La3+ and Gd3+ have an effect on the inward current at potentials ranging from −200 to −100 mV. Adding 5 mm La3+ (Fig. 4F, n = 4) or Gd3+ (experiment not shown, n = 4) to [160 Na+ + K+]o resulted in a drastic decrease of the inward current.Block of the σ-Current by VerapamilBecause α-pore-blocking substances acting from the outside were not able to block the σ-current we examined whether verapamil, a substance that can permeate through the membrane acting from the inside (41Rauer H. Grissmer S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar), could affect the inward current. We applied several verapamil concentrations to the [160 Na+ + 4.5 K+]o solution and observed a concentration-dependent blocking effect (Fig. 5A). From these data we calculated the dose-response curve shown in Fig. 5B), yielding an IC50 value of 2.3 μm at −180 mV for blocking the σ-pore. For comparison, we performed s"
