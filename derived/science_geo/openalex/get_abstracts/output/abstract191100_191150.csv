If a slow growing strain, designated poky, functions in a cross to wild type as the “maternal” or protoperithecial parent, then all progeny from the cross exhibit the poky character. If the cross is made in the reverse, or reciprocal manner, that is, with the wild type strain functioning as a protoperithecial parent, then all progeny are normal in growth rate. 

During the course of the work on inheritance it was observed that mycelial pads from poky were characterized by a red color reminiscent of that of the heme pigments. Examinations of suspensions and extracts of the mold with a spectroscope yielded the information that poky mycelium contains large quantities of a substance having the absorption spectrum characteristic of cytochrome c, whereas the bands corresponding to cytochromes a and b were not visible. All three of these components were detected easily in the wild type strain. The experimental results presented here provide more precise information on the similarities and differences between these two strains with respect to the cytochrome and the succinic acid oxidase systems. Preliminary observations suggested that poliy in Neurospora is analogous to petite in yeast (2) in which abnormalities in the succinic acid oxidase system have been reported, but this analogy is shown here to be only a partial one."

https://openalex.org/W2076455704,"IN some recent attempts1 to follow rapid changes in the concentration of acetylcholine in mammalian brain in vivo, the experimental animals were killed by freezing in liquid air, a method which had already yielded valuable results when applied to the study of certain other labile metabolites2. As an accompaniment to these studies, one of us3 reported that the amount of acetylcholine which can be extracted from excised brain frozen in liquid air is some 13 per cent greater than when it is extracted from unfrozen tissue by the more usual methods. Since this work was completed, however, Elliott and his colleagues4,5 have claimed that a complete extraction can be achieved only by homogenizing the unfrozen brain in an acid saline solution; according to these workers, previous freezing of the excised tissue results in a loss of up to 50 per cent of its contained acetylcholine. It has, however, proved impossible to confirm these findings, as the following experimental results testify."

This system has been proposed as a model of the molecular mechanism of muscular contraction2, and may be taken as typical of such models3. The reagent appears to act as a ‘plasticizer’, weakening attractions between protein molecules, and leaving them free to curl up under the influence of thermal agitation."

These were fission neutrons obtained by allowing thermal neutrons escaping from the graphite reflector to interact with uranium on the floor of the compartments in which the animals were housed. It is believed that less than 5 per cent of the biological effects produced was due to contaminating radiations. Dose-rates were measured with homogeneous ‘tissue’ (C0.15 H1.00 N0.00 O0.48) and hydrocarbon (CH) ionization chambers, an allowance being made for gamma-ray ionization by simultaneous readings with an argon chamber1."

https://openalex.org/W1985518186,"WHEN Drosophila males are treated with mustard gas, the proportion of chromosome re-arrangements to sex-linked lethals in their progeny is lower than after an X-ray treatment which yields the same frequency of sex-linked lethals. This observation has been made by genetical methods1. It has been confirmed by the cytological findings of Slizynska and Slizynski2, who examined the salivary chromosomes of strains carrying sex-linked lethals induced by mustard gas and reported that these chromosomes had many fewer structural changes than would have been expected if the lethals had been induced by X-rays. Since these investigations were based on selected samples of chromosomes—namely, X-chromosomes already shown to carry a lethal—it seemed important to check them on unselected samples. Accordingly, wild-type Drosophila males were given different doses of mustard gas, and unselected female F1 larvæ were analysed for chromosomal changes in their salivary glands. The apparatus for the treatment was designed by Dr. H. Moser and has been described elsewhere3. The genetical effectiveness of each dose was measured in terms of sex-linked lethals. For comparison, exposures were carried out with doses of X-rays which approximately matched those of the mustard gas in respect of their ability to produce sex-linked lethals. The results are summarized in the accompanying table."

This practice leads to certain difficulties in assessing consciousness, since the usual muscle reflexes are impaired by the action of the relaxant. The change in heart-rate in response to a pain stimulus has recently been investigated and found to be a reliable indicator of consciousness during electrical curarization in animals, and during ether anaesthesia in man1. It therefore seemed possible that this cardiac pain, reflex might be useful as an index of consciousness when muscular relaxants were being used."

X-ray examination shows that the crystals are orthorhombic, with unit cell edges a = 15.36 A., b = 8.92 A. and c 6.88 A. The space group is P212121, and there are four molecules in the unit cell. The structure was obtained from a three-dimensional Patterson function which was interpreted by means of the vector convergence method1."

https://openalex.org/W2074072405,"RIPPER et al.1 have shown that the organophosphorus insecticide, octamethylpyrophosphoramide (‘Schradan’), when sprayed on leaves, is absorbed and translocated to other parts of the plant. Metcalf and March2 have demonstrated the tolerance to ‘Schradan’ shown by the honey bee. Using radioactive ‘Schradan’, containing phosphorus-32, we have examined the possibility of the unchanged insecticide being present in the nectar of flowers and afterwards appearing in honey."
