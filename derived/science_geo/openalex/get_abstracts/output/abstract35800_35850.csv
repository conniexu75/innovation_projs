https://openalex.org/W2092198909,"Two members of the hsp70 family, termed hsc70 and BiP, have been implicated in promoting protein folding and assembly processes in the cytoplasm and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Short hydrophilic (8 to 25 residues) synthetic peptides have now been tested as possible mimics of polypeptide chain substrates to help define an enzymatic basis for these activities. Both BiP and hsc70 have specific peptide binding sites. Peptide binding elicits hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, with the subsequent release of bound peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2027703149,"The effects of DNA methylation on transcription and chromatin structure require that nuclear factors be able to distinguish methylated and nonmethylated DNA. We describe a methyl-CpG binding protein (MeCP) that complexes with a variety of unrelated DNA sequences when they are methylated at CpG. Fifteen or more symmetrically methylated CpG moieties per molecule are required for strong binding under our conditions. Competition experiments show that vertebrate DNAs bind to MeCP, whereas naturally nonmethylated genomes or cloned vertebrate genomes do not bind. Cross-linking experiments detect a 120 kd protein that correlates stringently with MeCP activity. Species and tissue comparisons show that MeCP is widely distributed in mammals except in embryonal carcinoma cell lines, which have very low levels."
https://openalex.org/W1986152803,"Plant cells do not in general process the introns of transcripts expressed from introduced vertebrate genes. By studying the processing of model introns in transfected plant protoplasts, we have investigated the special requirements for intron recognition by plant cells. Our results indicate that the requirements for intron recognition in plants are different from those of both metazoa and yeast. A synthetic intron of arbitrary sequence but incorporating splice site consensus sequences and a high proportion of U and A nucleotides, a characteristic feature of plant introns, was efficiently spliced in protoplasts. We have studied the effects of various sequence alterations and conclude that AU-rich sequences are necessary for intron recognition. In addition, we find that the criteria for branch site selection are relaxed, as they are in vertebrates, but a polypyrimidine tract is not necessary."

https://openalex.org/W2087240242,"A novel form of RNA editing generates two forms of apolipoprotein B (apo-B) mRNA by converting C at nucleotide 6666 to U or a U-like base. We have established an in vitro system for the editing of apo-B mRNA using synthetic RNAs and S100 extracts from rat hepatoma cells. Editing was detected by a sensitive primer extension assay and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The in vitro editing activity is specific and sensitive to proteinase K. Apo-B100 RNAs were synthesized in vitro from deletion mutants spanning nucleotide 6666. Synthetic RNAs containing 2383, 483, and 55 nucleotides of apo-B mRNA sequence were edited in vitro with similar efficiency, but an RNA containing 26 nucleotides was not edited."
https://openalex.org/W1574840625,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for the cell envelope-located proteinase of Lactococcus lactis SK11. The gene contains a very AT-rich promoter region followed by the coding sequence of a protein of 1962 amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature proteinase and the expected primary translation product of the proteinase gene indicates that the enzyme is probably synthesized as a pre-pro-protein. This is confirmed by expression studies of the proteinase gene in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence of the proteinase shows significant homology to a number of serine proteinases of the subtilisin family. Compared with the related proteinase of L. lactis Wg2, the proteinase of L. lactis SK11 contains a 60-amino acids duplication and a total of 44-amino acid substitutions, some of which may account for the different cleavage specificity of both enzymes. Furthermore, a region was identified in the Lactococcus proteinase, which shows homology to the membrane-anchoring domains of a number of proteins from other Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2130376915,"SPEECH, in any language, is continuous; speakers provide few reliable cues to the boundaries of words, phrases, or other meaningful units. To understand speech, listeners must divide the continuous speech stream into portions that correspond to such units. This segmentation process is so basic to human language comprehension that psycholinguists long assumed that all speakers would do it in the same way. In previous research1,2, however, we reported that segmentation routines can be language-specific: speakers of French process spoken words syllable by syllable, but speakers of English do not. French has relatively clear syllable boundaries and syllable-based timing patterns, whereas English has relatively unclear syllable boundaries and stress-based timing; thus syllabic segmentation would work more efficiently in the comprehension of French than in the comprehension of English. Our present study suggests that at this level of language processing, there are limits to bilingualism: a bilingual speaker has one and only one basic language."
https://openalex.org/W1528325393,"We have constructed the expression plasmids harboring protein kinase C (PKC) mutant cDNAs with a series of deletions in the PKC coding region. These plasmids were transfected into COS7 cells to characterize the PKC mutants. Immunoblot analysis using the anti-PKC antibody identified proteins with the Mr values expected from the PKC mutant cDNAs in the extracts from COS7 cells. The wild-type PKC, when expressed in COS7 cells, conferred increased phorbol ester binding activity on intact cells; but the PKC mutants with the deletion around the C1 region did not show this activity. The wild-type PKC showed protein kinase activity dependent on phospholipid, Ca2+, and phorbol ester, whereas these PKC mutants exhibited protein kinase activity independent of the activators in a cell-free system. A PKC mutant cDNA with the deletion in the C2 region gave increased phorbol ester binding activity. Protein kinase activity of this mutant was much less dependent on Ca2+ compared with the wild-type PKC. A PKC mutant cDNA with the deletion in the C3 region conferred increased phorbol ester binding activity, but neither activator-dependent nor -independent protein kinase activity. These results indicate that elimination of the C1 region of PKC gives rise to constitutively active PKC independent of phospholipid, Ca2+, and phorbol ester and that the C1-C3 regions play distinct roles in the regulatory and catalytic function of PKC. In another series of experiments, transfection of some PKC mutant cDNAs with the deletions around the C1 region into Chinese hamster ovary and Jurkat cells activated the activator protein-1-binding element or the c-fos gene enhancer linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the absence of phorbol ester. Microinjection of these constructs into Xenopus oocytes induced initiation of germinal vesicle breakdown, indicating that they stimulated the PKC pathway in vivo. Thus, the phorbol ester-independent PKC mutant cDNAs could be a powerful tool to investigate the transmembrane signaling pathway mediated by PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1497578279,"A cDNA clone encoding a manganese-dependent peroxidase from the filamentous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was isolated and characterized. The clone, lambda MP-1, was isolated by screening a lambda gt11 expression library with polyclonal antibodies raised against a purified manganese-dependent peroxidase (isozyme H4, pI 4.5). The lambda MP-1 cDNA sequence predicts a mature protein containing 358 amino acids with a molecular weight of 37,711 preceded by a leader peptide of 24 amino acid residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of a purified manganese-dependent peroxidase (H4) corresponds to the sequence deduced from the cDNA. Some homology (58% in nucleotide sequence and 65% in amino acid sequence) is observed between the manganese-dependent peroxidase and lignin peroxidase isozyme H8. The highest degree of similarity is observed near the enzyme active site. Residues essential for peroxidase activity, the distal and proximal histidines, can be identified in the amino acid sequence. Near these residues, homology is also observed with several other peroxidases. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from nitrogen-limited P. chrysosporium cultures indicates that the level of messenger RNA correlates with expression of the enzyme and its activity. This is consistent with the regulation of the enzyme being at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1515505902,"Abstract Mammalian plasma contains a phospholipase D, which is specific for the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor found on many eukaryotic cell surface proteins (Davitz, M. A., Hereld, D., Shak, S., Krakow, J., Englund, P. T., and Nussenzweig, V. (1987) Science 238, 81-84; Low, M. G., and Prasad, A. R. S. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have purified this phospholipase D to homogeneity by a four-step procedure involving a Mono Q and phenyl-5PW columns, followed by wheat germ lectin affinity chromatography and finally another Mono Q column. A 4,500-fold purification was achieved with a 5% yield. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the homogeneous enzyme has a Mr of 110,000 and appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. It exhibits identical substrate specificity as compared with the crude preparation, is active over a broad pH range (4.0-8.5), inhibited by the thiol-blocking agent p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and by 1,10-phenanthroline, and is partially heat-labile."
https://openalex.org/W1584964960,"Abstract The Ku antigen is a DNA-associated nuclear protein recognized by sera from patients with autoimmune diseases. It consists of two polypeptides of 86 and 70 kDa. cDNA clones encoding the 86-kDa subunit of the Ku antigen were isolated by probing lambda gt11 recombinant cDNA expression libraries with a monoclonal antibody specific for this protein. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA comprises 732 amino acids and corresponds to a protein with molecular weight of 81.914. Nineteen residues at the NH2 terminus determined by protein sequencing corresponded to the sequence deduced from the cDNA. The predicted amino acid sequence contains a region with repeating residues similar to the leucine zipper structure observed in the c-myc, v-myc, and c-fos oncogene products. The largest cDNA hybridized to 2.7- and 3.4-kilobase poly(A)+ mRNAs from HeLa cells. The cDNA clones expressed fusion proteins immunoreactive with the monoclonal antibody and sera from patients with autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1557908007,"Abstract Most ligands which are taken up by macrophages are transported to lysosomes where they are degraded to their constituents by a concert of acid hydrolases. This process requires a number of intracellular events which result in the transport of ligands from light density endosomes to the more dense lysosomes. In contrast, our studies have shown that macrophages may process some incoming ligands in endosomes (Diment, S., and Stahl, P. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15311-15317) and that cathepsin D, an aspartyl protease, is localized in these organelles (Diment, S., Leech, M. S., and Stahl, P. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6901-6907). Using rabbit alveolar macrophages, which can be subjected to subcellular fractionation, we have traced the intracellular transport and processing of bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH-(1-84]. We present evidence that macrophages internalize PTH-(1-84). Once in endosomes the hormone is cleaved to fragments which include a bioactive peptide, PTH-(1-34), and then the fragments are returned to the extracellular medium, without delivery to lysosomes. The entire cycle from initial binding to release of PTH-(1-34) is achieved within 10-15 min, a time period consistent with findings in vivo. Our data provide evidence for a novel route for processing of an endocytosed ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1497443740,"Cycloheximide injection of rats results in the activation of a protein kinase that phosphorylates 40 S ribosomal protein S6. This Ca2+/cyclic nucleotide-independent kinase exhibits chromatographic properties that are indistinguishable from the S6 kinase in H4 hepatoma cells whose activity is stimulated by insulin and growth factors and the S6 kinase that is activated during liver regeneration. The enzyme has been purified 50,000-fold to near homogeneity: a critical step in purification employs a peptide affinity column using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 32-amino acid residues of mouse liver S6, which encompasses all S6 phosphorylation sites. The purified enzyme is a 70,000-dalton polypeptide that is reactive with azido-ATP. In addition to 40 S ribosomal S6 and the synthetic peptide, the S6 kinase catalyzes rapid phosphorylation of a number of other protein substrates including histone H2b, glycogen synthase, and ATP citrate lyase; this last protein is phosphorylated by S6 kinase in vitro on the same serine residue that is phosphorylated in response to insulin and epidermal growth factor in intact hepatocytes. Moreover, the S6 kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of a number of hepatic nonhistone nuclear proteins. This S6 kinase probably underlies the increased hepatic S6 phosphorylation observed after cycloheximide treatment, which in turn corresponds to the mitogen-activated S6 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1539005426,"Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the calcium-binding subunit of the myofibrillar thin filament that regulates excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. We have utilized a novel polymerase chain reaction cloning procedure to isolate cDNA clones encoding murine cTnC. Murine cTnC is a 161-amino acid polypeptide that has been highly conserved during evolution. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that the cTnC gene is a member of a multigene family. Northern blot analyses revealed that the cTnC gene is expressed in murine cardiac tissue and slow skeletal muscle (soleus), but is not expressed in fast skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum longus and anterior tibialis) or in neonatal or adult brain, kidney, lung, liver, or testis. In addition, while the cTnC gene is not expressed in murine C2C12 myoblasts, differentiation of these cells into myotubes was shown to result in a dramatic induction of cTnC gene expression. A full length cTnC genomic clone was isolated from a murine genomic library by hybridization with a cTnC cDNA probe and structurally characterized by DNA sequence, primer extension, and S1 nuclease protection analyses. The cTnC gene is 3.4 kilobase pairs long and is composed of six exons. The introns do not appear to divide the gene into functional domains. Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the gene revealed the presence of a consensus TATA box 24 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site. Despite the finding that the gene is expressed only in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, it lacks the previously described CArG and M-CAT transcriptional regulatory sequence motifs that are involved in regulating the expression of a number of other myofibrillar genes."
https://openalex.org/W1544219463,"Thyroglobulin from a human goiter, containing four atoms of iodine/molecule (660,000 daltons), was iodinated with Na 125I and KI in vitro to achieve a net addition of either 2 or 7.8 atoms of iodine/molecule. After fractionation by high performance liquid chromatography, iodinated tryptic peptides from S-cyanoethylated 125I-thyroglobulin were purified, sequenced, characterized by [125I]iodoamino acid distribution, and localized within thyroglobulins primary structure based upon the published cDNA sequence, (Malthiery, Y., and Lissitsky, S. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 165, 491-498). The addition of 2 atoms of iodine/molecule of thyroglobulin produced iodotyrosyls at five principal sites, with no 125I-hormone formation. The addition of 7.8 atoms iodinated the same sites more heavily, produced iodotyrosyls at 10 additional sites, and formed iodothyronines at 5 sites. After addition of 2 atoms of iodine, tyrosyl 24 and 11% of thyroglobulins 125I, while tyrosyl 2572 had 24%, but with 7.8 added atoms of iodine, tyrosyl 24 had more of the thyroglobulins [125I]iodothyronine (36 versus 26%). Since tyrosyls 149, 866, and 1466 were iodinated early but did not form the inner rings of iodothyronines, they are attractive candidates for donors of outer iodothyronyl rings. The sequences around the iodotyrosyls fall into three consensus groups, as follows: 1) Glu/Asp-Tyr, associated with synthesis of thyroxine (residues 24, 2572, and 1309), or iodotyrosine (residues 2586 and 991); 2) Ser/Thr-Tyr-Ser, associated with synthesis of iodothyronine (residue 2765) and iodotyrosine (1466 and 883); and 3) Glu-X-Tyr, 7 of the remaining 8 iodotyrosyls occur in this sequence, and we found iodine incorporation at each place this sequence appears in the thyroglobulin molecule. Iodine has been found at homologues of most of these sites in thyroglobulins of other species. We conclude that the primary structure of thyroglobulin, and particularly these consensus sequences, have a major role in the formation of thyroid hormones and their iodinated precursors."

https://openalex.org/W1488282372,"Previous studies have shown that increased ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity in unfertilized Xenopus eggs can be resolved by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography into two peaks, designated S6 kinase I and S6 kinase II. We show here that antibody against bacterially expressed S6 kinase II cross-reacts with S6 kinase I. Both S6 kinases undergo marked phosphorylation when they are activated during oocyte maturation, and both become deactivated and dephosphorylated upon activation of eggs. Immunoblotting of extracts of oocytes reveals that all S6 kinase molecules undergo a decrease and increase in electrophoretic mobility upon activation and deactivation, respectively. The increase in electrophoretic mobility can be produced in vitro by incubation of activated S6 kinase with purified phosphatases. Phosphoamino acid analysis of S6 kinase II labeled in vivo during maturation reveals both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, and phosphopeptide maps suggest that several kinases may phosphorylate and activate S6 kinase II in vivo. These results demonstrate that, during oocyte maturation and early development, S6 kinase activation and deactivation are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, suggesting a probable mechanism for S6 kinase regulation in other mitogenically stimulated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1506838377,"Abstract The venoms of the Naja species are known to be cytotoxic. This toxicity has been attributed to the presence of small nonenzymatic polypeptides of 60 amino acid residues, designated as cardiotoxins or cytotoxins. We investigated the cytotoxic potency of Naja nigricollis venom fractions and isolated another type of cytotoxic component which is even more potent than cardiotoxins. This cytotoxic compound, which was designated as nigexine, was purified to homogeneity and its amino acid sequence was determined. Nigexine is a basic phospholipase A2 consisting of a single chain of 118 amino acids. A detailed investigation of the cytotoxic effects on epithelial FL cells, C-13T neuroblastoma cells, and promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells revealed that nigexine not only altered cell viability but also prevented cell proliferation. This is a property that was specific to nigexine since other phospholipases A2 from various sources had no detectable cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activity of nigexine was not dependent on the presence of divalent cations, unlike its enzymatic activity. In particular, the cytotoxic activity of nigexine was identical in the presence or absence of either 2 mM Ca2+ or Sr2+, or 6 mM EDTA. We also present evidence based on chemical modifications that cytotoxic activity was not correlated with enzymatic activity. Thus, modification with parabromophenacyl bromide totally abolished the enzymatic activity of nigexine, which nevertheless retained 6-20% of the cytotoxicity of native nigexine. Conversely, treatment with cyanogen bromide gave a compound that retained 7% of the enzymatic activity of the parent molecule but was devoid of detectable cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1526609105,"Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated that ether-linked diglycerides are endogenous constituents of biologic tissues and accumulate during agonist stimulation (Daniel, L. W., Waite, M., and Wykle, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9128-9132) and myocardial ischemia (Ford, D. A., and Gross, R. W. (1989) Circ. Res. 64, 173-177). Although protein kinase C previously had been thought to specifically require 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) molecular species for activation, the present study demonstrates that purified rat brain protein kinase C is activated by naturally occurring ether-linked diglycerides (e.g. 1-O-hexadec-1'-enyl-2-octa-dec-9'-enoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-octa-dec-9'-enoyl-sn-glycerol) with a similar dose response curve to that for DAG molecular species. Although in vitro assays demonstrated that DAG could partially activate protein kinase C in the absence of free calcium, activation by ether-linked diglycerides required free calcium concentrations found only in stimulated cells (greater than 1 microM [Ca2+]free). To substantiate these findings the alpha and beta isoforms of protein kinase C from rat brain cortical grey matter were resolved by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Although the beta isoform of protein kinase C was substantially activated by DAG in the absence of free calcium, activation by ether-linked diglycerides had an absolute requirement for physiologic increments in free calcium ion found in stimulated cells. Since ether lipids are localized in specific subcellular membrane compartments, accumulate during several pathophysiologic perturbations and are effective activators of protein kinase C with separate and distinct calcium requirements in comparison to DAG, these results suggest that ether-linked diglycerides are important and potentially specific biologic activators of one or more isoforms of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1567804396,"Abstract The biosynthesis and turnover of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) have been investigated in adipose 3T3-F442A cells labeled with [35S]methionine. Pulse-chase experiments, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have indicated that LPL is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a glycoprotein of Mr = 55,500 bearing two N-oligosaccharide side chains of the high mannose-type. This precursor form of LPL is transported within 10 min to the Golgi apparatus, and this event is accompanied by the formation of a mature species of Mr = 58,000. Treatment of the Mr = 58,000 species with glycopeptidase F yielded a Mr = 51,000 protein similar to that observed after treatment of the Mr = 55,500 precursor form or after inhibition of N-glycosylation in tunicamycin-treated cells. The precursor form of LPL of Mr = 55,500 does not accumulate in the cells since, after a labeling period of 2 h, only the Mr = 58,000 species is detected. It is shown that only 20% of the newly synthesized molecules of Mr = 58,000 are constitutively secreted, whereas 80% are degraded, most likely in lysosomes, as indicated by the inhibitory effect of leupeptin upon the degradation process. Under heparin stimulation, quantitative secretion of the mature form of LPL takes place whereas the intracellular degradation is arrested. Heparin is able to mobilize intracellular LPL without changing the rate of LPL export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the material from intracellular cisternae shows that the Mr = 55,500 precursor form is present as a monomer (s = 4.1 S), whereas the Mr = 58,000 mature form is present as a homodimer (s = 6.8 S) to which LPL activity is associated. The results are interpreted as LPL being transiently stored under a dimeric form before its degradation. A sorting process of LPL in the Golgi apparatus, followed by its entry either mainly in a regulated pathway or in a constitutive pathway, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1561322239,"Abnormal regulation of collagen synthesis has been observed in fibroblasts from keloids, benign collagenous tumors that develop as a result of an inherited defect in dermal wound healing. Hydrocortisone reduces the rate of collagen synthesis in fibroblasts from normal adult dermis and scars, but fails to down regulate collagen synthesis in keloid-derived fibroblasts. We show here that loss of glucocorticoid control of collagen synthesis in keloid cells is due to an inability of hydrocortisone to reduce the levels of types I, III, and V collagen mRNA, whereas it coordinately lowers these RNAs in normal adult cells. The defective regulatory mechanism is expressed only in fibroblasts from the lesion. Fibroblasts from uninvolved dermis respond normally to hydrocortisone. Not all glucocorticoid-modulated matrix proteins are abnormally regulated in this disorder; fibronectin mRNA is induced to a similar extent in normal and keloid cells. The failure of hydrocortisone to reduce collagen gene expression is also seen in fibroblasts from fetal dermis. We have reported similarities between keloid and fetal cells with regard to growth factor requirements and growth response to hydrocortisone. Thus, keloids may be due to the inappropriate expression of a pattern of growth and matrix production that is developmentally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2100824568,"A specific repressor of ferritin mRNA translation originally detected in rabbit reticulocyte lysates has now been purified to homogeneity from rabbit liver, as described in a companion paper (Walden, W. E., Patino, M. M., and Gaffield, L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13765-13769). This repressor is a 90-kDa protein that binds to a sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of ferritin mRNA. In this communication we describe the molecular features of a ferritin light chain transcript that are required for the repression of its translation by this protein. Addition of small amounts of the 90-kDa ferritin repressor protein (FRP) completely inhibited translation of ferritin transcripts in a wheat germ system. This repression did not require mRNA sequences contained in the 3'-untranslated region or in the majority of the ferritin coding region. In contrast, the first 130 nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region, which contains the 28-nucleotide iron responsive element (IRE), was required for the repressive effect. Moreover, repression of full length transcripts was relieved by addition of a molar excess of a 92-nucleotide transcript of the 5'-untranslated region which also contained the IRE. These results suggest that no sequence information other than a portion of the 5'-untranslated region containing the IRE sequence is required for action of the 90-kDa FRP. In addition, a quantitative comparison of the repression of transcript with that of poly(A+) RNAs indicates that no post-transcriptional modifications of the latter (other than cap addition) are involved in the action of the 90-kDa FRP."
https://openalex.org/W1488353990,"When platelets bind certain specific ligands they are induced to secrete the contents of their cytoplasmic granules and to aggregate. Studies of the molecular events accompanying this vital physiological response have led to a greater understanding of cell activation in general since the pathways involved are common to a number of cell types. By contrast most of the information about the cell surface molecules that initiate signal transduction has emerged from work on T lymphocyte activation, a process essential to the initiation of the immune response. We have described an activation antigen on T lymphocytes that is involved in the differentiation of these cells. In the present report it is demonstrated that the antigen is expressed on the platelet membrane with about 1,200 copies/platelet. A monoclonal antibody detecting this antigen stimulates platelet secretion and aggregation with a half-maximal response at approximately 10(-8) M. Characterization of the antigen, termed PTA1, reveals a glycoprotein of Mr 67,000 showing extensive N-linked carbohydrate, much of which appears to be heavily sialated. The amino-terminal sequence of PTA1, EEVLWHTSVPFAEXMSLEXVYPSM, indicates that the protein has not previously been characterized. Preliminary investigation of the mechanism by which PTA1 mediates platelet activation suggests involvement of protein kinase C and the 47-kDa protein of platelets is rapidly phosphorylated upon antibody-mediated activation. During this process PTA1 is also phosphorylated, as it is following platelet activation by the other agonists, collagen, thrombin, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These results provide the first example of a cell surface glycoprotein that is directly involved in both platelet and T lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1557447433,"Abstract Apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA undergoes a novel tissue-specific editing reaction, which replaces a genomically templated cytidine with uridine. This substitution converts codon 2153 from glutamine (CAA) in apo B100 mRNA to a stop codon (UAA) in apoB48 mRNA (Powell, L. M., Wallis, S. C., Pease, R. J., Edwards, Y. H., Knott, T. J., and Scott, J. (1987) Cell 50, 831-840). To examine sequences in the human apoB mRNA required for the editing reaction, a series of deletion mutants around the cytidine conversion site was prepared and transfected into a rat hepatoma cell line (McArdle 7777). This cell makes both apoB100 and apoB48. Editing was detected by a primer extension assay on cDNA that had been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. RNAs of between 2385 and 26 nucleotides spanning the conversion site underwent similar levels of conversion. Editing was confirmed by cloning and sequencing of cDNA corresponding to the transfected RNAs. Conversion did not occur in transfected human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) or epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines, which do not make apoB48. These results verify that apoB48 is generated by a genuine tissue-specific RNA editing reaction and show that 26 nucleotides of apoB mRNA are sufficient for editing."

https://openalex.org/W1562458137,"Abstract Peptidylarginine deiminase (protein-L-arginine iminohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.15) is widely distributed in various organs of the mouse. Activity in salivary glands, pancreas, and uterus is higher than that in the other organs. In submandibular gland and uterus, sex- and estrous cycle-related differences were observed, respectively. The activity in the submandibular gland from females was approximately four times higher than that in the male. In the uterus, the activity increased in proportion to the hyperplasia of the tissues. Peptidylarginine deiminase from the murine skeletal muscle resembles the enzyme obtained from other animal species with respect to enzymatic and chemical properties. Double immunodiffusion tests and immunoblotting analyses showed that the enzymes present in each murine tissue have the same molecular weight (81,000) and are immunologically indistinguishable. Immunohistochemical analyses of salivary glands and pancreas revealed an intense staining only of the exocrine cells. In uterus, the staining was restricted to the luminal and glandular epithelia of endometrium; the intensity of the staining changed during the course of the estrous cycle. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy showed that the enzyme is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm of the exocrine cell. These observations indicate the general importance of peptidylarginine deiminase, presumably in a cytoplasmic secretory process of the exocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601765913,"In a previous study, we purified three selenium-binding proteins (molecular masses 56, 14, and 12 kDa) from mouse liver using column chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The aim of the present study was to determine the amino acid sequence of the 14-kDa protein thereby establishing any relationship with known proteins. Although the amino terminus of the 14-kDa protein was blocked, separate in situ digestions of the protein with endoproteinases Glu-c and Lys-c gave overlapping peptides that provided a continuous sequence of 93 amino acids. This sequence exhibited a 92.5% sequence homology with rat liver fatty acid-binding protein. In situ enzymatic digestion and partial sequencing of a 12-kDa selenium-binding protein revealed identical homology to the 14-kDa protein. The 14-kDa protein bound specifically to an oleate-affinity column from which the protein and 75Se coeluted. Delipidation or sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment failed to remove 75Se from the protein, indicating that the selenium moiety was tightly bound to the protein. These observations confirm that the mouse liver selenium-binding 14-kDa protein is a fatty acid-binding protein. The nature of the selenium linkage to the protein still needs to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1591225500,"Interconversion of D- and L-isomers of 3-hydroxy-decanoyl-CoA was catalyzed by rat liver homogenate. Cation exchange chromatography followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and PBE-94 chromatofocusing column was used to separate the peroxisomal bifunctional protein, the classic 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase), and a novel 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase. Epimerization activity was lost during the last purification step. None of the above proteins was capable of catalyzing the epimerization by itself, but reconstitution was achieved by recombining crotonase and the novel 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase. Since hydration by the latter enzyme follows a different stereochemical course from that with crotonase, these two hydratases are distinguished as 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (crotonase) and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (the novel hydratase). The data strongly suggested that epimerization in the rat liver proceeds via dehydration-hydration catalyzed by the two different hydratases. The intermediate of this two step mechanism appears to be trans-2-enoyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W2040535855,"The crystal structure of glycogen phosphorylase a complexed with its substrates, orthophosphate and maltopentaose, has been determined and refined at a resolution of 2.8 angstroms. With oligosaccaride bound at the glycogen storage site, the phosphate ion binds at the catalytic site and causes the regulatory and catalytic domains to separate with the loss of stabilizing interactions between them. Homotropic cooperativity between the active sites of the allosteric dimer results from rearrangements in isologous contacts between symmetry-related helices in the subunit interface. The conformational changes in the core of the interface are correlated with those observed on covalent activation by phosphorylation at Ser14 (phosphorylase b----a)."
https://openalex.org/W1594959795,"In recent years, growing evidence suggests that glutathione peroxidases (GSH-Pxs), both selenium-dependent GSH-Px (Se-GSH-Px) and selenium-independent GSH-Px (non-Se-GSH-Px) play an important role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and in the regulation of key enzymes associated with the arachidonic acid cascade. The precise nature of their involvement in eicosanoid metabolism, however, is not yet completely understood. In the study reported here, we have systematically determined the catalytic efficiencies of Se-GSH-Px and non-Se-GSH-Px toward prostaglandin (PG) G2 (PGG2) and PGH2. Se-GSH-Px exhibited high catalytic activity for the reduction of PGG2 as indicated by Km and Vmax values of 12 microM and 78 mumol/min/mg, respectively, whereas PGH2 was found to be a poor substrate, an indication that Se-GSH-Px reduces the hydroperoxide moiety but not the endoperoxide moiety of PGG2. The kinetic constants of Se-GSH-Px toward PGG2 were comparable to those determined for such classical substrates as H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide. In contrast to Se-GSH-Px, non-Se-GSH-Px associated with cationic isozyme II of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) from sheep lung cytosol was very active in the conversion of PGH2 to PGF2 alpha with a Vmax of 960 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 77 microM. This study shows that PGF2 alpha formation by non-Se-GSH-Px occurred in a GSH-dependent reduction of either PGG2 or PGH2. When PGG2 was used as the substrate for non-Se-GSH-Px, a novel intermediate compound appeared and was later identified by several methods of structural analysis as 15-hydroperoxy PGF2 alpha. Thus, the reductive cleavage of the endoperoxide occurs faster than the 15-hydroperoxide reduction allowing 15-hydroperoxy PGF2 alpha to accumulate briefly. A study of GSTs from several different tissues and species indicated that the transformation of PG endoperoxides to PGF2 alpha is catalyzed specifically by GST isozymes, which contain Ya size subunits. This specificity of GST isozymes in PG biosynthesis, coupled with their tissue-specific expression, may be a mechanism by which the body modulates the type of PGs produced in these tissues. Also, these results suggest a possible interaction of Se-GSH-Px and non-Se-GSH-Px in the biosynthesis of PGF2 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2099960488,"Structural analysis revealed the existence of two types of subunits in human red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The two subunits have the same COOH region consisting of 479 amino acid residues, but their NH2-terminal regions are different in size and sequence. The minor subunit can be fully encoded by the X-linked G6PD cDNA, but the NH2-terminal region of the major subunit cannot. The cDNA and the gene for the NH2-terminal region of the major subunit were cloned and characterized. Southern blot hybridization indicated that the gene for the NH2-terminal region is on chromosome 6, not on the X chromosome. Northern blot hybridization demonstrated an existence of two separate mRNA components, one for the COOH-terminal region and the other for the NH2-terminal region. Two separate structural genes, the X-linked and chromosome 6-linked genes, must be coresponsible for encoding the single chain subunit. Either cross-translation of two mRNAs, or transpeptidation, or some other mechanism must be involved in the synthesis of human red cell G6PD."

https://openalex.org/W293471811,"Human lymphocytes respond optimally to mitogenic stimulation when cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with transferrin if fatty acids necessary for maximal proliferation are provided. Either lipoproteins or exogenous fatty acids support optimal lymphocyte responses. The current studies examined the role of cell surface receptors for low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the enhancement of lymphocyte proliferation. Support of lymphocyte growth by limiting concentrations of LDL was found to involve interaction of the lipoprotein with LDL receptors. Thus, modification of LDL by reductive methylation so as to inhibit receptor-mediated interactions markedly decreased the capacity of LDL to enhance lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, growth of lymphocytes obtained from patients with LDL receptor-negative homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was minimal when cultures were supplemented with low concentrations of LDL (less than 10 micrograms cholesterol/ml). LDL also enhanced lymphocyte proliferation by a receptor-independent mechanism since high concentrations (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms cholesterol/ml) supported growth of both normal and familial hypercholesterolemia lymphocytes. In contrast, support of lymphocyte proliferation by high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass 3 was completely independent of LDL receptors. Thus, HDL3 enhanced responses of both normal and familial hypercholesterolemia lymphocytes in an equivalent concentration-dependent manner; this effect was not altered by reductive methylation of HDL3. One function of lipoproteins in this system may be the provision of fatty acids since oleic and linoleic acids enhanced DNA synthesis by both normal and familial hypercholesterolemia lymphocytes in the absence of lipoproteins. These results indicate that lipoproteins may provide fatty acids necessary for optimal proliferation of human lymphocytes by both LDL receptor-mediated and LDL receptor-independent interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1506555111,"Ependymins β and γ constitute a novel family of secretory proteins in the extracellular fluid of goldfish brain. Here we demonstrate that at least two different transcripts exist in goldfish brain differing mainly in the length of their 3′ noncoding regions but encoding very similar precursors for ependymins. Both precursors consist of 216 amino acid residues including two potential N-glycosylation sites. Prepro-ependymin-I is the main but not the only precursor of ependymin β, whereas prepro-ependymin-II is preferentially processed to ependymin γ. This is in line with our results showing that both ependymins β and γ represent different glycoforms with very similar protein backbones. Additionally, we show that both ependymins share the same C-terminal ends indicating that ependymin γ is not a proteolysis product of ependymin β. We also demonstrate that processing at three internal pairs of basic residues does not occur in either ependymin."
https://openalex.org/W1594206030,"Abstract Polyclonal antibodies have been raised in rabbits against homogeneous lipoprotein lipase (LPL) purified from the media of adipose 3T3-F442A cells. The antibody is able to inhibit the apolipoprotein C-II-dependent activity of LPL, to immunoprecipitate LPL under nondenaturating conditions from media and cellular extracts. A dot-blot immunoassay of secreted LPL is also described (range 0.1-0.7 milliunits). The secretion potential mu, taken as the ratio of total releasable activity or antigen to initial cellular activity or antigen, was determined. This was shown in cells treated with heparin and cycloheximide to be equal to 1 for LPL antigen but significantly greater than 1 for LPL activity assayed under standard conditions. No LPL was actually degraded within the cells. A dramatic enhancement of the intracellular activity was induced by a mere dilution of detergent-treated cell lysates with no change in LPL antigen. The total intracellular activity reached a plateau at a value which now became identical to that obtained in the medium of cells exposed to heparin and cycloheximide. The existence of an inhibitor of LPL activity has been excluded as well as that of an increase in the catalytic activity of LPL during its secretion, before or after exposure to heparin. Our results indicate a systematic underestimation of LPL intracellular activity and suggest that LPL is present within intracellular cisternae in a cryptic state. This potential activity can be fully unmasked in vitro. In agreement with other data (Vannier, C., and Ailhaud, G., (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13206-13216), our results appear to exclude the existence of a reservoir of catalytically inactive LPL molecules within adipose cells."
https://openalex.org/W1495467271,"Abstract L-Canavanine is a potentially deleterious arginine antimetabolite whose toxicity is expressed in canavanine-sensitive organisms ranging from viruses to humans. Canavanine, a substrate for arginyl-tRNA synthetase, is incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains in place of arginine. This substitution results in the production of structurally aberrant, canavanyl proteins. Chemical, physical, and immunological studies of native and canavanine-containing vitellogenin obtained from female migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria migratorioides (Orthoptera] provide the first experimental evidence that canavanine can disrupt the tertiary and/or quaternary structure that yields the three-dimensional conformation unique to the protein. These findings enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis for canavanine's antimetabolic and potent insecticidal properties."
https://openalex.org/W1590243826,"Early steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis appear to require the fusion of endosomes with each other. Recently, these fusion events have been reconstituted in vitro using vesicle preparations from J774 macrophages which have internalized ligands via the mannose receptor (Diaz, R., Mayorga, L., and Stahl, P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6093-6100). The present studies indicate that endosomes first form clusters when incubated under fusogenic conditions. Aggregation state was determined by electron microscopy using vesicles containing ligand-coated colloidal gold of different sizes previously internalized via the mannose receptor. Aggregation required cytosol and ATP. Afterwards, the limiting membranes of the vesicles composing these aggregates undergo multiple fusion and bring about the formation of large diameter vesicles that maintained the same density as endosomes when analyzed by Percoll gradient sedimentation. These large diameter vesicles were no longer fusogenic in the fusion assay. Multiple fusion was determined morphologically by the co-localization of three different size colloidal gold vesicles inside endocytic vesicles and biochemically by the fusion-dependent formation of triple immune complexes between three endocytic ligands internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis: anti-dinitrophenol mouse IgG and dinitrophenol-derivatized beta-glucuronidase, ligands for the mannose receptor, and aggregated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, a ligand for the macrophage Fc receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1592964397,"We have identified two distinct sequence elements in the mouse α1(III) collagen promoter which are protected from DNase I digestion by the binding of factors present in crude nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Small substitution mutations were introduced into these promoter elements and shown by the gel retardation (gel mobility shift) and DNase I protection assays to decrease or eliminate factor binding to the mutated element but not to the remaining wild-type element, indicating that two distinct factors recognize these separate promoter regions. Region A appears to bind a factor related to the Jun/AP-1 protein, whereas the factor binding to region B remains as yet unidentified. Mutagenesis of either region decreased the activity of the α1(III) collagen promoter in DNA transfection assays by about 3-fold for the A region (located between − 122 and − 106) and about 5-fold for the B region (located between −83 and −61). These results indicate that regions A and B in the mouse α1(III) collagen promoter are positive cis-regulatory elements, independently binding two distinct trans-activating factors."
https://openalex.org/W1776469890,"A1 adenosine receptor-binding subunits can be visualized using high affinity antagonist and agonist photoaffinity radioligands. In the present study, we examined whether agonists and antagonists bind to the same receptor-binding subunit and if agonists and antagonists induce different conformational states of the receptor in intact membranes. It was demonstrated that several agonist and antagonist photoaffinity receptor-binding subunit. When the agonist and antagonist photoaffinity labeled peptides were denatured and subjected to partial peptide map analysis using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system similar peptide fragments were generated from each specifically labeled protein. This suggests that both classes of ligand label and incorporate into the same binding subunit. Proteolytic digestions of agonist- and antagonist-occupied receptors in native intact membranes revealed distinct and different peptide fragments depending on whether the ligand was an agonist or an antagonist. Manipulation of incubation conditions to perturb ligand-receptor interactions alter the pattern of peptide fragments generated with each specific protease. These data suggest that agonist and antagonist photoaffinity probes interact with an incorporate into the same binding subunit but that agonist binding is associated with a unique and detectable receptor conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1544238455,"Abstract Growth of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39) on thrombin as sole mitogen is dependent on phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism and activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter. By modifying a H+ suicide selection developed for the isolation of antiporter mutants in these cells, we enriched for and isolated CCL39 variants deficient in the thrombin mitogenic response (thrombin nongrowers). These mutants retain alternate mitogenic mechanisms and, hence, grow well on media containing serum. When challenged with thrombin, the mutants show decreased, increased, or unchanged levels of inositol phosphates produced as compared with wild type cells. One of the mutants (D1-6b) has decreased inositol phosphates production not only with thrombin but also with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and AlF4-, suggesting a defect distal to the thrombin receptors. Extracts of this mutant reveal marked decreased phospholipase C activity toward PI. From the different phenotypes of the thrombin nongrowers, it is clear that the selection is general and that mutants with various biochemical defects should lead to a better understanding of the PI cycle as well as of functions essential to mitogenesis."

The molecular weights of the native N alpha-acetyltransferase and its protein subunit were estimated as 240,000 and 79,000, respectively. The purified enzyme exhibited a narrow pH optimum centered at 7.8. The enzyme was activated by dithiothreitol, cysteine, glutathione, and beta-mercaptoethanol, but inhibited by Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and all thiol-specific reagents tested. These findings suggest that a thiol group(s) is essential to the enzyme activity. Substrate specificity experiments of the purified enzyme revealed that (i) the minimal length of a peptide chain required for N alpha-acetylation is 10 residues, (ii) the amino acids, Ala, Ser, Met, and Gly, which are predominantly found in the N termini of N alpha-acetylated proteins, are not the sole determinant of N alpha-acetylation for 10 and more residue peptides, and (iii) N alpha-acetyltransferase recognizes a minute difference in the side chain structure at the N termini of ACTH1-18-NH2 and [Gly1]ACTH1-18-NH2, a productive and a nonproductive substrate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1578760838,"Calf uterine estrogen receptor was covalently labeled with [3H]tamoxifen aziridine during affinity chromatography purification. After carboxymethylation, affinity labeled receptor was digested with trypsin under limit conditions and the labeled peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography into one major and two minor components. Sequence analysis of the dominant labeled fragment indicated the facile cleavage of label during Edman degradation but identified two peptides, both derived from the extreme carboxyl terminus of the steroid-binding domain. The 17 residues of one peptide were fully conserved in all estrogen receptors. This fragment contained five nucleophilic amino acids and was considered as the more favored interaction site for tamoxifen aziridine. A corresponding region of the glucocorticoid receptor has recently been identified as one of three major contact sites for glucocorticoids (Carlstedt-Duke, J., Stromstedt, P.-E., Persson, B., Cederlund, E., Gustafsson, J.-A., and Jornvall, H.

(ii) A nucleic acid band stained with ethidium bromide was detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (iii) An ethidium bromide band co-migrated with a fluorescent band of the protein treated with N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarinyl)maleimide, a reagent specific for thiol groups, on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. N alpha-Acetyltransferase lost its activity partially or completely by digestion with bovine pancreatic RNase A, Staphylococcus aureus nuclease, or proteinase K, showing that both the nucleic acid and the protein subunit were necessary for the enzyme activity. The nucleic acid component was identified as an RNA but not a DNA because the RNase T2 digest of the nucleic acid was composed of four 3'-ribomononucleotides and completely separated from 3'- and 5'-deoxyribomononucleotides on TLC. The chain length of the nucleic acid of 260 nucleotides estimated by formamide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was calculated to be about 83,000 of the molecular weight. The contents of RNA (35.0%) and protein (65.0%) in N alpha-acetyltransferase determined on weight basis corresponded reasonably well to the contents of RNA (34.4%) and protein (65.6%) calculated based on the assumption that N alpha-acetyltransferase consisted of one molecule of 7 S RNA (Mr 83,000) and two identical Mr 79,000 protein subunits. The total molecular weight (241,000) of the holoenzyme calculated based on the above result was identical to the molecular weight (240,000) of N alpha-acetyltransferase estimated by Sepharose 6B gel filtration."
