https://openalex.org/W1999091180,"First-principles calculations were performed to compare the energies of 29 different fullerene structures, with mass number from 60 to 240, and of eight nonhelical graphite tubes of different radii. A quantity called the planarity, which indicates the completeness of the Ï€-bonding, is the single most important parameter determining the energetics of these structures. Empirical equations were constructed for the energies of nonhelical tubes and for those fullerene structures that may be described as balls or capsules. For a given mass number, bail-shaped fullerenes are energetically favored over capsular (tube-like) fullerenes."

Baker [ Science 139, 877 (8 March 1963)] the fifth line up in the next-to-last paragraph (column 3, page 880) should have read: (. . . visited by large carpenter bees of the Xylocopidae ). In the published version Xylocopidae read Megachilidae."
https://openalex.org/W2051466016,"Large-scale process simulation was used to reconstruct the geologic evolution during the past 600,000 years of an alluvial fan in northern California. In order to reproduce the sedimentary record, the simulation accounted for the dynamics of river flooding, sedimentation, subsidence, land movement that resulted from faulting, and sea level changes. Paleoclimatic trends induced fluctuations in stream flows and dominated the development of the sedimentary deposits. The process simulation approach serves as a quantitative means to explore the genesis of sedimentary architecture and its link to past climatic conditions and fault motion."

The photoluminescence originates from a thin layer of luminescent porous silicon that is produced in the photoetch, and the colors that appear in the etched image arise from thin-film optical interference. A diffraction grating was also photoetched into the substrate, demonstrating simultaneous encoding of a gray-scale image into thin-film interference, luminescence, and diffraction phenomena."

In large measure, we appear to have lost sight of our intellectual foundations and to have reverted to authoritarianism. Contributing to this situation is the state of the universities. Since World War II these have become so deeply engaged in the pursuit of various kinds of applied research that they have seriously neglected their primary duties as institutions of learning and of education. Possibly the greatest source of this disruption is the government contract-grant system upon which the universities are becoming increasingly dependent for continued existence."
https://openalex.org/W811488890,"There was a complete absence of charged particles associated with the planet Venus at radial distances as small as 41,000 km on the sunward side of the planet. This result is taken to mean that the magnetosphere of Venus, if any, does not extend to that great a distance. The most plausible interpretation is that (MV/ME) </= 0.18, where MV and ME are the dipole magnetic moments of Venus and Earth, respectively. The results are consistent with MV/ME = 0. Certain qualifications prevent this interpretation from being a definitive one."

https://openalex.org/W4249441409,"In the news briefing ""The world's most prolific scientists"" (17 Jan., p. 283), Arnold L. Rheingold, a crystallographer at the University of Delaware, was inadvertently left off the list of the top 20 most prolific scientists. The Institute for Scientific Information has corrected its list and states that Rheingold published 391 articles and other scientific communications between 1981 and the end of 1990. He should have ranked 13th on the list."
