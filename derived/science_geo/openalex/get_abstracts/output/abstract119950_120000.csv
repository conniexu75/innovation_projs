https://openalex.org/W2008812258,"Several G protein-coupled receptors that interact with pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins mediate Ras-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. The mechanism involves Gβγ subunit-mediated increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein, Shc·Grb2 complex formation, and recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. We have investigated the role of the ubiquitous nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src in activation of the MAP kinase pathway via endogenous G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors or by transient expression of Gβγ subunits in COS-7 cells. In vitro kinase assays of Shc immunoprecipitates following LPA stimulation demonstrated rapid, transient recruitment of tyrosine kinase activity into Shc immune complexes. Recruitment of tyrosine kinase activity was pertussis toxin-sensitive and mimicked by cellular expression of Gβγ subunits. Immunoblots for coprecipitated proteins in Shc immunoprecipitates revealed a transient association of Shc and c-Src following LPA stimulation, which coincided with increases in Shc-associated tyrosine kinase activity and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. LPA stimulation or expression of Gβγ subunits resulted in c-Src activation, as assessed by increased c-Src autophosphorylation. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active mutant c-Src, but not kinase inactive mutant c-Src, lead to increased tyrosine kinase activity in Shc immunoprecipitates, increased Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and Shc·Grb2 complex formation. MAP kinase activation resulting from LPA receptor stimulation, expression of Gβγ subunits, or expression of c-Src was sensitive to dominant negatives of mSos, Ras, and Raf. Coexpression of Csk, which inactivates Src family kinases by phosphorylating the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine residue, inhibited LPA stimulation of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc·Grb2 complex formation, and MAP kinase activation. These data suggest that Gβγ subunit-mediated formation of Shc·c-Src complexes and c-Src kinase activation are early events in Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase via pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors.

Among these are receptors for several substances either present in the general circulation, released as neurotransmitters, or produced locally by vascular endothelium or activated platelets. These include catecholamines, acetylcholine, pituitary glycopeptide hormones, adenosine, angiotensins, bombesin, endothelins, LPA, and α-thrombin (1Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocr.

Heterogeneity exists in the mechanisms whereby G protein-coupled receptors activate MAP kinases. Depending upon receptor and cell type, MAP kinase activation may be mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive or -insensitive G proteins and be either PKC- or Ras-dependent. In COS-7 cells, for example, activation of MAP kinase via the pertussis toxin-insensitive, Gq-coupled, α1B adrenergic and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is significantly inhibited by PKC depletion but insensitive to expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras. In contrast, activation of MAP kinase via the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-coupled α2A adrenergic and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is PKC-independent but requires Ras activation and is sensitive to inhibitors of tyrosine protein kinases (2Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Google Scholar). Similarly, LPA, a potent stimulator of mitogenesis in quiescent fibroblasts that signals via a G protein-coupled receptor coupling to both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins (3Moolenaar W.H.

In COS-7 cells, Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation via α2A adrenergic (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Indeed, overexpression of Gβγ subunits, but not constitutively activated Gαi1 or Gαi2 mutants, is sufficient to activate MAP kinase (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K.

We have shown previously that Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation via LPA and α2A adrenergic receptors in COS-7 cells is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein and is dependent upon Grb2-mediated recruitment of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSos-1 (9van Biesen T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Google Scholar) has been reported to cause rapid and transient increases in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc · Grb2 complex formation. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and formyl methionyl peptide receptor-mediated Shc phosphorylation is not mimicked by Ca2+ ionophore, suggesting that the signal is not PKC-dependent. The α2A adrenergic and formyl methionyl peptide receptor-mediated Shc phosphorylation is pertussis toxin-sensitive and can be mimicked by transient expression of Gβγ subunits (9van Biesen T.

Furthermore, cellular expression of a specific Gβγ subunit sequestrant peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ subunit-binding domain of the β adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1) (16Koch W.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Google Scholar) inhibits LPA and α2A adrenergic receptor-mediated Shc phosphorylation in COS-7 cells (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Google Scholar), indicating that the phosphorylation is mediated largely via Gβγ subunits derived from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. These data suggest that Gβγ subunit-mediated formation of tyrosine-phosphorylated intermediates is one of the earliest events in a MAP kinase activation pathway cascade used by a significant subset of G protein-coupled receptors. The identity of the tyrosine kinase(s) and their mechanism of activation by G protein-coupled receptors remains unclear. Several cell surface receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, including the antigen receptors on T and B cells as well as the receptors for growth hormone, erythropoietin and several cytokines, stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation through association with Src family tyrosine kinases such as Lck, Lyn, and Fyn (18Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Google Scholar). Similar recruitment of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases might play a role in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. To test this possibility, we have investigated the role of Src kinases in LPA receptor and Gβγ subunit-mediated, Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation in COS-7 cells. The cDNAs encoding Gβ1 (19Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Kalman-Maltese V.K. Robishaw J.D. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13123-13126Google Scholar) and Gγ2 (20Yatsunami K. Pandya B.V. Oprian D.D.

The dominant-negative Sos-Pro construct, encompassing the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal fragment of mSos1, was prepared as described (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K.

The cDNA encoding the p74raf-1 (29Schaap D. van der Wal J. Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Google Scholar) was provided by J. Pouyssegur. All cDNAs were subcloned into pRK5 or pcDNA eukaryotic expression vectors for transient transfection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 µg/ml gentamicin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed on 80-90% confluent monolayers in 100-mm dishes for immunoprecipitation and c-Src kinase assays or in 6-well tissue culture plates for MAP kinase assays. For transient transfection, cells were incubated at 37°C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4 ml containing 6-10 µg of DNA/100-mm dish or 1 ml containing 1-2 µg of DNA/well) plus 6 µl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.)/µg of DNA. Empty pRK5 vector was added to transfections as needed to keep the total mass of DNA added per dish constant within an experiment. After 3-5 h of exposure to the transfection medium, monolayers were refed with growth medium and incubated overnight. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. LipofectAMINE transfection of COS-7 cells consistently resulted in transfection efficiencies of greater than 80% (data not shown). Transient expression of Gβ1 and Gγ2 subunits, Csk, wild-type and mutant c-Src proteins, Sos-Pro, N17 Ras and T24Ras, and ΔNRaf were confirmed by immunoblotting of transfected whole-cell lysates using commercially available antisera. Transfected monolayers were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, for 16-20 h prior to stimulation. Stimulations were carried out at 37°C in serum-free medium as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, monolayers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM NaVO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotonin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin), sonicated briefly, clarified by centrifugation, and diluted with RIPA buffer to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Endogenous Shc was immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of lysate using 4 µg/sample of polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (Transduction Laboratories) plus 50 µl of a 50% slurry of Protein G plus/Protein A agarose (Oncogene Science) agitated for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline and denatured in Laemmeli sample buffer. Following resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblots were performed to detect Shc phosphotyrosine or the presence of coprecipitated proteins. Shc phosphotyrosine was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Shc protein was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc IgG (Transduction Laboratories), and Grb2 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-Grb2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), each with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) as secondary antibody. Wild-type and mutant c-Src were detected using a 1:100 dilution of mAb 327 anti-Src monoclonal antibody (31Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Google Scholar) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as secondary antibody. Fyn and c-Yes immunoblots were performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn and anti-Yes antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes on nitrocellulose were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham) and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. Shc immune complexes on agarose beads were prepared from RIPA lysates of appropriately stimulated cells as described. To detect coprecipitated tyrosine kinase activity, washed pellets were incubated for 15 min at 20°C in 30 µl of reaction mix (10 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM MnCl2, 5 mM Val5-angiotensin II (Sigma), 10 mM ATP, and 10 µCi [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 µl of stop solution (6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 200 mM EDTA) and briefly centrifuged. Twenty-µl aliquots of each supernatant were added to 40 µl of ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, precipitated for 20 min, and centrifuged. Forty-µl aliquots of each clarified supernatant were spotted onto P81 paper and washed three times in 0.425% phosphoric acid and once in acetone; then Val5-angiotensin II phosphorylation was quantified by scintillation counting. Rabbit antiserum specific for Y416-phosphorylated Src was the generous gift of M. Weber. To detect endogenously autophosphorylated c-Src, clarified RIPA whole-cell lysates of appropriately stimulated or transfected cells (50 µg of whole-cell protein/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Y416-phosphorylated c-Src was detected using a 1:500 dilution of anti-pY416-Src antibody, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) as secondary antibody. Identical samples were immunoblotted with mAb 327 as controls. Immune complexes on nitrocellulose were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham) and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. Activation of epitope-tagged p44HA-mapk was determined using myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate (30Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Google Scholar). Appropriately transfected, serum-starved cells in 6-well plates were stimulated as described in the figure legends, lysed in 200 µl of ice-cold RIPA/SDS lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation of p44HA-mapk from the clarified supernatants was performed using 6.5 µg of anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) plus 25 µl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science) for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). MBP phosphorylation was performed at 20°C for 30 min in 40 µl of kinase buffer containing 250 µg/ml MBP, 20 µM ATP, and 4 µCi [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and labeled MBP was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Quantitation of labeled MBP was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Equal expression of p44HA-mapk in cotransfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-erk1 following immunoprecipitation of p44HA-mapkfrom whole-cell lysates using 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. Fig. 1A depicts the effects of endogenous LPA or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor stimulation, or transient coexpression of Gβ1 and Gγ2 subunits, on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation in COS-7 cells. LPA stimulation resulted in a transient 3-4-fold increase in Shc phosphotyrosine and Shc·Grb2 complex formation, compared with a 10-12-fold increase resulting from stimulation of the endogenous EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Gβ1γ2 subunits resulted in a sustained 2-fold increase. As shown in Fig. 1B, LPA receptor-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation were maximal after 2-5 min of stimulation. The responses were inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, as is LPA receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation in these cells (6Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation of endogenous LPA receptors or transient expression of Gβγ subunits lead to direct recruitment of a tyrosine kinase into Shc-containing signaling complexes, we assayed for tyrosine kinase activity in Shc immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cells stimulated with LPA or transiently cotransfected with Gβ1γ2 subunits. As shown in Fig. 2A, LPA stimulation resulted in the rapid appearance of tyrosine kinase activity in Shc immunoprecipitates assessed by an in vitro kinase assay using Val5-angiotensin II as exogenous substrate. The kinase activity was maximal 1-2 min after stimulation and declined subsequently. As shown in Fig. 2B, the LPA-induced recruitment of tyrosine kinase activity was pertussis toxin-sensitive. Cells transiently expressing Gβγ subunits showed a similar 6-8-fold increase in Shc-associated tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the presence of free Gβγ subunits alone was sufficient for kinase recruitment. The Src family kinases Src, Fyn, and Yes are expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To determine whether recruitment of Src family kinases could account for the increase in Shc-associated tyrosine kinase activity, Shc immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Src, Fyn, or Yes. Only c-Src was detected in Shc immunoprecipitates from cells following LPA or EGF stimulation, as shown in Fig. 3A. Coprecipitation of a c-Src with Shc was also observed in cells transiently expressing a constitutively activated human c-Src mutant (Y530F) (23Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S. Kaplan P.L. Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Google Scholar, 24Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Google Scholar, 25Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the LPA-stimulated association between c-Src and Shc was rapid and transient, reaching a maximum within 1-2 min of stimulation. Thus, the time course of c-Src·Shc protein complex formation paralleled the time course of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of tyrosine kinase activity into Shc immunoprecipitates. Two- to 3-fold increases in c-Src autophosphorylation and kinase activity have been reported following stimulation of LPA (32Jalink K. Eicholtz T. Postma F.R. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255Google Scholar), α-thrombin, α2A adrenergic, M2 muscarinic (33Chen Y. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Google Scholar), and angiotensin II receptors (34Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Google Scholar). Because there is a correlation between autophosphorylation of Y416 and activation of the c-Src kinase (24Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Google Scholar), whole-cell lysates from stimulated cells were assayed for c-Src activation by immunoblotting using antiserum specific for autophosphorylated c-Src (anti-pY416 c-Src) (35Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, in control immunoblots of c-Src from cells expressing kinase-deficient, K298M (26Snyder M.A. Bishop J.M. McGrath J.P. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1772-1779Google Scholar) or constitutively autophosphorylated, Y530F, c-Src mutants, anti-pY416 c-Src exhibited high specificity for the autophosphorylated kinase. One min stimulation with LPA or EGF, or transient expression of Gβ1γ2 subunits, resulted in increased Y416 phosphorylated c-Src, consistent with c-Src kinase activation in response to stimulation. Both LPA stimulation and expression of Gβ1γ2 subunits resulted in 2-3-fold increases in autophosphorylated c-Src, as shown in Fig. 4B. LPA-induced c-Src autophosphorylation, like LPA-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 association, was pertussis toxin-sensitive (data not shown). Thus, LPA- and Gβγ subunit-stimulated c-Src·Shc protein complex formation correlated with activation of the kinase. The transforming viral oncogene product v-Src is known to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (36McGlade J. Cheng A. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8869-8873Google Scholar), suggesting that the cellular homologue might play a similar role. As shown in Fig. 5A, transient overexpression of wild-type c-Src or the Y530F and K298M mutants resulted in increased c-Src·Shc complex formation, detected in c-Src immunoblots performed on Shc immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 5B, Shc immunoprecipitates from wild-type c-Src and Y530F-expressing cells contained increased tyrosine kinase activity, whereas cells expressing the kinase inactive K298M mutant exhibited less than basal levels of Shc-associated tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the overexpressed kinase inactive mutant competed with endogenous kinase for Shc binding. Fig. 5C depicts the effects of c-Src overexpression on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation. Transient expression of wild-type c-Src or the activated Y530F mutant increased Shc phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 association to a level comparable to that observed following EGF stimulation. The ability of wild-type c-Src to induce Shc phosphorylation comparable to the constitutively active Y530F mutant probably results from the high levels of expression achieved in the transient transfection system. To determine whether c-Src expression could mimick the effects of LPA stimulation and Gβγ subunit expression on MAP kinases, we determined the effects of each on Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 6, stimulation of endogenous LPA receptors or transient overexpression of either Gβ1γ2 subunits or c-Src resulted in MAP kinase activation, as determined by an in vitro kinase assay following immunoprecipitation of coexpressed epitope-tagged p44MapK (30Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Google Scholar). In each case, MAP kinase activation was inhibited by coexpression of dominant negatives of mSos1 (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Google Scholar, 37Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Google Scholar), p21ras (28Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Google Scholar), and p74raf-1 (29Schaap D. van der Wal J. Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20232-20236Google Scholar), indicating that the activation was Ras-dependent. Thus, overexpression of c-Src mimicked the effects of LPA receptor activation and Gβγ subunit expression, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, Shc·Grb2 complex formation, and Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase. To directly determine whether Src family kinase activity is necessary for LPA receptor- and Gβγ subunit-mediated signaling, we determined the effects of cellular expression of the c-Src kinase, Csk, on Shc phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation. Csk is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase (22Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Scopus (510) Google Scholar) that inactivates Src family kinases by phosphorylating a carboxyl-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue. Mouse embryos lacking csk exhibit increased c-Src, Fyn, and Lyn activity and increased levels of tyrosine protein phosphorylation (38Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type Csk suppresses endogenous c-Src activity (39Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Google Scholar) and, in opossum kidney cells, blocks acid-induced activation of Na+/H+ antiporter, a process associated with p60c-src activation (40Yamaji Y. Amemiya M. Cano A. Preisig P.A. Miller R.T. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6274-6278Google Scholar). Fig. 7A depicts the effects of Csk overexpression on LPA- and EGF-stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 association in transfected COS-7 cells. EGF-induced Shc phosphorylation was reduced by approximately 40%, whereas the LPA-mediated signal was abolished. The inhibition of Shc·Grb2 complex formation paralleled the effects on Shc phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7B, LPA-stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation were reduced to levels not significantly different from basal in cells overexpressing Csk. The effects of Csk expression on MAP kinase activation are depicted in Fig. 8. In Csk-transfected cells, LPA-stimulated MAP kinase activation was reduced by 60% and Gβγ subunit-mediated activation by greater than 90%, with no significant effect on basal levels of MAP kinase activity. In contrast, EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation was impaired by only 25%, consistent with the less dramatic effects of Csk expression on EGF-mediated Shc phosphorylation. Phorbol ester-mediated MAP kinase activation and that resulting from overexpression of constitutively activated p21ras (T24ras) (27Spandidos D.A. Wilkie N.M. Nature. 1984; 310: 469-475Google Scholar) were not significantly affected, suggesting that the Csk-sensitive step lies at a point in the pathway upstream of Ras and is not involved with PKC-dependent MAP kinase activation. The partial inhibition of LPA-mediated MAP kinase activation by Csk overexpression, compared to nearly complete inhibition of LPA-stimulated Shc phosphorylation, probably reflects downstream signal amplification occurring in subsequent steps of the pathway. Although LPA receptors have been reported to couple both to Gi and Gq/11 family G proteins, LPA-stimulated MAP kinase activation observed in COS-7 cells was greater than 90% pertussis toxin-sensitive (data not shown). Thus, the alternative pertussis toxin-insensitive, Ras-independent, PKC-mediated MAP kinase activation pathway, used by M1 muscarinic and α1B adrenergic receptors in COS-7 cells (2Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Google Scholar), probably does not account for the residual signal in the CSK-expressing cells. The ability of Csk expression to inhibit pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-mediated Shc phosphorylation, Shc·Grb2 complex formation, and MAP kinase activation without affecting PKC- or T24ras-dependent MAP kinase activation suggests that Src family kinases are required for the G protein-coupled, receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events that precede Ras activation. Gi-coupled receptors transduce intracellular signals via the stimulation or inhibition of several effectors, including phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase isoforms and some ion channels. Recently, pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of the Src family kinases Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn in various cell types has been reported (14Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Google Scholar, 33Chen Y. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Google Scholar, 34Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Google Scholar), suggesting that these kinases may also function in Gi-coupled receptor signaling. Here, we demonstrate that recruitment and activation of c-Src is involved in Gi-coupled receptor-mediated activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. In COS-7 cells, LPA receptor stimulation leads to the rapid and transient formation of protein complexes containing Shc and c-Src, which parallels the time course of LPA-stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 association. These events are mimicked both by cellular expression of Gβγ subunits and activated c-Src mutants. Furthermore, expression of Csk, which inactivates Src kinases, inhibits both LPA receptor-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation, indicating that Src family kinase activity is an important intermediate in the signal transduction pathway. These results support a model of MAP kinase activation wherein stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors and release of free Gβγ subunits leads to activation of c-Src- and Src kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, followed by Grb2-mediated recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Ras activation. Our data directly implicate c-Src in Gβγ subunit-mediated MAP kinase activation in COS-7 cells. Although it is likely that other Src family tyrosine kinases, such as Lyn, Fyn and Yes, function in an analogous manner in other cell types, we were able to demonstrate only c-Src in Shc immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cells. Since Csk specifically phosphorylates and inactivates Src family kinases, such as Src, Fyn, and Yes (41Okada S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20737-20741Google Scholar), its inhibition of LPA receptor and Gβγ subunit-mediated MAP kinase activation in COS-7 cells supports a requirement for c-Src in the pathway. Since transient overexpression of c-Src was sufficient to cause Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Grb2 recruitment, LPA receptor-mediated activation of Src kinase is probably sufficient to account for the tyrosine phosphorylation events required for Ras activation. In our system, coexpression of the kinase-deficient K298M c-Src mutant also blocks LPA- and Gβγ subunit-stimulated MAP kinase activation. Unlike CSK expression, however, this construct also strongly inhibits EGF receptor-, T24Ras-, and PMA-stimulated MAP kinase activation (data not shown). This apparently nonspecific effect on MAP kinase activation probably results from overexpression of the c-Src SH2 domain, which at high levels of expression could function as a relatively nonspecific phosphotyrosine-binding protein, blocking the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway at some point downstream of the initial c-Src-dependent phosphorylations. The detection of endogenous or transiently expressed c-Src in Shc immunoprecipitates may reflect either a direct interaction between the two molecules or an association of both with an unknown intermediate. However, in stimulated neutrophils (14Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Google Scholar), the Lyn kinase can be precipitated by a Shc-SH2 domain containing fusion protein, supporting the hypothesis that the interaction between Shc and this Src family kinase is direct and SH2 domain-mediated. Activation of c-Src via G protein-coupled receptors may also provide a direct link between this class of receptor and other receptor pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Src associates with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor, EGF receptor, and ErbB2 (42Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J. Gilmer T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 83-87Google Scholar) and phosphorylates EGF receptor and ErbB2 on nonautophosphorylation sites required for the binding of Src and possibly other signaling molecules (43Stover D.R. Becker M. Liebetanz J. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15591-15597Google Scholar). Genistein-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and IRS-1 following thrombin stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells has been reported (44Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27871-27875Google Scholar). Thus, Src activation might provide a mechanism for G protein-coupled, receptor-mediated assembly of a mitogenic signaling complex directly on a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor scaffold. Recent data have suggested such a role for platelet-derived growth factor receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells (45Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Google Scholar) and for EGF receptor and p185neu in Rat-1 fibroblasts (46Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Google Scholar). Src is also known to redistribute into a cytoskeletal compartment upon activation, where it associates with integrin-dependent cytoskeletal complexes. Bombesin, vasopressin, endothelin, thrombin, and LPA receptors stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase through both PKC-dependent and -independent pathways. In addition to focal adhesion kinase and Src, integrin signaling complexes contain Csk, the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, PI3K, and Grb2/mSos, suggesting that these complexes may regulate intracellular signal transduction pathways as well as integrin-mediated cell adhesive interactions (47Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). The focal adhesion kinase-related protein-tyrosine kinase PYK-2, which is highly expressed in brain, has been implicated in Shc·Grb2·Sos complex formation. Activation of PYK-2 is Ca2+ and PKC-dependent and occurs following stimulation of the Gq-coupled bradykinin receptor in PC12 cells (48Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar). Thus, in appropriate tissues, G protein-coupled, receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ influx might mediate Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation via PYK-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. The mechanism whereby Gβγ subunit-regulated effector(s) promote Src kinase activation remains unclear. Gβγ subunit-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization are unable to account for Gβγ subunit-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-7 cells (4van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Google Scholar, 8van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Google Scholar). Gβγ subunit-mediated phosphorylation of p52shc is inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, (15Touhara K. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9284-9287Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3K activity is required for assembly of the Ras activation complex. Gβγ subunit-sensitive PI3K activity has been described in neutrophils and platelets (49Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Google Scholar, 50Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Google Scholar), and the recently cloned p110 PI3Kγ can be activated by Gβγ subunits (51Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Google Scholar). Association between c-Src and PI3K has been reported in chicken embryo fibroblasts expressing activated c-Src mutants (52Chan T.O. Tanaka A. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3280-3283Google Scholar). Direct interaction between phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and the Src SH2 domain has also been proposed (53Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Google Scholar) and might contribute to the localization or activation of the kinase. The Src family tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lyn, and Hck have been reported to interact with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in hematopoietic cells via an SH3 domain-mediated interaction (53Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Google Scholar). Src/Btk interaction is associated with Btk autoactivation (54Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Google Scholar). Btk, and the related tyrosine kinases Itk, Tsk, and TecA, like the serine/threonine kinases βARK1 and βARK2, contain pleckstrin homology domains. The pleckstrin homology domain of βARK is required for kinase regulation, because it mediates Gβγ subunit- and phosphatidylinositol-dependent translocation of the kinase from cytosol to membrane (55Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Google Scholar, 56Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). The activation of Btk and Tsk by Gβγ subunits has been reported (57Langhansrajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Google Scholar). These findings raise the interesting possibility that Gβγ subunits, possibly in conjunction with the products of PI3K, might regulate a class of tyrosine protein kinase in a manner analogous to the βARK kinases and provide the initial signaling events leading to Src family kinase activation and a program of tyrosine protein phosphorylation. The relevance of G protein-coupled, receptor-regulated PI3K and pleckstrin homology domain-containing tyrosine protein kinases to the pathway of c-Src-dependent Ras and MAP kinase activation remains the subject of further study.

https://openalex.org/W2108246317,"Indolicidin is a cationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from bovine neutrophils. It consists of only 13 amino acids, has the highest tryptophan content of any known protein, and is amidated at the carboxyl terminus in nature. By circular dichroism spectroscopy a weak poly-L-proline II extended helix structure was observed that became substantially more pronounced upon interaction with liposomes. Indolicidin bound purified surface lipopolysaccharide with high affinity and permeabilized the outer membrane of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to the small hydrophobic molecule 1-<i>N</i>-phenylnapthylamine (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 200), results consistent with indolicidin crossing the outer membrane via the self-promoted uptake pathway. The methyl esterification of indolicidin's carboxyl terminus increased its activity for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In Gram-negative bacteria this was associated with an increased binding to lipopolysaccharide and increased permeabilization of the outer membrane. The cytoplasmic membrane was the site of action of indolicidin as assayed in <i>E. coli</i> by the unmasking of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase due to membrane permeabilization. The mechanism for this activity was shown to be the ability of the peptide to cause an increase in the transmembrane current of planar lipid bilayers. This current increase was activated by transmembrane potentials in excess of −70 to −80 mV. Consistent with this, there was a substantial decrease in indolicidin-mediated bacterial killing and permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane of <i>E. coli</i> that had been pretreated with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-<i>m</i>-chlorophenyl hydrazone. In planar bilayers, indolicidin induced the formation of discrete channels, which ranged in conductance from 0.05-0.15 nS. Thus despite the small size and unique composition of indolicidin, it was capable of killing Gram-negative bacteria by crossing the outer membrane and causing disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by channel formation."

The cloning of the respective genes allowed testing of the hypothesis that the selective neuronal loss in these disorders was a reflection of restricted expression of the mRNA transcript or protein in those cells undergoing degeneration.

At both the DNA and protein level, significant somatic mosaicism of the CAG (polyglutamine) repeat was demonstrated in tissues from affected patients with HD, with the predominant levels of mosaicism in the caudate nucleus and the cortex, those regions most severely affected in HD (14Telenius H.

This clearly indicates that somatic mosaicism was not likely to be a major factor in the genetically determined selective neuronal loss in HD or these other disorders (15Chong S.S. McCall A.E. Cota J. Subramony S.H. Orr H.T. Hughes M.R. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 344-350Google Scholar, 16Ueno S. Kondah K. Kotani Y. Komure O. Kuno S. Kawai J. Hazama F. Sano A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 663-666Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that the selective neuropathology of these disorders could be related not only to expression of the gene containing CAG expansion, but to a protein with restricted expression with which the gene product normally associates (17Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1400-1451Google Scholar, 18Nasir J. Floresco S.B. O'Kusky J.R. Diewert V.M. Richman J.M. Zeisler J. Borowski A. Marth J.D. Phillips A.G. Hayden M.R. Cell. 1995; 81: 811-823Google Scholar). To identify proteins interacting with the HD gene product, we exploited the yeast two-hybrid system (19Fields S. Song O-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar, 20Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Google Scholar) and identified a human protein with an affinity for the amino terminus of the HD protein. This protein has complete amino acid identity with the previously described bovine ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme known as E2-25K (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). The E2-25K ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme belongs to a family of proteins that participate in the linking of COOH-terminal glycine residues of ubiquitin to specific lysine residues of target proteins (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). This ubiquitination leads to target protein degradation by the 26 S proteosome (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Google Scholar, 23Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Google Scholar, 24Deshaies R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 428-434Google Scholar, 25Wefes I. Mastrandrea L.D. Haldeman M. Koury S.T. Tamburlin J. Pickart C.M. Finley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4982-4986Google Scholar). We demonstrate that hE2-25K is highly expressed in brain and that cell-derived huntingtin interacts with purified hE2-25K in vitro. In addition, we clearly show that huntingtin is ubiquitinated in peripheral cells, which may have implications for the regulated catabolism of this protein. An HD cDNA construct (44EKpGBT9), with 44 glutamine repeats was generated containing amino acids 1-540 of the published HD cDNA (1Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Google Scholar, 26Goldberg Y.P. Kalchman M.A. Zeisler J. Graham R. Koide H.B. O'Kusky J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Jirik F. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5 (177185): 2Google Scholar). This cDNA fragment was fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) of the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBT9 (Clontech). Another HD cDNA construct, 16EKpGBT9, was identical to 44EKpGBT9 but included only 16 glutamine repeats. Another clone (DMKΔBamHIpGBT9) containing the first 544 amino acids of the myotonic dystrophy gene (a gift from R. Korneluk) was fused in-frame with the GAL4-DNA BD of pGBT9 and was used as a negative control. Plasmids expressing the GAL4-BDRAD7 2D. Gietz, unpublished data. and SIR3 (27Paetkau D.W. Riese J.A. MacMorran W.S. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2035-2045Google Scholar) were used as positive controls for the β-galactosidase filter assay. The yeast strain Y190 (MATa leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, trp1-901, his3-Δ200, ade2-101, gal4Δgal80Δ, URA3::GAL1-lacZ, Lys2::GAL-His3 cyh) (28Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar) was used for all transformations and assays. Yeast transformations were performed using a modified lithium acetate transformation protocol (29Schiestl R.H. Manivasakum Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Johnston M. Fields S. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 79Google Scholar) and grown at 30°C using appropriate synthetic complete dropout media. The β-galactosidase chromogenic filter assays were performed by transferring the yeast colonies onto Whatman filters. The yeast cells were partially lysed by submerging the filters in liquid nitrogen for 15-20 s. Filters were allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 5 min and placed onto filter paper presoaked in Z-buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4) supplemented with 50 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.07 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside. Filters were placed at 37°C for up to 8 h. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed by inoculating a single yeast colony into appropriate synthetic complete dropout media and grown to OD600 0.6-1.5. Five milliliters of overnight culture was pelleted and washed once with 1 ml of Z-Buffer, then resuspended in 100 µl of Z-Buffer supplemented with 38 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.05% SDS. Acid-washed glass beads (~100 µl) were added to each sample and vortexed for 4 min, by repeatedly alternating a 30-s vortex, with 30 s on ice. Each sample was pelleted and 10 µl of lysate was added to 500 µl of lysis buffer. The samples were incubated in a 30°C water bath for 30 s and then 100 µl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside solution was added to each tube. The reaction was allowed to continue for 13 min at 30°C and stopped by the addition of 500 µl of 1 M Na2CO3 and placing the samples on ice. Subsequently, OD420 was taken in order to calculate the β-galactosidase activity with the equation 1000 × OD420/(t × V × OD600) (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), where t is the elapsed time (minutes) and V is the amount of lysate used. A human adult brain Matchmaker™ cDNA library (Clontech) was transformed into the yeast strain Y190 already harboring the 44EKpGBT9 construct. The transformants were plated onto 100 150 × 15-mm circular culture dishes containing synthetic complete media deficient in Trp, Leu, and His. The herbicide 3-aminotriazole (25 mM) was utilized to limit the number of false His+ positives (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chem P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Google Scholar). The yeast transformants were placed at 30°C for 5 days and β-galactosidase filter assays were performed on all colonies found after this time, as described above, to identify β-galactosidase+ clones. Primary His+/β-galactosidase+ clones were then orderly patched onto a grid on synthetic complete -Trp/-Leu/-His (25 mM 3-aminotriazole) plates and assayed again for His+ growth and the ability to turn blue with a filter assay. Secondary positives were identified for further analysis. Proteins encoded by positive cDNAs were designated as HIPs. The HIP activating domain (AD) cDNA plasmids were isolated by growing the His+/β-galactosidase+ colony in synthetic complete -Leu media overnight, lysing the cells with acid-washed glass beads and electroporating the bacterial strain, KC8 (leuB auxotrophic) with the yeast lysate. The KC8 ampicillin-resistant colonies were replica plated onto M9 (-Leu) plates. The plasmid DNA from M9+ colonies was transformed into DH5-α for further manipulation. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an ABI PCR-mate oligo-synthesizer. DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI 373 fluorescent automated DNA sequencer. The HIP cDNAs were confirmed to be in-frame with the GAL4-AD by sequencing across the AD-HIP-2 cloning junction using an AD oligonucleotide (5′-GAA GAT ACC CCA CCA AAC-3′). Subsequently, primer walking was used to determine the remaining sequences. In order to obtain the most 5′ sequence of the hE2-25K gene, direct sequencing of a gel purified RT-PCR product was performed. First strand cDNA was generated using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturers recommendations (BRL) following annealing of the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CCG TGC GGA GAG TCA TTG CAG CTG-3′ to total RNA. Subsequent PCR was performed using the same reverse primer used for the RT reaction and a forward primer (5′-GAC ATG GCC AAC ATC GCG GTG CAG-3′) derived from the bE2-25K nucleotide sequence. The HIP-2 cDNA was released from the GAL4-AD library plasmid, pGAD10, by digestion with NotI, ligated into the NotI site of pGEX4T-2 (Pharmacia) and electroporated into DH5-α. A clone in the correct orientation was electroporated into the Escherichia coli host BL21 (Pharmacia) for expression of the GST protein. A single colony of both GST-HIP-2 and GST alone were inoculated into 5 ml of LB liquid media supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37°C with good aeration. The 5-ml culture was subcultured into a 30-ml LB culture supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and grown shaking overnight at 37°C. The 30-ml culture was poured into 500 ml of 2 × YT media supplemented with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and grown shaking overnight at 26°C. Two hundred and fifty-milliliter aliquots of culture were pelleted and resuspended in 12.5 ml of ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. The bacterial suspension was sonicated with 30-s intervals for 10 min. The supernatant was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column (500 µl). The column was washed 3 times with 10 ml of ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. One milliliter of 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was used to elute the GST protein from the glutathione beads. The eluted protein was subsequently diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and dialyzed overnight against 1 × phosphate-buffered saline to remove the glutathione. Clones containing either 44 or 16 glutamine repeats, from amino acid 1 through 540 were cloned (26Goldberg Y.P. Kalchman M.A. Zeisler J. Graham R. Koide H.B. O'Kusky J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Jirik F. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5 (177185): 2Google Scholar) into the RcCMV vector (Invitrogen). The in vitro HD products were synthesized according to the manufacturers directions for the TnT-Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) except 1 mM cold L-methionine was substituted for L-[35S]methionine. The in vitro products were aliquoted and stored at −70°C. To generate monoclonal antibodies against the HD protein, part of the HD cDNA from nucleotide 5345 in exon 39 to nucleotide 6257 in exon 44 was cloned in-frame into the bacterial pATH expression vector (32Koemer T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 477-491Google Scholar). Approximately 20 µg of fusion protein was injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice in the presence of Freund's adjuvant. Following three additional boosts, spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with NS1 myeloma cells to generate antibody secreting hybridomas. Culture supernatants were screened for anti-HD antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using bacterial TrpE as a negative control. Approximately 600 hybrid clones were generated, of which 35 recognized the fusion protein. Seven of these did not react with the trpE portion of the fusion protein and were used for further analysis. Western blot analysis revealed that one of the clones secreted antibodies (GHM1) that recognized the 350-kDa human HD protein but did not recognize the HD murine homologue. In order to generate an HD amino-terminal polyclonal antibody, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 3-16 (TLEKLMKAFESLKSC) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet homocyanin using succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate). Two female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with this peptide antigen with Freund's adjuvant. Antibodies were purified on an affinity column, made with synthesized peptide bound to thiol-activated Sepharose. Purified antibodies (BKP1) were used for Western blotting and detected a 350-kDa protein in human and mouse tissues and also in cell lines, including 293 cell and ES cell lines containing the HD gene, but not in ES cell lines lacking the HD gene. Five microliters of in vitro translated HD proteins (amino acids 1-540 with either 44 or 16 glutamine repeats) were incubated with GST-HIP-2 and GST (10 µg each) in 500 µl of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl) for 2 h at 4°C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 µl) were then added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were pelleted for 5 min, and washed 3 times with reaction buffer containing 3% Nonidet P-40. Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, applied to 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). Immunodetection was performed using one of two HD NH2-terminal polyclonal antibodies (AP78 or BKP1). For the experiments with 293 cell lysates, GST-HIP-2, GST-PTPase and GST were incubated with 300 µl of cell lysate (~500 µg of total protein) and 200 µl of reaction buffer. In order to confirm that HIP-2 is in fact encoded for the hE2-25K protein, an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-bE2-25K antibody (33Haldeman M. Finley D. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9507-9516Google Scholar) was immunoreacted against the HIP-2 fusion protein after transfer onto a PVDF membrane from a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Although this antibody is highly specific for detection of the E2-25K protein, it has been shown not to be useful as an immunoprecipitating antibody. 3G. Xia and C. Pickart, unpublished experiments. The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) and immunoreacted in blocking buffer with the anti-bE2-25K polyclonal antibody (1:5000) for 1 h. After washing the membrane three times in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20), a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000) (Bio-Rad) was immunoreacted against the blots for 1 h followed by washing as described above. The blot was subsequently incubated with ECL solution (Amersham) and exposed to ECL-Hyperfilm (Amersham). An aliquot of purified bE2-25K was used as a positive control. The hE2-25K was mapped to chromosome 4p14 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (34Lichter P. Tang C.J. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Google Scholar) to normal human lymphocyte chromosomes counterstained with propidium iodide and DAPI. Biotinylated probe was detected with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Images of metaphase preparations were captured by a thermoelectrically cooled charge coupled camera (Photometrics). Separate images of DAPI banded chromosomes (35Heng H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1993; 102: 325-332Google Scholar) and FITC targeted chromosomes were obtained. Hybridization signals were acquired and merged using image analysis software and pseudo colored blue (DAPI) and yellow (fluorescein isothiocyanate) as described (36Boyle A.L. Feltquite D.M. Dracopoli N.C. Housman D.E. Ward D.C. Genomics. 1992; 12: 106-115Google Scholar) and overlaid electronically. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (33Haldeman M. Finley D. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9507-9516Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized with a PAGE purified antisense riboprobe as described previously (37MacDonald R.J. Smith G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Google Scholar). The riboprobe was labeled to a specific activity of ~109 cpm/µg and approximately 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled probe was used to probe the filter. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 media. Cultured cells, human, mouse, and rat tissues were sonicated in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.25 mM sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate: with 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, and 100 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein extracts (as specified in figure legends) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. Filters were then probed with an affinity-purified anti-bE2-25K polyclonal antibody (33Haldeman M. Finley D. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9507-9516Google Scholar), with detection by ECL. An Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line was used to determine if the HD protein is a substrate for ubiquitin conjugation. Cells from lymphoblasts of a heterozygote for HD were lysed in buffer containing Nonidet P-40, and supplemented with N-ethylmaleimide to inactivate endogenous de-ubiquitinating enzymes (38Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of cell lysate was mixed with dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) to give a final volume of 50 µl. Five microliters of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ubiquitin were added and the mixture rotated at 4°C for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), 50 µl of a 1:1 slurry in dilution buffer, was then added, and the suspension was rotated at room temperature for 30 min. The resin was pelleted, then washed four times with 500 µl of dilution buffer. The beads were suspended in 40 µl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 1 min. The resin was pelleted and 20-µl aliquots were electrophoresed on 5.5% and 10% mini-gels. Proteins in each gel were transferred to PVDF membrane in a buffer containing 10 mM CAPS (pH 10) and 10% methanol. The blot derived from the 10% gel was probed with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. The blot derived from the 5.5% gel was probed with the anti-HD monoclonal antibody GHM1. In both cases, detection was by ECL using a commercial secondary antibody. Samples with either no cell lysate or no anti-ubiquitin antibody were used as negative controls. A non-immunoprecipitated aliquot was used as a positive control for the detection of the HD protein. An HD cDNA spanning amino acids 1-540 and containing a polyglutamine tract of 44 residues was fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and used in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Approximately 4.0 × 107 -Trp/-Leu transformants were screened to isolate a number of HIPs from an adult human brain Matchmaker™ cDNA library. A total of 14 positive clones passed through a second round of His+/β-galactosidase screening. These 14 clones could be divided into three classes. The single HIP-2 clone represented a 2048-base pair cDNA. In addition, other cDNAs coding for HIP-1 and HIP-3 were identified and are currently being characterized. The HIP-2-GAL4 activating domain fusion protein was shown to specifically interact with the GAL4BD-HD fusion protein, as yeast containing HIP-2 and the HD protein (amino acids 1-540) gave a His+ phenotype as well as showed β-galactosidase activity in a chromogenic filter assay (Fig. 1A). Specificity of interaction was shown by the finding that HIP-2 did not stimulate β-galactosidase activity with the DNA-binding domain, with vector alone (pGBT9), or with an unrelated fusion with myotonin kinase control (Fig. 1, A and B). We next sought to determine whether the size of the polyglutamine tract influenced the interaction of HIP-2 with the HD protein. We performed semi-quantitative analysis using liquid β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1B). This revealed no difference in the strength of the interaction between HIP-2 and HD constructs (amino acids 1-540) containing either 44 or 16 glutamine repeats. Smaller fusion proteins containing either 44 or 16 glutamine repeats and the first 242 amino acids of the HD cDNA were also tested for interaction with HIP-2. There was no detectable interaction (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, assessment of a fusion protein containing residues 125 to 540 alone did not reveal any interaction suggesting that an intact amino-terminal region encompassing the entire first 540 residues is essential for this interaction (data not shown). In order to assess the interaction between the HIP-2 protein and HD, in vitro binding assays were performed using GST fusion proteins. In vitro translated products corresponding to the first 540 amino acids containing either 44 or 16 glutamine repeats of the HD protein were incubated with GST-HIP-2 protein linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The HD protein was retained on the beads, whereas no significant interaction was observed with the GST protein alone (Fig. 2A). The interaction was not obviously influenced by repeat size, consistent with the results obtained in the quantitative interaction assays of fusion proteins bearing different length glutamine repeats (Fig. 1B). Co-affinity purification experiments were also performed using a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) cell lysates to assess the interaction between HIP-2 and endogenous full-length HD protein. Incubation of HEK293 lysate with GST-HIP-2 linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads resulted in specific affinity purification of the 350-kDa HD protein on the beads (Fig. 2B). The HD protein failed to copurify with the GST-PTPase or GST protein alone. The detection of the HD protein on Western blots could be blocked by preincubation with peptide antigen (data not shown). Analysis of sequence data revealed that the HIP-2 protein had complete amino acid identity with a previously described bovine E2-25K (bE2-25K) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). Our original HIP-2 cDNA spanned all but the most 5′ 99 nucleotides of the published bovine sequence (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). Thus the N-terminal 33 residues of the E2 protein are not necessary for the interaction of E2-25K with huntingtin. The DNA sequence spanning the coding region for the first 33 amino acids was generated by RT-PCR using a 5′ primer based on the published E2-25K sequence (“Experimental Procedures”). There is 95% nucleotide identity and 100% amino acid identity between the bE2-25K and this human E2-25K (hE2-25K) protein, both of which comprise 200 amino acids (Fig. 3A). Residue 23 in the hE2-25K amino sequence is a serine while the published bE2-25K has a threonine at this codon (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). However, resequencing of the bE2-25K cDNA revealed that the bovine enzyme also has a threonine at this codon. 4L. Mastrandrea and C. Pickart, unpublished experiments. There are a total of 19 conservative nucleotide changes in the coding region and nine nucleotide changes in the known 3′-untranslated region sequence between human and bovine E2-25K cDNA (Fig. 3A). The HIP-2 cDNA isolated from the HD yeast two-hybrid screen contains an additional 3′-untranslated region sequence relative to that published for the bovine gene (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google Scholar). The complete identity between the bovine and human E2-25K enzymes places hE2-25K in the same class of conjugating enzymes as the E2- encoded by the UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 genes of S. cerevisiae (21Chen Z. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Google"
https://openalex.org/W2002244693,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumors and cancer cell lines demonstrate a wide variety of biochemical changes. In this study we used drug-sensitive wild-type (wt) cancer cell lines and respective MDR subclones, and we demonstrate the accumulation of distinct lipids in MDR cells. These lipids were either absent or present at very low levels in drug-sensitive cells. The compounds, termed lipid-1 and lipid-2, migrated on thin-layer chromatography as a doublet. They could be radiolabeled by incubating MCF-7-AdrR (Adriamycin-resistant) breast cancer cells with [3H]serine, [3H]palmitic acid, or [3H]galactose. Utilization of these precursors by MCF-7-wt cells for synthesis of lipid-1 and −2 was minimal. Two inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis, L-cycloserine and fumonisin B1, prevented the observed accumulation of the lipid compounds. An inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, completely abolished the formation of lipid-1 and −2 in MCF-7-AdrR cells and, to a lesser extent, inhibited the formation of lactosylceramides and gangliosides. Utilizing mass spectrometry, the multidrug resistance-associated lipids were further characterized as monoglycosylceramides of two major species that contained either 16-carbon (palmitic) or 24-carbon (lignoceric and nervonic) fatty acids. The carbohydrate head group of glycosylceramides was identified as glucose, not galactose, thus designating the accumulated lipids as glucosylceramides. Incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into glucosylceramide was strikingly higher (8-10 times) in MCF-7-AdrR cells compared with MCF-7-wt cells. Since the rate of glucosylceramide degradation in MCF-7-AdrR cells was not attenuated, accelerated glycosphingolipid synthesis in MDR cells is suggested. Glucosylceramide also accumulated in KB-V-1, a vinblastine-resistant epidermoid carcinoma but not in KB-3-1, drug-sensitive wt cells. MDR ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (NIH:OVCAR-3) also contained elevated levels of glucosylceramide. Our results demonstrate a correlation between cellular drug resistance and alterations in glucosylceramide metabolism.

MDR ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (NIH:OVCAR-3) also contained elevated levels of glucosylceramide. Our results demonstrate a correlation between cellular drug resistance and alterations in glucosylceramide metabolism.

Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that this resistance is due to the ability of cells to lower intracellular drug concentration. Overexpression of the membrane efflux transporter P-gp is the most consistent alteration in MDR cells (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar, 3Bradley G. Ling V.

Science. 1992; 255: 459-562Google Scholar); however, the physiologic function and mechanisms of action of P-gp are largely unknown. Moreover, the widespread drug resistance of human lung tumors (5Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deely R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar) is unrelated to overexpression of P-gp and indicates the existence of additional resistance mechanisms. The multifactorial nature of multidrug resistance is exemplified by a wide array of other biochemical changes including alterations in membrane fluidity and structure (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar), elevated glutathione S-transferase activity (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1994; 202: 211-217Google Scholar), and elevated transcription of c-fos, c-myc and c-Ha-ras (4Chin K.-V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1992; 255: 459-562Google Scholar, 6Volm M.

Cancer. 1994; 59: 208-211Google Scholar).In this study, we show that a unique glycosphingolipid pattern is associated with MDR cells. Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated with formation of 3-ketosphinganine by condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, followed by reduction of the keto group (producing sphinganine) and addition of an amide-linked fatty acid (Fig. 1A; Ref. 9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Google Scholar). The ceramide formed is further metabolized to sphingomyelin or glycosylceramide 2Throughout this article “glycosylceramide” is used to refer to ceramide that bears nonspecified sugar moiety (either glucose or galactose). by addition of the appropriate headgroup. De novo synthesis can be followed by incubation of cells with radiolabeled serine or palmitic acid and, in the case of glycosphingolipids, by incubation with radiolabeled galactose. In recent years, clues regarding the function of sphingolipids have been revealed by the discovery and use of sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors (Fig. 1A). These include inhibitors of 3-ketosphinganine synthase (L-cycloserine), ceramide synthase (FB1), and glucosylceramide synthase (PPMP) (10Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 577-581Google Scholar, 11Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Google Scholar, 12Lee K.J. Boyd S.A. Radin N.S.

(Tokyo). 1992; 111: 191-196Google Scholar).Glucosylceramides are the most widely distributed glycosphingolipids in cells serving as precursors for the biosynthesis of over 200 known glycosphingolipids. In addition to their role as building blocks of biological membranes, glycosphingolipids have long attracted attention because of their putative involvement in cell proliferation (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar), differentiation (15Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirchberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Google Scholar, 16Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Google Scholar), and oncogenic transformation (17Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Google Scholar, 18Morton D.L. Ravindranath M.H. Irie R.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 251-275Google Scholar). In addition, some metabolites of glycosphingolipids, such as sphingoid bases, ceramides, and lysosphingolipids, are suggested to have a second messenger function in signal transduction pathways involving growth (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar, 19Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Google Scholar), apoptosis (20Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Google Scholar), and the action of tumor necrosis factor-α (21Dressler K.A. Mathias S. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1992; 255: 1715-1718Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that specific glycosphingolipids, identified as glucosylceramides, accumulate in MDR cancer cells. This finding poses intriguing questions regarding the role of glucosylceramide in multidrug resistance.RESULTSDuring TLC analysis of total lipids obtained from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells, we noted the presence of two compounds migrating as a doublet in drug-resistant cells. Fig. 2 shows the lipid composition of MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. The compounds in question, migrated in solvent system II with Rf values of 0.5 and 0.45. There was a remarkable difference in the appearance of these lipids in wt versus MDR cells, the drug-sensitive cells being nearly devoid of lipid-1 and completely devoid of lipid-2. The chromatogram also shows that MCF-7-wt cells contained a lipid (lipid X) migrating just below lipid-2 (Rf value of 0.42). Preliminary work indicated that lipid-1 and −2 did not contain glycerol, choline, or ethanolamine and migrated just below sphinganine (solvent system I). The sphingoid base nature of lipid-1 and −2 was further pursued.Fig. 2Thin-layer chromatographic char of lipids from MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. Extracted lipids, 100 µg/lane, were resolved by TLC using solvent system II. Lipids were visualized by H2SO4 charring as described under “Experimental Procedures” and identified by migration with commercial standards. X, unknown lipid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Radiolabeling Using Sphingolipid PrecursorsMCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells were incubated for 24 h in medium containing [3H]serine, [3H]palmitic acid, or [3H]galactose. The incorporation of radioactivity into cell lipids was assessed by autoradiography (Fig. 3) and by liquid scintillation counting of tritium in the indicated areas of the chromatogram. [3H]Serine was incorporated into lipids of MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells and was mainly confined to PE (43.7 and 29.5%, respectively) and SM (6.9 and 10.9%, respectively). However, the incorporation of [3H]serine into lipid-1 and −2 was much more marked in MCF-7-AdrR cells (Fig. 3A), where it accounted for 4.5% of total radiolabeled lipids compared with 0.52% in MCF-7-wt cells. [3H]Palmitic acid was likewise used for the synthesis of complex lipids in wt and MDR cells and was incorporated mainly into PC (35.9 and 41.1%, respectively), PE (9.4 and 9.5%, respectively), and SM (3.4 and 6.9%, respectively). However, biosynthesis of lipid-1 and −2 from palmitic acid precursor was visible only in MDR cells (Fig. 3B). The autoradiograph in Fig. 3B also shows that MCF-7-wt cells incorporate radioactivity into a neutral lipid (lowermost spot, neutral lipid area). The comigration of this neutral lipid with oleoyl alcohol (solvent system IV) indicates that it is a fatty alcohol (data not shown). This is in accordance with previous work showing that fatty alcohol accumulates in MCF-7 wt cells but not in MDR MCF-7 variants (24Welsh C.J. Robinson M. Warne T.R. Pierce J.H. Yea G.C. Phang J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 41-47Google Scholar). Data of a more qualitative nature were obtained from experiments using [3H]galactose. Fig. 3C shows that [3H]galactose was utilized by MDR cells for synthesis of lipid-1 and −2. Radioincorporation was markedly pronounced in MCF-7-AdrR cells; MCF-7-wt cells demonstrated slight incorporation into lipid-1 and no incorporation into lipid-2. Collectively, the data (Fig. 3) suggest that lipids-1 and −2, accumulating in MDR cells, are glycosphingolipids. A comparison of the migration of commercial glucosylceramides (Gaucher's spleen) with lipid-1 and −2 radioactivity revealed a comigration. Work in other cell types has amply demonstrated the central position played by glycosylceramide in glycosphingolipid synthesis (12Lee K.J. Boyd S.A. Radin N.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 144: 148-154Google Scholar, 13Abe A. Inokuchi J.-I. Jimbo M. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Shayman J.A. Shukla G.S. Radin N.S. J. Biochem.

From the data of Fig. 3C it also appears that elevated glycosylceramide in MDR cells leads to enhanced formation of higher glycosphingolipids (lactosylceramide, gangliosides).Fig. 3Autoradiograph of lipids from MCF-7 cells incubated with radiolabeled sphingolipid precursors. MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells, grown to near-confluency in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes, were labeled with [3H]serine ([3H]ser) (A), [3H]palmitic acid ([3H]pal) (B), or [3H]galactose ([3H]gal) (C), for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA. Equal aliquots (based on uptake of radioactivity) of extracted cell lipids were analyzed by TLC using solvent system I (panels A and B) and solvent system III (panel C). The autoradiography of a representative chromatogram is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify that lipid-1 and −2 synthesis originates from a pathway involving sphingoid bases, sphinganine was added exogenously to the cell culture medium. As shown in Fig. 4, sphinganine supplementation caused a time-dependent elevation in the mass of lipid-1 in MCF-7-wt cells and elevation in the mass of lipid-1 and −2 in MCF-7-AdrR cells (detected by TLC charring). In addition, whereas lipid-1 from both cell lines migrated with an Rf value of 0.53, lipid-2 did not appear in MCF-7-wt cells. Instead, synthesis of lipid X increased, indicating that lipid X is a sphingolipid.Fig. 4Metabolism of sphinganine by MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. Cells, in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes, were incubated with 5.0 µM sphinganine/BSA (prepared at a 1:1 molar ratio) for the times indicated. Lipids were extracted, and a 100-µg lipid aliquot of each sample was resolved by TLC in solvent system II. The TLC plate was charred as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of two independent experiments that gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Inhibitors of Sphingolipid Biosynthesis on Lipid-1 and Lipid-2 AccumulationWe used MCF-7-AdrR cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]serine to investigate the effects of various inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis. The first enzymatic reaction in sphingoid base biosynthesis, catalyzed by 3-ketosphinganine synthase, is the formation of 3-ketosphinganine from serine and palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of cells with L-cycloserine, an inhibitor of 3-ketosphinganine synthase, caused almost complete disappearance of lipid-1 and major reduction in lipid-2 levels (Fig. 5A). Ceramide synthase, which catalyzes formation of ceramide via an acylation reaction, can be inhibited by FB1 (11Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Google Scholar, 15Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirchberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Google Scholar, 26Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Google Scholar). Preincubation of MCF-7-AdrR cells with FB1 caused a profound reduction in the levels of lipid-1 and −2 (Fig. 5B). In further experiments, the glycolipid nature of the accumulating lipids in MDR cells was investigated using PPMP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (12Lee K.J. Boyd S.A. Radin N.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 144: 148-154Google Scholar, 13Abe A. Inokuchi J.-I. Jimbo M. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Shayman J.A. Shukla G.S. Radin N.S. J. Biochem.

Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, PPMP blocked completely the formation of lipid-1 and −2. This effect was accompanied by an elevation in ceramide levels and a reduction in lactosylceramide and ganglioside levels (Fig. 5C), reflecting the ability of PPMP to block glycolipid synthesis distal to glycosylceramide. These observations suggest that the metabolic steps governing the accumulation of lipid-1 and −2 are closely associated with glycosylation/deglycosylation events.Fig. 5Effect of inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis on lipid-1 and −2 formation in MCF-7-AdrR cells. Cells, grown to near-confluency in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes, were radiolabeled for 24 h (in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA) with [3H]palmitic acid (A) or [3H]serine (B and C) in the presence or absence of 10 mML-cycloserine (A), 50 µM FB1 (B), or 20 µM PPMP (C). Extracted lipids were analyzed by TLC using solvent system II (A and B) or solvent system III (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of Glycosylceramide Structural ComponentsIn order to definitively establish structure, TLC-purified preparations of lipid-1 and −2 were analyzed by FAB/MS. As shown in Fig. 6A, the upper band (lipid-1) had a somewhat heterogeneous FAB/MS spectrum. This band appeared to contain predominantly N-tetracosanoyl monoglycosylceramides in the cluster at (M + H)+/z 809/811 (precisely, N-tetracosanoyl (lignoceroyl) monoglycosylceramide at (M + H)+/z 811 and N-tetracosanoyl (nervonoyl) monoglycosylceramide at (M + H)+/z 809) but also had peaks of (M + H)+/z 783 (N-docosanoyl) 723 (N-linoleoyl) monoglycosylceramides, (M + H)+/z 539 (N-palmitoyl ceramide), 567 (N-stearoyl ceramide), and 615 (N-docosatrienoyl ceramide). The heterogeneity and increased hydrophobicity of the lipid-1 peak, due to a larger inclusion of longer amide side chains, may account for its higher TLC migration. The lower TLC band (lipid-2) had a FAB/MS spectrum highly characteristic of N-palmitoyl monoglycosylceramide (Fig. 6B). The predominant peak of 699 was the native ion, with a well-defined N-palmitoyl ceramide breakdown peak of (M + H)+/z 537. This peak appeared to be relatively uniform, with a small amount of other expected monoglycosylceramides with different amide chains (e.g. (M + H)+/z 721 (N-linolenoyl), 781 (N-docosanoyl), and 809/811 (N-tetracosanoyl)). These results confirm that MCF-7-AdrR cells have two major glycosylceramide species differing in their fatty acid constituents.Fig. 6Fast-atom bombardment/mass spectrometry of TLC-separated and -purified lipids from MCF-7-AdrR cells. Each lipid band was characterized twice by both FAB-negative ion spectrometry and FAB-positive ion spectrometry. Representative FAB-positive samples are shown. Most probable identity of peaks is given in the text. A, upper TLC band (lipid-1); B, lower TLC band (lipid-2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The carbohydrate headgroup identity of the TLC-purified glycosylceramides was examined by comparing the migration of the lipids with that of commercial lactosyl-, galactosyl-, and glucosylceramide standards. As shown in Fig. 7, glycosphingolipid standards were separated according to their carbohydrate moiety (lanes 1-3). The migration of the cell-purified glycosylceramide doublet (lane 4) was aligned with that of glucosylceramide. These results identify the accumulated glycosylceramides as glucosyl- rather than galactosylceramides.Fig. 7Identification of the sugar moiety of glycosylceramides. Glycosylceramides, purified from MCF-7-AdrR cells as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were separated on borate-impregnated TLC plates developed in solvent system VI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipids were visualized by charring.

As shown in Fig. 8A, uptake and incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid was nearly equal in MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. Fig. 8B shows that [3H]palmitic acid was rapidly incorporated into ceramide, with 3.6-fold higher levels in MCF-7-AdrR cells than in MCF-7-wt cells at 30 min. Thereafter (1-6 h), the levels of [3H]ceramide decreased similarly in both cell lines, reflecting conversion of ceramide to sphingolipids. The incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into glucosylceramides showed a strikingly different pattern. This diversity was characterized by a consistently higher rate of glucosylceramide formation in MCF-7-AdrR cells, which reached a maximum of 3.1% of total lipid tritium at 6 h (Fig. 8C). In contrast, glucosylceramide formation in MCF-7-wt cells was significantly lower, accounting for only 0.38% of total lipid tritium at 6 h. These data show an 8-fold difference in the rate of glucosylceramide formation in wt and MDR cell types. The level of other specific lipids in the two cell lines was also compared. As shown in Table I, MCF-7-wt cells showed slightly higher incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into PC at 1 h (1.7-fold), a difference that was equalized by 6 h. Similar results were obtained for PE. While glycerophospholipid metabolism was alike in both cell lines, SM formation was higher in MCF-7-AdrR cells (3.4- and 1.9-fold at 1 and 6 h, respectively) (Table I). These results are in agreement with previous work (27Ramu A. Glaubiger D. Weintraub H. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1984; 68: 637-641Google Scholar). Because sphingomyelin synthase utilizes ceramide as a substrate for SM synthesis, the higher levels of radiolabeled SM in MCF-7-AdrR cells may be due to enhanced ceramide formation (Fig. 8B). Collectively, the data of Table I show that the major difference in lipids between MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells is in glucosylceramide levels.Fig. 8Time course of [3H]palmitic acid incorporation into total lipid, ceramide, and glucosylceramide in MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. MCF-7-wt (○) and MCF-7-AdrR (•) cells (60 × 15-mm dishes) were incubated with 1.0 µCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. At the times indicated, lipids were extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, aliquots of the labeling medium were counted directly by liquid scintillation spectrometry to determine [3H]palmitic acid uptake and incorporation. B, for ceramide detection, lipids were base-hydrolyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and separated by TLC using solvent system V. C, glucosylceramides (lipid-1 and −2) were separated by TLC using solvent system II. After TLC resolution, quantitation of radiolabel in the relevant regions of the TLC plate was conducted as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are from one of three experiments that gave similar results (A and C) and represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate samples of four separate experiments (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIncorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into PC, PE, SM, and glucosylceramide of MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cellsLipidIncubation time1 h6 hMCF-7-wtMCF-7-AdrRMCF-7-wtMCF-7-AdrRPC28.3 ± 0.4516.1 ± 0.7320.6 ± 2.8319.8 ± 2.70PE4.45 ± 0.143.02 ± 0.053.50 ± 0.063.72 ± 0.01SM0.55 ± 0.061.91 ± 0.101.34 ± 0.322.50 ± 0.23Glu-cer0.18 ± 0.021.50 ± 0.070.38 ± 0.033.10 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab Glucosylceramide Degradation RatesThe accumulation of glucosylceramides in MCF-7-AdrR cells is a consequence of either increased synthesis or decreased degradation. To test the possibility that glucosylceramide degradation is altered in the MDR cells, MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells were labeled with [3H]galactose for 24 h and then chased in [3H]galactose-free medium for an additional 6, 12, and 24 h. As shown in Fig. 9, radiolabeled glucosylceramide levels were decreased in both cell lines in a similar fashion. In light of the high amounts of glucosylceramide in MCF-7-AdrR cells, it is notable that degradation rates were slightly accelerated in this cell line. These findings indicate that the accumulation of glucosylceramides in MCF-7-AdrR cells is due to increased synthesis and is not a consequence of hindered breakdown.Fig. 9Degradation rates of glucosylceramide in MCF-7-wt and MCF-7-AdrR cells. Cells were prelabeled for 24 h with [3H]galactose in medium containing 0.1% BSA. Labeled cells were then washed and chased in 10% FBS-containing medium lacking [3H]galactose for the indicated times. The wash and chase medium was heat- and CO2-conditioned by storage in the tissue culture incubator for 24 h. [3H]Glucosylceramide was quantitated as described in the legend to Fig. 8. Control values (100%) represent zero time of the chase period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Accumulation of Glucosylceramides in Other MDR CellsIn addition to MCF-7-AdrR cells, glucosylceramide accumulation was observed in other MDR cell lines. Fig. 10 shows the TLC lipid profile of OVCAR-3 (MDR ovarian carcinoma), KB-3-1 (drug-sensitive, wt), and KB-V-1 (MDR) epidermoid carcinoma cells. The MDR cell lines OVCAR-3 and KB-V-1 most strikingly demonstrate the glucosylceramide doublet. The ovarian carcinoma is resistant to clinically relevant concentrations of Adriamycin, melphalan, and cisplatin (28Rogan A.M. Hamilton T.C. Young R.C. Klecker R.W. Ozols R.F. Science. 1984; 224: 994-996Google Scholar). These data imply that the association of elevated glucosylceramide levels with multidrug resistance is more global as opposed to a biochemical characteristic of limited scope. As such the work poses interesting questions regarding a biological role for glycosphingolipids in the ability of cells to resist drug toxicity.Fig. 10Qualitative analysis of lipids from wild-type and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. Cells were grown to near-confluency in their respective media. Lipids were extracted from the cells as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of total lipid (50 µg/lane) were separated by TLC using solvent system I. The lipids were visualized and identified as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

These compounds were readily radiolabeled by preincubation of cells with glycosphingolipid precursors, and their synthesis was sensitive to sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors. The lipids contained a long-chain sphingoid base, fatty acids of either 16 (palmitic) or 24 (nervonic, lignoceric) carbons, and glucose. Palmitic, nervonic, and lignoceric acids are among the most common aliphatic species comprising sphingolipids (29Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1985Google Scholar).Earlier studies have endeavored to distinguish drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells by differences in sphingolipid synthesis and composition. Reported differences in lipid composition of doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant P388 cells were mainly confined to triglycerides with minor changes in SM and PC in drug-resistant cells (27Ramu A. Glaubiger D. Weintraub H. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1984; 68: 637-641Google Scholar). Our data show similar minor alterations with respect to phospholipid and SM levels (Table I). Biedler and co-workers (30Biedler J.L. Chang T.D. Meyers M.B. Peterson R.H.F. Spengler B.A. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1983; 67: 859-867Google Scholar) examined ganglioside composition in daunorubicin-resistant, vincristine-resistant, and drug-sensitive cells. Although differences in ganglioside composition were found, there was no definitive correlation with drug resistance. Another study examined the levels of four major lipid classes, including gangliosides, in doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant P388 cells (31Holleran W.M. DeGregorio M.W. Ganapathi R. Wilbur J.R. Macher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1986; 17: 11-15Google Scholar). No differences in lipid composition were noted (31Holleran W.M. DeGregorio M.W. Ganapathi R. Wilbur J.R. Macher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1986; 17: 11-15Google Scholar). Our study provides the first evidence for multidrug resistance-associated alteration in glucosylceramide levels.As judged by the time course of [3H]palmitic acid labeling (Fig. 8), the rate of glucosylceramide synthesis is much higher in MCF-7-AdrR cells than in MCF-7-wt cells. Such differences can be explained by defects in glycosphingolipid degradation pathways, as in fibroblasts from patients with Gaucher's disease (32Grabowski G.A. Gatt S. Horowitz M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 384-414Google Scholar, 33Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 709-718Google Scholar). However, pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 9) ruled out this possibility, and demonstrated that glucosylceramide degradation rates in MCF-7-AdrR cells were even higher than in MCF-7-wt cells. These results indicate that a more active glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway exists in the MDR MCF-7-AdrR cells. One enzyme that may be involved in accelerated glycosphingolipid synthesis in MCF-7-AdrR cells is ceramide synthase. Recent work by Bose et al. (34Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Google Scholar) shows that daunorubicin stimulates ceramide elevation in P388 and U937 cells via activation of ceramide synthase. Another enzyme that may contribute to the enhanced synthesis of glucosylceramide in MCF-7-AdrR cells is glucosylceramide synthase. In vitro enzymatic assays addressing the relative activity of this enzyme in MDR and wt cells are in order.Glucosylceramides play a role in cell growth (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M.

A. 1984; 81: 5767-5771Google Scholar). Changes in expression of various glycosphingolipids on the cell surface have been correlated with mechanisms of acquiring and maintaining cancer phenotype and tumor progression (17Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Google Scholar, 18Morton D.L. Ravindranath M.H. Irie R.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 251-275Google Scholar). For example, human melanoma expresses GD2 ganglioside, and the level of GD2 increases as melanoma tumorigenesis progresses (38Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Tiller P.R. Varki A. Klock J.C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2376-2383Google Scholar). This increase may be correlated with metastatic potential, as GD2 has been implicated in the attachment of melanoma cells to solid substrata (37Cheresh D.A. Harper J.R. Schultz G. Reisfeld R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5767-5771Google Scholar). A novel sialylated fucosyl glycosphingolipid has been characterized in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (38Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Tiller P.R. Varki A. Klock J.C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2376-2383Google Scholar), and occurrence of another ganglioside, GD1α, has been associated with rat ascites hepatoma AH 7974F cells (39Taki T. Hirabayashi Y. Ishikawa H. Ando S. Kon K. Tanaka Y. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3075-3078Google Scholar).The multiple putative functions of glycosphingolipids in cell growth and transformation suggest that glucosylceramides, in light of our findings with MCF-7-AdrR cells, exert a role in acquiring and/or maintaining multidrug resistance. Elevated glucosylceramide levels were likewise expressed in other MDR cells we have studied (Fig. 10). Therefore, the biochemical processes underlying this accumulation are not restricted to breast cancer and/or to Adriamycin resistance. The contribution of glycosphingolipids may be important for MDR cells to survive a hostile environment (33Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 709-718Google Scholar, 40Nakamura S. Kozutsumi Y. Sun Y. Miyake Y. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1255-1257Google Scholar, 41Yan J.P. Ilsley D.D. Frohlick C. Steet R. Hall E.T. Kuchta R.D. Melancon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22836-22841Google Scholar). Interestingly, drugs that inhibit glycosphingolipid synthesis may elicit cytotoxic activity. For example, recent work has shown that 3′-azidothymidine alters glycosphingolipid metabolism in K562 erythroleukemia cells, an effect that may be related to cytotoxicity (41Yan J.P. Ilsley D.D. Frohlick C. Steet R. Hall E.T. Kuchta R.D. Melancon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22836-22841Google Scholar). The accumulation of glucosylceramides in MDR cells may impart resistance to toxic insult and thereby enhance cell survival. As such, P-gp activity, suggested to be dependent upon lipid environment (42Al-Awqati Q. Science. 1995; 269: 805-806Google Scholar, 43Shimabuku A.M. Nishimoto T. Ueda K. Komano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4308-4311Google Scholar, 44Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Google Scholar), may be regulated by glucosylceramides. We propose that glucosylceramides may be used as an index to identify MDR cancer. INTRODUCTIONThe multidrug-resistant (MDR) 1The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug-resistantAdrRAdriamycin (doxorubicin)-resistantBSAbovine serum albuminFAB/MSfast-atom bombardment/mass spectrometryFB1fumonisin B1FBSfetal bovine serumLac-cerlactosylceramidePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolamineP-gpP-glycoproteinPPMP1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanolSMsphingomyelinwtwild-type. phenotype in its natural (inherited) or acquired form expresses resistance to a variety of drugs (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that this resistance is due to the ability of cells to lower intracellular drug concentration. Overexpression of the membrane efflux transporter P-gp is the most consistent alteration in MDR cells (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar, 3Bradley G. Ling V.

Science. 1992; 255: 459-562Google Scholar); however, the physiologic function and mechanisms of action of P-gp are largely unknown. Moreover, the widespread drug resistance of human lung tumors (5Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deely R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar) is unrelated to overexpression of P-gp and indicates the existence of additional resistance mechanisms. The multifactorial nature of multidrug resistance is exemplified by a wide array of other biochemical changes including alterations in membrane fluidity and structure (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 87-128Google Scholar), elevated glutathione S-transferase activity (1Bradley G. Juranka P.F. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys.

Efferth T. Cancer (Phila.). 1993; 71: 3981-3987Google Scholar), increased phospholipase D activity (7Welsh C.J. Yea G.C. Phang J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 211-217Google Scholar), and elevated transcription of c-fos, c-myc and c-Ha-ras (4Chin K.-V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1992; 255: 459-562Google Scholar, 6Volm M.

Cancer. 1994; 59: 208-211Google Scholar).In this study, we show that a unique glycosphingolipid pattern is associated with MDR cells. Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated with formation of 3-ketosphinganine by condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, followed by reduction of the keto group (producing sphinganine) and addition of an amide-linked fatty acid (Fig. 1A; Ref. 9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Google Scholar). The ceramide formed is further metabolized to sphingomyelin or glycosylceramide 2Throughout this article “glycosylceramide” is used to refer to ceramide that bears nonspecified sugar moiety (either glucose or galactose). by addition of the appropriate headgroup. De novo synthesis can be followed by incubation of cells with radiolabeled serine or palmitic acid and, in the case of glycosphingolipids, by incubation with radiolabeled galactose. In recent years, clues regarding the function of sphingolipids have been revealed by the discovery and use of sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors (Fig. 1A). These include inhibitors of 3-ketosphinganine synthase (L-cycloserine), ceramide synthase (FB1), and glucosylceramide synthase (PPMP) (10Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 577-581Google Scholar, 11Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Google Scholar, 12Lee K.J. Boyd S.A. Radin N.S.

In addition to their role as building blocks of biological membranes, glycosphingolipids have long attracted attention because of their putative involvement in cell proliferation (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar), differentiation (15Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirchberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Google Scholar, 16Harel R.

Irie R.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 251-275Google Scholar). In addition, some metabolites of glycosphingolipids, such as sphingoid bases, ceramides, and lysosphingolipids, are suggested to have a second messenger function in signal transduction pathways involving growth (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar, 19Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Google Scholar), apoptosis (20Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A.

We now demonstrate that specific glycosphingolipids, identified as glucosylceramides, accumulate in MDR cancer cells. This finding poses intriguing questions regarding the role of glucosylceramide in multidrug resistance."

One of the major consequences of the advanced Maillard reaction in proteins is the formation of covalently cross-linked aggregates. The chemical nature of the cross-linking structures is largely unknown. Recently, methylglyoxal has been shown to be a potential glycating agent in vivo and suggested to be a common intermediate in the Maillard reaction involving glucose. Methylglyoxal can form enzymatically or nonenzymatically from glycolytic intermediates and by retro-aldol cleavage of sugars. Its elevation in tissues in diabetes and its high potency to glycate and cross-link proteins led us to investigate the chemical nature of its advanced Maillard products. Using an approach in which a synthetic model peptide was reacted with methylglyoxal, we isolated and purified a cross-linked peptide dimer. Characterization of this dimer revealed that the peptides are linked through ε amino groups of lysine residues. The actual cross-link was shown to be a methylimidazolium, formed from the reaction of two lysines and two methylglyoxal molecules. We have named this cross-link imidazolysine. Imidazolysine was detected in proteins by high performance liquid chromatography using a postcolumn derivatization method. Proteins incubated with methylglyoxal showed a time-dependent formation of imidazolysine. Quantification of imidazolysine in human serum proteins revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in diabetic samples (mean ± S.D., 313.8 ± 52.7 pmol/mg protein) when compared with normal samples (261.3 ± 50.4). These values correlated with glycohemoglobin (p < 0.05). These results provide chemical evidence for protein cross-linking by dicarbonyl compounds in vivo.

The Maillard reaction, initiated by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with proteins, is proposed to play a significant role in protein aging and the complications of aging and diabetes. The reaction is initiated with the reversible formation of a Schiff base between a reducing sugar and the amino group of a protein. The relatively unstable Schiff base undergoes rearrangement to form a more stable Amadori product. The Amadori product, over a period of several months to years, undergoes a series of further reactions through dicarbonyl intermediates to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEsadvanced glycation end productsMGmethylglyoxalHSAhuman serum albuminHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyt-BOCbutoxycarbonylTFAtrifluoroacetic acidHFBAheptafluorobutyric acidGK-peptideNα-acetyl-glycyl-lysine-methyl esterOPAO-phthalaldehydeLC/MSliquid chromatography/mass spectrometryFABfast atom bombardment. that are also known as advanced Maillard products. The AGEs are a heterogeneous group of structures formed as both cross-linking and noncross-linking adducts on proteins. The long-lived proteins in the body like lens crystallins and collagen accumulate AGEs because of their negligible or slow turnover. Immunochemical and chemical methods have clearly shown the progressive accumulation of AGEs in tissue proteins in aging (1The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition. Alan R.

Considerable interest has focused recently on the structural characterization of AGEs. Attempts are being made to isolate major products by using specific antibodies and by chromatographic methods. A consistent difficulty in these procedures has been the isolation of individual AGEs in a reaction where numerous products are formed with highly cross-linked structures. Although protein cross-linking is a major end result of the Maillard reaction, only two minor protein cross-linking compounds, pentosidine and fluorophore LM-1, have been detected in tissues (13Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Google Scholar, 14Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Google Scholar, 15Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Google Scholar). Therefore, to better understand the impact of the Maillard reaction in aging and diabetes and to develop effective therapeutic methods to prevent AGE accumulation in tissues, it is necessary to elucidate the chemical nature of the major protein cross-links derived from this reaction. In addition to glucose, a number of other sugars and sugar metabolites are known to initiate the Maillard reaction. Among them methylglyoxal (MG) has attracted considerable attention recently. MG is formed by enzymatic and nonenzymatic routes from glycolytic intermediates as well as from autoxidation of sugars (16Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 101-105Google Scholar, 17Hodge J.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1953; 1: 928-943Google Scholar). It has been shown that in diabetes the concentration of MG increases in the lens, blood, and kidney (18McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Ben J. Sonksen P.H. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 21-29Google Scholar, 19Phillips S.A. Mirrlees D. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 805-811Google Scholar, 20McLellan A.C. Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 17-23Google Scholar). In Type I diabetic patients the blood MG levels increased 5-6-fold and in Type II 2-3-fold compared with normal control subjects (18McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Ben J. Sonksen P.H. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 21-29Google Scholar, 19Phillips S.A. Mirrlees D. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 805-811Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have shown that MG undergoes a rapid Maillard reaction with proteins to form covalently cross-linked aggregates (21Riley M.L. Harding J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1270: 36-43Google Scholar). Such reactions have been shown to occur even at physiological concentrations of MG (22Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Google Scholar) and form fluorescent products, characteristics of which resemble those occurring in proteins in aging and diabetes (23Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.T. Hunsaker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4364-4369Google Scholar). The high reactivity of MG with proteins and its relatively high concentration (0.1 mM) in the plasma (24Monnier V.M. Sell D.R. Miyarta S. Nagaraj R.H. Finot P.A. Aeschbacher H.U. Hurrel R.F. Liardon R. The Maillard Reaction in Food Processing, Human Nutrition, and Physiology. Birkhauser, Basel1990: 393Google Scholar) suggest that it is one of the major glycating agents present in vivo. A specific receptor on macrophages has been identified for proteins that are modified by the Maillard reaction with MG (25Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Google Scholar). Papoulis et al. (26Papoulis A. Al-Abed Y. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 648-655Google Scholar) have suggested that MG is a common intermediate in the Maillard reaction by glucose and its derivatives. This study was undertaken to understand the chemical nature of cross-linking structures derived from the advanced Maillard reaction initiated by MG. Using a model synthetic peptide in our reaction, we have isolated a lysine-lysine cross-link and developed an assay for its detection and quantification in proteins. We report the isolation, characterization, and detection in human serum proteins of this novel lysine-lysine cross-link. Methylglyoxal (40% aqueous solution), human serum albumin (HSA, essentially fatty acid free), heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Sigma. Bio-Gel P-2 was from Bio-Rad. O-Phthalaldehyde (OPA) was from Aldrich. Nα-t-BOC-lysine and Nα-t-BOC-arginine and Nα-α-acetyl-glycyl-lysine methyl ester were from Bachem, CA. Nε-Carboxymethyllysine was a kind gift from Dr. John Baynes, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC. All other chemicals used were of highest quality commercially available. Bovine lenses were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Human blood was collected from The University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, and from volunteers at this University. Glycosylated hemoglobin was determined by boronate affinity chromatography with the Glycogel B column system (Pierce). To isolate cross-links derived from the advanced Maillard reaction initiated by methylglyoxal, the reaction was carried out with 1 g of GK-peptide, 500 mg of Nα-t-BOC arginine, and 100 mM methylglyoxal (78 µl) in 4.0 ml of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37°C in the dark. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.4 with 5 N NaOH. The reaction mixture was incubated for 24 h. The resulting deep brown mixture was then subjected to gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. The reaction mixture was applied onto a Bio-Gel P-2 column (70 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.01 M NaCl. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 18 ml/h, and fractions of 4.0 ml were collected. Aliquots from the collected fractions were diluted with distilled water for absorption measurement at 220 nm. The fractions were also analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60, 0.2 mm, E. Merck, Germany) using butanol:acetic acid:water:pyridine (2.5:1:1.25:1.25, v/v/v/v) as solvent. The TLC plates were developed with ninhydrin (5% in ethyl alcohol). Based on the absorption at 220 nm and the TLC profile, the fractions were combined into four pools. The pooled fractions were dried in a speed vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). The dried pools from the Bio-Gel column were reconstituted in 3.0 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and subjected to HPLC on a C18 reversed phase semi-preparative column (218TP1010, 10 µm, Vydac, The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). The HPLC system (Waters Chromatography Division, Milford, MA) consisted of two pumps (model 510), an automatic gradient controller, a model U6K manual injector, and a model 746 data module integrator. The solvent system consisted of 0.1% TFA in water (A) and 50% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% TFA (B). The program was as follows: 0-35 min, 0-100% B; 35-43 min, 100% B; 44-54 min, 0% B. The flow rate was set at 2.0 ml/min, and the column effluent was monitored for absorbance at 220 nm with a tunable absorbance detector (model UV-970, Jasco Corp., Japan). The major peaks were collected and dried in a speed vac concentrator. The dried fractions were reconstituted in 1.0 ml of water and injected again on a C18 reverse phase semi-preparative column for further purification. The solvent system and other conditions were the same as above, except that a longer solvent gradient was used (0-50 min, 0-100% B). The major peaks were collected and lyophilized. Using this procedure, a modified peptide was purified. Characterization of this peptide revealed that it was a dimer and cross-linked by a Maillard reaction product. This product was named imidazolysine. Other details of purification and characterization are described under the “Results.” Five hundred mg of Nα-t-BOC lysine and 200 mg of MG were dissolved in 5.0 ml of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The resulting deep brown solution was subjected to cation exchange chromatography on a AG-50W-X4 (Bio-Rad) (2.5 × 7-cm) column equilibrated with 0.02 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The column was washed with 250 ml of buffer and then eluted with a gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in 100 ml. This was followed with 100 ml of buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Fractions of 3.0 ml were collected at a flow rate of 20.0 ml/h. To each fraction, 200 µl of 2 N HCl was added (to release the BOC group) and allowed to stand overnight. The presence of imidazolysine was determined by TLC on silica (butanol:water:acetic acid:pyridine, 5:2.5:2:2.5, v/v/v/v, solvent system A). The plates were visualized with ninhydrin. The fractions that showed the presence of imidazolysine were pooled and lyophilized. The sample was then extracted twice with 20 ml of methanol to remove salt and finally dissolved in 5.0 ml of water and subjected to HPLC on a C18 reversed phase semi-preparative column with the following solvents and program: solvent A, 0.1% TFA in water, and solvent B, 50% acetonitrile in water + 0.1% TFA; 0-100% linear gradient of B in 0-35 min at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The column effluent was directed to an on-line fraction collector collecting 2.0-ml fractions. The fractions were analyzed by TLC using the solvent system A and visualized with ninhydrin. The fractions that showed the presence of imidazolysine (Rf 0.06) were pooled and dried in a speed vac concentrator. This fraction was further purified by HPLC using similar conditions as described above except that the gradient of solvent B was 0-100% in 0-45 min. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected, and imidazolysine in the fractions was detected by TLC. The fractions with imidazolysine were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization. Formation of imidazolysine in proteins incubated with MG was investigated. Bovine lens crystallins were prepared as described previously (27Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10257-10261Google Scholar). The water-soluble fraction was used in this experiment. Lens crystallins and HSA (100 mg/5.0 ml) in phosphate-buffered saline were incubated with 50 mM MG at 37°C, and aliquots (0.5 ml) were withdrawn at specified time intervals. Protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v in water), and the precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 15 min and hydrolyzed at 110°C for 20 h in the presence of 2.0 ml of 6 N HCl. Human serum proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. This fraction was then lyophilized and stored at −80°C until use. Ten mg of protein was hydrolyzed with 2.0 ml of 6 N HCl at 110°C for 20 h. The acid was evaporated in a speed vac concentrator, and the residue was redissolved with 0.5 ml of water. Imidazolysine was detected and quantified by HPLC with post-column derivatization by OPA. Initially, the retention time of purified imidazolysine (purified from the reaction of Nα-t-BOC lysine and MG, 15 µl = 1.06 nmol) was determined. A C18 reversed phase column was used. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-25% acetonitrile in water with 0.01 M HFBA at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The effluent from the column was mixed with OPA (0.5 ml/min) in a column (5 × 4.6 mm, 50-µm glass beads, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) through a three-way static mixing apparatus (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). The OPA reagent was prepared by the following procedure. 2.43% boric acid was taken in water and the pH was adjusted to pH 9.7 with KOH. To this, 0.08% OPA dissolved in 10.0 ml of ethanol and 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) were added and filtered through a 0.45-µm filter. To the filtrate, 0.1% Brij 35 was added. The volume was then adjusted to 1.0 liter with water. The OPA-derivatized products were detected with an on-line fluorescence detector (Jasco, Inc., MD) which was set at excitation/emission wavelengths of 340/455 nm. Under these conditions imidazolysine standard eluted between 29 and 30 min. The acid-hydrolyzed protein samples were injected (50 µl = 500 µg of protein in the case of proteins incubated with MG and 65 µl = 1.3 mg of protein in the case of human serum proteins) under the conditions described above but without postcolumn derivatization. The effluent from the column from 27 to 33 min was collected, dried in a speed vac concentrator, and reconstituted in 200 µl of water. Aliquots of 75 and 50 µl from plasma proteins and proteins incubated with MG, respectively, were subjected to HPLC using a C18 column (5 µm, 201HS54). A concave gradient of acetonitrile was used (0-8% acetonitrile in water + 0.1% HFBA in 40 min). Under these conditions imidazolysine standard eluted between 34 and 35 min. Quantification was performed by comparison of peak area in serum proteins to that of a purified imidazolysine standard. Results were expressed as picomoles of imidazolysine per milligram of protein. 1H NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR (100 MHz, acetone as external reference), 1H-1H COSY and DEPT analysis were performed on a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ scale. The samples were exchanged three times with D2O and taken in 5-mm tube (5-12 mg) for analysis. All mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the Department of Chemistry, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Molecular weight was determined by FAB spectroscopy with a KRATOS MS-50 double focusing mass spectrometer. Analysis was initially conducted at low resolution (1000) at an accelerating voltage of 8 KeV. Sample was mixed with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol/sodium iodide (NBA/NaI). Ions were formed by FAB with a 6-KeV argon beam. FAB high resolution mass analysis was performed at a resolution of 10,000 by peak matching with CsI/glycerol matrix ion at m/z 484.7625 and 576.8099. HPLC conditions were as follows. A reversed phase (C18, 15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm) column was used. The mobile phase consisted of a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (0-8% in 32 min) with 1% glycerol and 0.1% TFA with a flow rate of 250 µl/min. The mass spectra were obtained on a JOEL HX-110 double focusing mass spectrometer at an accelerating voltage of 10 KeV (FAB gas-Xe). The reaction of GK-peptide and MG was carried out in the presence of arginine with the objective of obtaining not only lysine-lysine cross-links but also lysine-arginine cross-links. The reaction mixture was passed through a Bio-Gel column to separate modified peptides from the unreacted peptides. The aim was to separate peptide dimers and peptides having arginine cross-links from the unreacted peptides and MG. The chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1. Most of the peptide remained in the native state (fractions 51-59). The TLC profile of the fractions also showed a strong ninhydrin positive spot in fractions just before the native peptide (Rf = 0.18, Rf for the native peptide = 0.5). HPLC analysis and mass spectral determinations showed that this material corresponds to the deesterified peptide. On the other hand, deep brown products were observed in fractions ahead of the deesterified peptide (fractions 38-50). Since these fractions were in a higher molecular weight region than the native peptide, it was assumed that these contained peptide polymers, dimers, and peptides carrying AGEs. Based on the TLC results and absorption values at 220 nm, fractions 38-44, 45-50, 51-59, and 60-65 were combined and designated as pools 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The pools from the Bio-Gel column were concentrated to dryness, dissolved in 2.0 ml of water, and subjected to HPLC. The native peptide eluted in 13.7 min and the deesterified peptide in 9.3 min. The other major peaks (Fig. 1) detected by monitoring the effluent at 220 nm (retention time between 17 and 30 min) were collected, dried, and reconstituted in 0.5 ml of water and further purified on a C18 reversed phase column by HPLC. By this procedure four peaks from pool 1 (labeled 1a-1d), six from pool 2 (labeled 2a-2f), five from pool 3 (labeled 3a-3e), and four from pool 4 (labeled 4a-4d) were separated and collected. The peaks with identical retention times from adjacent pools were mixed. The collected peaks were dried, and a portion of the material was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at 110°C for 20 h. The acid-hydrolyzed material was subjected to TLC on a silica plate with the solvent system butanol:water:acetic acid:pyridine (4:2:3:3, v/v/v/v). Glycine, arginine, and lysine were also spotted. In the peak at 19.3 min retention time (1a and 2a), a distinct ninhydrin positive spot with an Rf value of 0.13 was present. Glycine was present in this material but lysine was absent. Based on this observation, it was concluded that the material was a modified peptide. No other HPLC peak showed the presence of glycine, which suggested the absence of the peptide. The isolated modified peptide was characterized by 1H, 13C, NMR, and FAB-MS along with the native peptide (purified from pool 3 by HPLC). 1H NMR (in D2O) for the native peptide and for the modified peptide are shown in Fig. 2. The following signals were observed for the native peptide; the first letter within the parentheses represents proton position on the peptide: δH 1.42 (f, 2H, m), 1.67 (g, 2H, m), 1.77 (e, 2H, m), 2.05 (a, 3H, s), 2.97 (h, 2H, t, Jh,g = 7.6 Hz), 3.75 (d, 3H, s), 3.92 (b, 2H, q, Jb,b = 16.9 Hz), and 4.46 (c, 1H, q, Jc,e = 5 Hz). The signal at δ 1.92 (3H, s) was from acetate (the peptide was supplied as the acetate salt). For the modified peptide the signals were δH 1.38 (f, 4H, m), 1.78 (g, 4H, m), 1.87 (e, 4H, m), 2.05 (a, 6H, s), 2.33 (j, 3H, s), 3.76 (d, 6H, s), 4.14 (h, 4H, q, Jh,g = 7.2 Hz, Jh,h = 14.8 Hz), 4.45 (e, 2H, q, Jc,e = 4 Hz), 7.26 (k, 1H, s) and 8.69 (i, 1H, s). In the case of the modified peptide, no signals corresponding to BOC- or free arginine were observed ruling out the presence of arginine. The number of protons for lysine (between 1 and 2 ppm) were 12 for the modified peptide (6 in the case of native peptide). This suggested the presence of two peptides. This was further evident by the following observations: 1) the presence of 6 protons from the acetyl group (δ 2.05 ppm) and 2) two protons corresponding to α-position in lysine (δ 4.45 ppm). The two singlets in the aromatic region (δ 7.26 and 8.69 ppm) suggested the presence of 2 uncoupled protons in the aromatic ring and the signal at δ 2.33 ppm suggested the presence of a methyl group on the ring. 1H-1H COSY analysis showed spin-spin interaction between protons on C2 and C4 (5Nakamura Y. Horii Y. Nishino T. Shiiki H. Sakaguchi Y. Kagoshima T. Dohi K. Makita Z. Vlassara H. Bucala R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1649-1656Google Scholar) carbons (data not shown). Protonation of carbons was determined by DEPT analysis, which showed the presence of a single proton on C2 and C4 carbons (data not shown). 13C NMR spectroscopy showed the following signals for the native peptide: δC 21.67 (CH3-acetyl), 23.34 (γ-CH2-lys), 26.08 (δ-CH2-lys), 29.82 (β-CH2-lys), 39.10 (ε-CH2-lys), 42.32 (CH2-gly), 52.32 (α-CH-lys), 52.81 (CH3-ester), 171.41 (CO-acetyl), 173.82 (CO-gly), and 174.45 (CO-lys). The spectrum for the modified peptide showed four new signals. The signals at δC 8.23, 49.01, 119.28, and 134.55 corresponded to methyl group, C4, C5, and C2 carbons on the aromatic ring, respectively, and were fully compatible with the structure in Fig. 2. The FAB-mass spectrum on 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) matrix showed a molecular ion at m/z of 567.3 (M+, not shown). High resolution FAB-MS in the positive ion mode showed the molecular mass of 567.314238. This corresponded to molecular formula C26H43N6O8 and was in agreement with the proposed structure. Based on these characteristics, it was determined that the purified product was a cross-link of peptides joined by a methylimidazolium ring. The structure of the peptide cross-link is shown in Fig. 2. Imidazolysine was then synthesized by the reaction of Nα-t-BOC-lysine with MG. Cation exchange chromatography followed by HPLC resulted in the isolation and purification of imidazolysine. This was evident by a single spot on TLC (solvent:butanol:water:acetic acid:pyridine, 5:2:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v/v), detection by ninhydrin). The Rf value of this preparation (0.06) was identical to that of the ninhydrin-positive spot observed with the acid hydrolysate of the isolated peptide under the same condition suggesting that they were the same compound. Furthermore, the results establish that the sample was different than carboxymethyllysine (Rf = 0.09), an advanced Maillard reaction product that can be formed by the reaction of glyoxal with lysine (28Wells-Knecht K. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar). This was further confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3) which showed the following signals: δH 1.45 (c, 4H, m), 1.91 (b, d, 8H, m), 2.3 (f, 3H, s), 3.94 (a, 2H, q, Ja,b = 5 Hz), 4.17 (e, 4H, q, Je,d = 14.2 Hz), 7.24 (g, 1H, s), and 8.68 (h, 1H, s). These signals were compatible with that of the modified peptide (Fig. 2). FAB-MS (glycerol matrix) showed m/z at 341.3 (Fig. 3) which corresponded to the expected structure with a molecular formula of C16H29O4N6. Acid hydrolysis of this preparation (110°C, 20 h with 6 N HCl) followed by TLC did not change its Rf value on TLC suggesting that it was an acid-stable compound. Imidazolysine is likely to be formed from the reaction of two molecules of MG with two molecules of GK-peptide lysines. The reaction may involve first the formation of a diimine, with two lysine residues, followed by the addition of another molecule of MG. Subsequently, acetic acid and water may be removed to form imidazolysine. Since imidazolysine was found to be an acid-stable compound, its detection and quantification were performed after acid hydrolysis of proteins. Human serum albumin and lens crystallins incubated with MG showed a time-dependent formation of imidazolysine. A two-step HPLC method was used for better resolution of the imidazolysine peak. Imidazolysine was formed within a short period of incubation. After 3 h 18 nmol/mg protein was formed in HSA, and after 2 h 14 nmol/mg protein was formed in lens crystallins. The concentration reached 146.6 nmol/mg protein in HSA and 28 nmol/mg protein in lens crystallins after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 4). This accounted for 15 and 8.5% modification of lysine residues on HSA and lens crystallins, respectively. These values corresponded to 7-8 imidazolysines per HSA molecule (molecular mass 65 kDa and 59 lysines) and one imidazolysine per 5-6 α-crystallin subunits (average molecular mass 20 kDa and 7-8 lysines). In the case of lens crystallin"

They display 20-45% amino acid sequence identity including eight invariant cysteine residues involved in intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonding of the two subunits. The COOH-terminal coding regions in several of these growth factors vary by alternative splicing, giving rise to distinct isoforms.

The receptor(s) for VEGF-B remains to be identified. VEGF is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that acts as a potent angiogenic factor. In addition, it induces blood vessel permeability (16Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Google Scholar). Four splice isoforms of human VEGF have been described (17Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Google Scholar, 18Houck K. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B.

The longer isoforms of VEGF are highly basic and bind to cellular or pericellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whereas the shorter isoforms are soluble in the extracellular fluid (17Breier G.

Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Google Scholar). VEGF has been considered to be the major factor involved in normal and pathological angiogenesis (for review, see Ref. 24Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Google Scholar). These processes include embryonic development, wound healing, tissue regeneration and reorganization, growth and metastasis formation of solid tumors, and ischemia-induced retinal disorders. The importance of VEGF in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree was implicated further by the analysis of mice carrying targeted mutations in the two VEGF receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-l. Both mutations were found to be lethal. Embryos lacking functional Flk-1 lacked blood islands and hematopoetic precursor cells in the yolk sac and failed to develop a proper vasculature during early development (25Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M. Schuh A. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Google Scholar), whereas embryos lacking functional Flt-1 formed endothelial cells but developed an abnormal organization of the vascular endothelium (26Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel growth factor for endothelial cells, VEGF-B, which is expressed abundantly in cardiac and skeletal muscle (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). The isolated mouse and human cDNA clones for VEGF-B were found to encode secreted proteins of 167 amino acids (VEGF-B167) with strong affinity for heparin sulfate. Amino acid sequence comparisons showed that VEGF-B shared ≈45% identity with VEGF and a lower degree of identity with PlGF and the two PDGF polypeptides. In this work we have identified mouse and human cDNA clones encoding a novel isoform of VEGF-B consisting of 186 amino acids. The NH2-terminal domains of the two isoforms were identical, whereas the COOH-terminal portions showed no obvious similarities. Analysis of mouse and human genes for VEGF-B showed that the two isoforms were generated by alternative splicing of mRNA from a single gene. Thus VEGF-B, like most other identified growth factors in the PDGF/VEGF family, is expressed as distinct isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Several cDNA clones encoding mouse VEGF-B186 were isolated from an adult mouse heart ZAP II cDNA library as described previously for the isolation of mouse VEGF-B167 cDNA clones (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). The inserts of the cDNA clones were subcloned by in vivo excision, and both strands of the clones were fully sequenced. Approximately 1 × 106λ clones of a human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell cDNA library in λgt11 were screened using the same the probe (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). A positive clone, termed H.1, was analyzed and found to represent cDNA encoding VEGF-B186. Throughout this work standard molecular biology techniques were used (27Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Several λ clones for the mouse VEGF-B gene were isolated from a 129/Sw λFIX genomic library as recommended by the supplier (Stratagene). The same probe as above was used. The positive λ clone 10 was subcloned as BamHI fragments into pBluescript SK (Stratagene). Isolated DNA from clone 10 was also used as the template in PCRs (100 ng of λ DNA/reaction), and the coding parts of the mouse VEGF-B gene were amplified using different combinations of primers derived from the cDNA clones encoding VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186. Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/reaction) was used. The generated PCR fragments were cloned into the TA-cloning vector pCR II (Invitrogen). The exon-intron structure of the mouse VEGF-B gene was established by nucleotide sequence analysis of the subcloned BamHI genomic fragments and of the cloned PCR products. A human genomic λ clone was isolated by screening 1 × 106 clones of a human genomic library in EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (Clontech) using high stringency conditions with a 32P-labeled 90-bp PCR fragment spanning 5′-sequences of human VEGF-B cDNA as the probe. Primers used for the PCR were: 5′-CACCATGAGCCCTCTGCTCC (forward) and 5′-GGGCATCAGGCTGGGAGACAG (reverse). The positive λ clone was subcloned as SacI fragments into pGEM 3Z vector (Promega) and was found to carry the 5′-region of the gene. The remaining parts of the human VEGF-B gene were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as the template. Different combinations of primers derived from the human cDNA sequences of the two VEGF-B isoforms were used. Dynazyme DNA polymerase (2.5 units/reaction, Finnzymes) was used. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the TA-cloning vector pCR II. The exon-intron boundaries and the length of the short introns of the mouse and human VEGF-B genes were determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. The length of the larger introns was calculated based upon the length of the amplified PCR fragments when analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA from mouse and human tissues was isolated using standard procedures (28Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Two or 5 µg of total RNA/reaction was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (20 units/reaction). The reactions were primed with oligo(dT)18. Aliquots of these reactions were used as templates in PCRs using Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/reaction). To amplify mouse cDNA two pairs of primers were used. These pairs were obtained by combining a common forward primer, 5′-CACAGCCAATGTGAATGCA (mp1), located in exon 4, with two different reverse primers, 5′-GCTCTAAGCCCCGCCCTTGGCAATGGAGGAA (mp2) and 5′-ACGTAGATCTTCACTTTCGCGGCTTCCG (mp3, this primer has a BglII site and 4 extra bases in the 5′-end), located in exons 6B and 7, respectively. Following the analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, the amplified bands were transferred onto a nylon filter (GeneScreen Plus) and sequentially hybridized with oligonucleotide probes specific for exon 6A and 6B. These [32P]dCTP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes were 5′-CTCTGTTCCGGGCTGGGACTCTA (exon 6A) and 5′-TCAGGGCGTTGACGGCGCTGGGTGCAA (exon 6B). Hybridizations were carried out at 37°C in 6 × SSC containing 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed at the same temperature in 6 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS twice for 15 min each and subjected to autoradiography. The two pairs of primers used for amplification of human cDNA were combined using two different 5′-primers, 5′-CCTGACGATGGCCTGGAGTGT (hp1, forward), located in exon 3, and 5′-TGTCCCTGGAAGAACACAGCC (hp2, forward), located in exon 4, with a common 3′-primer, 5′-GCCATGTGTCACCTTCGCAG (hp3, reverse), located in exon 7. Aliquots of the amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the amplified bands were cloned in the TA-cloning vector pCR II and analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. Adult mouse and human multiple tissue Northern blots (MTN, Clontech) were hybridized with a single-stranded DNA probe specific for exon 6A. The 32P-labeled probe was generated using a PCR-based strategy mainly as described (29Konat G.W. Laszkiewicz I. Grubinska B. Wiggins R.C. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 37Google Scholar). The primers 5′-GGTTGCCATACCCCAC (forward) and 5′-ATGGATGATGTCAGCT (reverse) were used to amplify a 91-nucleotide fragment of murine VEGF-B186 exon 6A. The overnight hybridizations were carried out in 37% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 µg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA at 42°C. The filters were washed briefly in 2 × SSC containing 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then washed at 45°C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. As a specificity control, EcoRI-cut plasmids (1 µg of DNA) encoding mouse VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186 were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a filter, and hybridized and washed together with the multiple tissue Northern blot filters. The filters were subjected to autoradiography. cDNA inserts encoding mouse VEGF-B186 and human VEGF165 were cloned into the pSG5 expression vector (30Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and appropriate antibiotics. The cells were transfected with the expression vectors, separately or in combination, using calcium phosphate precipitation. Following 36-48 h of incubation, the cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 30 min and then incubated in the same medium containing 100 µCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h (Promix Amersham Inc.) and then chased for an additional 2 h in minimal essential medium. In some experiments 100 µg/ml heparin was added during the 2-h chase period. Media were collected after the chase period, and the cells were solubilized in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the media and of the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antisera to mouse VEGF-B and to human VEGF. The precipitates were analyzed by 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. The antisera to mouse VEGF-B were raised by immunizing rabbits with a 18-mer oligopeptide, comprising the NH2-terminal region of processed VEGF-B, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Cysteine residues were introduced as the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal amino acid residues to allow coupling of the peptide to the carrier protein using succimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The sequence of the oligopeptide was CPVSQFDGPSHQKKVVPC. The antiserum to human VEGF was from R&D Systems. To check for O-linked glycosylation of VEGF-B186, transiently transfected COS-1 were metabolically labeled as above, and the media and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the antipeptide antiserum to VEGF-B. The immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 50 µl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing neuraminidase type VIII (0.25 unit, Sigma) with or without the addition of O-glycosidase (50 microunits, Boehringer Mannheim) overnight at 37°C. The samples were then resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. For the pulse-chase experiments, separate cultures of transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled as described above for 30 min, washed twice with normal medium, and then incubated for up to 240 min in minimal essential medium without fetal calf serum. Media and cells were harvested after 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min of postlabeling and were prepared for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis as above. Several cDNA clones isolated from an adult mouse heart cDNA library and the clone H.1 isolated from a human fibrosarcoma cDNA library differed in their nucleotide sequences from those cDNA clones previously found to encode VEGF-B167 (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). Common to the mouse and human cDNA clones was an insertion of 101 bp found between nucleotides 410 and 411 in the coding sequence of VEGF-B167. Downstream of the insertion, the nucleotide sequences of these cDNA clones were identical to the VEGF-B167 cDNA sequence. The position of the 101-bp insertion corresponded to the exon 5-exon 6 junction in VEGF (18Houck K. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 91: 1806-1814Google Scholar, 19Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J. Abraham J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Google Scholar, 20Shima D.T. Kuroki M. Deutsch U. Ng Y.-S. Adamis A.P. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Google Scholar), and it resulted in a shift of the reading frame of the translated nucleotide sequence downstream of the insertion and a stop codon (TAG) at a position corresponding to nucleotides 521-523 in the coding region of VEGF-B167 cDNAs. The open reading frames of these mouse and human cDNA clones encoded polypeptides of 207 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). Like VEGF-B167, the signal peptidase cleavage site is likely to occur between Ala21 and Pro22. Thus the processed novel variants of VEGF-B, devoid of signal sequences, were 186 amino acid residues in length. We will refer to this isoform as VEGF-B186. Although the two variants of VEGF-B had an identical NH2-terminal domain of 115 amino acids, the COOH-terminal domains showed virtually no similarities. The eight invariant cysteine residues found in all PDGF/VEGF-like growth factors were within the common NH2-terminal domain. The COOH-terminal domains of mouse and human VEGF-B186 displayed ≈ 85% identity at amino acid level, which was similar to the identity displayed by the COOH termini of mouse and human VEGF-B167 (≈84%) (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). Data base searches revealed no significant amino acid sequence similarity between the COOH terminus of VEGF-B186 and other sequenced proteins. In contrast, the COOH terminus of VEGF-B167 is similar to that of VEGF (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). No consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (amino acid residues NXS/T) were found in the COOH-terminal domain of VEGF-B186 and, as we have reported previously, no such sites are present in the common NH2-terminal domain (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domains in mouse and human VEGF-B186 were rich in conserved proline, serine, and threonine amino acid residues. The divergence of the COOH-terminal amino acid sequences found in the two VEGF-B isoforms is reflected in their different biochemical characteristics. The COOH-terminal domain of VEGF-B186 is weakly basic (net charge +5) and has a long stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues in its COOH terminus (Fig. 1B). However, the hydrophobic tail in VEGF-B186 does not serve as a transmembrane domain since this isoform is secreted from cells (see below). In comparison, the COOH-terminal domain of VEGF-B167 is hydrophilic and strongly basic (net charge +13) and binds heparin (3Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana O. Pettersson R. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Google Scholar). Thus, despite of their identical NH2-terminal domains, the two isoforms of VEGF-B have markedly different biochemical properties. To investigate the possibility that the VEGF-B isoforms were generated by alternative splicing, the structures of the corresponding mouse and human genes were determined. The coding parts of the mouse and human VEGF-B genes were found to span ≈ 4 kilobases of DNA, and both genes are divided into seven coding exons ranging from 19 bp (E7) to 236 bp in length (E6). The introns in both genes varied from 161 bp to ≈ 2.6 kilobases (for a schematic outline, see Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron junctions of both genes are shown in Fig. 3. The length of each exon and the locations of the splice junctions in the mouse and human genes were identical, and all splice donor and acceptor sites followed the canonical GT/AG rules (31Padgett R. Grabowski P. Konarska M. Seiler S. Sharp P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Google Scholar). The only notable differences between the mouse and the human genes were the lengths of introns 1 and 4, which were longer in the human gene, and intron 6, which was longer in the mouse gene. All exon-intron boundaries were found to be well conserved between VEGF-B and VEGF, but the introns of the VEGF-B genes were generally smaller than the introns of the VEGF gene (18Houck K. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 91: 1806-1814Google Scholar, 19Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J. Abraham J. J. Biol.

Coding sequences are in upper case letters; intron sequences are in lower case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 300-bp intron after exon 5 in VEGF-B differs from the human gene for VEGF, which is 3 kilobases in length and contains an alternatively spliced exon found in VEGF189 and VEGF206 (18Houck K. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 91: 1806-1814Google Scholar, 19Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J. Abraham J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Google Scholar). When this intron in VEGF-B was analyzed more carefully, no exon corresponding to the sixth exon of human VEGF could be identified. Instead, the 3′-ends of this intron and the following exon were found to be identical with corresponding sequences of the cDNA clones encoding mouse and human VEGF-B186. We conclude that the VEGF-B186 mRNA is formed by use of an alternative splice acceptor site during splicing, resulting in an insertion of a 101-bp intron sequence into these mRNAs. To determine whether the two VEGF-B splice isoforms exhibit a differential tissue distribution and whether additional isoforms exist, RT-PCR analysis was carried out using total RNA extracted from mouse brain, heart, liver, and kidney and from human embryonic heart and skeletal muscle. The cDNA sequences were amplified using two pairs of specific primers covering exons 4 to 6B or 7 and exons 3 or 4 to 7 in the mouse and human VEGF-B genes, respectively. Analysis of amplified PCR products from mouse tissues by agarose gel electrophoresis showed two major bands from each pair of primers used in the reactions. The lengths of these bands were 172 and 273 bp (using primers mp1 and mp2; see “Experimental Procedures” for the identity of the primers), and 223 and 324 bp in length (using primers mp1 and mp3, respectively) (Fig. 4A). Similar analysis of RNA from human fetal heart and skeletal muscle using two pairs of primers resulted in the amplification of bands of 223 and 324 bp (using primers hp1 and hp3) and 329 and 430 bp (using primers hp2 and hp3), respectively (data not shown). The amplified bands thus corresponded to the mRNAs for VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186. Furthermore, amplification of mRNAs from different tissues yielded the two bands with roughly similar intensity, suggesting that the two isoforms were expressed at approximately equal levels in the tissues examined. To verify the identity of the amplified products from mouse tissues, the PCR-amplified DNA from the primer combination mp1 and mp3 was transferred to a filter and probed with specific oligonucleotide probes for exons 6A and 6B. The autoradiograms showed that an exon 6A-specific probe hybridized with the 324-bp band, whereas an exon 6B-specific probe hybridized with both the 223- and 324-bp bands. Similarly, nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified bands from the two human embryonic tissues showed that these bands were generated from transcripts encoding VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186. These results confirmed that the two isoforms of VEGF-B are generated by alternative usage of the exon 6 splice acceptor sites and that both major amplified PCR products correspond to those predicted from the sequences of VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186 isoforms (Fig. 4B). The expression of VEGF-B186 transcripts in different tissues was investigated by Northern blotting and hybridization using a probe specific for the 101-bp insertion in VEGF-B186 mRNA (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The probe hybridized to VEGF-B186 cDNA but not to VEGF-B167 cDNA (Fig. 5A). The 1.4-kilobase mouse and human VEGF-B186 transcripts were expressed in several tissues in a pattern almost identical with that reported previously for both VEGF-B mRNAs (Fig. 5B) (3Olofsson B.

https://openalex.org/W2072170340,"Sequence comparisons with the Mr 8,000 light chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein revealed the presence of highly conserved homologues (up to 90% identity) in the expressed sequence tag data base (King, S. M. & Patel-King, R. S. (1995a) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11445-11452). Several of these homologous sequences were derived from organisms and/or tissues that lack motile cilia/flagella, suggesting that these proteins may function in the cytoplasm. In Drosophila, lack of the homologous protein results in embryonic lethality (Dick, T., Ray, K., Salz, H. K. & Chia, W. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol., 16, 1966-1977). Fractionation of mammalian brain homogenates reveals three distinct cytosolic pools of the homologous protein, one of which specifically copurifies with cytoplasmic dynein following both ATP-sensitive microtubule affinity/sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody specific for the 74-kDa intermediate chain (IC74). Quantitative densitometry indicates that there is one copy of the Mr 8,000 polypeptide per IC74. Dual channel confocal immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that the Mr 8,000 protein is significantly colocalized with cytoplasmic dynein but not with kinesin in punctate structures (many of which are associated with microtubules) within mammalian oligodendrocytes. Thus, it appears that flagellar outer arm and brain cytoplasmic dyneins share a highly conserved light chain polypeptide that, at least in Drosophila, is essential for viability. Sequence comparisons with the Mr 8,000 light chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein revealed the presence of highly conserved homologues (up to 90% identity) in the expressed sequence tag data base (King, S.

Thus, it appears that flagellar outer arm and brain cytoplasmic dyneins share a highly conserved light chain polypeptide that, at least in Drosophila, is essential for viability. Dyneins are microtubule-based molecular motors that function in both the cytoplasm and flagellum. Within the flagellum, these enzymes provide the force required for interdoublet microtubule sliding, which forms the basis for flagellar bending (for reviews see various chapters in Warner et al. (53Warner F.D. Satir P. Gibbons I.R. Cell Movement Vol. 1: The Dynein ATPases. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar)). The roles of the cytoplasmic isozymes remain to be fully elucidated. However, to date, known or suspected functions for cytoplasmic dynein include retrograde transport in axons, movement of endosomes and lysosomes, subcellular organization of the Golgi apparatus, nuclear migration, and positioning of the mitotic spindle (Corthésy-Theulaz et al., 5Corthésy-Theulaz I.

There are also several studies supporting a role for dynein during anaphase (Pfarr et al., 40Pfarr C.M. Coue M. Grissom P.M. Hays T.S. Porter M.E. McIntosh J.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 263-265Google Scholar; Saunders et al., 48Saunders W.S. Koshland D. Eshel D. Gibbons I.R. Hoyt M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 617-624Google Scholar; Steuer et al., 51Steuer E. Wordeman L. Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 266-268Google Scholar). Recent molecular data demonstrate unequivocally that flagellar and cytoplasmic dyneins are related. Each dynein contains two to three heavy chains (DHCs) 1The abbreviations used are: DHCdynein heavy chainICintermediate chainLClight chainLIClight intermediate chainTBSTris-buffered saline. of ~520 kDa that contain the motor domains and sites of ATP hydrolysis (see Holzbaur et al. (12Holzbaur E.L.F. Mikami A. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1994: 251Google Scholar) and Witman et al. (59Witman G.B. Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1994: 229Google Scholar) for reviews). However, except in the vicinity of the ATP binding loops, the degree of conservation between DHCs is rather low; e.g. the Chlamydomonas flagellar γ DHC (Wilkerson et al., 54Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Witman G.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 497-506Google Scholar) and rat brain cytoplasmic DHC (Mikami et al., 27Mikami A. Paschal B.M. Mazumdar M. Vallee R.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 787-796Google Scholar) are only ~26% identical overall. In addition, the cytoplasmic and flagellar outer arm isoforms contain related intermediate chains (ICs) of 70-80 kDa (Mitchell & Kang, 29Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 835-842Google Scholar; Ogawa et al., 33Ogawa K. Kamiya R. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 685-696Google Scholar; Paschal et al., 37Paschal B.M. Mikami A.

All these IC polypeptides contain multiple WD repeats that likely are involved in protein-protein interactions (Neer et al., 32Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Google Scholar; Wilkerson et al., 55Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 169-178Google Scholar). Within the Chlamydomonas flagellum, ICs are essential for outer arm assembly (Mitchell & Kang, 29Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 835-842Google Scholar; Wilkerson et al., 55Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 169-178Google Scholar), and one (IC78) has been shown to mediate attachment of the outer arm motor to its cargo (King et al., 21King S.M. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8401-8407Google Scholar, 20King S.M. Patel-King R.S. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 399-409Google Scholar). Multiple forms of the cytoplasmic dynein IC generated by alternative splicing and phosphorylation have been described (Dillman & Pfister, 56Wilson R. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Google Scholar; Paschal et al., 37Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Google Scholar; Pfister et al., 43Pfister K.K. Salata M.W.

Chem. 1996; 271 (b): 1687-1694Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized by analogy with the flagellar ICs that these are involved in the targeting of cytoplasmic dynein to various intracellular cargoes. Indeed, IC74 has recently been shown to mediate the interaction of cytoplasmic dynein with dynactin (Karki & Holzbaur, 14Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Google Scholar; Vaughan & Vallee, 15King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 11445-11452Google Scholar). Again, however, the conservation between cytoplasmic and flagellar components is low (~25% identity between Chlamydomonas IC78 and rat brain IC74). dynein heavy chain intermediate chain light chain light intermediate chain Tris-buffered saline. Cytoplasmic dynein also contains several polypeptides (light intermediate chains (LICs)) of 50-60 kDa that are related to the ABC transporter family of ATPases (Gill et al., 10Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Google Scholar; Hughes et al., 13Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24Google Scholar). No flagellar homologues of the LICs have yet been positively identified, although the trout sperm outer arm dynein does contain several polypeptides of appropriate mass (Gatti et al., 9Gatti J.-L. King S.M. Moss A.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11450-11457Google Scholar). Both inner and outer arm flagellar dyneins contain one or more polypeptides of 8-30 kDa that have not been reported as components of cytoplasmic dynein. For example, the outer arm from Chlamydomonas flagella contains eight such light chain polypeptides (LCs), several of which are present in multiple copies (Pfister et al., 42Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1982; 2: 525-547Google Scholar; Piperno & Luck, 46Piperno G. Luck D.J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3084-3090Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular studies of LCs from several outer arm systems have implicated a number of these polypeptides in the cAMP and Ca2+-mediated regulation of dynein motor function (Barkalow et al., 4Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Google Scholar; King & Patel-King, 1995b; Stephens & Prior, 50Stephens R.E. Prior G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 999-1012Google Scholar). Recently, we described the molecular cloning of the Mr 8,000 and 11,000 LCs from the outer arm of Chlamydomonas flagella (King & Patel-King, 1995a). These polypeptides are thought to associate with the ICs at the base of the soluble dynein particle (Mitchell & Rosenbaum, 1986). Examination of the sequence data bases revealed a number of LC homologues of unknown function that share up to ~90% amino acid sequence identity with the Chlamydomonas Mr 8,000 protein. Unexpectedly, several of these homologous sequences were obtained from cDNA libraries derived from organisms and/or tissues that do not contain motile cilia/flagella. For example, cDNAs for Mr 8,000 LC homologues have now been identified in nematodes, higher plants, and a number of human tissue-specific libraries including one derived from white blood cells. Identification of these homologues from nonciliated/flagellated systems suggested that these proteins may function in the cytoplasm and raised the intriguing possibility that they represent previously unrecognized components of cytoplasmic dynein (King & Patel-King, 1995a). Partial and total loss-of-function mutants for a Drosophila Mr 8,000 LC homologue have now been isolated by Dick et al. (7Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Google Scholar). Partial loss of protein function gave rise to severe pleiotropic morphogenetic deficencies in bristle and wing development and also caused defects in oogenesis resulting in female sterility. Total loss of function of this protein resulted in massive cell death via the apoptotic pathway leading to embryonic lethality. Thus, it has become of considerable interest to identify the subcellular location of these LC homologues to determine whether these proteins are in fact components of cytoplasmic dynein and if, as a consequence, the severe phenotypes observed in the Drosophila mutants might be due to the dysfunction of that enzyme. In this report, we demonstrate that the mammalian homologue of the Mr 8,000 protein is indeed a component of brain cytoplasmic dynein. Searches of the GenBank™ and Expressed Sequence Tag data bases maintained at NCBI were performed using BLAST. Sequence comparisons were generated by the GCG programs PILEUP and GAP using the default parameters for the creation and extension of gaps in the sequences (Devereux et al., 6Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against the Chlamydomonas Mr 8,000 LC expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose binding protein (R4058; King & Patel-King (1995a)). For some experiments, we obtained a more highly purified anti-Mr 8,000 LC antibody fraction by blot purification (Olmsted, 34Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Google Scholar). In this case, whole axonemal protein or the factor Xa-digested recombinant protein was separated in a 5-15% acrylamide gradient gel and blotted to nitrocellulose. The appropriate molecular weight regions of the axoneme and recombinant LC blots were excised and incubated overnight with serum diluted ~1:3 with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. Antibody bound to the nitrocellulose strip was eluted by a 1-2-min incubation with a small volume of 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.16. Eluted antibody was immediately neutralized by the addition of 1.5 M Tris·Cl, pH 8.8, and stored at −20°C until use. Wild type axonemes were prepared from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain cc124 using standard methods (Witman, 57Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Google Scholar). Outer arm dynein was extracted with 0.6 M NaCl and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described in King et al. (19King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Google Scholar). Bovine and rat brain cytoplasmic dyneins were prepared using a minor modification of the standard ATP-sensitive microtubule affinity procedure followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Paschal et al., 38Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 181-191Google Scholar). Briefly, a high speed supernatant of homogenized bovine or rat brain was incubated at 37°C in the presence of taxol to allow microtubule polymerization. Following centrifugation, the microtubule pellet was washed with buffer and then sequentially eluted with 5 mM GTP, 5 mM ATP, and 1.0 M NaCl. The dynein in the ATP eluate then was further purified by centrifugation through 5-20% sucrose density gradients. Cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and dynactin also were isolated directly from rat brain homogenate by immunoprecipitation with antibodies 74-1 (dynein; Dillman & Pfister (1994)), H-2 (kinesin; Pfister et al. (45Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1453-1463Google Scholar)) and 50-1 (dynactin; Paschal et al. (36Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Pfister K.K. Clark S. Meyer D.I. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15318-15323Google Scholar)) using the methodology described in Dillman & Pfister (1994). A mock immunoprecipitation containing beads but no primary antibody also was included as a negative control. Fractions of cytoplasmic and flagellar dyneins at various stages of purification were electrophoresed in 5-15% or 4-16% acrylamide gradient gels as described in King et al. (19King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Google Scholar) and Dillman & Pfister (1994). These systems ensure that proteins as small as the Mr 8,000 LC are separated from the dye front. Polyacrylamide gels were stained first with Coomassie Blue and in some cases, subsequently with silver (Merril et al., 26Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Google Scholar). Quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained gels was performed using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) or a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer and ImageQuant software. Alternatively, gels were electroblotted to nitrocellulose (BA-83; Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) in 10 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM Na2CO3, 0.01% SDS, 20% methanol. Blots were incubated with 5% dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and then probed with primary antibody diluted at least 1:500 in the same buffer. Following several washes, blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:3000) and washed several more times in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and once in 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS. Antibody reactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Corp.) and Fuji RX film. Following immunodetection, blots were stained with Amido Black to reveal total protein. Sucrose gradient-purified bovine brain cytoplasmic dynein was concentrated in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Danvers, MA) that had previously been incubated with 5% Tween 20 in TBS overnight to reduce nonspecific protein binding. The concentrated sample was then electrophoresed in a 5-15% acrylamide gradient gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon Psq, Millipore, Woburn, MA) using the conditions described above. The Mr 8,000 band was excised from the blot and digested with trypsin. Peptides eluting from the membrane were purified by reverse phase chromatography on an Aquapore RP-300 (C8) column. Peptides were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 492A sequencer in the protein chemistry facility at the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research (Shrewsbury, MA). Mouse and rat brain oligodendrocytes were cultured, fixed, and treated for immunocytochemistry as described previously (Ainger et al., 2Ainger K. Avossa D. Morgan F. Hill S.J. Barry C. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 431-441Google Scholar; Barbarese et al., 3Barbarese E. Koppel D.E. Deutscher M.P. Smith C.L. Ainger K. Morgan F. Carson J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2781-2790Google Scholar). Samples were imaged using dual channel confocal fluorescence microscopy. Ratiometric analysis of single particles in the dual channel images was performed as described in Barbarese et al. (3Barbarese E. Koppel D.E. Deutscher M.P. Smith C.L. Ainger K. Morgan F. Carson J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2781-2790Google Scholar). Briefly, the pixel coordinates for well resolved particles in either channel were determined, and the total intensity in the surrounding 25 pixels was measured in both channels. The ratio value for each particle was then determined from the intensity in the green channel divided by the sum of the intensities in both channels. Particles labeled in the red channel with little or no label in the green channel have low ratio values (near 0.0) and appear red. Conversely, particles primarily labeled in the green channel have high values (near 1.0) and are green. Those particles, which are labeled in both channels, are yellow and have intermediate ratio values. Intensity ratios were calculated from several hundred particles for each combination of fluorescently tagged antibodies. The outer dynein arm from Chlamydomonas flagella contains eight distinct LCs (Pfister et al. (42Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1982; 2: 525-547Google Scholar); Piperno & Luck (1979); for review see Witman et al. (59Witman G.B. Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1994: 229Google Scholar)). Molecular cloning of the Mr 8,000 and 11,000 LCs identified a novel protein family including several highly conserved homologues derived from organisms or tissues lacking cilia and flagella (King & Patel-King, 1995a). Recently, several additional mammalian and higher plant homologues of the Mr 8,000 flagellar LC have been entered into the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, a related Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein (DYN2) has been revealed by the genome sequencing project and a highly conserved homologue from Drosophila also has been described (Dick et al., 7Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Google Scholar). Together, these sequences define two distinct subsets within this protein family. The first group comprises the Chlamydomonas flagellar Mr 8,000 LC and mammalian, insect, and nematode homologues, all of which share ~90% sequence identity with the Chlamydomonas protein. A comparison between these polypeptides generated by the GCG program PILEUP is shown in Fig. 1. The second group is more diverse (sharing ~25-40% identity with the Chlamydomonas Mr 8,000 protein) and contains both higher plant and yeast homologues as well as the Chlamydomonas flagellar Mr 11,000 LC (not shown). In order to identify highly conserved Mr 8,000 LC homologues, the Chlamydomonas LC was expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose binding protein, and the resulting preparation was used to obtain a high affinity polyclonal antiserum (R4058; King & Patel-King (1995a)). This antibody is highly specific for the Mr 8,000 LC. When used to probe Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemes or purified outer arm dynein, it reacts solely with Mr 8,000 LC and does not react with other dynein or axonemal components, including the homologous Mr11,000 LC with which it shares 42% identity (Fig. 2a). Similar blots were stained with the preimmune serum at a dilution of 1:50. These blots showed no reactive bands, indicating that the preimmune serum does not contain antibodies that recognize Chlamydomonas axonemal proteins. To further assess the specificity of this antibody, it was used to probe rat oligodendrocyte protein on immunoblots. Only a single immunoreactive band migrating at Mr ~8,000 was observed (Fig. 2b). Because oligodendrocytes lack cilia and flagella, this suggests that the rat Mr 8,000 LC homologue is a cytosolic protein. To investigate the hypothesis that the cytosolic Mr 8,000 protein is associated with cytoplasmic dynein (King & Patel-King, 1995a), successive fractions from a standard cytoplasmic dynein purification scheme were probed with the R4058 antibody and with antibody 74-1 (Dillman & Pfister, 1994), which reacts specifically with IC74 from cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 3). Approximately 40% of the Mr 8,000 protein and ~90% of IC74 were found in the first microtubule pellet. Thus, there appears to be a significant cytoplasmic pool of the Mr 8,000 protein in whole brain that does not associate with microtubules at least under the homogenization/polymerization conditions used here. However, nearly all the Mr 8,000 protein found in the first microtubule pellet remained microtubule-bound following sequential incubations with buffer and 5 mM GTP. Upon ATP addition, ~75% of IC74 and ~30% of the Mr 8,000 protein were eluted from the microtubules; this ATP-eluted fraction constitutes a second pool of the Mr 8,000 protein. The small amount of IC74 not eluted with ATP was completely solubilized following incubation with 1 M NaCl. Interestingly, only ~50% of the remaining Mr 8,000 protein was salt extracted, suggesting the existence of a third pool of this protein in whole brain. Thus, the three pools of Mr 8,000 protein are (i) nonmicrotubule associated, (ii) microtubule-associated, ATP-extracted, and (iii) microtubule-associated, non-ATP extracted. Following ATP elution from the microtubule pellet, the crude cytoplasmic dynein preparation was sedimented through a 5-20% sucrose density gradient. The ATP-eluted Mr 8,000 protein was found to exclusively cosediment with bona fide cytoplasmic dynein proteins (Fig. 4; fractions 7-9). It was not found in fractions containing kinesin (fractions 10-13) nor did it precisely cosediment with dynactin, which was found both in cytoplasmic dynein-containing fractions and in fractions extending from the dynein peak to the bottom of the gradient (fractions 1-9). This fractionation profile suggests that cytoplasmic dynein is indeed associated with a Mr 8,000 protein recognized by the R4058 antibody. To further investigate the association of cytoplasmic dynein with the Mr 8,000 protein, cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and dynactin were each purified directly from a rat brain homogenate by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies, 2We have attempted to use both the R4058 antibody and a second polyclonal antibody made against the Mr 8,000 Chlamydomonas protein to immunoprecipitate associated polypeptides from both rat brain homogenates and Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts. In neither case were any proteins (including the Mr 8,000 LC) obtained in the pellet. i.e. by a methodology distinct from that used above. An Amido Black-stained blot of proteins in the resulting precipitates and in the bead control is shown in Fig. 5. In each immunoprecipitate, only the cognate complex was observed on the stained blot. When these samples were probed with monoclonal antibody 74-1 and with the R4058 antibody, both IC74 and the Mr 8,000 protein were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic dynein sample; no detectable R4058 or 74-1 immunoreactivity was found in either the bead control, kinesin, or dynactin samples. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the Mr 8,000 protein is a component of cytoplasmic dynein and further demonstrate that it is not associated with either kinesin or dynactin. No components of less than ~50 kDa have previously been described associated with cytoplasmic dynein. However, in view of the high degree of sequence identity between LC homologues and our identification of an R4058-immunoreactive protein within cytoplasmic dynein, this complex was examined for the presence of LC components. The bovine brain enzyme purified by ATP-sensitive microtubule affinity, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation was subject to electrophoretic conditions known to resolve the light chains of flagellar dynein both from each other and from the dye front. Upon Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6a), the DHC, IC74, and both sets of LICs were readily detected in the cytoplasmic dynein sample. This same gel subsequently was silver-stained (Fig. 6b), which revealed additional discrete bands of Mr 22,000, 14,000, and 8,000 in the cytoplasmic dynein sample. Comparison of these low molecular weight components of brain cytoplasmic dynein with the LCs of Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein is shown in Fig. 6c. Bands of similar Mr also were observed in immunoprecipitated rat brain cytoplasmic dynein following Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6d). The results discussed above rely solely on antibody reactivity to identify the dynein-associated Mr 8,000 protein. In order to further demonstrate the identity of the cytoplasmic dynein-associated Mr 8,000 protein, we isolated bovine cytoplasmic dynein by microtubule affinity and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Following electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the Mr 8,000 protein band was excised and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography. Two peptides were sequenced and yielded a total of 19/19 unambiguous residue assignments (Table I). One peptide is 100% identical with a portion of the human and rat Mr 8,000 proteins (cf. Fig. 1). The second bovine peptide is 100% identical to sections of the Chlamydomonas, nematode, and Drosophila proteins; both human and rat sequences show a single conservative substitution. Thus, the peptide sequencing unambiguously confirms the identity of the R4058-immunoreactive Mr 8,000 protein associated with cytoplasmic dynein as a highly conserved homologue of the Chlamydomonas flagellar Mr 8,000 protein.Table IPeptide sequences obtained from the electrophoretically-purified Mr 8,000 protein associated with bovine brain cytoplasmic dyneinPeptide SequenceIdentity (cf.

Open table in a new tab Determination of the stoichiometry of the Mr 8,000 LC within the dynein particle might provide significant clues as to its function. Previously reported quantitative densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels suggested a very high stoichiometry for the Mr 8,000 LC within flagellar dynein, with perhaps as many as ten copies per Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein particle (data quoted in King & Witman (24Luck D.J.L.

The composition, polypeptide associations, and stoichiometry of the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm are tabulated in Table II. To determine the stoichiometry of the Mr 8,000 protein within cytoplasmic dynein, quantitative densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels of dynein purified both by microtubule affinity/sucrose density gradient centrifugation and by immunoprecipitation was performed (Table III). The data indicate that there is approximately one copy of the Mr 8,000 protein per copy of IC74. Thus this protein is indeed a stoichiometric component of cytoplasmic dynein.Table II.Polypeptides within Chlamydomonas outer arm dyneinPolypeptideAssociationsaKing et al.

https://openalex.org/W2043610475,"We describe the isolation of a novel protein from the conditioned medium of human articular cartilage chondrocytes in primary culture. This 39-kDa protein has the N-terminal sequence YKL, which we have termed YKL-39. The 1434-nucleotide sequence of the YKL-39 cDNA predicts a 385-residue initial translation product and a 364-residue mature YKL-39. The amino acid sequence of YKL-39 is most closely related to YKL-40, followed by macrophage chitotriosidase, oviductal glycoprotein, and macrophage YM-1. All five proteins share significant sequence identity with bacterial chitinases and have the probable structure of an (αβ)8 barrel. YKL-39 lacks the active site glutamate, which is essential for the activity of chitinases, and as expected has no chitinase activity. The highest level of YKL-39 mRNA expression is seen in chondrocytes, followed by synoviocytes, lung, and heart. YKL-39 accounts for 4% of the protein in chondrocyte-conditioned medium, prostromelysin accounts for 17%, and YKL-40 accounts for 33%. In contrast to YKL-40, YKL-39 is not a glycoprotein and does not bind to heparin. We describe the isolation of a novel protein from the conditioned medium of human articular cartilage chondrocytes in primary culture. This 39-kDa protein has the N-terminal sequence YKL, which we have termed YKL-39. The 1434-nucleotide sequence of the YKL-39 cDNA predicts a 385-residue initial translation product and a 364-residue mature YKL-39. The amino acid sequence of YKL-39 is most closely related to YKL-40, followed by macrophage chitotriosidase, oviductal glycoprotein, and macrophage YM-1. All five proteins share significant sequence identity with bacterial chitinases and have the probable structure of an (αβ)8 barrel. YKL-39 lacks the active site glutamate, which is essential for the activity of chitinases, and as expected has no chitinase activity. The highest level of YKL-39 mRNA expression is seen in chondrocytes, followed by synoviocytes, lung, and heart. YKL-39 accounts for 4% of the protein in chondrocyte-conditioned medium, prostromelysin accounts for 17%, and YKL-40 accounts for 33%. In contrast to YKL-40, YKL-39 is not a glycoprotein and does not bind to heparin. In this study we report the discovery of a new member of the mammalian protein family related in sequence to bacterial chitinases. This protein family has an (αβ)8 barrel structure (1Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Google Scholar, 2Coulson A.F.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 41-44Google Scholar) and includes a protein secreted from human macrophages that does have chitinase activity, which is termed chitotriosidase (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Google Scholar), and three proteins with no presently known enzymatic activity, YKL-40 (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar), YM-1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number M94584), and oviductal glycoprotein (6Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Google Scholar). Because the new member of this family, which we have termed YKL-39, is more closely related in size and sequence to YKL-40 than to other members of this family, it is useful to summarize research on YKL-40 as a background for the present investigation. YKL-40 is a 40-kDa glycoprotein that was first discovered as a heparin-binding protein secreted from bovine breast tissue during the massive tissue involution that follows the cessation of lactation (7Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 329-334Google Scholar). YKL-40 was subsequently discovered as a heparin-binding protein in the conditioned medium of human synoviocytes (8Nyirkos P. Golds E.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 265-268Google Scholar), chondrocytes (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar, 9Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Google Scholar), and the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line (10Johansen J.S. Williamson M.K. Rice J.S. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 501-512Google Scholar). YKL-40 has also been discovered as a heparin-binding protein expressed by porcine vascular smooth muscle cells undergoing a differentiation transition (11Shackelton L.M. Mann D.M. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13076-13083Google Scholar) and as a protein expressed selectively by murine mammary tumors initiated by neu/ras oncogenes (12Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426Google Scholar). The present studies were initiated to further examine the expression of YKL-40 by human articular cartilage chondrocytes in culture. In the course of these studies YKL-39 was found as a protein that copurified with YKL-40. We report here the discovery, purification, characterization, and sequence of human YKL-39. Chondrocytes and synoviocytes were obtained from Martin Lotz, director of the University of California, San Diego osteoarthritis cell culture facility and were isolated and cultured essentially as described (13Maier R. Ganu V. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21527-21532Google Scholar). Cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus of the knee joints was obtained at autopsy from donors without known history of joint disease or from healthy organ donors from the University of California, San Diego tissue bank. Cartilage slices were cut into pieces (2-3 mm3), washed with DMEM, 1The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumYKL-39the 39-kDa human chondrocyte protein with the N terminus YKLYKL-40the 40-kDa human chondrocyte protein with the N terminus YKL (also called HC gp-39; see Ref. 4Hakala B.E.

The tissues were transferred to DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin-Fungizone, and 2 mg/ml clostridial collagenase type IV (Sigma) and digested overnight on a shaker until the tissue fragments were dissolved. The cells were washed three times with DMEM and cultured in T175 flasks containing 30 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum until confluent. All experiments reported here used chondrocytes in primary culture or at passage 1 following a 1:3 subculture. To harvest conditioned culture medium, chondrocyte cultures were grown to confluence in T175 flasks, washed twice with 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in 30 ml of serum-free DMEM for 1 week.

Synovial tissues were obtained from knee joints and washed with DMEM, minced, and treated with trypsin (10% v/v) for 15 min in a 37°C water bath. The tissue fragments were then transferred to DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin-Fungizone, and 2 mg/ml clostridial collagenase type IV (Sigma) and digested on a shaker until dissolution of the fragments (about 3 h). The cells were washed three times with DMEM and cultured in T175 flasks. After 24 h nonadherent cells were removed, and the adherent synovial cells were further cultured until confluent and then harvested for RNA isolation. To fractionate conditioned medium proteins by size (see Fig. 1), 200 ml of medium obtained after 1 week of culture in serum-free conditions was concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa MWCO membrane and applied to a 2 × 150-cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column equilibrated with 150 mM NH4HCO3 at room temperature. To remove YKL-40 and other heparin-binding proteins, 600 ml of conditioned medium was passed through a 2 × 15-cm heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column initially equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The unbound proteins were concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration and then applied to a 2 × 150-cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column equilibrated with 150 mM NH4HCO3 at room temperature (see Fig. 2).Fig. 2Purification of YKL-39 by filtration over Sephacryl S-300 HR of the conditioned medium proteins that do not bind heparin. 600 ml of 7-day conditioned medium (Fig. 1) were first passed over a 2 × 30-cm column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B to remove YKL-40 and other heparin-binding proteins. The unbound fraction was concentrated to 5 ml and applied to a 2 × 150-cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column equilibrated with 150 mM NH4HCO3 at room temperature. Fraction volume, 4.2 ml (see “Materials and Methods” for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions using 4-20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or with the periodic acid-Schiff reaction (glycoprotein detection kit, Sigma). Conditioned medium was obtained from primary chondrocytes cultured in the absence of serum for 7 days and was dialyzed against milli Q water before concentration for electrophoresis (see Fig. 1, inset, lane 2). Purified proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a ProSpin device (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division model 494 sequenator equipped with online high performance liquid chromatography. As explained under “Results,” clone 118809 isolated by the Washington University-Merck EST Project from a human lung cDNA library proved to be a cDNA clone of YKL-39. We purchased this clone from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). SmaI and XhoI digestion of this clone showed that it contains a 1.5-kilobase insert. We sequenced the 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert DNA using a T7 primer and a M13 reverse primer for the pBluescript SK(−) phagemid and a version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Synthetic primers were synthesized from the DNA sequences and used to extend the sequence in increments until the sequence of both strands was determined. Total RNA was isolated from chondrocytes, synoviocytes, MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, normal dermal fibroblasts, and Hep G2 liver cells with an RNA STAT-60™ kit (Tel-Test “B,” Inc., Friendswood, TX). Thirty µg of total RNA from each cell line was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer and transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.). A multiple tissue Northern blot containing total RNA from human heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen was purchased from BioChain Institute, Inc. (San Leandro, CA). Following prehybridization for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42°C, blots were hybridized with random primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes for 16-20 h under identical conditions. Filters were washed three times for 1 h each with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C and then exposed to x-ray film. The blots were first hybridized with the EcoRI fragment of clone 118809 (nucleotides 388-1256, see Fig. 4) and after exposure to x-ray film were then stripped by boiling in H2O containing 0.5% SDS and rehybridized with cDNA probes for YKL-40 (nucleotides 135-916, see Ref. 4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The chitinase activity of YKL-39 was tested with the fluorogenic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma), and the p-nitrophenyl substrates p-nitrophenyl β-D-N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and p-nitrophenyl β-D-N,N′,N′′-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma), as described by Renkema et al. (14Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Google Scholar). Chitinase from Serratia marcescens (Sigma) was used as a positive control. To harvest proteins secreted from chondrocytes, primary cultures of human articular cartilage chondrocytes were grown to confluence in media containing 10% fetal calf serum and then switched to serum-free medium. After 1 week of culture, conditioned medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration and fractionated by molecular weight using Sephacryl S-300 HR. As seen in Fig. 1, the major protein component in conditioned medium emerges in an asymmetric peak centered at fraction 79. Fraction 79 gave a band 2When purified YKL-40 is dried in preparation for loading onto a gel, it gives variable amounts of dimeric YKL-40 (data not shown). This accounts for the 80-kDa band seen in Fig. 1 (inset), a band that was not seen in the SDS-PAGE of these fractions when the drying step was omitted. at 40 kDa upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, inset) and proved to be YKL-40 by the criteria of N-terminal protein sequencing (YKLVXYYTSW-) and by radioimmunoassay (9Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Google Scholar). The next most abundant protein component in chondrocyte-conditioned medium emerges in an asymmetric peak centered at fraction 70. N-terminal protein sequencing of fraction 70 identified a major sequence identical to human prostromelysin and a minor sequence identical to bovine serum albumin. (The presence of some bovine albumin in conditioned medium is not unusual in such experiments, since albumin is the most abundant protein in fetal calf serum and so is the most likely serum constituent to contaminate serum-free conditioned medium.) Several experiments were carried out to ascertain the cause of the asymmetry in the YKL-40 peak centered at fraction 79 in Fig. 1. When the level of YKL-40 was determined by radioimmunoassay (9Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Google Scholar), there was a good correlation between A220 and immunoreactivity for fractions 77-80 but less immunoreactivity than expected based on absorbance for fractions 81-84 (data not shown). This result indicated the possible presence of an A220-absorbing protein constituent not recognized by the radioimmunoassay for YKL-40. SDS-PAGE of fraction 83 revealed a doublet at 39-40 kDa (Fig. 1, inset). N-terminal protein sequencing of fraction 83 revealed the apparent presence of two sequences, and therefore two proteins, each in approximately equimolar amounts. One sequence is that of YKL-40 (YKLVXYTWSQR-) and the other is very similar to YKL-40 (YKLVXYTWSQR-). To further evaluate the possible existence of a putative YKL-40-related protein, another portion of the serum-free conditioned medium whose fractionation is shown in Fig. 1 was separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, inset) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Subsequent N-terminal protein sequencing of the intense protein band centered at 40 kDa revealed a mixture of two sequences, the major (90%) of which is identical to YKL-40 and the minor (10%) of which is identical to the putative YKL-40-related protein. Interestingly, the N-terminal sequencing of YKL-40 purified from conditioned medium by heparin affinity chromatography, our customary procedure for purification of the protein (9Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Google Scholar), yielded only the expected sequence of YKL-40 with no trace of the putative YKL-40-related protein. To see whether the putative YKL-40-related protein might be among the conditioned medium proteins that did not bind to the heparin column, the unbound protein fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration and fractionated by molecular weight using the same Sephacryl S-300 HR column. As can be seen in Fig. 2, there is a protein constituent at the approximate elution volume of YKL-40 centered at effluent fraction 91. N-terminal protein sequencing of fraction 91 revealed the presence of a single sequence, YKLVXYFTNWSQDRQEPGKFTPENI-, the sequence predicted for the YKL-40-related protein, with no trace of the YKL-40 sequence itself. SDS gel electrophoresis revealed this protein to be 39 kDa in apparent mass and therefore slightly smaller than YKL-40 (Fig. 3a), and staining of the gel for carbohydrate showed that the YKL-40-related protein is not a glycoprotein, whereas, as previous studies have shown (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar, 7Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 329-334Google Scholar), YKL-40 itself is (Fig. 3b). Since YKL-40 and the YKL-40-related protein have the same N-terminal sequence YKL but differ in apparent mass, we have given the YKL-40-related protein the provisional name YKL-39 to denote its 39-kDa apparent mass and so distinguish it from the 40-kDa YKL-40. The other major protein component seen in the chromatogram shown in Fig. 2 emerges in an asymmetric peak centered at fraction 76. N-terminal protein sequencing of fraction 76 revealed it to be a mixture of human prostromelysin and bovine albumin. Based on the recovery of A220 absorbance, a direct measure of total protein, we calculate from the data in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 that 10 confluent T175 flasks of articular cartilage chondrocytes accumulate 18 mg of total protein (assuming a 1 mg/ml protein concentration has an A220 = 10.0) into conditioned medium after 1 week of culture in serum-free conditions. Of this total, YKL-40 accounts for 6 mg (33% of total protein) and YKL-39 accounts for 0.75 mg (4%). The five fractions in Fig. 1 that contain almost all of the prostromelysin (fractions 69-73; based on SDS-PAGE) account for 3 mg of the conditioned medium protein (17%). Because these fractions are contaminated with albumin, the actual amount of prostromelysin in conditioned medium must be somewhat lower. Before initiating efforts to clone YKL-39 we investigated the possibility that clones for YKL-39 may have already been partially sequenced as part of the Washington University-Merck EST Project. One approach was to design a predicted cDNA sequence from the N-terminal 25-residue sequence of YKL-39 using where possible the preferred codon usage in humans. When we used this to screen the EST data base with the Blast N program (15Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar), only one sequence gave a significant match, clone 257753 (GenBank™/EBI accession number N40107). The other approach was to use the known cDNA sequence of YKL-40 itself to identify sequences closely related to, but not identical with, YKL-40. This approach yielded an additional clone, clone 118809 (GenBank™/EBI accession number T91693). The partial sequences for clones 257753 and 118809 that were available in the EST data base indicated a region of overlap identity, and we therefore concluded that they were clones of the same gene. We then obtained clone 118809 and determined its complete cDNA sequence. Fig. 4 shows the complete nucleotide sequence of clone 118809 and the deduced amino acid sequence of YKL-39. The coding region of YKL-39 is terminated by a TGA triplet at nucleotide 1191 and is followed by 242 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region with a potential polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at nucleotides 1391-1396. The ATG, found at nucleotides 36-38, was considered to be the initiation codon according to the rules for translation initiation described previously (16Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). The open reading frame codes for a 385-residue-long protein containing a 21-residue transmembrane signal peptide with a potential signal peptidase cleavage site at amino acid residue 21 (17Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar). The predicted protein, after removal of the signal peptide, has a length of 364 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 40,825 Da. The predicted N-terminal sequence of YKL-39 is identical to the N-terminal 25-residue sequence determined by protein sequencing of the purified protein. The putative NXS site of N-glycosylation in YKL-40, asparagine residue 60 and serine residue 62 (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar), is not found in YKL-39. There is a single potential recognition site for N-glycosylation in YKL-39, the NWS sequence at residues 30 to 32. This site does not appear to be a functional site of N-glycosylation in YKL-39 secreted from chondrocytes, however, since no carbohydrate could be detected in purified YKL-39 (Fig. 3b) and N-terminal sequencing of the mature YKL-39 revealed the expected repetitive yield of asparagine at residue 9. Although the predicted number of amino acid residues in the mature form of YKL-39 is slightly larger than for YKL-40 (364 versus 362 residues), the presence of carbohydrate in YKL-40 but not in YKL-39 is probably sufficient to account for the fact that YKL-40 appears to be slightly larger than YKL-39 based on its elution position from Sephacryl S-300 HR (Fig. 1) and on its apparent SDS-PAGE molecular weight (Fig. 3). Five cell cultures were tested for the production of YKL-39 by Northern blot. The 32P-labeled cDNA probe for YKL-39 hybridized with a single 1.5-kilobase band in the chondrocyte and synoviocyte RNA samples (Fig. 5a). This size is in good agreement with the 1434-base pair size of clone 118809. No YKL-39 mRNA could be detected in RNA from normal human fibroblasts, the HEP G2 human liver cell line, and the MG-63 human osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line. As expected (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar, 10Johansen J.S. Williamson M.K. Rice J.S. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 501-512Google Scholar), reprobe of this membrane demonstrated high levels of YKL-40 mRNA in chondrocytes and MG-63 cells, lower levels in synoviocytes, and undetectable levels in HEP G2 and fibroblasts (data not shown). The lack of YKL-39 mRNA expression by MG-63 cells is in agreement with the fact that the previously reported N-terminal protein sequencing of the 40-kDa protein band seen in SDS-PAGE of MG63 conditioned media identified the sequence of YKL-40 but failed to detect evidence of the sequence of YKL-39 (10Johansen J.S. Williamson M.K. Rice J.S. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 501-512Google Scholar). It is possible that culture under the serum-free conditions that are needed for protein isolation from conditioned medium could significantly alter the quantitative pattern of secreted protein expression. To evaluate the possible effect of serum-free conditions on YKL-39 expression, confluent primary chondrocytes were cultured for 1 week in serum-free medium or in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the level of YKL-39 was determined by Northern blot. The YKL-39 levels in the serum-free and serum-containing cultures proved to be identical (data not shown). We could also detect no effect of serum-free conditions on the level of YKL-40 mRNA or on the medium levels of YKL-40 antigen. Seven tissues from adult humans were examined for the presence of YKL-39 mRNA (Fig. 5b). YKL-39 mRNA is expressed strongly in lung and is detectable in heart. No YKL-39 mRNA could be detected in brain, spleen, pancreas, or liver. A reprobe of this membrane failed to detect YKL-40 mRNA in any of these tissues. Further evidence on the tissue distribution of YKL-39 mRNA expression is provided by the frequency with which YKL-39 cDNA clones have been identified by the Washington University-Merck EST Project. Two different clones have been obtained from a human lung cDNA library (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers T91693 and T66009), one clone has been obtained from each of two infant brain libraries (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers H10721 and H10989), and one has been obtained from a placenta library (GenBank™/EBI accession number N40107). This evidence suggests that YKL-39 may also be expressed in developing brain and in placenta. Pairwise comparison of YKL-39 with the four previously identified mammalian members of the protein family related in sequence to bacterial chitinases using the ALIGN program (Protein Identification Resource) shows that YKL-39 is most closely related to human YKL-40 (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar) followed by human chitotriosidase (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Google Scholar), human oviductal glycoprotein (6Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Google Scholar), and murine YM-1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number M94584). The regions of sequence identity encompass all of YKL-39, YKL-40, and YM-1 and the N-terminal domains of chitotriosidase and of oviductal glycoprotein. The C-terminal domain of chitotriosidase is related to the C-terminal domain of nematode and insect chitinases (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Google Scholar) and has no counterpart in YKL-40, YKL-39, or YM-1. The C-terminal domain of oviductal glycoprotein is thought to be a region of extensive protein glycosylation (6Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of YKL-39 is compared to the two proteins which are most closely related to it in sequence, YKL-40 and chitotriosidase, in Fig. 6. As can be seen, there is extensive sequence identity among all three human proteins, particularly in the regions that are thought to be involved in substrate binding in the bacterial chitinases (18Watanabe T. Oyanagi W. Suzuki K. Ohnishi K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 408-414Google Scholar, 19Myashita K. Fujii T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 1691-1698Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, shaded residues). It is of interest to note that the glutamate residue which is known from mutagenesis studies to be essential for the activity of bacterial chitinases (20Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Google Scholar) is found in chitotriosidase (Fig. 6, glutamate 139) but not in YKL-39, YKL-40, YM-1, or oviductal glycoprotein. This observation is consistent with the fact that chitotriosidase is a glycosidic bound hydrolyase, while no enzymatic activity has yet been reported for YKL-40, YM-1, or oviductal glycoprotein. Although we have not carried out extensive tests of the possible enzymatic activities of YKL-39, we did examine its possible chitinase activity (see “Materials and Methods”). YKL-39 was not active in any of the four assays tested (data not shown). The high degree of sequence identity between YKL-40 and YKL-39, which includes continuous stretches of identity up to 10 residues in length, suggests that antibodies against one protein could cross-react with the other. We therefore tested the possible cross-reactivity of YKL-39 on the radioimmunoassay that we developed for measurement of human YKL-40 in serum and tissues (9Johansen J.S. Jensen H.S. Price P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 949-955Google Scholar). No cross-reactivity was observed, which indicates that the dominant epitope recognized by the antiserum used for the YKL-40 assay does not recognize YKL-39. It should be noted, however, that this result does not rule out the presence of minor cross-reacting antibodies in this antiserum. Recent investigations have assigned bacterial chitinases and the related mammalian proteins to a gene family termed family 18 of the glycosylhydrolyses (1Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Google Scholar). Based on the crystallographic structure of one member of this family, it has been further suggested that all members of this gene family have the tertiary structure of an (αβ)8 barrel (also called a TIM barrel) (2Coulson A.F.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 41-44Google Scholar). TIM barrels are the most common architecture of enzymes and are found in 10% of the enzymes whose structures are presently known (21Farber G.K. Curr. Opin.

The substrate binding site in such enzymes is invariably formed by the loops which connect the β sheet and α helical segments that are located at the C-terminal end of the 8-stranded barrel. It seems probable that this region of the YKL-39 structure also has specific binding properties, forming either an active site or a specific glycan binding site. We speculate that the high level of sequence identity between chitinases and YKL-39 in the region of the sequence that corresponds to the putative chitinase active site (Fig. 6, shaded residues) is best explained by the need to conserve residues involved in glycan binding and that YKL-39 is likely to bind a given glycan structure with high specificity. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that YKL-40 binds a glycan, heparin, with an affinity greater than found for the well established heparin binding of fibronectin (11Shackelton L.M. Mann D.M. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13076-13083Google Scholar). Since YKL-39 clearly has no affinity for heparin in spite of its similarity in net charge and sequence to YKL-40, it seems likely that heparin binding is attributable to a specific binding site on YKL-40, one that is conserved in all species tested (cow, human, pig). We are currently investigating the glycan binding specificities of YKL-39. We think that the expression of YKL-39 at high levels in primary chondrocyte cultures suggests that the protein could function in tissue remodeling processes. Evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the identity of the other major proteins in chondrocyte-conditioned medium (Fig. 1). The most abundant protein in chondrocyte-conditioned medium, YKL-40, is thought to be involved in remodeling of breast tissue (7Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 329-334Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle (11Shackelton L.M. Mann D.M. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13076-13083Google Scholar), and cartilage (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar). YKL-40 is not in fact even expressed at detectable levels in normal cartilage or in cartilage explants until 2 days in culture (4Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Google Scholar) (data not shown). YKL-40 is, however, expressed at high levels in arthritic cartilage, an abnormal tissue characterized by high levels of tissue destruction and turnover. The next most abundant protein in chondrocyte-conditioned medium, prostromelysin, is an enzyme with broad substrate specificity which is involved with the digestion of a wide variety of extracellular matrix proteins in tissue remodeling processes. If YKL-39 is involved in the remodeling of cartilage, it is likely that YKL-39 is, like YKL-40, not expressed by normal cartilage but is induced in explant culture and expressed at high levels in arthritic cartilage."

These sites are highly selective, as demonstrated by the inability of other types of signaling molecules to displace [3H]anandamide. Furthermore, this binding site is coupled to nitric oxide release in the invertebrate tissues examined as well as in human monocytes. Interestingly, the cannabinoid-stimulated release of nitric oxide initiates cell rounding. Thus, these cannabinoid actions resemble those of opiate alkaloids. In this regard, we demonstrate that these signaling systems use the same effector system, i.e. nitric oxide release, but separate receptors.

Proteins encoded by seven XP genes, XPA through XPG, are required for the dual incision (excision) step of nucleotide excision repair. In addition to the proteins encoded by the XP genes, the ERCC1 protein, the replication protein RPA, and the multimeric transcription factor TFIIH (two of the subunits are XPB and XPD) are required for the dual incision (Mu et al., 21Mu D.

Furthermore, upon purification of XPC complementing activity, it was found that the 125-kDa protein encoded by XPC (Legerski and Peterson, 11Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar) was in a complex with a protein of 58 kDa which is highly homologous to the yeast excision repair protein encoded by the RAD23 gene (Watkins et al., 33Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Google Scholar; Masutani et al., 16Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). In humans there are two genes with sequence homology to RAD23, and these were named human homolog of RAD23 A and B (HHR23A and HHR23B), respectively; only the protein encoded by HHR23B is found in a complex with XPC protein (Masutani et al., 16Masutani C.

Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Google Scholar), there was no genetic or biochemical data from mammalian systems indicating that HHR23B is involved in excision repair. To clarify the role of HHR23B in repair, we expressed XPC and HHR23B, separately and in a complex using baculovirus/insect cells and plasmid/Escherichia coli expression systems, purified these proteins, and characterized them. We found that XPC and the XPC-HHR23B complex bind to DNA nonspecifically and with relatively high affinity and to UV-damaged DNA with slightly higher affinity. Both forms of XPC are capable of complementing cell-free extracts of XP-C mutants and are active in reconstituting excision nuclease activity in a completely defined system. We conclude that with naked DNA under our experimental conditions HHR23B does not play a direct role in excision repair.DISCUSSIONThe yeast RAD23 gene belongs to the RAD3 epistasis group, whose members participate in excision repair. Null mutations of genes in this group, such as RAD1, completely abolish excision repair (Prakash et al., 26Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of RAD23 increases the UV sensitivity of yeast cells only modestly (Perozzi and Prakash, 25Perozzi G. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1497-1507Google Scholar; Watkins et al., 33Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Google Scholar) indicating that, unlike RAD1 and other members of the RAD3 epistasis group, RAD23 is not essential for excision. Thus, extrapolating from yeast genetics, one would expect that the same would be true in humans. However, even though the yeast and human excision repair systems are highly homologous (Prakash et al., 26Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Google Scholar; Friedberg et al., 7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar; Sancar, 28Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Google Scholar), certain significant differences have been found. In particular, it was found that the 3′ nick of the dual incision could occur in the absence of XPF-ERCC1 in humans (Mu et al., 22Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Google Scholar) but requires the entire complement of excision repair proteins in yeast (Guzder et al., 10Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (b): 12973-12976Google Scholar). Thus, a priori, it was not possible to predict whether XPC without HHR23B would be sufficient to reconstitute the human excision nuclease. Indeed, it was reported that it was not possible to separate XPC from HHR23B without losing the XPC correcting activity (Masutani et al., 16Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). The results presented in this report indicate that the HHR23B polypeptide is not required for the excision repair function of the XPC protein and that HHR23B modulates XPC activity, perhaps by interacting with and masking the DNA binding domain of XPC. It is possible that the stringent conditions used to separate XPC from HHR23B in the previous study inactivated the XPC protein.In light of our results, it is reasonable to ask whether HHR23B plays any role in repair. To answer this question, in addition to the yeast rad23 phenotype, one must take the following findings into account. First, in humans, two RAD23 homologs were found which exhibit 57% sequence identity to one another and 30-34% sequence identity to RAD23. Second, of the two polypeptides, only HHR23B was found in a complex with XPC (Masutani et al., 16Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). Third, RAD23 (Watkins et al., 33Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Google Scholar) and HHR23 belong to the ubiquitin-fusion family of proteins in that the NH2-terminal 80 amino acids are highly homologous to ubiquitin (Masutani et al., 16Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). The precise role of ubiquitin in these proteins is not known but is thought to function as a chaperone in assisting proper folding and assembly and thermostability (Finley et al., 6Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Google Scholar; Garrett et al., 8Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 92: 7172-7176Google Scholar; Aso et al., 2Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Google Scholar). Fourth, the Rad23 protein is not essential for, but promotes complex formation between TFIIH and Rad14 (XPA homolog) proteins (Guzder et al., 9Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 8385-8388Google Scholar). In humans TFIIH seems to be directly bound to XPA without the aid of other proteins (Park et al., 24Park C.-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Google Scholar) although the possibility that HHR23B stimulates XPA-TFIIH interaction has not been ruled out. Fifth, the yeast homolog of XPC, the Rad4 protein, is required for global excision repair (Prakash et al., 26Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Google Scholar) but not for excision repair of the transcribed strand of rDNA genes which are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Verhage et al., 31Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24 (a): 1020-1025Google Scholar). In contrast, in humans the template strand of the polymerase II-transcribed sequences is repaired in XP-C mutants at an essentially normal rate (Mellon et al., 19Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Google Scholar; Kantor et al., 12Kantor G.J. Barsalou L.S. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 171-180Google Scholar; Venema et al., 29Venema J. van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 443-448Google Scholar, 30Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Google Scholar; Evans et al., 5Evans M.K. Robbins J.H. Ganges M.B. Tarone R.E. Nairn R.S. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4839-4847Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated in vitro that for certain lesions, even in the absence of transcription, excision repair occurs without XPC-HHR23B (Mu et al., 22Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Google Scholar). Thus, not only HHR23B but even XPC is dispensable for excision nuclease activity under certain conditions or with certain substrates.The following model is consistent with most of these observations. The HHR23B subunit of the heterodimer may be involved in nucleosome disassembly or reorganization which makes DNA accessible to the XPC subunit and other factors of the excision nuclease system. Alternatively, HHR23B may modulate the activity of XPC and perhaps function as a chaperone molecule. Indeed, preliminary experiments suggest that HHR23B protects the XPC subunit from thermal inactivation as tested by the DNA binding assay. 3J. T. Reardon and A. Sancar, unpublished results. The role of XPC may be to stabilize the local unwinding that is thought to occur in the preincision complex. Thus, with naked DNA (such as the 140-mer substrate), there is no need for HHR23B. Similarly, in transcribed DNA where local unwinding is provided by the RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion or with certain lesions which intrinsically cause local unwinding, XPC is not needed and hence excision occurs at a near-normal rate in the absence of the XPC-HHR23B heterodimer. This model is in agreement with the finding of Miller et al. (20Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 235-239Google Scholar) that yeast rad23 mutants removed pyrimidine dimers at about 60% of wild type levels. In contrast, McCready (18McCready S. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 261-273Google Scholar) and Verhage et al. (32Verhage R.A. Zeeman A.-M. Lombaerts M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362 (b): 155-165Google Scholar) using different methodologies did not find dimer removal from the genome overall or from transcriptionally active genes in rad23 mutants. Further studies are needed to establish the function of XPC, to determine whether there are bona fide differences between the roles of HHR23B in humans and RAD23 in yeast, and to reconcile these seemingly contradictory reports regarding the requirement of RAD23 for excision repair in yeast.

In humans there are two genes with sequence homology to RAD23, and these were named human homolog of RAD23 A and B (HHR23A and HHR23B), respectively; only the protein encoded by HHR23B is found in a complex with XPC protein (Masutani et al., 16Masutani C.

To clarify the role of HHR23B in repair, we expressed XPC and HHR23B, separately and in a complex using baculovirus/insect cells and plasmid/Escherichia coli expression systems, purified these proteins, and characterized them. We found that XPC and the XPC-HHR23B complex bind to DNA nonspecifically and with relatively high affinity and to UV-damaged DNA with slightly higher affinity. Both forms of XPC are capable of complementing cell-free extracts of XP-C mutants and are active in reconstituting excision nuclease activity in a completely defined system. We conclude that with naked DNA under our experimental conditions HHR23B does not play a direct role in excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W2077075729,"We have cloned and characterized a putative protein serine/threonine kinase termed prk through a combination of polymerase chain reaction and conventional cDNA library screening approaches. There are apparently two distinct domains within prk protein deduced from its nucleotide sequences. The amino-terminal portion has the feature of the catalytic domain of a serine/threonine kinase and shows strong homology to mouse fnk and other polo family kinases including mouse snk, human and murine plk, Drosophila polo, and yeast Cdc5. The carboxyl-terminal portion, presumably the regulatory domain, shares extensive homology to mouse fnk. Northern blotting analyses reveal that prk expression is restricted to a very limited number of tissues with placenta, ovaries, and lung containing detectable amounts of prk mRNA. prk mRNA expression is also detected at a low level in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami, MO7e, and three brain glioma cell lines. In addition, refeeding of serum-deprived MO7e, Dami, and K562 cells of hematopoietic origin and GMOO637D of lung fibroblasts rapidly activates prk mRNA expression with its peak induction around 2 h after serum addition. prk gene activation by the serum requires no new protein synthesis. The recombinant cytokines such as interleukin-3 and thrombopoietin also activate prk mRNA expression in MO7e cells. Furthermore, a survey of RNAs isolated from the tumor and the uninvolved tissues from 18 lung cancer patients reveals that prk mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues. Southern blotting analysis indicates that the prk gene is present in a single copy in the genome of tumors and normal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that prk expression may be restricted to proliferating cells and involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The molecular cloning of prk cDNA will facilitate the study of its biological role as well as its potential role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034918699,"We previously showed that mouse ST8Sia II (STX) exhibits polysialic acid (PSA) synthase activity in vivo as well as in vitro (Kojima, N., Yoshida, Y., and Tsuji, S. (1995) FEBS Lett. 373, 119-122, 1995). In this paper, we reported that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was specifically polysialylated by a single enzyme, ST8Sia II. PSA-expressing Neuro2a cells (N2a-STX) were established by stable transfection of the mouse ST8Sia II gene. Only the 140- and 180-kDa isoforms of NCAM in N2a-STX cells were specifically polysialylated in vivo, although other membrane proteins of N2a-STX were polysialylated in vitro. A recombinant soluble mouse ST8Sia II synthesized PSA on a recombinant soluble NCAM fused with the Fc region of human IgG1 (NCAM-Fc) as well as fetuin. However, NCAM-Fc served as a 1500-fold better acceptor for ST8Sia II than fetuin. Treatment of NCAM-Fc with Charonia lampas α-fucosidase, which is able to cleave α1,6-linked fucose, clearly reduced the polysialylation of NCAM-Fc by ST8Sia II. PSA was not synthesized on the N-glycanase-treated NCAM-Fc polypeptide or the free N-glycans of NCAM-Fc. When fetuin and its glycopeptide and N-glycans of fetuin were used as substrates for ST8Sia II, PSA was found to be synthesized on native fetuin and its glycopeptide but not on free N-glycans. These results strongly suggested that core α1,6-fucose on N-glycans as well as the antennary structures of N-glycans and the polypeptide regions are required for the polysialylation by ST8Sia II. Furthermore, oligo and single α2,8-sialylated glycoproteins were no longer polysialylated by mouse ST8Sia II. Therefore, the single enzyme, ST8Sia II, directly transferred all α2,8-sialic acid residues on the α2,3-linked sialic acids of N-glycans of specific NCAM isoforms to yield PSA-NCAM. Polysialylation did not require any initiator α2,8-sialyltransferase but did depend on the carbohydrate and protein structures of NCAM.

https://openalex.org/W1995339668,"Development of atherosclerosis is believed to involve proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that the growth of bovine aortic SMC was stimulated by mildly oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and that the mitogenic effect of oxLDL was greater than that induced by native LDL (Augé, N., Pieraggi, M. T., Thiers, J. C., Nègre-Salvayre, A., and Salvayre R. (1995) Biochem. J. 309, 1015-1020). Since the lipid mediator ceramide has been described to be proliferative, the present work aimed at studying the potential involvement of the so-called sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway in the signal transduction cascade induced by oxLDL. Incubation of SMC with UV-oxidized LDL induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis (32%), which peaked at 60 min and was accompanied by a concomitant increase of intracellular ceramide level. The effect of oxidized LDL on sphingomyelin turnover exhibited the same LDL dose dependence as their mitogenic effect. Exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation and also stimulated cell growth, in contrast to exogenous phospholipases A2, C, or D. This mitogenic effect was reproduced by incubating the cells with the cell-permeant ceramides, N-acetyl- and N-hexanoylsphingosines.

During atherogenesis, focal lesions spread out progressively and lead to the formation of fibroatheroma plaques in which accumulation of macrophagic foam cells and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) play a crucial role (24Ross R. Glomset J.A. Science. 1973; 180: 1332-1338Google Scholar, 25Stary H.C. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11 (Suppl. E): 3-19Google Scholar). Oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) are present in atherosclerotic areas (26Haberland M.E. Fong D. Cheng L. Science. 1988; 241: 215-217Google Scholar, 27Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Google Scholar). LDL oxidation is a progressive process leading at first to the formation of mildly oxidized LDL (oxLDL), which are defined by a low content of lipid peroxidation derivatives and slight apolipoprotein B modifications, and later to extensively oxidized LDL which contain high levels of lipid peroxidation products and severe apolipoprotein B alterations (29Esterbauer E. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar).In atherosclerotic areas, SMC proliferation may be mediated through a complex network of growth factors (30Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that UV-treated LDL, that is mildly oxidized LDL, are mitogenic to cultured bovine aortic SMC (31Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Google Scholar), an effect also observed with copper-oxidized LDL (32Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Google Scholar). We report here that the mitogenic effect of oxLDL is transduced through the SPM-ceramide pathway in cultured SMC as shown by the induction of SPM hydrolysis and as mimicked by exogenous sphingomyelinase or short-chain synthetic C2- and C6-ceramides.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExposure of LDL to cultured endothelial cells or to UV-C irradiation results in mild lipoprotein oxidation (29Esterbauer E. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar, 34Nègre-Salvayre A. Paillous N. Dousset N. Bascoul J. Salvayre R. Photochem.

Pieraggi M.T. Dousset N. Douste-Blazy L. Salvayre R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 224-232Google Scholar). In contrast to extensively oxidized LDL, mildly oxidized LDL used here are taken up by cultured cells (42Nègre-Salvayre A. Lopez M. Levade T. Pieraggi M.T. Dousset N. Douste-Blazy L. Salvayre R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 224-232Google Scholar), including SMC (data not shown), through the apoB/E receptor pathway. As illustrated in Fig. 1, both endothelial cell- and UV-oxidized LDL (50 and 100 µg of apoB/ml) were mitogenic to vascular SMC. Incubation of SMC with higher concentrations (200 µg of apoB/ml) of oxLDL did not increase DNA synthesis but were rather cytostatic, in agreement with previous observations (31Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Google Scholar). Native LDL exhibited a lower mitogenic effect than that of oxLDL, and their effect was prevented by the addition of BHT (10 µmol/liter). However, the mitogenic effect of UV-oxidized LDL was not inhibited by the same dose of BHT (see Fig. 1B, inset). This result suggests that (i) BHT is not antiproliferative per se, (ii) BHT blocks the mitogenic effect of native LDL by inhibiting their oxidation in the culture medium (data not shown), and (iii) the major part of the mitogenic effect of LDL is subsequent to their oxidation. In the next experiments, UV-oxidized LDL were employed because the culture medium containing cell-oxidized LDL may contain growth factors secreted by endothelial cells which would interfere with the mitogenic effect of oxidized LDL.In order to investigate whether oxLDL activate the SPM-ceramide signaling pathway, SMC phospholipids were metabolically labeled to equilibrium either with [methyl-3H]choline or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, effective mitogenic doses of UV-oxidized LDL (100 µg of apoB/ml) induced a time-dependent degradation of SPM. Maximal hydrolysis of [3H]choline-labeled SPM (32 ± 9%) was observed within 50-70 min after addition of oxLDL. Then, SPM levels returned progressively toward baseline (Fig. 2A). Similar results of SPM hydrolysis were obtained when using cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 2B). Activation of SPM hydrolysis was accompanied by a concomitant increase of cellular ceramide levels (Fig. 2B), supporting the conclusion that oxLDL stimulate a sphingomyelinase activity. Both SPM and ceramide levels recovered to baseline within 2 h, similarly to responses seen with various activators of the SPM cycle, such as vitamin D3 (9Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Google Scholar), TNFα (10Kim M.Y. Linardic C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Google Scholar, 43Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. J. Biol.

A, SMC were incubated for 48 h in RPMI medium containing 1% FCS and [methyl-3H]choline (0.5 µCi/ml). Then, medium was replaced by fresh medium and cells further incubated in the presence (+oxLDL) or absence (−oxLDL) of 100 µg of apoB/ml of UV-oxidized LDL. At the indicated time, incubation was stopped and SPM levels (dpm/mg of cell protein) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, cells metabolically labeled for 48 h with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1 µCi/ml) were treated as above. At the indicated time, lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and localized using a Berthold radiochromatoscan. Sphingomyelin (Spm) and ceramide (Cer) spots were scraped off and counted by liquid scintillation. Radioactivities (dpm/mg of cell protein) are expressed as percent of those measured at time 0 in the absence of LDL. C and D, SMC were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline (0.5 µCi/ml) as in A. Then, medium was replaced by fresh medium and cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of UV-oxidized (C) or native (D) LDL and in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 10 µM BHT. SPM levels (dpm/mg of cell protein) were determined and are expressed as percent of the values at time 0 in the absence of LDL. All data are means ± S.E. of at least 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine further the connection between oxLDL-induced cell proliferation and activation of the SPM pathway, the dose dependence of the effects of oxLDL on SPM degradation was investigated. While 100 µg of apoB/ml of oxLDL consistently promoted ~30% SPM hydrolysis, a concentration of 50 µg/ml caused only a 15% reduction (which was also shorter in duration), and, quite unexpectedly, no significant SPM degradation was detected after incubation (for 15 to 120 min) with 200 µg/ml oxLDL (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, as observed with thymidine incorporation assays (see Fig. 1B, inset), addition of BHT did not significantly inhibit the oxLDL-induced activation of SPM breakdown (Fig. 2C). Thus, the effects of oxLDL on SPM turnover closely paralleled their effects on mitogenesis (see Fig. 1, A and B).Since native LDL were also found to stimulate SMC growth (Fig. 1 and Ref. 31Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Google Scholar), the effects on increasing concentrations of native LDL on SPM turnover were examined. Interestingly, only elevated concentrations of native LDL promoted SPM hydrolysis (Fig. 2D). It is noteworthy that the extent of SPM degradation induced by 100 µg of apoB/ml of native LDL approximated that induced by 50 µg of apoB/ml of oxLDL, thereby correlating with the effects on cell growth (see Fig. 1, A and B). Finally, the effects of native LDL on SPM degradation were severely inhibited by BHT, again in accordance with the inhibition by BHT of the mitogenic effect of native LDL. Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that native LDL may stimulate SPM hydrolysis and subsequent cell proliferation because they get oxidized when added to the cell culture medium.As the SPM-ceramide pathway has been reported to be involved in cell growth regulation (5Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 223-236Google Scholar, 8Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar, 44Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar), the above data suggested that SPM hydrolysis might be involved in the intracellular signaling triggered by oxLDL in vascular SMC. To further define the potential role of SPM degradation and subsequent ceramide generation, we investigated the ability of membrane SPM hydrolysis and of cell-permeant ceramide analogs to mimic the mitogenic effect of oxLDL. Treatment of SMC by bacterial sphingomyelinase, under nontoxic conditions, induced an intense incorporation of [3H]thymidine (205 ± 20% of the control after a 48-h incubation; Fig. 3A), that was associated with an extensive hydrolysis of radiolabeled SPM (72 ± 9% degradation of cellular radiolabeled SPM within 15 min) and a concomitant production of ceramide (Fig. 3B). In contrast, under nontoxic conditions, addition of exogenous phospholipases A2, C, and D led to the hydrolysis of 35-40% of cellular radiolabeled phospholipids, in particular phosphatidylcholine, but induced no significant [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3, C and D). This strongly suggests that, under the used conditions, hydrolysis of the SPM present in the plasma membrane triggers a mitogenic signal in vascular SMC, whereas, under similar conditions, phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by various phospholipases is unable to produce any mitogenic effect.Fig. 3Mitogenic effect of exogenous sphingomyelinase on cultured SMC and comparison with phospholipases A2, C, and D. A, SMC, grown for 48 h in medium containing 1% FCS, were treated for 10 min with B. cereus sphingomyelinase (100 milliunits/ml). Then, the medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium. At the indicated times, [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is expressed as percent of the values obtained at the same time in untreated cells. Inset, cytotoxicity evaluated by LDH activity release into the culture medium (expressed as IU/liter). B, cells were labeled for 48 h with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1 µCi/ml). At time 0, B. cereus sphingomyelinase (100 milliunits/ml) was added. After 10 min of incubation, the medium was removed and cells were incubated further in fresh medium. Lipids were extracted and the cellular levels of sphingomyelin (Spm) and ceramide (Cer) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, cells grown for 48 h in medium containing 1% FCS were treated for 1 h with B. cereus sphingomyelinase (SMase; 100 milliunits/ml), B. cereus phospholipase C (PL C; 10 milliunits/ml), cabbage phospholipase D (PL D; 10 milliunits/ml), or Naja naja phospholipase A2 (PL A2). Then, [3H]thymidine incorporation was evaluated as in A. D, SMC prelabeled for 48 h with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1 µCi/ml) were treated exactly as in C. The cellular phosphatidylcholine levels (dpm/mg of protein) were determined and are expressed as percent of the level in untreated cells (25 106 dpm/mg of protein). The data in each figure correspond to means ± S.E. of 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Among the various metabolites derived from SPM hydrolysis, ceramide has been shown to be mitogenic per se in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (45Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Google Scholar, 46Hauser J.M. Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6803-6809Google Scholar). This led us to test whether addition of cell-permeable, short-chain ceramide analogs, such as C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) and C6-ceramide (N-hexanoylsphingosine) were mitogenic to the vascular SMC used here. Fig. 4 shows that treatment of SMC with 1 µM C2-ceramide or 5 µM C6-ceramide (i.e. under nontoxic conditions), resulted in a significant [3H]thymidine incorporation, thereby mimicking the effect of endogenously produced ceramide.Fig. 4Mitogenic effect of synthetic short-chain ceramides, N-acetylsphingosine (A) or N-hexanoylsphingosine (B). Cell-permeant ceramides (squares, 1 µM; circles, 5 µM; triangles, 10 µM) were introduced into the culture medium at time 0, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined at the indicated times, exactly under the conditions described in Fig. 1. Inset, cytotoxicity evaluated by LDH activity (IU/liter) released into the culture medium (means ± S.E. of 3 separate experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that mildly oxidized LDL activate the SPM-ceramide pathway in SMC with the same dose dependence as their effect on cell growth. In addition, the mitogenic effect of oxLDL can be recapitulated by production or addition of ceramides. Such a proliferative effect has previously been documented on Swiss 3T3 cells directly treated with synthetic ceramides or exogenous sphingomyelinase (45Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Google Scholar, 46Hauser J.M. Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6803-6809Google Scholar). On the same cells, ceramide has also been shown to potentiate the proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (47Sasaki T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 829-834Google Scholar). While in those studies the effect of exogenously added ceramides or of ceramides produced by bacterial sphingomyelinase was investigated, the question still remained whether the mitogenic response could be elicited by the natural ceramide generated in situ through the action of an extracellular agent. The present study strongly supports this idea, corroborating previous reports which indicated that triggering of the SPM-ceramide pathway is involved in cell proliferation. For instance, the SPM-ceramide pathway has been shown to be activated in the TNFα or interleukin-1β-induced proliferation of human skin fibroblasts (40Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Google Scholar), as well as in the T cell proliferation triggered by anti-CD28 (19Chan G.C. Ochi A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1999-2004Google Scholar).To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on the initiation of the SPM-ceramide turnover in SMC and on the overlap of SPM and oxLDL signaling pathways. Since ceramide can induce the phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (47Sasaki T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 829-834Google Scholar, 48Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Google Scholar), which are classically associated with cell proliferation signaling, it is tempting to speculate that the mitogenic effect of oxLDL is mediated by the stimulation of ceramide-activated MAPK. Indeed, preliminary results from our laboratory show that oxLDL stimulate MAPK. 2N. Augé, A. Nègre-Salvayre, and R. Salvayre, manuscript in preparation. The proliferative effect of ceramide might also be due to another metabolite of SPM hydrolysis (5Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 223-236Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that exogenous ceramides most probably exert their effect without any metabolic conversion (13Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Google Scholar, 45Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Google Scholar), suggesting that ceramide actually represents the effective mediator.Oxidized LDL exhibit a variety of biological properties, being able to modulate gene expression of growth factors, adhesion molecules, and tissue factor, altering the motility of monocytes/macrophages and the vasomotor properties of arteries, being cytotoxic (reviewed in Ref. 28Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Google Scholar) and mitogenic to vascular SMC (31Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Google Scholar, 32Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in the cellular effects triggered by oxidized LDL are only poorly known, and no coherent picture has emerged to account for all of the data. Although the participation of other signaling pathways cannot be excluded (49Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Hart C.M. Parthasarathy S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2005-2016Google Scholar), our data provide strong evidence for the involvement of the SPM-ceramide signal transduction pathway in the mitogenic effect of mildly oxidized LDL on vascular SMC. INTRODUCTIONRecently, sphingolipids have emerged as key signaling molecules involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev.

In particular, the so-called sphingomyelin (ceramide phosphocholine; SPM) 1The abbreviations used are: SPMsphingomyelinSMCsmooth muscle cellsLDLlow density lipoproteinsoxLDLmildly oxidized LDLFCSfetal calf serumBHTbutylhydroxytolueneTBARSthiobarbituric acid-reactive substancesPBSphosphate-buffered salineLDHlactate dehydrogenaseTNFαtumor necrosis factor αBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. cycle appears as a prototypic sphingolipid signaling pathway implicated in the positive or negative regulation of cell growth (6Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway leads to SPM hydrolysis and subsequent generation of ceramide, the backbone of all sphingolipids, which serves as an intracellular second messenger (7Kolesnick R.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-236Google Scholar, 8Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar).

We found previously that Ser-228 is essential for enzyme activity and is likely to function as a nucleophile in the catalytic center of the enzyme (Sharp, J. D., White, D. L., Chiou, X.

Chem. 266, 14850-14853). cPLA2 contains a catalytic aspartic acid motif common to the subtilisin family of serine proteases. Substitution within this motif of Ala for Asp-549 completely inactivated the enzyme, and substitutions with either glutamic acid or asparagine reduced activity 2000- and 300-fold, respectively. Additionally, using mutants with cysteine replaced by alanine, we found that Cys-331 is responsible for the enzyme's sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. Surprisingly, substituting alanine for any of the 19 histidines did not produce inactive enzyme, demonstrating that a classical serine-histidine-aspartate mechanism does not operate in this hydrolase. We found that substituting alanine or histidine for Arg-200 did produce inactive enzyme, while substituting lysine reduced activity 200-fold. Results obtained with the lysine mutant (R200K) and a coumarin ester substrate suggest no specific interaction between Arg-200 and the phosphoryl group of the phospholipid substrate. Arg-200, Ser-228, and Asp-549 are conserved in cPLA2 from six species and also in four nonmammalian phospholipase B enzymes. Our results, supported by circular dichroism, provide evidence that Asp-549 and Arg-200 are critical to the enzyme's function and suggest that the cPLA2 catalytic center is novel.

J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Google Scholar). While these two classes of PLA2 catalyze the same reaction on the same substrates, admittedly with different preferences (1Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Google Scholar), their mechanism of action appears to be different. While a tightly bound calcium ion is essential for catalysis in 14-kDa PLA2 (9Scott D.L. White S.P. Zbyszed O. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Google Scholar), calcium is necessary for cPLA2 only for enhanced binding to its aggregated phospholipid substrates (4Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M.

Much evidence supports the currently accepted model that the secreted PLA2 enzymes have a catalytic center that lacks a serine residue and in which a tightly bound water molecule serves as the nucleophile (9Scott D.L.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 743-750Google Scholar). In contrast, in cPLA2, a serine residue (Ser-228) is essential and is likely to play this role (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V.

Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Google Scholar), the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate (arachidonoylserine 228), for which additional indirect evidence was recently obtained by examination of the comparative rates of secondary transfer of the arachidonoyl group to glycerol or to water (15Hanel A.M.

We report here that, in addition to Ser-228, Asp-549 and Arg-200 are also essential for catalysis and that Cys-331, while not essential, is responsible for the sensitivity of cPLA2 to NEM. The role of Arg-200 is discussed. Furthermore, we show that none of the 19 histidines in human cPLA2 is essential. Therefore, histidine cannot play the central role that it plays in more conventional catalytic centers, and it is likely that cPLA2 acts through a novel catalytic mechanism for acylhydrolases. Two systems were used to produce both wild-type and mutant cPLA2 enzymes for analysis. For more rapid preliminary analysis, we produced cPLA2 in COS-1 cells using the plasmid pCDCPT. For production of larger amounts of cPLA2, we used baculovirus in insect cells with plasmid pVLCP (21Becker G.W. Miller J.R. Kovacevic S. Ellis R.M. Louis A.I. Small J.S. Stark D.H. Roberts E.F.

The EcoRI-SpeI fragment of pALTERCPT was used to replace the EcoRI-SpeI fragment of pCDCPFS, creating pCDCPT. pCDCPFS was constructed by inserting the entire coding sequence contained within the KpnI-SpeI fragment of pHDCPFS (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol.

For some of the histidine mutants (H259A, H333A, H385A, H426A, H488A, H544A, and H637A), we used a mutagenic primer containing the histidine mutation and a synthetic primer containing one of the two NcoI sites in cPLA2 cDNA to amplify a mutagenic “megaprimer” (23Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). This megaprimer was then used with a synthetic primer containing the other NcoI site to amplify the mutant 1.53-kilobase NcoI fragment. This NcoI fragment was ligated into the baculoviral transfer vector pVLCP (21Becker G.W. Miller J.R. Kovacevic S. Ellis R.M. Louis A.I. Small J.S. Stark D.H. Roberts E.F. Wyrick T.K. Hoskins J. Chiou X.G. Sharp J.D. McClure D.B. Riggin R.M. Kramer R.M. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 69-74Google Scholar). For the other mutants, we used the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega) (24Hutchison III, C.A. Phillips S. Edgell M.H. Gillam S. Jahnke P. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6551-6560Google Scholar). The mutagenized coding sequence was used to replace the wild-type coding sequence of either the baculoviral transfer vector pVLCP or the mammalian expression vector pCDCPT. For each point mutation, a “silent” restriction site was introduced near the mutagenic site for identification of the mutant plasmid. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the histidine mutants expressed in the baculovirus system, a region of the recombinant viral DNA was amplified and sequenced to confirm that the correct mutation was present after recombination with the viral genome. For those mutations that produced inactive enzyme, it was necessary to prove rigorously that no unintended mutation might be responsible for the loss of activity. For all six mutations at Arg-200 and Asp-549, revertants were prepared, and it was demonstrated that these revertants regained full activity. This was considered preferable to sequence analysis since the reversion demonstrates a dramatic recovery of several orders of magnitude of enzyme activity. Any additional mutation that may be present and escape detection when sequencing the 2.2-kilobase cPLA2 coding region is thereby ruled out as causing the loss of activity. PLA2 activity was assayed using as substrate 3 µM sonicated mixed phosphatidylcholine/dioleoylglycerol vesicles at a molar ratio of 2:1 as described (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V.

Immunoblotting analysis was performed on all mutant forms to confirm electrophoretic mobility equivalent to wild-type cPLA2 and to estimate qualitative yield. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting with M3-1/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-cPLA2 monoclonal antibody and the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Google Scholar). Enzyme assay data were normalized to protein content with ELISA for crude lysates or with the Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce) for purified enzyme. ELISA was performed as described (12Sharp J.D.

The specific activity values were adjusted by subtraction of background values obtained from insect cells that had not been infected with baculovirus. As more data were collected, it became apparent that some of the values for inactive mutants were slightly below those of uninfected cells, yielding negative values for the most inactive mutants, as reported in Table I. This is probably due to a slight suppression we observed of the small insect cell background activity, caused by growth of baculovirus. This suppression was detected after much of our data were collected by using baculovirus carrying no cPLA2 gene. All reported specific activity values were derived from at least three independently prepared transfected COS-1 or infected Sf9 insect cell cultures.Table ISpecific activities of wild-type cPLA2 and cPLA2 mutated at Asp-549 and Arg-200, produced in baculovirus-infected insect cellsMutationcPLA2-specific activitynmol/min/mgcPLA22700 ± 500D549A−0.36 ± 0.06D549N0.75 ± 0.05D549E0.14 ± 0.04D549N (purified)8.5D549E (purified)1.3R200A−0.16 ± 0.05R200H−0.27 ± 0.04R200K6.4 ± 0.3R200K (purified)14 Open table in a new tab Enzyme activity was measured as described (12Sharp J.D.

The dilution after treatment was 200-fold into the same buffer without modifying reagents, resulting in assay of 0.25 ng of enzyme. For measurement of circular dichroic spectra, fluorescent assay, and precise determination of enzyme-specific activities, cPLA2 was purified as described (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Google Scholar, 25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.

The concentration of wild-type and mutant cPLA2 enzymes was in the range of 0.1-0.25 mg/ml in solutions containing 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, and 20 µM dithiothreitol adjusted to pH 7.5. Spectra were recorded at 25 ± 1°C using cylindrical quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 0.05 and 0.1 cm. For each sample, three separate spectra were collected and averaged using a step interval of 0.5 nm and an average time of 5 s. The protein spectra were corrected by subtracting a blank solution containing 50 mM phosphate and 100 mM NaCl adjusted to pH 7.5. The final results are reported as mean residue ellipticity in units of degrees·cm2·dmol−1 calculated using a mean residue weight of 113.9. To a solution of arachidonic acid (943 mg, 3.10 mmol) in methylene chloride (22 ml) was added 7-hydroxycoumarin (557 mg, 3.44 mmol), benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (1.618 g, 3.11 mmol), and diisopropylethylamine (1.1 ml, 6.31 mmol) in that order. The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was diluted with methylene chloride (30 ml) and washed with saturated aqueous potassium dihydrogen phosphate (3 × 10 ml). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give an oil. The crude material was purified by flash column chromatography, eluting with 1) 5% EtOAc/hexanes and 2) 10% EtOAc/hexanes, to give 7-hydroxycoumarinyl arachidonate as a colorless oil (948 mg, 2.11 mmol) in 68% yield. The 1H NMR data for this compound are identical to those reported in Ref. 5Huang Z. Laliberte F. Tremblay N.M. Weech P.K. Street I.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 110-115Google Scholar (mass spectrometry, m/z 448). 7-HCA was prepared in the form of sonicated mixed vesicles with OSPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described (5Huang Z. Laliberte F. Tremblay N.M. Weech P.K. Street I.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 110-115Google Scholar). The fluorescence enzyme assay was initiated by addition of cPLA2 or its R200K mutant into the stirring liposome suspension in a 3-ml plastic cuvette (Evergreen, Pico Rivera, CA). Fluorescence of the hydrolysis product, 7-hydroxycoumarin, was followed in an SLM 48000 spectrophotofluorometer (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL) with excitation at 360 nm and emission 460 nm. Data were collected and stored for 200 s at 1-s intervals. A motif was found within the cPLA2 sequence (Fig. 1A) that includes Asp-549 and perfectly matches the specifications for the catalytic aspartic acid residue in the subtilisin family of proteolytic enzymes (26Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 19-37Google Scholar). The motif was also aligned with imperfect but good matches in phospholipase B from Penicillium and yeast (Fig. 1A). When Asp-549 was mutated to alanine, all activity was lost; however, low but measurable activity remained when Asp-549 was substituted with either glutamic acid or asparagine (Table I). To confirm that no additional unintended mutation might have caused the drastic loss of activity, each of these three mutations was reverted to wild-type cPLA2, and full activity was regained. The three Asp-549 mutant proteins were made in normal amounts and were readily detected both by immunoblotting analysis and ELISA. The ELISA data were used to calculate the specific activities of the lysates. The specific activities of D549N and D549E increased ~10-fold on purification (Table I). We do not know the reason for this significant difference; however, a substantial portion of each of these two mutant proteins was lost during purification. It is possible that this portion was incorrectly folded and thus enzymatically inactive, but still was measured in the ELISA, lowering the apparent specific activity before purification. The dramatic reduction in activity observed upon mutating Asp-549 was extraordinary within cPLA2, as previous to identifying the subtilisin motif, we had mutated 17 other aspartic and glutamic acid residues (E214A, D242A, E249A, E277A, D337A, D366A, multiple mutant D433A/D436A/D438A/D439A, D519A, D522A, D529A, E530A, D569A, D633A, and E658A) with no significant reduction in activity. We attempted to identify an essential histidine residue. Eleven of the 19 histidine residues of human cPLA2 are conserved in mouse, rat, chicken, and zebra fish, and these were thus considered candidates. When each of these histidines was changed in separate mutants to alanine, significant activity always remained, suggesting that there is no essential histidine or that catalysis involves a histidine that is not conserved among species. Further mutagenesis of the remaining eight histidines proved that there is no histidine that is essential to catalysis in human cPLA2 (Fig. 2). Altogether, 17 mutant forms were prepared and analyzed, one with three His-to-Ala substitutions (H9A, H14A, and H18A) and the rest with one each. All of these mutants showed >10% of wild-type activity, with some higher than wild-type activity. Adjacent to His-694 is Asp-695, reminiscent of His-Asp found in the catalytic center of the secreted PLA2 enzymes. For this reason, we made H694A (designated 16 in Fig. 2) as a double mutant also containing the mutation D695A. This double mutant showed full wild-type activity. cPLA2 is inactivated by NEM and other thiol reagents, suggesting that a cysteine may play a role in catalysis. For the nine cysteine residues of cPLA2, five mutants were made (up to three Cys residues mutated in each one), and all were active. In crude lysates, all but one, the double mutant C324A/C331A, were still sensitive to NEM (data not shown). We prepared the two separate mutants C324A and C331A, purified all seven mutants, and tested their sensitivity to NEM and to DTNB (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows several interesting observations. (i) Only the two mutants with Cys-331 altered showed any appreciable resistance to NEM; (ii) several of the mutants had higher initial specific activity when compared with wild-type cPLA2, the highest being those with Cys-324 and Cys-331 altered; and (iii) while the DTNB treatment appreciably inactivated all the mutants, those with Cys-331 altered were significantly more resistant than the others. These results are consistent with Cys-331 having no critical catalytic role, but being situated near the catalytic center, so that when modified, it may interfere with catalysis. The alignment of the linear sequence of cPLA2 with that of phospholipase B was a major aid in determining that Ser-228 (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Google Scholar) and Asp-549 (see above) were likely candidates for catalytic elements. Thus, we mutated seven additional non-aliphatic amino acids that aligned with phospholipase B (T222A, Y223A, Y238A, multiple mutant K281A/K282A/K283A, and N555A), but we found that they did not lose significant activity (data not shown). However, one that showed a striking change was Arg-200 (see Table I). When Arg-200 was substituted with alanine or histidine, there was no detectable activity, indicating that the mutants are inactivated by at least 1000-fold. Lysine was able to substitute weakly for Arg-200, with the R200K mutant having ~0.5% of wild-type activity. All three mutants (R200A, R200H, and R200K) were reverted to Arg-200 and found to regain total activity. One possible way that arginine may contribute to catalysis is by complexing with the phosphoryl group of the phospholipid substrate, as observed in other enzymes (27Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Google Scholar, 28Barford D. Hu S.-H. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 233-260Google Scholar, 29Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Strang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Google Scholar). To test this concept, we employed a substrate devoid of phosphoryl groups, the arachidonic acid ester of 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HCA). 7-HCA was incorporated and hydrolyzed in a mixed vesicle with the relatively inert (to cPLA2) lipid OSPC as demonstrated by Huang et al. (5Huang Z. Laliberte F. Tremblay N.M. Weech P.K. Street I.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 110-115Google Scholar). If the function of Arg-200 were to associate with the phosphoryl groups of the substrate, one would expect that, relative to wild-type cPLA2, the R200K mutant would lose considerably less activity with 7-HCA than the 200-fold observed with the phosphatidylcholine substrate. Instead, we found that R200K had still only ~0.5% of wild-type activity in this 7-HCA assay (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that Arg-200 does not simply associate with the phosphoryl group of the phospholipid molecule being hydrolyzed. The three mutants D549N, D549E, and R200K, which had measurable catalytic activity, were purified and subjected to circular dichroism analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the spectra appeared identical to that of wild-type cPLA2, demonstrating that the significant (200-2000-fold) losses of enzyme activity are not the result of a global defect in folding of these mutants. The fact that Asp-549 and Arg-200 are among clusters of conserved residues in the alignment of cPLA2 with several distantly related phospholipase B enzymes (Fig. 1, A and B) is consistent with their importance in the function of both enzymes. These two amino acids (as well as Ser-228) (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Google Scholar) are also conserved within the known cPLA2 enzymes, lying, in fact, within regions of near total conservation among the six cPLA2 sequences known (Fig. 6). Our earlier work (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Google Scholar) suggested that the importance of Ser-228 for cPLA2 may lie in its nucleophilic attack on the substrate, as it does in many other enzymes. More directed chemical analysis has recently been reported (13Huang Z. Payette P. Abdullah K. Cromlish W.A. Kennedy B.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3712-3721Google Scholar) that makes this conclusion more likely. Our data suggest that the catalytic center of cPLA2 is unusual. While Ser-228 (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T.

In light of the histidine-containing catalytic centers of the 14-kDa PLA2 enzymes and of lipases for which there are three-dimensional structural data (16Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W.

Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Google Scholar), we took thorough precautions to ensure that no error had been made on the point that every His-to-Ala mutation retained significant catalytic activity and was mutated as intended. Whereas the altered sequences of all mutated DNA sequences were directly verified in their DNA vectors before recombination into the baculovirus vector, the histidine mutations that were produced in baculovirus were each verified as well in the baculovirus recombinants by analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified segments from the viral stocks. Data on histidine-containing catalytic triads suggest that the functional histidine is sufficiently critical for catalysis that normally no detectable activity remains when the histidine is mutated (14Tjoelker L.W.

INTRODUCTIONIn most mammalian species (including mouse, rat, and human), cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) 1The abbreviations used are: COCcumulus-oocyte complexFBSfetal bovine serumECMextracellular matrixELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaysHAhyaluronic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyIαIinter-α-inhibitorMEMminimum essential mediumPαIpre-α-inhibitorHCheavy chainhCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. of pre-ovulatory follicles undergo a dramatic change following an ovulatory stimulus. The tightly packed cumulus cells first disaggregate and then synthesize and secrete large amounts of hyaluronic acid (HA) into their extracellular matrices (ECMs). The ECM, cumulus cells, and oocyte are thus integrally bound within an expanded mucoid complex which is about 20 to 40 times larger (volume) dependent upon the species (1Chen L. Wert S.E. Hendrix E.M. Russell P.T. Cannon M. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1990; 26: 236-247Google Scholar). This process of cumulus expansion is required for ovulation and may also facilitate the process of fertilization (2Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 87-93Google Scholar, 3Blandau P.J. Hafez E.S.E. Blandau R.J. The Mammalian Oviduct. University of Chicago Press, Chicago1969: 129Google Scholar, 4Bjersing L. Cajander S. Cell Tissue Res. 1974; 149: 287-300Google Scholar).We have previously identified a serum factor (proteins of the inter-α-inhibitor family), critical in organizing and stabilizing the expanding cumulus matrix (5Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Google Scholar). This protein factor appears to be excluded from follicular fluid until the ovulatory gonadotropin surge and then quickly diffuses into the follicular fluid where it becomes integrated within the cumulus ECM (5Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Google Scholar, 6Powers R.W. Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E290-E298Google Scholar). Two major forms of this factor, pre-α-inhibitor (PαI) and inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), exist in mammalian species including mouse, bovine, and human (7Salier J.P. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Sesboue R.

Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 13-22Google Scholar). They each include a common light chain (about 40 kDa) which has two domains of the Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor and so this protein is termed bikunin. PαI is composed of bikunin and a single heavy chain connected by chondroitin sulfate (9Jessen T.E. Faarvang K.L. Ploug M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 195-200Google Scholar, 10Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

IαI consists of bikunin and two heavy chains also joined by chondroitin sulfate. According to a model proposed by Enghild et al. (10Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Th Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Google Scholar, 11Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Th Valnickova Z. Pizzo S.V. Hefta S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Google Scholar), a single chondroitin sulfate chain extends from a glycosylation site at Ser-10 of the bikunin subunit to link with the C-terminal Asp residue of each heavy chain via an ester bond to form a novel carbohydrate linkage. The three different heavy chains are highly homologous and, in fact, the specific heavy chain combinations identified in different species may differ from one another. For example, PαI of human and mouse is composed of heavy chain 3 (HC3) and the light chain, while bovine PαI consists of heavy 2 (HC2) and the light chain (13Castillo G.M. Templeton D.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 292-296Google Scholar).Both PαI and IαI are almost identical in their ability to stabilize the expanding cumulus ECM in vitro (14Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L. Powers R. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Google Scholar) where a direct interaction between proteins of the IαI family and HA seems to play a critical role in preventing the release of HA into the culture medium. As demonstrated in an earlier in vitro study, this initial interaction appears to be a non-covalent charge- mediated interaction (14Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L. Powers R. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Google Scholar). Although COCs which expand in vitro are morphologically indistinguishable from those expanding in vivo, ovulated COCs appear to be more elastic and more resistant to mechanical shear force. It has been reported that proteins of the IαI family could form covalent interactions with HA in various systems including follicular fluid (15Hutadiolok N. Ghosh P. Brooks P.M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1988; 47: 377-385Google Scholar, 16Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Google Scholar, 17Jessen T.E. Odum L. Johnsen A.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 521-526Google Scholar, 18Malki N. Balduyck M. Maes P. Capon C. Mizon C. Han K.K. Tartar A. Fournet B. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1009-1018Google Scholar), however, the degree of native protein that forms covalent linkage with HA appears to be very low and the mechanism of the covalent interaction has not been clarified. Nonetheless, it is possible that a covalent interaction between IαI and HA could result in this observed increased stability of the cumulus ECM.In this study, we show that the majority of IαI within the ovulated cumulus ECM is covalently linked with HA and that this covalent interaction can be partially achieved in vitro by incubating purified PαI and HA with granulosa cells. Like ovulated COCs which expand within the intact follicle, COCs stabilized in medium containing granulosa cells or granulosa cell-conditioned medium, possess greater resistance to shear forces than those stabilized in medium lacking granulosa cells or granulosa cell-conditioned medium. This increased stability may be required for maintenance of integrity of the cumulus mass during extrusion of the COC through the rupture site within the follicular wall.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFemale mice (B6D2F1, 18-22 days old) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Minimal essential medium (MEM) with Earle's salts were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT), and pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin was purchased from Diosynth (Chicago, IL). Rabbit anti-human IαI IgG was obtained from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Carrier-free [35S]sulfuric acid was from ICN (Irvine, CA). Chondroitinase ABC was from Boehringer Mannheim and porcine follicle-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), glucosamine, rooster comb hyaluronic acid, Streptomyces hyaluronidase, guanidine-HCl, and lauryl sulfobetaine were all purchased from Sigma.MethodsPreparation of COCsMice were injected with 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and sacrificed 48 h later. Ovaries were placed in MEM with penicillin-G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 µg/ml). COCs (about 50-80 COCs per animal) for in vitro expansion assays were isolated and incubated in medium containing MEM, 2.5 mM glucosamine, porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (2 µg/ml), and other factors (FBS, purified bovine or mouse PαI as specified in each experiment) at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 16 h as described previously (5Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Google Scholar). In vivo stabilized ovulated COCs were collected about 12 h after an injection of an ovulatory dose of hCG (5 IU) in animals primed 48 h earlier with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (5 IU).High Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled ELISA for COCsOvulated COCs were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline and then transferred to 500 µl of 6 M guanidine HCl with 8% lauryl sulfobetaine or to 100 µl of phosphate-buffered saline with 2 units of Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 3 h at 37°C and then transferred to 400 µl of 6 M guanidine HCl with 8% lauryl sulfobetaine. About 100 µl of each of these samples were fractionated using a gel-filtration column (TSK-G-4000, Bio-Rad) on a Waters HPLC unit eluted with phosphate-buffered saline at a 6 ml/min flow rate. Fractions were collected from 10 to 34 min. 100 µl of each collected fraction was placed in a microwell plate (Dynatech Labs, Alexandria, VA) overnight at 4°C. The plates were then washed and blocked with 1% dry milk in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) with 0.05% of Tween 20 (TBT). Following incubation with anti-human IαI (1:1000 dilution with TBT) for 1 h at room temperature and three consecutive washes with TBT, the plates were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution, Bio-Rad). Following three washes with TBT, the plates were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative absorbance at 450 nm was determined with a Bio-Tek EL 309 Autoreader (Bio-Tek, Winnoski, VT).Cumulus ECM Shear Resistance AssayPasteur pipettes were flamed to an average size of 180 µm (inside diameter; about half the size of fully expanded and stabilized COCs). Individual COCs were sucked fully into the pipette and gently blown out (defined as one cycle). This process was repeated until the outer half of the cumulus mass had been stripped away and the remaining complex had been reduced to the size of the bore of the pipette. Although this parameter is judged subjectively, the release of the outer layer of the expanded cumulus mass is an all or nothing event which permits an accurate quantitation of the stability of expanded cECM. The resistance to shear stress (shear resistance index) is defined as the number of cycles necessary to strip off the outer half of the mass of cumulus cells.Purification of Mouse and Bovine PαIBoth mouse and bovine PαI were purified from mouse serum or FBS through four consecutive steps including ammonium sulfate precipitation, HPLC using gel filtration, DEAE, and gel filtration as described previously (5Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Google Scholar, 14Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L. Powers R. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Google Scholar). The purity of PαI/IαI used in this experiment is about 99% free of other proteins judged by Coomassie Blue staining following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The cross-contamination of PαI with IαI, however, is about 5%.Generation of Bikunin Site Specific AntiserumPeptide corresponding to human bikunin sequence 116-130 (QGNGNKFYSEKECRE) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Kentucky (Lexington, KT). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the conjugated peptide and antiserum was collected as described previously (19Hendrix E.M. Skowron-Lomneth C. Wilfinger W.W. Hertzberg E.L. Mao S.J.T. Chen L. Larsen W.J. Tissue & Cell. 1992; 24: 61-73Google Scholar). The specificity of the antiserum was characterized by Western blot as shown in Fig. 4B.Western Blot AnalysisProtein samples from FBS, mouse serum, ovulated COCs, and various in vitro stabilized COCs or media (see figure legends for details of individual sample preparation) were heated to 100°C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl at pH 6.8 and containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 90 s. Prior to treatment in this sample buffer, most samples in MEM were divided equally into two parts and one part was treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 3 h at 37°C. The Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma, H1136) is specific for hyaluronic acid and does not have chondroitinase activity (20Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Google Scholar). As shown in this study, this enzyme will not dissociate the heavy chains and light chain of native PαI/IαI. The reduced samples were then resolved on polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad pre-casted 4-15%, 4-20% gradient, or homemade 7 or 10% as specified in figure legends) and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Following incubation with rabbit anti-human IαI IgG (Dako) (1:1000) or anti-bikunin site-specific anti-serum (1:500) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), the blots were developed using substrates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).Preparation of Chondroitin Sulfate Radiolabeled IαI and ImmunopreciptationTo radiolabel the chondroitin sulfate component of IαI, a mouse hepatoma cell line was generated from an SV40 large T antigen transgenic mouse provided by Dr. J. S. Butel, Baylor College of Medicine. The cells were maintained and propagated in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C under 5% CO2. After achieving confluence in a 75-cm2 flask, the cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 5 ml of labeling medium (sulfate free MEM containing 2 mCi of carrier-free [35S]sulfuric acid, 0.5% FBS) overnight. The medium was centrifuged (1000 × g) for 10 min and passed through a 0.2-µm filter (Millipore) to remove cell debris. The unincorporated radioisotope was removed using ultrafiltration with a molecular mass cut-off of 100 kDa (Centricone-100, Amicon) and the medium concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml. About 20 µl of this sulfate-labeled protein mixture was then added to 80 µl of MEM containing granulosa cells under various conditions specified in the figure legends and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. These cell-medium mixtures were then centrifuged (at 1000 × g for 10 min) to remove cell debris and 2 µl of rabbit anti-human IαI was added and the mixture then incubated at room temperature for 2 h following addition of 20 µl of protein A-agarose suspension. The resulting mixture was incubated for another 2 h with gentle agitation and washed 4 times in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0 with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20). 20 µl of sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added and this mixture was heated to 100°C for 90 s. After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was resolved on a 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gels were then soaked with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN) and fluorographed as recommended by the manufactures manual.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn vitro and in vivo expanded COCs exhibit marked differences in resistance to shear forces. In vivo stabilized, ovulated COCs exhibit shear resistant indices greater than 60 in every ovulated COC tested (n = 12). In fact, trituration of ovulated COCs was arbitrarily terminated at the 60th cycle since every ovulated COC tested in this manner was still intact. In sharp contrast, in vitro stabilized COCs (stabilized in the absence of granulosa cells) exhibit a shear resistance index of 8 ± 2 (n = 26), while those stabilized in vitro in the presence of granulosa cells exhibit a shear resistance index of 20 ± 4 (n = 23). While the number of cumulus cells in either conditions were not assessed, incubating COCs with granulosa cell-conditioned medium also resulted in an enhancement of the shear resistance index 18 ± 4 (n = 11). This suggests a different cECM stabilization mechanism in vivo and in cultured COCs, despite the similarity in morphology of stabilized COCs of both preparations. The difference may be in part because of the participation of granulosa cells.Since the molecular mass of ovarian HA is >2000 kDa (21Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar), gel filtration HPLC should be able to distinguish native PαI/IαI from the protein-HA complex. Thus, to assess the interaction of HA and proteins of the IαI family within the ECM of in vivo ovulated COCs, the ovulated COCs were subjected to 6.0 M guanidine HCl and 8% lauryl sulfobetaine (a reagent which would dissociate most non-covalent interactions (16Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Google Scholar)), prior to subjecting the sample to gel filtration HPLC. The results are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1, A and B, are controls of native bovine PαI and PαI treated with chondroitinase ABC where the bimodal peak in panel B represents the heavy chain and the light chain fraction of the native protein as verified by Western blot (not shown). However, following guanidine HCl-lauryl sulfobetaine treatment, the majority of the IαI immunopositive fraction was still present in the void volume (Fig. 1C). When COCs were treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase, the immunopositive fraction shifted to a position as a broader peak that corresponds roughly to the naked heavy chain (panel D). Moreover, these results implied that most of the inter-α-inhibitor immunopositive material in the in vivo stabilized cumulus ECM was covalently associated with HA.Fig. 1HPLC coupled ELISA of IαI of ovulated COCs. Protein samples were fractionated on a TSK-G-4000 gel filtration column running at a 6 ml/min flow rate. Fractions were collected from 10 to 34 min which includes the void volume (~1000 kDa) to 10 kDa. 100 µl of each fraction were used to coat polywall plates and ELISAs were performed using anti-human IαI IgG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, 20 µg of purified bovine PαI. B, 20 µg of purified bovine PαI treated with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC. C, 157 ovulated COCs solubilized in water containing 6 M guanidine HCl and 8% lauryl sulfobetaine. D, 192 ovulated COCs treated with 1 unit of Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 3 h before solubilization in water containing 4.8 M guanidine HCl and 6.4% of lauryl sulfobetaine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This conclusion was strengthened by Western blot analysis of the ovulated COCs using antibody against native IαI (Dako) as shown in Fig. 2. Lane 2 illustrates the relative positions of native mouse IαI and PαI on SDS-PAGE. These bands migrate at about 220 and 130 kDa, respectively. Lane 3 shows that this antibody recognizes both the heavy and light chains of IαI on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. These bands migrate at about 100 and 50 kDa, respectively. Both PαI and IαI could be dissociated from in vitro stabilized COCs by treatment of the sample with SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2, lane 4). Prior treatment of the same sample of in vitro stabilized COCs with Streptomyces hyaluronidase, however, did not release any more detectable native IαI, PαI, or heavy chain (Fig. 2, lane 5), indicating that the interaction of IαI/PαI with HA without granulosa cells is non-covalent in nature. In contrast, major IαI components of in vivo stabilized COCs could not enter the gel upon treatment of the sample with SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (lane 6) without prior hyaluronidase treatment. The Coomassie Blue staining of the transferred gel shows similar transfer efficiency in both lanes 6 and 7 (not shown). After Streptomyces hyaluronidase treatment prior to SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol of the in vivo stabilized COCs, however, prominent immunostaining was visible with a major component of IαI at about 100 kDa (probably the heavy chain) and a minor component migrating at about 200 kDa (probably a double heavy chain; see Fig. 3, below). There is, however, a very small amount of immunopositive material corresponding to the heavy chains and the native PαI in the sample that is not treated with hyaluronidase (lane 6, compare to lane 7). It may be that a small amount of heavy chain spontaneously falls off during extraction. If all of the immunopositive material shown in lane 7, following hyaluronidase treatment, is covalently linked with HA, the conversion from native protein to the covalently bound form is almost complete. Such a high degree of covalent linkage between heavy chains of the IαI family and HA in an extracellular matrix is unprecedented.Fig. 2Western blots of IαI of in vivo ovulated COCs and in vitro stabilized COCs.

Lane 1, high molecular weight standards. Lanes 2-4 represent COCs collected at 3, 6, and 12 h after hCG injection without treatment with hyaluronidase. Lanes 5-7 represent COCs collected at the same time points but treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase. Lane 8 is 3 µl of mouse serum showing the location of IαI and PαI. Lane 9 is the same sample as lane 7, but collected independently. Lane 10 is the same sample as lane 9, but treated with 0.5 N NaOH and then neutralized with 0.5 N HCl after hyaluronidase treatment. Lane 12 is another control of ovulated COCs treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (same as lane 7). Lane 13 is a sample of ovulated COCs treated with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase. Lane 14 is the same sample as lane 13, but treated consecutively with Streptomyces hyaluronidase and chondroitinase. Finally lane 15 is a sample of ovulated COCs treated with NaOH without any enzymatic treatment. Note the disappearance of apparent double heavy chains at about 200 kDa following NaOH treatment. The lane between 7 and 8 as well as lane 11 are the high molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The time course of incorporation of IαI heavy chains into the expanding HA enriched cumulus ECM in vivo is shown in Fig. 3. During the time frame from 3 to 12 h after the hCG injection, only trace amounts of intact IαI/PαI become incorporated into the cECM as shown by Western blot (lanes 2-4) without prior treatment with hyaluronidase. However, a large amount of PαI/IαI heavy chains were incorporated into the matrix by about 6 h after injection of hCG revealed by treating the sample with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (lanes 5-7). There is no detectable incorporation of native protein or heavy chains of PαI/IαI during the first hour following hCG, regardless of whether the samples are treated with hyaluronidase or not (not shown). In addition, a band was again observed at about 200 kDa, which was suspected to be comprised of double heavy chains, possibly derived from the IαI that forms a covalent linkage with a single HA molecule in such a way that it is protected from the action of hyaluronidase. Indeed, further treatment of the hyaluronidase-treated sample with NaOH (0.1 M for 10 min at room temperature followed by neutralization with 0.1 M HCl; a method previously shown to dissociate the heavy chains from O-linked carbohydrates as well as the ester bond that links the heavy chain of IαI with chondroitin sulfate (9Jessen T.E. Faarvang K.L. Ploug M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 195-200Google Scholar, 18Malki N. Balduyck M. Maes P. Capon C. Mizon C. Han K.K. Tartar A. Fournet B. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1009-1018Google Scholar)), the 200-kDa band disappeared and only the single apparent heavy chain was present (lane 10). In addition, this 200-kDa band is not sensitive to consecutive treatments with hyaluronidase and chondroitinase (lane 14). Moreover, direct treatment of ovulated COCs with NaOH (without pretreatment with hyaluronidase, lane 15) also coverts this 200-kDa band to a sharp 100-kDa band that corresponds to the position of the heavy chain of IαI. These results taken together support the possibility that a small fraction of the two heavy chains of IαI form a covalent linkage with the same HA molecule in close proximity that is resistant to Streptomyces hyaluronidase or chondroitinase but sensitive to NaOH treatment.The apparent covalent interaction observed in vivo within the ovulated cECM can be partially reproduced in vitro in the presence of granulosa cells or granulosa cell-conditioned medium. This system consisted of HA, purified IαI or PαI, and granulosa cells in MEM or granulosa cell-conditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 4A, only when granulosa cells or granulosa cell-conditioned medium are added into the reaction mixture, will the system generate the free light chain of PαI and the heavy chain of PαI which is released upon treating the sample with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 4A, lanes 6-9). Heat-treated granulosa cell-conditioned medium is unable to facilitate the covalent binding of HA with heavy chain (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). The same experiments illustrated in lanes 6-9 of Fig. 4A were repeated and illustrated in lanes 2-5 of Fig. 4B but with a higher concentration of purified PαI and HA. As stated above, Western blot of medium extracts showed two bands corresponding to PαI and bikunin (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). Treatment of the samples with Streptomyces hyaluronidase prior to SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol treatment, however, revealed a prominent band corresponding to the heavy chain position (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 5). Purified bovine PαI displayed the same pattern of interaction wi"

Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar).Typical ABC transporters include two nucleotide-binding (ABC) domains and two hydrophobic domains containing transmembrane-spanning α-helices (TMS); these domains can reside in one to four proteins (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Google Scholar). Many eukaryotic ABC transporters include all four domains in one protein, and these can be sub-classified into those that have a (TMS6-ABC)2 configuration (such as the mammalian MDR proteins (5Gottesman M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar), the human CFTR and the yeast STE6 transporter of a-mating type pheromone (6Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 3973-3984Google Scholar)), and those that have the reverse (ABC-TMS6)2 configuration. The reverse form of four domain transporters have as yet only been found in various yeasts, although “half-size” proteins (ABC-TMS6), such as the white and brown pigment precursor importers, are known in invertebrates (7O'Hare K. Murphy C. Levis R. Rubin G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 437-455Google Scholar, 8Dreesen T.D. Johnson D.H. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5206-5215Google Scholar).In yeast, the best characterized reverse form ABC transporter is that encoded by the PDR5 (STS1, YDR1, LEM1) gene (9Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Google Scholar, 10Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4180-4186Google Scholar, 11Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr.

A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Google Scholar), overexpression of which leads to resistance to a number of structurally unrelated drugs such as cycloheximide, sulfomethuron methyl, sporodesmin, compactin, and cerulenin. Deletion of the gene leads to hypersensitivity to these drugs, as well as to dexamethasone, chloramphenicol, staurosporine, fluphenazine, and mycotoxins. PDR5, therefore, is presumed to function as an efflux pump for cytotoxic compounds in much the same way as the P-glycoprotein MDR1, despite their differing structural organization. Expression of the PDR5 gene has been shown to be under the control of a number of transcriptional regulators (e.g. PDR1, PDR3), suggesting a complex but precise control of expression at the transcriptional level (13Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 152-162Google Scholar). In addition, PDR5 gene expression seems to be under hormonal control, α-factor repressing PDR5 transcript accumulation (10Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4180-4186Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the PDR5 gene product plays a physiological role in the externalization of cytotoxic compounds which accumulate during growth, especially in response to environmental stress (11Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar), and that PDR5-like proteins might modulate the levels of steroid hormones in higher eukaryotes (12Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Google Scholar).In this paper, we report on the cloning and characterization of a plant cDNA, TUR2, encoding a homolog of the yeast PDR5 ABC transporter. We show that the transcript level is under hormonal control, TUR2 expression being elevated by the steroid-like plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), this elevation being reversed by the adenine-derived hormone, kinetin. In addition, environmental stress conditions such as low temperature lead to an elevated level of the TUR2 transcript. These hormonal and environmental effects on TUR2 gene expression are paralleled at the developmental level by the altered fate of new buds produced by the plant (Spirodela polyrrhiza), which under conditions of elevated ABA level and cold treatment forms dormant buds, termed turions (14Smart C.C. Trewavas A.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1983; 6: 507-514Google Scholar, 15Smart C. Longland J. Trewavas A. Fox J.E. Jacobs M. Molecular Biology of Plant Growth Control. Alan R.

The chimeric protein contains the N-terminal domain of EWS1 fused to the DNA-binding domain of WT1, including zinc fingers 2-4. Because WT1 has been shown previously to bind and repress the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I-R) promoter, we investigated whether this promoter is, in addition, a target for the aberrant EWS/WT1 transcription factor.EWS/WT1 activated the IGF-I-R promoter ~340%, whereas a fusion protein containing a three-amino acid insert (KTS) between zinc fingers 3 and 4 had no effect. On the other hand, expression vectors encoding either WT1 or EWS1 reduced the activity of the promoter to 46 and 58% of control values, respectively. Results of gel shift assays indicate that the binding affinity of EWS/WT1 to a fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the receptor promoter was higher than the affinity of WT1 itself. Consistent with the results of functional assays, the binding of EWS/WT1(+KTS) was significantly reduced.

It is constitutively expressed by most tissues, where it is basically required for progression through the cell cycle (1Baserga R. Receptor. 1992; 2: 261-266Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Adamo M.

The IGF-I-R is also implicated in malignant transformation, as shown by its high level of expression in many tumors and cancer cell lines (7Werner H. LeRoith D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 183-223Google Scholar) and by the inability of a number of oncogenes to transform cell lines lacking IGF-I-R (8Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). One of the best characterized rearrangements is the translocation of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma (12Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Adv. Immunol. 1991; 50: 119-146Google Scholar). In this type of cancer, the c-myc protooncogene is juxtaposed to an immunoglobulin gene by chromosomal fusion, thereby activating the oncogene. A second example of a chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic tumors is the fusion of the bcr and c-abl genes on the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia, with generation of an oncogenic fusion protein (13de Klein A. van Kessel A.G. Grosveld G. Bartram C.R. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Spurr N.K. Heiterkamp N. Groffen J. Nature. 1982; 300: 765-767Google Scholar). More recently, a number of pediatric malignant tumors, such as soft-tissue sarcomas, were shown to be characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations, frequently resulting in the fusion of genes (11Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). These fusion gene products often comprise potential transcription factors and nucleic acid-binding proteins. An example of this growing family of disrupted transcription factors is the (11;22) chromosomal translocation found in nearly 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (EWS) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of childhood (14Delattre O. Zucman J. Melot T. Garau X.S. Zucker J.-M. Lenoir G.M. Ambros P.F. Sheer D. Turc-Carel C. Triche T.J. Aurias A. Thomas G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 294-299Google Scholar, 15Delattre O. Zucman J.

This translocation results in the fusion of the 5′ region of the ubiquitously expressed EWS1 gene to the 3′ region of the FLI-1 gene. This chimeric gene product (EWS/FLI-1) is an aberrant transcription factor which contains the transcriptional domain of EWS1, which is usually involved in protein-protein interactions, and the DNA-binding domain of FLI-1. Although capable of promoting tumorigenesis (18May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brooks J.J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993; 7: 119-121Google Scholar). Recently, a genomic DNA fragment containing an EWS1 and Wilms' tumor (WT1) fusion gene has been isolated from these tumors (23Rauscher III, F.J. Benjamin L.E. Fredericks W.J. Morris J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 137-146Google Scholar, 24Ladanyi M. Gerald W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2837-2840Google Scholar, 25Gerald W.L. Rosai J. Ladanyi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Analyses of chimeric transcripts showed fusion of RNAs encoding the N-terminal domain of EWS1 to both alternatively spliced forms of the last three zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain of WT1. As for the EWS/FLI-1 chimeric protein, the functional target gene(s) of EWS/WT1 remain unknown.WT1 itself is a tumor suppressor gene product that functions as a transcription factor and whose deletion or mutation has been implicated in the etiology of a subset of Wilms' tumors (26Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 509-520Google Scholar, 27Gessler M. Poustka A. Cavenee W. Neve R.L.

Cell. 1990; 60: 495-508Google Scholar, 29Rauscher III, F.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 896-903Google Scholar). WT1 interacts with target promoters containing the consensus sequence GCGGGGGCG by means of four zinc finger motifs located at its C terminus, and usually suppresses their activity by means of its N-terminal activation domain (30Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Google Scholar, 31Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J.

We have previously shown that the IGF-I-R gene is overexpressed in Wilms' tumor, consistent with the IGF-I-R gene promoter being a target for the inhibitory action of WT1 (33Werner H. Re G.G. Drummond I.A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Sens D.A. Garvin A.J. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5828-5832Google Scholar). Accordingly, WT1 expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells results in a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of a co-transfected IGF-I-R promoter-luciferase reporter construct (34Werner H. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar, 35Werner H. Shen-Orr Z. Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3516-3522Google Scholar). This effect of WT1 involves the interaction of its zinc finger domain with multiple consensus binding sites in both the 5′-flanking and 5′-untranslated regions of the IGF-I-R gene.Since the EWS/WT1 chimeric product obtains the three C-terminal zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain of WT1 it is anticipated that this fusion protein may modulate transcription of target genes containing WT1 binding motifs, such as the IGF-I-R gene. Due to the pivotal role of IGF-I-R in transformation events we have investigated the potential molecular mechanisms for the regulation of the IGF-I-R gene promoter by the EWS/WT1 fusion protein at the transcriptional level.DISCUSSIONTumor-specific chromosomal translocations resulting in chimeric transcription factors emerged as a general theme in oncogenesis (11Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). The modular organization of transcription factors is disrupted by the chromosomal event, and gain-of-function mutant genes harboring motifs derived from unrelated genes are usually generated. Many of these fusion proteins have been shown to be highly oncogenic.DSRCT is a very aggressive clinicopathological subcategory of small cell round tumors (SCRT) which occurs most frequently in adolescent males and is mainly circumscribed to the abdomen (38Ordonez N.G. El-Naggar A.K. Ro J.Y. Silva E.G. Mackay B. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 850-865Google Scholar). Histopathological studies showed the presence of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal elements, similarly to triphasic Wilms' tumors which also contain epithelial, mesenchymal, and stromal cells (39Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Google Scholar). Cytogenetic analyses revealed the presence of a recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of RNA extracted from the tumors demonstrated the in-frame fusion of the N-terminal domain of EWS1 at exon 7 to exon 8 (zinc finger 2) of WT1. This rearrangement was observed in 11 of 14 DSRCT samples, but not in normal adjacent tissue (23Rauscher III, F.J. Benjamin L.E. Fredericks W.J. Morris J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 137-146Google Scholar).The chimeric EWS/WT1 is a member of a family of fusion proteins which involve the N-terminal domain of EWS1, and which includes EWS/FLI-1, EWS/ERG, and EWS/ATF1 (15Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Google Scholar, 40Sorensen P.H.B. Lessnick S.L.

Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 341-345Google Scholar). The EWS1 gene encodes an ubiquitous 656-amino acid protein of unknown function. EWS1 comprises an N-terminal domain homologous to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II and a C-terminal domain homologous to RNA-binding domains (42Zucman J. Delattre J. Desmaze C. Plougastel B. Joubert I. Melot P.M. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 5: 271-277Google Scholar). The common feature of these oncogenic proteins, thus, is the presence of the highly potent transcriptional activation N-terminal domain of EWS1 fused to a novel DNA binding domain.The results of this study demonstrate that, whereas EWS1 and WT1, individually, suppressed the activity of the IGF-I-R promoter, the EWS/WT1 fused gene sustained a gain-of-function mutation which conferred upon its product the ability to transactivate the IGF-I-R promoter. The mechanism for EWS1 suppression of IGF-I-R promoter is presently unknown. WT1 has been previously demonstrated to bind to specific sites in the 5′-flanking and 5′-untranslated regions of the IGF-I-R promoter and to suppress its activity in a manner which is directly dependent on the number of sites involved (34Werner H. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar). In the case of EWS/WT1, however, removal of all the binding sites in the 5′-untranslated region does not decrease its stimulatory effect, thus suggesting that WT1 sites in the 5′-flanking region are mainly responsible for the effect of the fusion protein. Interestingly, construct p(−188/+640), which lacks the four N-terminal WT1 sites in the 5′-flanking region was still stimulated by EWS/WT1, suggesting that the site at position −163/−155 had a preponderant effect in the context of this promoter. We may speculate that, from the standpoint of WT1, loss of its N-terminal domain in EWS/WT1 and replacement by the potent activation domain of EWS1, confers upon it a very strong oncogenic potential. From the standpoint of EWS1, loss of its C-terminal domain in EWS/WT1 abrogates its RNA-binding activity. Fusion to the zinc finger domain of WT1 converts EWS1 from an RNA-binding to a DNA-binding protein with a well defined set of target genes. Such gain-of-function changes are not unprecedented. WT1 itself, for example, has been shown to be an inhibitory factor in the presence of p53, whereas in the absence of this protein it stimulates the activity of target genes (43Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Google Scholar).As previously shown using a synthetic early growth response gene-binding site oligonucleotide, the results of gel shift assays indicate that the affinity of the fusion protein for binding to the IGF-I-R promoter is higher than that of WTZF itself. This increased affinity of EWS/WT1 can be explained by the lack of zinc finger 1, which has been previously shown to destabilize the DNA binding activity of WT1 (44Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa S.L. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3800-3809Google Scholar).The IGF-I-R has a central role in transformation and proliferation events, and its presence is a fundamental prerequisite for the transforming ability of simian virus 40 large T antigen, Ras, and other oncogenes (1Baserga R. Receptor. 1992; 2: 261-266Google Scholar, 8Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar, 9Coppola D. Ferber A.

Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions the expression of the potent IGF-I-R promoter is negatively controlled by a number of tumor suppressors, including p53 and WT1 (45Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher III, F.J. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Inhibitory control of IGF-I-R gene expression by WT1 can be overcome by the pathologic fusion of EWS1 to WT1, an event which abrogates the tumor suppressor effect of WT1 and which generates an oncogenic chimera. By means of the WT1-derived DNA binding domain, EWS/WT1 is able to recognize and activate the same set of target genes which were previously negatively regulated by WT1.In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the IGF-I-R promoter is a molecular target for the EWS/WT1 fusion protein. Relief from negative regulation by WT1 and activation by EWS/WT1 constitute a novel paradigm in tumorigenesis.

It is constitutively expressed by most tissues, where it is basically required for progression through the cell cycle (1Baserga R. Receptor. 1992; 2: 261-266Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Adamo M.

The IGF-I-R is also implicated in malignant transformation, as shown by its high level of expression in many tumors and cancer cell lines (7Werner H. LeRoith D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 183-223Google Scholar) and by the inability of a number of oncogenes to transform cell lines lacking IGF-I-R (8Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). One of the best characterized rearrangements is the translocation of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma (12Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Adv. Immunol. 1991; 50: 119-146Google Scholar). In this type of cancer, the c-myc protooncogene is juxtaposed to an immunoglobulin gene by chromosomal fusion, thereby activating the oncogene. A second example of a chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic tumors is the fusion of the bcr and c-abl genes on the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia, with generation of an oncogenic fusion protein (13de Klein A. van Kessel A.G. Grosveld G. Bartram C.R. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Spurr N.K. Heiterkamp N. Groffen J. Nature. 1982; 300: 765-767Google Scholar). More recently, a number of pediatric malignant tumors, such as soft-tissue sarcomas, were shown to be characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations, frequently resulting in the fusion of genes (11Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). These fusion gene products often comprise potential transcription factors and nucleic acid-binding proteins. An example of this growing family of disrupted transcription factors is the (11;22) chromosomal translocation found in nearly 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (EWS) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of childhood (14Delattre O. Zucman J. Melot T. Garau X.S. Zucker J.-M. Lenoir G.M. Ambros P.F. Sheer D. Turc-Carel C. Triche T.J. Aurias A. Thomas G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 294-299Google Scholar, 15Delattre O. Zucman J.

This translocation results in the fusion of the 5′ region of the ubiquitously expressed EWS1 gene to the 3′ region of the FLI-1 gene. This chimeric gene product (EWS/FLI-1) is an aberrant transcription factor which contains the transcriptional domain of EWS1, which is usually involved in protein-protein interactions, and the DNA-binding domain of FLI-1. Although capable of promoting tumorigenesis (18May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, a genomic DNA fragment containing an EWS1 and Wilms' tumor (WT1) fusion gene has been isolated from these tumors (23Rauscher III, F.J. Benjamin L.E. Fredericks W.J. Morris J.F.

Accordingly, WT1 expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells results in a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of a co-transfected IGF-I-R promoter-luciferase reporter construct (34Werner H.

DISCUSSIONTumor-specific chromosomal translocations resulting in chimeric transcription factors emerged as a general theme in oncogenesis (11Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). The modular organization of transcription factors is disrupted by the chromosomal event, and gain-of-function mutant genes harboring motifs derived from unrelated genes are usually generated. Many of these fusion proteins have been shown to be highly oncogenic.DSRCT is a very aggressive clinicopathological subcategory of small cell round tumors (SCRT) which occurs most frequently in adolescent males and is mainly circumscribed to the abdomen (38Ordonez N.G. El-Naggar A.K. Ro J.Y. Silva E.G. Mackay B. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 850-865Google Scholar). Histopathological studies showed the presence of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal elements, similarly to triphasic Wilms' tumors which also contain epithelial, mesenchymal, and stromal cells (39Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Google Scholar). Cytogenetic analyses revealed the presence of a recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of RNA extracted from the tumors demonstrated the in-frame fusion of the N-terminal domain of EWS1 at exon 7 to exon 8 (zinc finger 2) of WT1. This rearrangement was observed in 11 of 14 DSRCT samples, but not in normal adjacent tissue (23Rauscher III, F.J. Benjamin L.E. Fredericks W.J. Morris J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 137-146Google Scholar).The chimeric EWS/WT1 is a member of a family of fusion proteins which involve the N-terminal domain of EWS1, and which includes EWS/FLI-1, EWS/ERG, and EWS/ATF1 (15Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Google Scholar, 40Sorensen P.H.B. Lessnick S.L.

Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 341-345Google Scholar). The EWS1 gene encodes an ubiquitous 656-amino acid protein of unknown function. EWS1 comprises an N-terminal domain homologous to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II and a C-terminal domain homologous to RNA-binding domains (42Zucman J. Delattre J. Desmaze C. Plougastel B. Joubert I. Melot P.M. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 5: 271-277Google Scholar). The common feature of these oncogenic proteins, thus, is the presence of the highly potent transcriptional activation N-terminal domain of EWS1 fused to a novel DNA binding domain.The results of this study demonstrate that, whereas EWS1 and WT1, individually, suppressed the activity of the IGF-I-R promoter, the EWS/WT1 fused gene sustained a gain-of-function mutation which conferred upon its product the ability to transactivate the IGF-I-R promoter. The mechanism for EWS1 suppression of IGF-I-R promoter is presently unknown. WT1 has been previously demonstrated to bind to specific sites in the 5′-flanking and 5′-untranslated regions of the IGF-I-R promoter and to suppress its activity in a manner which is directly dependent on the number of sites involved (34Werner H. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar). In the case of EWS/WT1, however, removal of all the binding sites in the 5′-untranslated region does not decrease its stimulatory effect, thus suggesting that WT1 sites in the 5′-flanking region are mainly responsible for the effect of the fusion protein. Interestingly, construct p(−188/+640), which lacks the four N-terminal WT1 sites in the 5′-flanking region was still stimulated by EWS/WT1, suggesting that the site at position −163/−155 had a preponderant effect in the context of this promoter. We may speculate that, from the standpoint of WT1, loss of its N-terminal domain in EWS/WT1 and replacement by the potent activation domain of EWS1, confers upon it a very strong oncogenic potential. From the standpoint of EWS1, loss of its C-terminal domain in EWS/WT1 abrogates its RNA-binding activity. Fusion to the zinc finger domain of WT1 converts EWS1 from an RNA-binding to a DNA-binding protein with a well defined set of target genes. Such gain-of-function changes are not unprecedented. WT1 itself, for example, has been shown to be an inhibitory factor in the presence of p53, whereas in the absence of this protein it stimulates the activity of target genes (43Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Google Scholar).As previously shown using a synthetic early growth response gene-binding site oligonucleotide, the results of gel shift assays indicate that the affinity of the fusion protein for binding to the IGF-I-R promoter is higher than that of WTZF itself. This increased affinity of EWS/WT1 can be explained by the lack of zinc finger 1, which has been previously shown to destabilize the DNA binding activity of WT1 (44Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa S.L. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3800-3809Google Scholar).The IGF-I-R has a central role in transformation and proliferation events, and its presence is a fundamental prerequisite for the transforming ability of simian virus 40 large T antigen, Ras, and other oncogenes (1Baserga R. Receptor. 1992; 2: 261-266Google Scholar, 8Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar, 9Coppola D. Ferber A.

Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions the expression of the potent IGF-I-R promoter is negatively controlled by a number of tumor suppressors, including p53 and WT1 (45Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher III, F.J. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Inhibitory control of IGF-I-R gene expression by WT1 can be overcome by the pathologic fusion of EWS1 to WT1, an event which abrogates the tumor suppressor effect of WT1 and which generates an oncogenic chimera. By means of the WT1-derived DNA binding domain, EWS/WT1 is able to recognize and activate the same set of target genes which were previously negatively regulated by WT1.In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the IGF-I-R promoter is a molecular target for the EWS/WT1 fusion protein. Relief from negative regulation by WT1 and activation by EWS/WT1 constitute a novel paradigm in tumorigenesis. Tumor-specific chromosomal translocations resulting in chimeric transcription factors emerged as a general theme in oncogenesis (11Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Google Scholar). The modular organization of transcription factors is disrupted by the chromosomal event, and gain-of-function mutant genes harboring motifs derived from unrelated genes are usually generated. Many of these fusion proteins have been shown to be highly oncogenic. DSRCT is a very aggressive clinicopathological subcategory of small cell round tumors (SCRT) which occurs most frequently in adolescent males and is mainly circumscribed to the abdomen (38Ordonez N.G. El-Naggar A.K. Ro J.Y. Silva E.G. Mackay B. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 850-865Google Scholar). Histopathological studies showed the presence of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal elements, similarly to triphasic Wilms' tumors which also contain epithelial, mesenchymal, and stromal cells (39Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Google Scholar). Cytogenetic analyses revealed the presence of a recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of RNA extracted from the tumors demonstrated the in-frame fusion of the N-terminal domain of EWS1 at exon 7 to exon 8 (zinc finger 2) of WT1. This rearrangement was observed in 11 of 14 DSRCT samples, but not in normal adjacent tissue (23Rauscher III, F.J. Benjamin L.E. Fredericks W.J. Morris J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Biol. 1995; 2: 707-710Google Scholar, Gorczyca et al., 1995) are members of a recently identified subclass of EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins that respond to Ca2+ differently than any other known members of the EF-hand superfamily. GCAPs acquire an activating conformation only in their Ca2+-free form. Free Ca2+ concentrations corresponding to levels in dark-adapted vertebrate photoreceptors inhibit the ability of GCAPs to activate photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases (RetGCs). We studied the effects of mutations that block binding of Ca2+ to the EF-hands of GCAP-2. Unlike other EF-hand proteins, which fail to activate their target when their EF-hands are inactivated by mutations, GCAP-2 with any single EF-hand inactivated remains active and is 3-6 times less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of Ca2+. Inactivation of any two or all three EF-hands produces active forms of GCAP-2 that are insensitive to inhibition by physiological intracellular concentrations of Ca2+. Unexpectedly we also found that activation of RetGCs by a Ca2+-insensitive mutant is inhibited by Ca2+-loaded wild type GCAP-2. We propose the following. 1) GCAP-2 can exist in two extreme functional forms: an apo form that activates RetGCs and a Ca2+-loaded form that blocks activation of RetGCs. 2) All three EF-hands of GCAP-2 contribute to the inhibitory effect of Ca2+. 3) Inactivation of two or three EF-hands is sufficient to shift the “activator-inhibitor” transition outside the physiological range of intracellular free Ca2+.

A variety of proteins with EF-hand type Ca2+-binding domains interact with their targets only when their EF-hands are occupied by Ca2+ (reviewed by Strynadka et al. (25Strynadka C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Google Scholar) and Crivici and Ikura (3Crivici A. Ikura M. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Google Scholar)). However, two recently discovered guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins, GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 (Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

They activate their target enzyme, a photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC), 1The abbreviations used are: RetGCphotoreceptor guanylyl cyclaseGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinOSphotoreceptor outer segment(s). only in their Ca2+-free or “apo” forms. The apo form of neuromodulin is the only other known example of an EF-hand protein that is capable of interacting with its target protein, calmodulin. However, even in that case the function of neuromodulin appears to “dock” calmodulin rather than imparting Ca2+ sensitivity to an effector enzyme (reviewed by Liu and Storm (19Liu Y.C. Storm D.R.

The unique type of Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAPs accounts for their biological function as Ca2+ sensors in a feedback mechanism that regulates resynthesis of cGMP in vertebrate photoreceptors (Koch and Stryer, 16Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-71Google Scholar). photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase guanylyl cyclase-activating protein photoreceptor outer segment(s). Ca2+ enters outer segments (OS) of vertebrate photoreceptors through cGMP-gated Na+/Ca2+ channels in the plasma membranes. These channels are open in the dark, but light closes them by stimulating cGMP hydrolysis. Channel closure lowers the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration because Ca2+ is removed from the OS by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger (reviewed by Lagnado and Baylor (17Lagnado L. Baylor D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 995-1002Google Scholar) and Yarfitz and Hurley (28Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Google Scholar)). The decrease in free Ca2+ concentration stimulates cGMP synthesis (Koch and Stryer, 16Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-71Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro that when free Ca2+ decreases from 500 nM to below 50 nM, GCAP-2 (Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11646-11651Google Scholar). GCAPs and GCAP-regulated membrane guanylyl cyclases have been found only in photoreceptors (reviewed by Garbers and Lowe (1995)). GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 belong to the family of recoverin-like proteins (Dizhoor et al., 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Each member of this family has four EF-hand like domains (Fig. 1). The present study was undertaken to understand the role of Ca2+-binding domains in GCAP-2 function. We analyzed the effects of EF-hand mutations on the ability of recombinant GCAP-2 to stimulate RetGC activity in OS membranes. Inactivation of the EF-hands produced a constitutively active form of GCAP-2 that is insensitive to Ca2+. We also demonstrated that Ca2+ induces a transition of wild type GCAP-2 into an inhibitor form that competes with constitutively active GCAP-2. This provides an additional important feedback element for regulation of RetGCs. Photoreceptor outer segments were isolated from frozen bovine retinas using sucrose gradient centrifugation (McDowell, 22McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Methods in Neuroscience: Photoreceptor Cells. Academic Press, New York1993: 123Google Scholar) and washed in low salt buffer in order to remove endogenous GCAPs as described (Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P.

Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar), except polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plates were purchased from Merck. GCAP-2 cDNA and its mutant forms were expressed in HEK293 cells under control of the β-actin promoter as described (Dizhoor et al., 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were mock-transfected with vector DNA only. The amount of expressed GCAP-2 in the soluble cell fraction was evaluated using immunoblotting as described (Dizhoor et al., 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar). The GCAP-2 cDNA coding region (Dizhoor et al., 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar) was inserted into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET11d vector (Novagen) and expressed under control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-dependent promoter in the BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain carrying a p88131 plasmid encoding yeast N-myristoyl transferase (a gift from Dr. J. Gordon). As an N-myristoyl donor, free myristic acid was added into the suspension of bacterial cells to 50 µg/ml 30 min before the induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as described (Dizhoor et al., 6Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E.V. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar). The expressed GCAP-2 and its mutants were always found in the inclusion bodies. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of ultrasonication, and the insoluble material was washed three times with a 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 µg/ml leupeptin (Buffer A). GCAP-2 was extracted from the pellet by homogenization in buffer A containing 6 M freshly deionized urea for 30 min and dialyzed twice against 300-1000 volumes of Buffer A overnight at 4°C. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min. Final purification of recombinant protein was achieved by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. The molecular mass of recombinant myristoylated GCAP-2 was determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Dizhoor et al., 5Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Google Scholar). It corresponded to the calculated molecular mass of GCAP-2 (Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Google Scholar, 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Within the accuracy of the method, it was identical to the mass of GCAP-2 isolated from bovine retinas. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate site-directed mutants using a “splicing by overlap extension” approach (Horton and Pease, 14Horton R. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217Google Scholar). Nucleotide substitutions were incorporated into overlapping polymerase chain reaction primers 24-30 base pairs long during their chemical synthesis. High concentrations (~100-200 ng) of GCAP-2 cDNA and Pfu polymerase (Promega) were used to decrease the possibility of random mutations. The positions of mutations were verified by cDNA sequencing, and the masses of recombinant mutant proteins expressed in E. coli were also verified by mass spectrometry. Ca-EGTA buffers were calculated using a multifactor program “Bound and Determined,” based on the algorithm of Marks and Maxfield (9Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1994; 75: 709-716Google Scholar), and were prepared according to the method of Tsien and Pozzan (26Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Google Scholar), and free Ca2+ concentrations were verified using Rhod-2 Ca2+-sensitive dye (Calbiochem) and a Ca2+-selective electrode (Orion). There are four EF-hand like regions in GCAP-2 (Fig. 1, EF1-EF4) (Dizhoor et al., 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar), as in other members of the recoverin family. Strictly speaking, “EF1” in GCAP-2 is not a true EF-hand. It cannot bind Ca2+ because it lacks two oxygen-containing side chain amino acids at Ca2+ coordinating positions “Y” and “−X” (positions in EF-hand are given according to Strynadka et al. (1989) and Babu et al. (1Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Google Scholar)), important for Ca2+ binding. It also has Glu instead of Asp in the X position. No metal ion was bound within the similarly disrupted EF-hand related region of recoverin (Flaherty et al., 1993). The other three EF-hands of GCAP-2 have all the proper amino acid side chains for coordinating Ca2+. EF2 has a single deviation from the consensus sequence, Asn-74 instead of the usual Gly between the coordinating residues “Z” and “−Y” of the EF-hand motif (Strynadka et al., 1989). We used site-directed mutagenesis of the three EF-hands of GCAP-2 to study their functional significance in imparting Ca2+ sensitivity to RetGC. We found that GCAP-2 expressed either in HEK293 cells or in E. coli activates OS GC in a Ca2+-sensitive manner indistinguishable from activation by GCAP-2 isolated from bovine retina. In both cases the EC50 for the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ is ~250 nM with a Hill coefficient of 1.7-1.9 (Fig. 2, A and C). Half-saturation of RetGCs activity in our assay system containing OS membranes occurs at ~500 nM recombinant GCAP-2, consistent with previous results using GCAP-2 isolated from bovine retina (Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Google Scholar, 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

These results validate our use of recombinant GCAP-2 from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for the in vitro mutagenesis studies reported here. One might expect that the substitution N74G (Fig. 1B) would improve EF2 and increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2. However, we find that the Ca2+ sensitivity of N74G GCAP-2 expressed in HEK293 cells is indistinguishable from that of the wild type GCAP-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that either EF2 does not participate in Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2 or that EF2 is important but the naturally occurring Asn-74 effectively substitutes for Gly. We resolved that issue by using a different mutation that inactivates EF2. As shown below, we find that EF2 is, indeed, important for the Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2. It has been established that carboxyl side chains of the first Asp (position X) or the last Glu (position −Z) of an EF-hand are essential for coordinating Ca2+. Their substitution with Asn or Gln, respectively, hampers Ca2+ binding and inactivates an EF-hand as a regulatory domain (Strynadka et al., 1989, Babu et al., 1Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Google Scholar). In order to inactivate EF2, EF3 or EF4 domains of GCAP-2 we introduced point mutations, E80Q, E116Q, or D158N, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 1B. Inactivation of EF3 (E116Q) decreases Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity (Fig. 2, A and B). E116Q GCAP-2 expressed either in HEK293 cells or in E. coli gave equivalent results (Fig. 2, A and C). This confirms that expression in E. coli, solubilization/dialysis and purification do not alter the functional properties of GCAP-2. Fig. 2D demonstrates that inactivating any one of the three EF-hands does not interfere with activation of OS GC at low Ca2+ concentrations, but substantially (3-6-fold) reduces the Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2. Mutations in EF2 or EF4 reduce Ca2+ sensitivity more effectively than a mutation in EF3. A precise value of the intracellular free Ca2+ level in mammalian photoreceptors has not yet been reported. In lower vertebrate photoreceptors, however, it was most recently evaluated using Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes (Gray-Keller and Detwiler, 11Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1994; 14: 849-861Google Scholar). The bulk free Ca2+ concentration in dark-adapted photoreceptors is near 500 nM, and after light adaptation it decreases to as low as 50 nM. On this basis we refer to submicromolar free Ca2+concentrations as the “physiological range” (shadowed area in Fig. 2, D and E). Regulation of RetGCs by Ca2+in vitro takes place within that range (Koch and Stryer, 16Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-71Google Scholar; Dizhoor et al., 7Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Google Scholar, 8Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Google Scholar). However, the mutant forms of GCAP-2 shown in Fig. 2D are only partially inhibited by free Ca2+ within its physiological range. In order to evaluate the contribution of each individual EF-hand to the overall Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2, we generated double mutations that inactivate pairs of EF-hands: EF2 and EF3 (E80Q/E116Q), EF2 and EF4 (E80Q/D158N), EF3 and EF4 (E116Q/D158N). We also inactivated all three EF-hands (E80Q/E116Q/D158N). Mutating any pair of EF-hands makes GCAP-2 insensitive to the inhibitory effect of submicromolar Ca2+ (Fig. 2E). However, the double mutants of GCAP-2 are ~50% inhibited by very high (>10 µM) free Ca2+. The most dramatic effect on Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-2 occurred in the triple mutant E80Q/E116Q/D158N, which is fully active within the whole range of free Ca2+ concentrations between 15 nM and 20 µM (Fig. 2E). Importantly, this mutant, like all the other GCAP-2 mutants used in this study, is not impaired in its ability to fully activate RetGCs. According to the original model by Koch and Stryer (16Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-71Google Scholar), photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase is regulated by a Ca2+-binding protein that is active at low Ca2+ and inactive at high Ca2+concentrations. By using the EF-hand mutations described above, we have found that there is an important additional feedback element. The Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 effectively inhibits stimulation of RetGCs by the active form of GCAP-2 (Fig. 3). OS membranes reconstituted with the Ca2+-insensitive GCAP-2 triple mutant E80Q/E116Q/D158N demonstrate high RetGC activity, even at 1.2 µM free Ca2+. Further addition of the mutant protein produces little or no effect on cyclase activity. However, addition of wild type GCAP-2 at 1.2 µM Ca2+ inhibits RetGC activity that was stimulated by the triple mutant (Fig. 3A). Conversely, when OS membranes were initially reconstituted with wild type GCAP-2 at 1.2 µM Ca2+, only basal GC activity was detected. Additional wild type GCAP-2 had no effect, but addition of the constitutively active triple mutant GCAP-2 stimulated cyclase activity (Fig. 3B). In the presence of 1.2 µM free Ca2+, wild type GCAP-2 increased the EC50 for the triple mutant from ~0.5 to ~ 6 µM (not shown). Apparently, the Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 is not only incapable of activating the cyclase itself, it also strongly competes with the active form of GCAP-2. The Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 may also affect basal cyclase activity. At Ca2+ concentrations above 1 µM, basal RetGC activity in washed OS membranes is higher than in the presence of GCAP-2 (Fig. 2D). Based on these results, we propose a model for regulation of RetGC by GCAP-2 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4A model for the transition of GCAP-2 between the two functional states that regulate photoreceptor GC activity. In the light, when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is low, GCAP-2 activates GC. An increase in free Ca2+ concentration as a result of reopening cGMP-gated channels causes the transition of GCAP-2 into its inhibitory Ca2+-loaded form, which also competes with the remaining active form of GCAP-2 to facilitate RetGC inactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) High free Ca2+ (~500 nM) in dark-adapted photoreceptors maintains GCAP-2 in the Ca2+-loaded form incapable of activating GC. After illumination, when the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration is low, GCAP-2 transforms into its active “apo” form and stimulates cGMP resynthesis. When cGMP in the cell is restored and cGMP gated channels open, the free Ca2+ concentration increases and transforms GCAP-2 back into its Ca2+-loaded form. This form no longer activates RetGC, but instead inhibits it. This facilitates the turn-off of cGMP resynthesis. The ability of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 to inhibit GC could also have an additional function such as preventing any spontaneous activation of RetGC in dark-adapted photoreceptors. It is remarkable that GCAP-2 can be either an activator or inhibitor of RetGC. The Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 strongly competes with the active protein (Fig. 3). There are at least two possible mechanisms for such competition. The inhibitory form of GCAP-2 might interact with the target RetGC and thus outcompete the active apo form. Alternatively, the inhibitory effect may reflect oligomerization. For example, the Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 may interact directly with the apo form to form an inactive complex. In other EF-hand proteins, such as calmodulin, not all EF-hands are equally involved in regulating their targets (reviewed by Strynadka et al. (1989)). GCAP-2 is remarkably different in this regard. Our study has focused on the role of EF hands in regulating GCAP-2 activity. As a criteria for functional significance, we compared the ability of GCAP-2 mutants with inactivated EF-hands to stimulate RetGC. Surprisingly, each mutant demonstrates a substantial loss of Ca2+ sensitivity. Our data suggest that each EF hand contributes to the overall regulation of a cyclase-activating domain in GCAP-2. In one model for this regulation, each EF-hand would directly interact with such a domain. Alternatively, only one EF-hand might interact with the cyclase-activating region, but the activity of this EF-hand would depend on cooperative Ca2+ binding involving other EF-hand(s) (Waltersson et al., 27Waltersson Y. Linse Brodin P. Grundstrom T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7866-7871Google Scholar). The loss of cooperativity in Fig. 2B indicates that EF-hands in GCAP-2 may interact. At least two functional EF-hands are required for GCAP-2 to operate within the physiological range of free Ca2+. Introduction of the Ca2+ insensitive GCAP-2 double or triple EF-hand mutants into intact photoreceptors would provide a useful model for studying the physiological role of Ca2+ feedback in photoreceptor recovery and light adaptation. We thank Robert Hughes and Elena Olshevskaya for help in developing a procedure for GCAP-2 expression in E. coli, Irina Ankoudinova for excellent technical assistance, Greg Niemi for performing electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of GCAP-2, and Kenneth Walsh for providing facilities for that analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1997887425,"The Jak family of tyrosine kinases and the Stat family of transcription factors have been implicated in transducing signals from the hematopoietic growth factor receptors. To explore the role played by a member of the Jak family, Jak2, in hematopoietic cell growth signaling, we constructed a chimeric cDNA coding for the Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain linked to the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and expressed the chimera in an interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell line, 32D. When deprived of IL-3, EGF prevented apoptosis of the transfected cells, induced dose-dependent proliferation, and supported long-term growth. EGF stimulation of the transfectants induced dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR/Jak2 chimera and Stat5, which correlated with the EGF dose dependence of cell proliferation. On the other hand, EGF did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of other factors implicated in cytokine receptor signaling, including the IL-3 receptor β subunit, Jak kinases, Stat proteins other than Stat5, Shc, Syp, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results suggest that the activation of Jak2 may be sufficient for transducing a growth signal in hematopoietic cells by activating the Stat5 pathway or previously unidentified signaling pathways. In addition, because EGF induces homodimerization of the EGFR to activate its tyrosine kinase activity, the present study, which shows EGF-dependent activation of the EGFR/Jak2 chimera, implies that Jak2 may also become activated by homodimerization.

The receptors for these hematopoietic growth factors belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily and lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (1Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, recent studies have shown that the activation of all known cytokine receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Jak family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar). The Jak kinases have a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine kinase domain immediately preceded by a kinase-like (or “pseudokinase”) domain (5Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Zurcher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2057-2065Google Scholar). Although no other recognizable protein motifs, such as the Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains, are present, amino-terminal domains, termed the Jak homology (JH)1-5 domains, are conserved in the different family members (6Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Google Scholar). However, the roles of these domains are unknown. The activated Jak kinases induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of a class of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar). Six members of the Stat family, Stat1-Stat6, are presently known. The activated Jak kinases also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytokine receptor cytoplasmic region and thereby recruit the Src homology 2-containing signaling factors to the activated receptors (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar, 7Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic region of the cytokine receptors may play a role in activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which is mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc as well as Syp and their subsequent association with the Sos·Grb2 complex (3Ihle J.N.

Using IL-3-dependent cell lines expressing the transfected Epo receptor (EpoR) or its mutants, we previously showed that Jak2 associates with the membrane proximal region of the EpoR and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and activated upon binding of the receptor with Epo (9Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

Since the EpoR is hypothesized to homodimerize upon binding with Epo (11Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Google Scholar, 12Ohashi H. Maruyama K. Liu Y.C. Yoshimura A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 158-162Google Scholar), it is speculated that Jak2 may become activated by homodimerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation through binding with the EpoR homodimer. The region of the EpoR required for binding with Jak2 was also required for induction of cell proliferation (13Miura O. D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4895-4902Google Scholar, 14Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Google Scholar), thus suggesting that Jak2 may play a critical role in growth signaling from the EpoR. Furthermore, Jak2 also associates with and becomes activated by other cytokine receptors that play important roles in growth regulation of hematopoietic cells, such as the common β subunit of the receptors for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-5 or the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 15Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Google Scholar, 16Quelle F.W.

Jak2 may, therefore, play a particularly important role in the growth control of hematopoietic cells. To explore the role Jak2 plays in the growth signaling from the hematopoietic growth factor receptors and to examine the activation mechanism of Jak2, we constructed a chimeric construct in which the intracellular domain of the EGFR was replaced by the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak2. When expressed in an IL-3-dependent cell line, the chimeric receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated upon EGF binding and transduced an EGF-dependent growth signal. EGF stimulation of the transfectants also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5. However, other signaling molecules known to be involved in cytokine receptor signaling, including other Stats and those involved in activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, did not show any change in tyrosine phosphorylation status after EGF stimulation. These data suggest that Jak2 may become activated by dimerization and transduces a growth signal in hematopoietic cells by activating Stat5 or previously unidentified signaling pathways. A clone of 32D cells, an IL-3-dependent cell line originally isolated from long-term bone marrow cultures, was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, as described previously (14Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Google Scholar). Murine IL-3 and human EGF were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The murine Jak2 cDNA (15Silvennoinen O.

An anti-Jak2 antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1110-1129 mapping at the carboxy terminus of murine Jak2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Stat5b, anti-Tyk2, and anti-Syp antibodies were also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10) and EGFR (LA22), as well as antibodies against Shc, Vav, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (erk1-CT), were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A monoclonal antibody against the mouse IL-3 receptor β subunit (HC) was from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). An anti-Stat1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). To construct an expression plasmid for an EGFR/Jak2 chimera containing the Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain linked to the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the EGFR, a portion of the EGFR cDNA coding for amino acids −24 to 647 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using 5′ and 3′ primers of 5′-CCGGTACCGGAGCGAGCTCTTCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTTCATGCGAAGGCGCGATATCGG-3′, respectively. The primer sequences were designed to add KpnI and EcoRV recognition sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the amplified fragment, and these sites were used for directional subcloning into the KpnI-EcoRV sites of the expression plasmid pcDNA3. The murine Jak2 cDNA was digested with StuI and NheI in the coding and 3′ noncoding regions, respectively. The 1100-base pair StuI-NheI fragment, coding amino acids 796-1129, was then directionally subcloned in frame into the EcoRV-XbaI site of the pcDNA3 clone containing the 5′ portion of EGFR cDNA to create pcD/EG-J2. The structure of pcD/EG-J2 was confirmed by digestion with multiple restriction enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1, the chimera protein EG-J2 coded by pcD/EG-J2 contains the signal peptide, extracellular domain, and transmembrane region of the EGFR followed by an Asp residue resulting from the artificially added EcoRV recognition sequence, the carboxyl-terminal portion of the tyrosine kinase-like domain (JH2) of Jak2, and the entire Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain (JH1). Transfection of pcD/EG-J2 into 32D cells and isolation of clones expressing the EG-J2 chimera were carried out essentially as described previously (13Miura O. D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4895-4902Google Scholar, 14Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Google Scholar). In brief, 32D cells were transfected with 10 µg of pcD/EG-J2 by electroporation and selected in medium containing G418. Three clones, isolated by limiting dilution, were subjected to the subsequent studies. For measurement of the cell number increase, cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105/ml in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with the indicated growth factors. Viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue staining. Alternatively, cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105/ml in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with the indicated concentrations of EGF or with 10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium. After 2 days, the number of viable cells was measured by the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate colorimetric assay (Boehringer-Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To detect apoptosis of cells, low molecular weight chromosomal DNA was isolated essentially as described (21Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were cultured for 16 h in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 without growth factor or supplemented with 10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium or with 100 ng/ml EGF. The cells were then lysed in 600 µl of a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After clarification by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was extracted first with phenol and then with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and subjected to ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA), treated with RNase A (0.6 mg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min, and electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. DNA fragments were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For stimulation with EGF or IL-3, cells were starved for 12 h in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 without IL-3. The cells were then left unstimulated as a negative control or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) or IL-3 (30% WEHI-3 conditioned medium) at 37°C for 5 min. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. For immunoprecipitation, a relevant antibody was added to the lysates, along with protein A-Sepharose beads, and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates, each obtained from 1 × 107 cells, were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with the indicated antibody, and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). Immunoprecipitation of denatured MAP kinases was carried out as described previously (8Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Google Scholar). For reprobing with a different antibody, the membranes were treated at 50°C for 30 min with stripping buffer containing 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7). The results shown are representative of experiments repeated at least twice. An expression plasmid for an EGFR/Jak2 chimera, EG-J2, in which the intracellular domain of the EGFR was replaced by the Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain, as shown in Fig. 1, was constructed as described in “Materials and Methods.” The plasmid was transfected into an IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line, 32D, which does not express endogenous EGFR (22Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. Di F.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in G418-containing medium, and three clones, isolated by limited dilution, were subjected to the subsequent studies. The three clones, named EJ-1, EJ-2, and EJ-3, were first analyzed for expression of the EG-J2 chimera by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The chimeric receptor was first immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of these clones or parental 32D cells with an monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of human EGFR and then immunoblotted with a rabbit antibody (anti-Jak2c) raised against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 1110-1129 at the carboxy terminus of murine Jak2. As shown in Fig. 2, an indistinct band in the 140-kDa range was observed in samples from the three transfected clones but not in that from the parental clone. This band was not detected by reprobing with an anti-Jak2 antibody (anti-Jak2m) against amino acids 758-776 in the JH2 region, which are not contained in EG-J2 (data not shown). These data demonstrated that the three transfectant clones expressed the EG-J2 chimera. The indistinct nature of the chimeric protein most likely reflects the glycosylation of the EGFR extracellular domain, which may also explain the apparent molecular mass of the chimera that is larger than that predicted from its amino acid sequence. Since the three transfectant clones expressed the chimera at comparable levels, a clone, EJ-1, was arbitrarily chosen for further detailed studies. To examine whether EGF stimulation activates the chimeric receptor to transduce a growth signal, EJ-1 cells were cultured in the absence of growth factors or in the presence of EGF or IL-3. Fig. 3A shows growth curves of EJ-1 cells in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 without any growth factor or supplemented with IL-3 or EGF. EJ-1 cells remained growth factor-dependent and thus could not survive in medium not supplemented with any growth factor. The addition of EGF to medium induced proliferation of EJ-1 cells, although the rate of growth in EGF was considerably slower than that in IL-3. It was also confirmed that EGF supported the long-term growth of EJ-1 cells as well as the other two clones (data not shown). EGF dose dependence of proliferation of EJ-1 was next examined by the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate colorimetric assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, EGF-induced proliferation was observed at as low as 1.6 ng/ml of EGF and almost reached a plateau level at 40 ng/ml of EGF. The maximal level of proliferation induced by EGF was, however, about 40% of that induced by IL-3. The other two clones also showed very similar EGF dose-response curves (data not shown). To examine the ability of the EG-J2 chimera to suppress apoptosis, chromosomal DNA fragmentation of EJ-1 cells was then analyzed. The characteristic DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cell death was observed when EJ-1 cells were removed from growth factors for 16 h, as shown in Fig. 3C. When the cells were cultured in the presence of EGF or IL-3, the DNA fragmentation was prevented, thus demonstrating that the EG-J2 chimera also transduced an EGF-dependent antiapoptotic signal. Because the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 has been shown to correlate closely with the tyrosine kinase activity of Jak2 (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar, 9Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Google Scholar, 10Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Google Scholar), we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of EG-J2 in EJ-1 cells. For this purpose, growth factor-starved EJ-1 cells were first stimulated with EGF or IL-3. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of EGFR, anti-Jak2m, or anti-Jak2c. Antiphosphotyrosine blotting of the immunoprecipitates revealed that EGF stimulation, but not IL-3 stimulation, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 140-kDa EG-J2 chimera, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR or anti-Jak2c but not with anti-Jak2m (Fig. 4, upper panel). On the other hand, endogenous 130-kDa Jak2, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2m or anti-Jak2c but not with anti-EGFR, was tyrosine phosphorylated only after IL-3 stimulation. Reprobing of the filter with anti-Jak2c showed equal loading of the immunoprecipitates and confirmed that EG-J2 or Jak2 was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR or anti-Jak2m, respectively, whereas both were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2c. Although the in vitro kinase assay was technically not feasible using anti-Jak2c or anti-EGFR that was used in this study (data not shown), these results strongly suggest that EGF activates the tyrosine kinase activity of EG-J2 but not that of endogenous Jak2 in EJ-1 cells. Because the Jak kinases have been shown to transduce signals to the nucleus by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Stat family of transcription factors, we next examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of various Stat proteins in EGF-stimulated EJ-1 cells. In accordance with a recent report (23Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Google Scholar), antiphosphotyrosine blotting of anti-Stat5a and anti-Stat5b immunoprecipitates showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was induced by IL-3 (Fig. 5A). EGF also induced, albeit to a lesser extent, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b. We also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat6 using specific antibodies. However, none of these Stat proteins was induced to be tyrosine phosphorylated by stimulation with EGF or IL-3 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Inconsistent with our observation, Stat6 was previously reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon IL-3 stimulation in another IL-3-dependent cell line, DA3 (20Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3336-3343Google Scholar). It is speculated that the difference in cell lines examined might have caused the discrepancy. In repeated experiments, EGF never induced detectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Jak2 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, to address the possibility that the EG-J2 chimera may activate other Jak kinases to transduce a mitogenic signal, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Jak1, Jak3, and Tyk2. Antiphosphotyrosine blotting of immunoprecipitates obtained with specific antibodies, however, showed that none of these Jak kinases was tyrosine phosphorylated in EJ-1 cells stimulated with EGF or IL-3 (Fig. 5B). In addition, EGF stimulation of EJ-1 cells failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-3 receptor β subunit (data not shown), thus indicating that the EG-J2 chimera dose not activate the IL-3 receptor. EGF also failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (data not shown), which was previously implicated in Jak2-mediated growth signaling from the EpoR (24Miura O. Miura Y. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 4135-4141Google Scholar). We next examined the factors involved in the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, which is activated by most of the hematopoietic growth factors and may play a role in growth signaling. As shown in Fig. 5C, EGF stimulation of EJ-1 cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of neither Shc nor Syp, which have been implicated in activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by the cytokine receptors (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar, 8Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike IL-3 stimulation, EGF stimulation of EJ-1 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the MAP kinases (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that EG-J2 transduces a growth signal without activating the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Of all the signal transducing factors we examined, EGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of only EG-J2 and Stat5 in EJ-1 cells. To explore the significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins, the EGF dose dependence of tyrosine phosphorylation was then examined. As shown in Fig. 6, the tyrosine phosphorylation of both EG-J2 and Stat5b was faintly detectable at 1 ng/ml of EGF and increased to a near maximal level at 100 ng/ml. The EGF dose dependence of EG-J2 and Stat5b was thus comparable and also correlated with that of cell proliferation. Taken together with the data showing that EG-J2 did not activate the other signaling pathways examined, these results suggest that Stat5 may play a role in transducing a growth signal from the EG-J2 chimera. The critical role of Jak2 in hematopoietic cell growth signaling has been suggested by several studies. We previously showed that the ability of various mutant EpoRs to activate Jak2 closely correlated with the ability to transduce a growth signal (9Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Google Scholar, 10Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Google Scholar). Zhuang et al. (25Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Google Scholar) further showed that a kinase-deficient mutant of Jak2 dominantly suppressed cell proliferation induced by stimulation with Epo or, to a lesser extent, with IL-3. These and other studies (reviewed in Refs. 3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar and 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the activation of Jak2 or other Jaks is required for growth signaling in hematopoietic cells. However, since the cytoplasmic domain of activated cytokine receptors recruits Src homology 2-containing signaling molecules or may couple with tyrosine kinases other than Jaks, it has remained elusive whether the activation of Jak2 is sufficient for transducing a growth signal from the hematopoietic growth factor receptors. In the present study, we have demonstrated that a chimeric receptor in which the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR was replaced by the Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain transduced an EGF-dependent growth signal in an IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line. This result clearly indicates that the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak2 has the ability to transduce a mitogenic signal in hematopoietic cells. The present study thus strongly supports the hypothesis that the growth signaling from the hematopoietic growth factor receptors is mediated by ligand-dependent activation of the Jak kinases. In addition, it is also suggested that the activation of Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity may be sufficient to induce proliferation of hematopoietic cells by activating a growth signaling pathway that does not require the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors. The present study implies that Stat5 may play a role in transducing a growth signal from the activated Jak2 kinase, because of all signaling molecules we have examined, only Stat5 was induced to be tyrosine phosphorylated by the chimeric receptor activated by EGF. Furthermore, the EGF dose dependence of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 correlated with that of cell proliferation, which also suggests a role for Stat5 in growth signaling. Initially identified as a mediator of prolactin-induced transcription of the β-casein gene (26Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar), Stat5 was later shown to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a variety of cytokines, including growth hormone, Epo, IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-5, and thrombopoietin (23Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Google Scholar, 27Azam M. Erdjument B.H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C.

Two murine homologues, Stat5a and Stat5b, sharing 96% amino acid sequence identity, have been identified, although no functional differences have yet been observed between these two molecules (23Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Google Scholar). Stat5 binds a subset of interferon-γ-activated sequence elements that contains a common palindromic element 5′-TTCNNNGAA-3′, which are primarily found in promoters of early-response genes induced by cytokines and interferons. However, a role of Stat5 in growth signaling from cytokine receptors has remained controversial. A previous study showed that the growth signaling from the IL-2 receptor may not require Stat5 activation, because a mutant receptor was reported to trigger cell proliferation without activating Stat5 (30Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Schindler U. Kawahara A. Mori H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Ihle J.N. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5482-5486Google Scholar). On the other hand, Damen et al. (33Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Google Scholar) very recently reported that the activation of Stat5 correlated directly with proliferation in cells expressing several mutant EpoRs. This is in accordance with the present study and provides evidence for the role of Stat5 in growth signaling. However, further studies are obviously required to prove this possibility and to explore target genes of Stat5 that may lead to cell proliferation. The EG-J2 chimera, which selectively activated Stat5 in transfected cells, may prove useful for these studies. In apparent contradiction with our study which implied that Jak2 may tyrosine phosphorylate Stat5 independently of the cytokine receptor cytoplasmic domains, Damen et al. (33Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Google Scholar) reported that tyrosine-343 in the EpoR was required for the activation of Stat5 by Epo stimulation. The requirement for this tyrosine residue, however, was not absolute, since a mutant EpoR lacking all of the intracellular tyrosine residues in fact induced, although weakly, the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat5 when activated by a high concentration of Epo (33Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Google Scholar). Jak2 may thus directly bind and activate Stat5 under certain circumstances. Most of the cytokine receptors activate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or Syp and their association with the Grb2·Sos1 complex (3Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the significance of the activation of Ras/MAP kinase pathway in hematopoietic cell growth signaling has remained to be determined. We showed previously that a mutant EpoR that was severely impaired in its ability to activate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway normally transduced a proliferation signal when expressed in the IL-3-dependent cell line 32D (8Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Google Scholar). In contrast, Kinoshita et al. (34Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2207-2212Google Scholar) showed that IL-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor β subunit mutants lacking the ability to activate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway stimulated DNA synthesis but failed to prevent apoptosis of IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells in serum-free medium (35Evans G.A. Goldsmith M.A. Johnston J.A. Xu W. Weiler S.R. Erwin R. Howard O.M.Z. Abraham R.T. O'Shea J.J. Greene W.C. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28858-28863Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IL-2 receptor mutants defective in Ras activation have recently been shown to confer Ba/F3 cells the ability to grow in response to IL-2 in serum-free medium. Moreover, very recent study by Terada et al. (36Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Google Scholar) demonstrated that a dominant-negative form of Ras did not show any inhibitory effect on IL-3-dependent proliferation, thus indicating that the Ras/MAP kinase pathway is dispensable for IL-3-induced growth stimulation. Results in the present study also indicate that the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway is not required for growth signaling in IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells, because cells expressing the EG-J2 chimera proliferated in response to EGF without showing tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, Syp, or MAP kinases. The present study further demonstrated the ability of the EG-J2 chimera to transduce an antiapoptotic signal, which is consistent with the study of Zhuang et al. (37Zhuang H. Niu Z. He T.C.

Thus, Jak2 may directly play an essential role in transduction of an antiapoptotic signal in hematopoietic cells. EGF induces homodimerization/oligomerization of the EGFR and causes juxtapositioning and transphosphorylation of its tyrosine kinase domain in the intracellular region, thus resulting in the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity (38Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). The present study showed that, when the intracellular domain of the EGFR was replaced with the Jak2 tyrosine kinase domain, EGF also activated the chimeric receptor. It is thus strongly suggested that the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak2 may be activated in a very similar way with that of the EGFR. Since the cytokines that activate Jak2 also induce homo- or heterodimerization of their receptors, it is speculated that Jak2, which physically associates with these receptors, may become activated through juxtapositioning and transphosphorylation. Very recently, two studies were reported in which chimeric receptors containing Jak2 were examined. In the first study, Sakai et al. (39Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Google Scholar) constructed a fusion gene encoding for the extracellular domain of CD16 and the entire Jak2 molecule. By using a recombinant vaccinia virus vector, the fusion protein was transiently expressed at high levels in an IL-3-dependent cell line, BaF3. Activation of the fusion protein by cross-linking with an anti-CD16 antibody induced the protein binding to a interferon-γ-activated sequence oligonucleotide in a manner similar to that seen after IL-3 treatment. Although the Stat protein activated by CD16/Jak2 was not identified, the finding is in accordance with our study showing the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 was induced by EG-J2. Sakai et al. (39Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Google Scholar) also reported that cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins, including Shc and MAP kinases, that are also tyrosine phosphorylated after IL-3 stimulation. This is in contrast to the present study which showed induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of only the chimera and Stat5. It is thus possible that Jak2 domains other than the tyrosine kinase domain, which the CD16/Jak2 chimera contained, might have played a role in induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the various proteins. This possibility is, however, inconsistent with previous studies that demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and MAP kinases by IL-3 or Epo was dependent on the carboxyl-terminal region of their receptors which activated Jak2 phosphorylates (8Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Google Scholar, 40Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies suggested that the role of the amino-terminal domains of Jak2 is to bind with the cytokine receptors (41Zhao Y. Wagner F. Frank S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13814-13818Google Scholar, 42Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14776-14785Google Scholar). Further studies are thus required to explore the significance of these domains in activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. In the second study, Frank et al. (42Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14776-14785Google Scholar) constructed a chimera in which the Jak2 kinase domain replaced the growth hormone receptor cytoplasmic domain. The chimera was shown to mediate growth hormone-induced transcriptional activation of a c-fos enhancer-driven luciferase reporter in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. However, both of these two studies, using the transient expression systems, did not examine the abilities of the chimeras to transduce a growth signal. Therefore, the significance of the signaling events induced by these chimeras in growth signaling was not evaluated. This is in contrast to the present study, which investigated the signaling events from the EGFR/Jak2 chimera possessing the ability to transduce a growth signal. We are grateful to Dr. James N. Ihle for invaluable comments and for the generous gift of the murine Jak2 cDNA and antibodies. We thank Drs. Yoji Ikawa, Atsushi Miyajima, and Hiroshi Wakao for critically reading the manuscript."

Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Google Scholar). All DNA primases, whether from bacteriophage, viral, prokaryotic, or eukaryotic sources, have a potential metal binding site (20Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Google Scholar, 21Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Google Scholar). In the bacteriophage and prokaryotic primases, the potential metal binding site is located in the N terminus of the polypeptide. Two DNA primases, the phage T7 gene 4 primase (21Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Google Scholar) and the E. coli DnaG primase (22Stamford PJ N. Penelope L.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Google Scholar) have been shown to be zinc metalloproteins. It is reasonable to postulate that the zinc motif of primases is important in the recognition of primase sites since the recognition of specific sequences in DNA is known to occur in several other biological processes. For example, the Cys2His2 zinc fingers of the Zif268 (23Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Google Scholar) and the human oncogene product GLI (24Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Google Scholar) make contacts with three bases. An alternative metal-binding motif, the Cys4 zinc motif, is found in many proteins such as the human elongation factor TFIIS and interacts with both DNA and RNA (25Qian X. Gozani S.N. Yoon H.S. Jeon C.J. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9944-9959Google Scholar, 26Argarwal K. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Google Scholar). In one instance, gene 4 proteins with single amino acid substitutions of Ser at each of the four conserved Cys residues cannot support phage DNA replication and growth, and the altered proteins cannot catalyze template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides (21Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the prokaryotic DNA primases recognize a trinucleotide sequence on ssDNA is at present unknown as is the precise role of the zinc motif in this process. One approach to defining the role of the zinc motif in sequence recognition is to construct chimeric primases in which the zinc motif of one is substituted for another. The gene 4 primase of phage T7 has utility in this approach in that it is also a helicase, thus circumventing the dependence of the primase reaction on the presence of a separate specific helicase, as is the case for the phage T4 and E. coli priming systems (12Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2176-2182Google Scholar, 27Liu C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2813-2820Google Scholar, 28Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Gene 4 actually encodes two colinear proteins, a 56-kDa protein and a 63-kDa protein, the former protein arising as the result of an internal translation initiation sequence in the gene 4 transcript (31Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar). The 56-kDa gene 4 protein is a helicase that translocates 5′ to 3′ on ssDNA, a reaction coupled to the hydrolysis of nucleotides, and catalyzes the unwinding of duplex DNA that it encounters (32Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Google Scholar). The 63-kDa gene 4 protein contains an additional 63 amino acids at its N terminus, and it is within this sequence that the zinc motif is located. Consequently, the 63-kDa gene 4 protein has primase activity in addition to the helicase activity found in both molecular mass species of the protein (3Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar, 32Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Google Scholar). Since the 63-kDa protein can provide both primase and helicase activities, it is both necessary and sufficient for productive infection by T7 phage (33Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Google Scholar, 34Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Google Scholar). However, gene 4 protein functions as a hexamer (35Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Google Scholar, 36Egelman E.D. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Google Scholar), and most likely hexamers found in wild-type phage infected cells contain both molecular forms of gene 4 protein (38Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Google Scholar). We recently constructed a T3/T7 chimeric primase in which the zinc motif of the phage T3 primase, a primase whose recognition site is not known, was substituted for the zinc motif of the T7 primase (39Hine A.V. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12327-12331Google Scholar). The recognition sites used by the chimeric primase were identical to those used by the T7 primase, and the chimeric primase was functional in vivo, not a surprising result since T3 and T7 are closely related and their gene 4 proteins highly conserved (40Krüger D. Schroeder C. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 9-51Google Scholar, 41Beck P.J. Gonzalez S. Ward C.L. Molineux I.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 687-701Google Scholar). The ability of the T3/T7 chimeric primase to function both in vivo and in vitro provided the incentive for us to examine chimeric proteins in which the zinc motif of the primase of either phage T4 or E. coli is substituted for that of the phage T7 primase. Since the trinucleotide recognition sequences for these three primases differ from one another, the identity of any functioning chimeric protein will provide definitive information on the role of the zinc motif in sequence recognition and will perhaps yield insight into the importance of specific recognition sequences in a particular replication system. In this report we show that the zinc motifs of both the T4 and E. coli primases can replace the zinc motif of the T7 gene 4 protein to yield a functional primase but that the zinc motif alone does not dictate the sequence specificity.

To construct the chimeric proteins, FspI and SphI recognition sites were introduced into the loop region of the zinc finger motif of pGP4-6G64. The zinc loop region of T7 primase was amplified by PCR with the primers T7-1 (5′-ACATCTGCAGACCACAACGGTTTCC-3′) and T7-2 (5′-CGCATACGTATGCGAATTCTGCGTTGTCACAAGGAATGTGG-3′). PstI, SnaBI, SphI, and FspI recognition sites are indicated by bold letters. Underlined codons correspond to the third and second cysteine residues of the zinc finger motif. The PCR products were digested with PstI and SnaBI restriction enzymes and the resulting fragments were cloned into the PstI and SnaBI site of pGP4-6G64 (pGP4-6G64-C). The loop regions of T4 primase and E. coli primase were amplified from T4 DNA and E. coli genomic DNA using PCR. The primers used for amplification of the T4 fragment were 5′-GGAGATTCAAAAACCGACCAG-3′ and 5′-CAATGAATATTTCCTTCATT-3′ and for the E. coli fragment 5′-AACGAGAAAACCCCGTCCTT-5′ and 5′-CAGTGGTAAAACTGTTTCTC-3′. The amplified fragments were then incubated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove the additional T residue at the 3′-end. The fragments were inserted into the blunt-ended FspI and SphI sites of pGP4-6G64-C. Nucleotide sequences of the resulting plasmids (pGP4-6G64-T4, pGP4-6G64-E. coli) were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGP4-6G64-T4-C-36,39-S, pGP4-6G64-E. coli-C-36,39-S, pGP4-6-T4, pGP4-6-E. coli were constructed by cloning the PstI and SnaBI fragment from pGP4-6G64-T4 or pGP4-6G64-E. coli into pGP4-6G64-C-36,39-S or pGP4-6. Purification of the chimeric primases was performed as described previously by Notarnicola et al. (37Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Google Scholar). Three liters of E. coli cells carrying the appropriate expression plasmids were cultured in 2X YT medium (16 g/liter Bacto-Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) at 37°C until A600 = 1.0 and infected with bacteriophage λCE6 which encode RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were cultured for an additional 3 h and harvested. The cells were suspended in buffer L (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme and 400 µM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 1 h. The suspension was frozen, thawed twice, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The precipitate was reextracted twice with buffer L-II (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl), and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) was combined with the first supernatant. The combined lysate (fraction I) was adjusted to a NaCl concentration of 0.5 M, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of polyethylene glycol 4000 to a final concentration of 10%. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer P (20 mM KPO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 20 mM KCl (fraction II) and loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) column (3.2 cm2× 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer P containing 20 mM KCl. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer P containing 20 mM KCl, and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 to 1000 mM KCl. The amount of gene 4 protein in fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing gene 4 protein were pooled, and MgCl2 and KCl were added to a final concentration of 10 mM and 0.5 M, respectively (fraction III). Fraction III was loaded onto an agarose-hexane-ATP type-3 (Sigma) affinity column (0.8 cm2× 1.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer T (20 mM KPO4 (pH 6.8), 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM KCl) and washed with 2 column volumes of buffer T containing 10 mM MgCl2. The column was eluted with buffer T containing 20 mM EDTA, and the fractions containing gene 4 protein were pooled and dialyzed at 4°C against 20 mM KPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol (fraction IV). The assay for measuring nucleotide hydrolysis by the primases was performed essentially as described previously (37Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Google Scholar). The reactions (20 µl) contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM [α-32P]dTTP, and varying concentrations of primase. After incubation at 30°C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 50 µM M13 ssDNA (nucleotide phosphorous), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 µl of 150 mM EDTA and 10 mM dTDP. The products of the reactions were separated by CEL 300 polyethyleneimine/UV thin layer chromatography (Brinkmann Instrument Inc.), and the amount of radioactivity in the dTDP spot was determined by scintillation counting. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis by DNA primase was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity labeled oligoribonucleotide synthesized after electrophoretic separation (3Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar). The reaction (10 µl) contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.6 mM dTTP, 21 nM M13 ssDNA or 100 nM synthetic oligonucleotides, and 320 nM (monomer) primase. After incubation at 20°C for 10 min in the absence of rNTPs, 0.3 mM rNTPs at final concentration were added, incubated at 37°C for 60 min, and processed as described previously (3Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar). Analysis of primase stimulation of DNA synthesis on ssDNA by T7 DNA polymerase was performed using a modification of the method described previously (43Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Google Scholar). The reactions (20 µl) contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.3 mM rNTP, 0.3 mM dTTP, 0.3 mM [α-32P]dTTP, 5 nM T7 polymerase, 10 nM M13 ssDNA, and varying concentrations of primases for 20 min at 37°C. After incubation the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 µl of 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and spotted onto DE81 filters. The filters were washed with 0.3 M ammonium formate (pH 8.0) four times and then washed with 95% ethanol once. After drying, the radioactivity retained on the filter was determined by scintillation counting. The DNA primases of phage T7, phage T4, and E. coli all contain a Cys4-type zinc motif, and each primase recognizes a different trinucleotide sequence (see Introduction). We have replaced the zinc motif of the T7 63-kDa gene 4 primase with those found in the T4 gene 61 primase and the E. coli DnaG primase in order to examine the properties of the resulting chimeric proteins in vivo and in vitro. The expression plasmids used to produce the chimeric primases were constructed by replacing the DNA sequence encoding a 15-amino acid sequence of the T7 primase with the corresponding regions derived from T4 gene 61 or E. coli DnaG (Fig. 1). The N-terminal fragments derived from T4 and E. coli encode 24 or 17 amino acids, respectively, and constitute the zinc motifs of these primases. The T4 and E. coli DNA fragments were obtained by PCR amplification of the appropriate sequences from T4 and E. coli DNA. The resulting DNA fragments were then inserted into the T7 gene 4 expression vector pGP4-6G64 replacing a segment of T7 gene 4 encoding a 15 amino acid residue found in the loop region of the zinc motif. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequences, derived from the DNA sequence, of the chimeric primases are shown in Fig. 1. In order to determine if the chimeric primases function in vivo, plating efficiencies of T7 phage lacking gene 4 (T7 Δ4-1) were compared on E. coli cells containing the expression vectors for T7, T4/T7, or E. coli/T7 chimeric proteins (Table I). T7 Δ4-1 cannot grow on E. coli in the absence of exogenous gene 4. In agreement with earlier studies (33Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Google Scholar, 34Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Google Scholar) E. coli cells containing plasmids encoding both the 56- and 63-kDa gene 4 protein or the 63-kDa gene 4 protein alone support the growth of T7 Δ4-1. However, a plasmid encoding the 56-kDa helicase does so less efficiently (0.8 × 103 p.f.u./ml). A mechanism allowing T7 Δ4-1 to grow at all in cells expressing only the 56-kDa helicase is presently unknown. The essential function of the zinc motif is illustrated by the reduction of growth of T7 Δ4-1 in cells harboring a plasmid that encodes a 63-kDa gene 4 protein in which two of the four cysteines of the zinc motif have been replaced with serine, a finding in agreement with earlier studies (21Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Google Scholar).Table I.Plating efficiencies of bacteriophage T7 Δ4-1 on the E. coli C600 strains harboring various expression plasmidsGene 4 proteinsaPlasmid-encoded wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gene 4 proteins expressed in the E. coli C600 cells.T7 Δ4-1bThe mutant T7 bacteriophage which lack the both of gene 4 proteins.Wild-type T7p.f.u./mlNo protein<1cPlaque-forming units on E. coli C600 cells with plasmids encoding the indicated gene 4 proteins.1.0 × 1010T7 helicase0.8 × 1030.8 × 1010T7 primase + T7 helicase0.8 × 1090.7 × 1010T7 primase1.0 × 1090.8 × 1010T7 primase C-36,39-S1.0 × 1031.1 × 1010T4/T7 primase2.4 × 1051.0 × 1010E. coli/T7 primase1.8 × 1031.0 × 1010a Plasmid-encoded wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gene 4 proteins expressed in the E. coli C600 cells.b The mutant T7 bacteriophage which lack the both of gene 4 proteins.c Plaque-forming units on E. coli C600 cells with plasmids encoding the indicated gene 4 proteins. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I a plasmid expressing the chimeric protein in which the zinc motif of the T4 primase is substituted for that of the gene 4 primase can support the growth of T7 Δ4-1 phage, albeit at a lower efficiency (2.4 × 105 p.f.u./ml). On the other hand, the E. coli/T7 chimeric primase appears to support the growth of T7 Δ4-1 at an efficiency similar to that observed with the plasmid expressing only the 56-kDa helicase (1.8 × 103 p.f.u./ml). In order to determine unequivocally if the zinc motifs of the T4 and E. coli primases of the chimeric primases can support T7 growth, we replaced Cys-36 and Cys-39 in each primases with serine, an alternation that inactivates T7 primase (Table I). As shown in Table II the mutation in the plasmids encoding each of the chimeric proteins reduced greatly the ability of the chimeric protein to support the growth of T7 Δ4-1. These results show that the chimeric primases can function in vivo, although at greatly reduced efficiency. The apparent inability of the E. coli/T7 primase to support T7 Δ4-1 growth (Table I) is most likely due to our finding that the chimeric protein has significantly lower dTTPase activity for translocation (see below). Hence, a direct comparison between T7 Δ4-1 growth on cells expressing the T7 helicase alone and the chimeric primase can not be made.Table II.Plating efficiencies of bacteriophage T7 Δ4-1 on the E. coli C600 strains harboring various expression plasmidsGene 4 proteinsaPlasmid-encoded chimeric and mutant chimeric gene 4 proteins expressed in the E. coli C600 cells.T7 Δ4-1p.f.u./mlT4/T7 primase2.0 × 105T4/T7 primase C-36,39-S2.0 × 101E. coli/T7 primase1.5 × 103E. coli/T7 primase C-36,39-S1.0 × 101a Plasmid-encoded chimeric and mutant chimeric gene 4 proteins expressed in the E. coli C600 cells. Open table in a new tab The reduced ability of the T4/T7 and E. coli/T7 chimeric primase to support T7 growth could arise from several defects in the proteins. One simple interpretation is that the conformation of the zinc motif in the protein is altered in such a way that its interaction with the primase recognition sites is weakened. More interesting would be a requirement for recognition of the T7 primase recognition sequence 3′-CTG-5′ for efficient DNA replication, a sequence different from that recognized by the T4 or E. coli primases. Alternately, the defect could reside in the helicase portion of the protein, limiting translocation to primase sites and perhaps even reducing helicase activity. Finally the chimeric protein could be defective in its interaction with other replication proteins such as the T7 DNA polymerase or gene 2.5 protein. In order to explore these possibilities we have purified the two chimeric proteins and characterized them biochemically. The two chimeric proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity from cells expressing each of the recombinant genes (Fig. 2). The purification procedure was essentially that previously described for wild-type gene 4 protein with the exception that the cell pellet was extracted with high salt since the overexpressed chimeric proteins were less soluble than the wild-type gene 4 proteins. The ability of the two chimeric primases to function even to a limited extent in vivo suggests that they catalyze the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides that can be used as primers by T7 DNA polymerase. The oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay provides a direct analysis of RNA primer synthesis (3Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Google Scholar, 10Scherzinger S. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the wild-type gene 4 primase catalyzed the synthesis of di-, tri-, and tetraribonucleotides on M13 DNA. In this assay, triphosphate was removed from 5′-termini by phosphatase, and the resulting products were separated by denaturing PAGE. Oligoribonucleotide products were visualized by [α-32P]NTP incorporation and autoradiography. Both of the chimeric primases catalyzed the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides, but the amount of protein required to detect oligoribonucleotides was considerably more than that required for wild-type gene 4 protein (Fig. 3). Under the condition of this assay the T4/T7 chimeric primase was 2.5-fold more active than the E. coli/T7 primase. However, the amounts of products with 320 nM T4/T7 primase and E. coli/T7 primase were only 0.78 and 0.29%, respectively, of that obtained with wild-type gene 4 protein, as measured by a Bio-Imaging analyzer. In this assay trimers and tetramers were not detected, but as will be shown below, these products are synthesized under appropriate conditions. The 63-kDa gene 4 primase, like the 56-kDa gene 4 protein, catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleotides, a reaction stimulated greatly by the presence of ssDNA (44Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1525-1529Google Scholar). The energy of nucleotide hydrolysis drives the unidirectional translocation of the protein on ssDNA. As shown in Fig. 4A the two chimeric proteins catalyzed the hydrolysis of dTTP, the nucleotide preferred by T7 gene 4 protein, in the absence of ssDNA at rates similar to those catalyzed by the wild-type T7 primase. However, the hydrolysis of dTTP catalyzed by the two chimeric proteins was not stimulated by ssDNA to the same extent as that observed with the wild-type T7 primase (Fig. 4B). Whereas the rate of hydrolysis catalyzed by the wild-type T7 primase was stimulated approximately 38-fold by ssDNA, the T4/T7 and E. coli/T7 chimeric primases were stimulated only 16- and 5-fold, respectively. The reduced dTTPase activity observed with the chimeric proteins in the presence of ssDNA indicates either a defect in the binding of the proteins to ssDNA, a reacti"

A recombinant vaccinia virus, vBGN4 encoding the mature biglycan core protein as a polyhistidine fusion protein under control of the T7 phage promoter was expressed in HT-1080 cells and UMR106 cells. The structure of the recombinant biglycan secreted by these cells was defined by analyzing molecules labeled in the presence of [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, and [35S]methionine. Glycoforms of biglycan were separated by imidazole gradient elution, under non-denaturing conditions, and comprised: a large proteoglycan form substituted with two chondroitin sulfate chains of molecular mass ~ 34 kDa (HT-1080 cells) or ~40 kDa (UMR106 cells); a small proteoglycan form substituted with two chondroitin sulfate chains with a median molecular mass ~ 28 kDa; and a core protein form secreted devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains. All the glycoforms were substituted with two N-linked oligosaccharides, and the disaccharide composition of the two glycosaminoglycan populations were identical. Approximately 70% of the recombinant biglycan secreted by HT-1080 cells was substituted with chondroitin sulfate chains, whereas about 50% of the biglycan expressed by UMR106 cells was substituted with chondroitin sulfate chains. Infection with vBGN4 in both HT-1080 and UMR106 cells resulted in the production of approximately 10 mg of biglycan/109 cells per 24 h. The native recombinant biglycan was shown to bind to collagen type V and the complement protein, C1q. However, when the secondary structure of recombinant biglycan was disrupted by exposure to 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, the affinity for collagen type V was dramatically reduced.

https://openalex.org/W2058276994,"A unique feature of the insulin receptor is that it is dimeric in the absence of ligand. Dimerization of two adjacent transmembrane domain (TMD) α helices has been shown to be critical in receptor kinase activation. Moreover, previous work has suggested that the TMD is involved in stabilizing the high-affinity binding site; soluble receptors expressed after simple truncation at the ectodomain-TMD junction have reduced affinity for insulin. To further examine this issue, we have replaced the TMD and intracellular domain of the soluble human insulin receptor (HIRs) with constant domains from immunoglobulin Fc and λ subunits (HIRs-Fc and HIRs-λ). Studies of receptor biosynthesis and binding characteristics were performed following transient transfection of receptor cDNAs into human embryonal kidney 293 cells. Each hybrid receptor was initially synthesized as a single chain proreceptor, followed by cleavage into α- and β-Fc or β-λ subunits. The majority of secreted protein appeared in the cell medium as fully processed heterotetramer. Fc fragments released from HIRs-Fc by papain digestion and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were dimeric. Furthermore, dissociation constants for both chimeras were similar to those for the full-length holoreceptor (wild-type receptor, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 2 nM; HIRs-Fc, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 40 nM; and HIRs-λ, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 5 nM).

To further examine this issue, we have replaced the TMD and intracellular domain of the soluble human insulin receptor (HIRs) with constant domains from immunoglobulin Fc and λ subunits (HIRs-Fc and HIRs-λ). Studies of receptor biosynthesis and binding characteristics were performed following transient transfection of receptor cDNAs into human embryonal kidney 293 cells. Each hybrid receptor was initially synthesized as a single chain proreceptor, followed by cleavage into α- and β-Fc or β-λ subunits. The majority of secreted protein appeared in the cell medium as fully processed heterotetramer. Fc fragments released from HIRs-Fc by papain digestion and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were dimeric. Furthermore, dissociation constants for both chimeras were similar to those for the full-length holoreceptor (wild-type receptor, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 2 nM; HIRs-Fc, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 40 nM; and HIRs-λ, Kd1 = 200 pM and Kd2 = 5 nM). These results extend previous observations that dimerization of the membrane-proximal ectodomain is necessary to maintain an intact high-affinity insulin-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1977396882,"Phosducin (Pd) is a widely expressed phosphoprotein that regulates G-protein (G) signaling. Unphosphorylated Pd binds to Gβγ subunits and blocks their interaction with Gα. This binding sequesters Gβγ and inhibits both receptor-mediated activation of Gα and direct interactions between Gβγ and effector enzymes. When phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Pd does not affect these functions of Gβγ. To further understand the role of Pd in regulating G-protein signaling in retinal rod photoreceptor cells, we have measured the abundance of Pd in rods and examined factors that control the rate of Pd phosphorylation. Pd is expressed at a copy number comparable to that for the rod G-protein, transducin (Gt). The ratio of rhodopsin (Rho) to Pd is 15.5 ± 3.5 to 1. The rate of Pd phosphorylation in rod outer segment preparations was dependent on [cAMP]. K1/2 for cAMP was 0.56 ± 0.09 µM, and the maximal rate of phosphorylation was ~500 pmol PO4 incorporated/min/nmol Rho. In the presence of Gtβγ this rate was decreased ~50-fold. From these data, one can estimate a t1/2 of ~3 min for the rephosphorylation of Pd in rods during the recovery period after a light response. This relatively slow rephosphorylation of the Pd·Gtβγ complex may provide a period of molecular memory in which sensitivity to further light stimuli is reduced as a result of sequestration of Gtβγ by Pd.

FcεRI is a tetrameric complex composed of an α-chain, a β-chain, and a dimeric γ-chain. The extracellular portion of the α-chain (α-t) is sufficient for the binding of IgE. The Fc portion of IgE contains two copies of the FcεRI binding sites. In contrast, the binding stoichiometry is 1:1. Previously, it was hypothesized that the binding of FcεRI to IgE results in a conformational change in IgE that precludes the binding of a second molecule (Presta, L., Shields, R., O'Connel, L., Lahr, S., Porter, J., Gorman, C., and Jardieu, P.

Binding experiments show that when IgE interacts with α-t there is a 15-26% decrease of the negative ellipticity at 217 nm. Together, the absence of an α-helix element in α-t and the small contribution of α-t to the spectra of the complex indicate that upon binding, a major conformational rearrangement must occur on IgE.

https://openalex.org/W2157738560,"Human progesterone receptor (PR) in T47D breast cancer cells is phosphorylated on nine different serine residues; three are hormone-inducible (Ser<sup>102</sup>, Ser<sup>294</sup>, and Ser<sup>345</sup>), while others are basal but hormone-stimulated. In the present study, we have compared the phosphorylation state of native and recombinant PR expressed in a baculovirus insect cell system. Stoichiometric measurements showed that unliganded native PR in T47D cells was approximately 50% phosphorylated (≈4 phosphates/PR) and became essentially 100% phosphorylated (≈9 phosphates/PR) when bound to hormone. Unliganded PR expressed in Sf9 insect cells was phosphorylated with a similar stoichiometry (≈3 phosphates/PR), but the phosphate content did not change with hormone addition. Site-specific phosphorylation analyzed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and manual peptide sequencing revealed that expressed PR bound to hormone in the Sf9 insect cells was phosphorylated on all the same sites as hormone-treated PR in T47D cells. Only minor differences were detected in the relative proportion of three sites (two basal sites and Ser<sup>345</sup>) and phosphorylation did not occur on alternate sites. Interestingly, unliganded baculovirus-expressed PR was constitutively phosphorylated on hormone inducible sites and was phosphorylated on basal sites to the same extent as hormone treated PR. Thus, in the absence of hormone, the phosphorylation state of baculovirus-expressed PR resembled that of the hyperphosphorylated native PR. In contrast to native PR, the expressed receptor in cytosols of Sf9 cells did not form a large oligomeric complex suggesting that hyperphosphorylation may be due to dissociation of the complex in the absence of hormone. This study demonstrating phosphorylation on correct sites with a stoichiometry similar to that of native PR indicates that overexpressed PR in the baculovirus system is suitable for <i>in vitro</i> structure/function studies."

https://openalex.org/W2016422606,"Factor-dependent transcription termination during synthesis of vaccinia early mRNAs occurs at heterogeneous sites downstream of a UUUUUNU signal in the nascent transcript. The choice of termination site is flexible and is determined by a kinetic balance between nascent chain elongation and the transmission of the RNA signal to the polymerase. To eliminate ongoing elongation as a variable, we have established a system to study transcript release by purified ternary complexes halted at a defined template position 50-nucleotides 3' of the first U residue of the termination signal. Release of the nascent RNA depends on the vaccinia termination factor (VTF) and an ATP cofactor. Transcript release is blocked by BrUMP substitution within the termination signal of the nascent RNA. In these respects, the release reaction faithfully mimics the properties of the termination event. We demonstrate that ternary complexes are refractory to VTF-mediated transcript release when the first U of the UUUUUNU signal is situated 20 nucleotides from the growing point of the nascent chain. Ribonuclease footprinting of the arrested ternary complexes defines a nascent RNA binding site on the polymerase elongation complex that encompasses a 16-21 nucleotide RNA segment extending proximally from the 3' end of the chain. We surmise that access of VTF to the signal sequence is prevented when UUUUUNU is bound within the nascent RNA binding site. Hence, physical not kinetic constraints determine the minimal distance between the signal and potential sites of 3' end formation."

Because the proofreading mechanisms that remove 3′-F-ara-AMP from DNA represent a possible means of resistance to the drug, the present study investigated the excision of incorporated F-ara-AMP from DNA by the 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase ε from human leukemia CEM cells. Using the drug-containing and normal deoxynucleotide oligomers (21-base) annealed to M13mp18(+) DNA as the excision substrates, we demonstrated that DNA polymerase ε was unable to effectively remove F-ara-AMP from the 3′-end of the oligomer. However, 3′-terminal dAMP and subsequently other deoxynucleotides were readily excised from DNA in a distributive fashion. Kinetic evaluation demonstrated that although DNA polymerase ε has a higher affinity for F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA (Km = 7.1 pM) than for dAMP-terminated DNA of otherwise identical sequence (Km = 265 pM), excision of F-ara-AMP proceeded at a substantially slower rate (Vmax = 0.053 pmol/min/mg) than for 3′-terminal dAMP (Vmax = 1.96 pmol/min/mg). When the 3′-5′ phosphodiester bond between F-ara-AMP at the 3′-terminus and the adjacent normal deoxynucleotide was cleaved by DNA polymerase ε, the reaction products appeared to remain associated with the enzyme but without the formation of a covalent bond. No further excision of the remaining oligomers was observed after the addition of fresh DNA polymerase ε to the reaction. Furthermore, the addition of DNA polymerase α and deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the excision reaction failed to extend the oligomers. After DNA polymerase ε had been incubated with 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer for 10 min, the enzyme was no longer able to excise 3′-terminal dAMP from a freshly added normal 21-mer annealed to M13mp18(+) template.

Because the toxicity of many anticancer and antiviral nucleotide analogues is expressed only after their incorporation into nascent DNA chains, such analogues may also be recognized as substrates for 3′→ 5′ exonucleases. Thus, the ability of exonucleases to excise antimetabolites may serve as a drug resistance mechanism. As a corollary, incorporated analogues that resist excision removal are predicted to be highly cytotoxic. Inasmuch as most of the incorporated F-ara-AMP residues are located at the 3′-termini of the DNA strands (10Huang P. Chubb S. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16617-16625Google Scholar), 3′-terminal F-ara-AMP might well be excised by the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activities associated with DNA polymerases. Indeed, preliminary studies indicated limited excision of 3′-terminal F-ara-AMP by pol ε (10Huang P. Chubb S. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16617-16625Google Scholar). In the present study, we used an in vitro DNA excision assay to quantitatively investigate the ability of 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity of human DNA pol ε to remove F-ara-AMP from the 3′-end of DNA. For comparison, excision of normal nucleotides was also evaluated. Our results demonstrated that DNA pol ε bound to F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA with high affinity but excised the analogue from DNA at a low velocity. Once the phosphodiester bond between the 3′-F-ara-AMP and its adjacent nucleotide was cleaved by pol ε, the excision products appeared to remain associated with the enzyme, inactivating the exonuclease and preventing further exonucleolytic degradation or polymerization of the DNA products. F-ara-A was kindly provided by Dr. V. L. Narayanan (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, National Institutes of Health). F-ara-ATP was synthesized as described previously (32Novotony L. Plunkett W. Townsend L.B. Tipson R.S. Nucleic Acid Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 337-340Google Scholar). The M13mp18(+) single-stranded DNA and the 17-mer M13 universal sequencing primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′), complementary to sites 6290-6306 of M13mp18(+) DNA, were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Synthetic oligonucleotide 21-mer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCA-3′), complementary to sites 6286-6306 of M13mp18(+) DNA, was purchased from Genosys (Woodlands, TX). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 4500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). T4 polynucleotide kinase, polyacrylamide, and bis-methyl-acrylamide were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Human DNA polymerase α (pol α), and DNA pol ε were prepared from human CCRF-CEM cells as described previously (10Huang P. Chubb S. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16617-16625Google Scholar). The specific activities of pol α and pol ε were 11,936 and 2,440 units/mg, respectively. One unit is the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTTP into acid-insoluble material in 1 h at 37°C. The 17-mer M13 sequencing primer was labeled at its 5′-terminus with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the complementary site of the M13mp18(+) single-stranded DNA template as described previously (10Huang P. Chubb S. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16617-16625Google Scholar). The labeled 17-mer primer/M13mp18 template was incubated with pol α and 100 µM each of dCTP, dGTP, and 10 µM F-ara-ATP at 37°C for 30 min in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM NaCl. F-ara-ATP was incorporated into the primer at site 21 opposite the T site of the M13mp18 template. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The 21-mer band containing 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer was excised from the gel and recovered from the gel slice as described previously (10Huang P. Chubb S. Plunkett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16617-16625Google Scholar). The purified 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer was annealed to M13mp18(+) DNA to generate the following DNA hybrid, 21−mer5′[32P]GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCF3′−−−−−−−−CATTTTGCTGCCGGTCACGGTTCGAACGTACGGA– where Findicates the incorporated F-ara-AMP at the 3′-end of the 21-mer. To assure that all 32P-labeled oligomers were hybridized to the complementary M13mp18(+) DNA strands, a ratio of 1 oligomer to 10 copies of M13 DNA was used (see below). A 21-base oligomer with nucleotide sequence identical to the 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer except that dAMP was substituted for 3′-F-ara-AMP was chemically synthesized by Genosys. The normal 21-mer and the 17-mer M13 sequencing primer were separately labeled at the 5′-ends with [γ-32P]ATP and purified by polyacrylamide sequencing gels as described above. The 32P-labeled normal oligomers were annealed to the M13mp18(+) DNA to produce the following DNA hybrid substrates for excision assay by pol ε. 21−mer5′[32P]GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCA3′CATTTTGCTGCCGGTCACGGTTCGAACGTACGGA– 17-mar5′[32P]GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT3′CATTTTGCTGCCGGTCACGGTTCGAACGTACGGA– To assure that all 32P-labeled oligomers were hybridized to the complementary M13mp18(+) DNA strands, a ratio of 1 oligomer to 10 copies of M13 DNA was used. Under these conditions, no single-stranded 32P-labeled oligomer was present in the mixture as evidenced by a complete conversion of all primers to high molecular weight DNA products when the mixtures were incubated with DNA pol α in the presence of the four dNTPs. The normal and F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA hybrids described above were used as the substrates for excision by pol ε. The reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2 unit of DNA polymerase ε, and the indicated concentration of DNA substrates. The reactions were carried out at 37°C for the indicated times up to 40 min. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 10 or 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. After autoradiography, the radioactivity associated with each DNA band in the gels was quantitated by a Betascope 603 blot analyzer under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Betagen Corporation, Waltham, MA). The normal and F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA hybrids described above were used as the substrates for polymerization by pol ε or pol α. The reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM NaCl, 20 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 µM each of 4 dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, the indicated concentration of DNA substrates, pol ε, and/or pol α. The reactions were carried out at 37°C for the indicated times, and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. After autoradiography, the radioactivity in the gels was quantitated by a blot analyzer as described above. To determine the apparent Km and Vmax values for the excision of normal and F-ara-AMP-3′-terminated DNA by pol ε, various concentrations of the respective DNA constructs were incubated with pol ε in 10-µl excision reaction mixtures (see above) at 37°C for 10 min. Under these conditions, the reaction rate remained linear for at least 15 min. The reaction products were then analyzed and quantitated as described above. The sum of radioactivity associated with all excision products (20-mer and less) in each lane was used to calculate the reaction rate and then plotted against the respective DNA substrate concentrations. The apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated by the Michaelis-Menten equation with a computer-assisted program (33Chou J. Chou T. Dose-Effect Analysis with the Microcomputer. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 5Google Scholar). To determine the Ki value of 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA in inhibiting the excision of normal oligomer/M13mp18 DNA by pol ε, various concentrations of normal 32P-labeled DNA substrates were incubated with pol ε for 15 min in the presence of different fixed concentrations of nonradioactive 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA. Nonradioactive normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA were used in parallel as controls. The reaction products were analyzed and quantitated as described above, and the Ki value was calculated by the Michaelis-Menten equation with a computer-assisted program (33Chou J. Chou T. Dose-Effect Analysis with the Microcomputer. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 5Google Scholar). The following normal or F-ara-AMP-containing oligomers were used as the substrates for binding to pol ε. Normal5′[32P]GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGTGTGTA3′CATTTTGCTGCCGGTCACACACATGCACACA–F-ara-A5′[32P]GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGTGTGTF3′CATTTTGCTGCCGGTCACACACATGCACACA– The oligomers (50 pg/20-µl reaction mixture) were separately incubated with pol ε for 10 min at 37°C and then an additional 10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 5-fold competing DNA (nonradioactive normal oligomer, 250 pg/20 µl). The reaction products were then separated by electrophoresis through a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at constant power of 25 W for 100 min. Autoradiography and Betascope analysis of the radioactivity were carried out after the gels were dried under vacuum at 60°C. An in vitro DNA excision assay was used to investigate the ability of 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity associated with DNA polymerase ε to remove the incorporated F-ara-AMP residues from the 3′-ends of DNA. A 21-base oligomer with F-ara-AMP at its 3′-end annealed to the complementary region of M13mp18(+) DNA was used as the substrate for excision by pol ε. The same amount of normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA hybrid of identical sequence with dAMP at the 3′-end of the oligomer was used for comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (top panel), pol ε was able to excise normal nucleotides from the 3′-end of the normal 21-mer in a nonprocessive manner. More than 10 bands of excision products with different lengths (20-mer and less) were revealed (lanes 9-14). The excision was time-dependent, and a substantial amount of final excision products (mononucleotides at the bottom of the gel) accumulated during a 25-40-min incubation (lanes 13 and 14). When a normal 17-mer/M13mp18 DNA was the substrate for pol ε, the excision pattern was similar to that of the normal 21-mer/M13mp18 hybrid (data not shown). However, when the 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer DNA hybrid was the substrate, pol ε was much less effective in removing F-ara-AMP from the 3′-end of the oligomer (Fig. 1, lanes 2-7). Less than 10% of the 3′-terminal F-ara-AMP was removed during a 40-min incubation. After removal of 3′-F-ara-AMP from site 21, no significant amount of further excision of the 20-mer product was evident. When the incubation time was prolonged to 25-40 min, a barely visible faint band appeared at the 19-mer position (lanes 6 and 7). No mononucleotide was produced even at the longest incubation time (lane 7). The radioactivity associated with each DNA band was then quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Determination of the excision velocity indicated that the rate of 3′-terminal dAMP removal by pol ε was much greater than that of excising 3′-F-ara-AMP (Fig. 1, bottom panel). For example, 0.2 unit of pol ε removed more than 30% of the deoxynucleotides in 5 min, whereas less than 5% of the terminal F-ara-AMP was excised during the same period. To determine the excision kinetics of normal nucleotides and F-ara-AMP from DNA by pol ε, various concentrations of 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18(+) or normal 21-mer/M13mp18(+) DNA were incubated with pol ε for 10 min, during which period the excision rates remained linear. The reaction products were quantitated, and the apparent Km and Vmax values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As summarized in Table I, the apparent Km of pol ε for F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA was approximately 37-fold less than that for the normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA hybrid, indicating that pol ε has a higher binding affinity to F-ara-AMP-containing DNA than to normal DNA. However, the Vmax of F-ara-AMP excision was substantially less than the Vmax of the enzyme for oligonucleotides terminated by dAMP, indicating that catalysis of excision was the rate-limiting step in removal of F-ara-AMP from the 3′-end of the oligomer. The kinetic parameters for a normal 17-base oligomer/M13mp18 DNA were similar to that of the normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA (Table I).Table IKinetics of 3′-terminal F-ara-AMP and dAMP excision by 3′→ 5′ exonuclease associated with pol ϵDNA substrateKmVmaxpMpmol/min/mgF-ara-AMP-21-mer7 ± 20.053 ± 0.01Normal 21-mer265 ± 321.96 ± 0.16Normal 17-mer242 ± 270.79 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab In addition to the difference in the reaction kinetics, the excision pattern of the 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer by pol ε was different from that of the normal oligomer. When 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA was used as the excision substrate, a band at the 20-nucleotide position was the predominant reaction product (Fig. 1, lanes 2-7). No significant amount of further excision products were detected below the 20-nucleotide band. This indicates that after pol ε removed F-ara-AMP at the 3′-end of the oligomer, the enzyme was not able to further excise normal nucleotides from the 20-base oligomer and, perhaps, protected the 20-mer product from further exonucleolytic degradation. As the incubation time was prolonged, only a barely visible band at the 19-mer position was revealed (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, pol ε removed nucleotides consecutively from the normal oligomer (Fig. 1A, lanes 9-14). These observations were further confirmed by scanning the radioactivity profiles associated with each DNA band by a Betascope blot analyzer. In the 25-min reaction, at least 12 excision products, with sizes decreasing in increments of a single nucleotide, were revealed from the normal 21-mer/M13mp18 substrate (data not shown). When 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA was incubated with pol ε for the same time, only a relatively small excision product peak corresponding to 20-mer was detected, which reflected the slow cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between 3′-F-ara-AMP and the adjacent nucleotide at position 20. A much smaller but identifiable 19-mer peak was also revealed. Thereafter, no peaks of smaller sizes were detected. Thus, it appears that after F-ara-AMP was excised, the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity of pol ε was greatly decreased relative to its utilization of the 20-mer/M13mp18 oligomer. Further experiments were designed to investigate the mechanism by which the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity of pol ε was inactivated after removal of F-ara-AMP from the 3′-end of the DNA. In sequential reaction experiments, pol ε was first incubated with nonradioactive F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA for 10 min, and then the 32P-labeled normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA was added to the reaction for an additional 20 min. Preincubation of pol ε with 81 pM or 162 pM of the nonradioactive 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA resulted in a decrease in exonuclease activity by 69 and 78%, respectively, against the 32P-labeled normal substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, preincubation of pol ε with the same concentrations of nonradioactive normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA did not significantly diminish the exonuclease activity against labeled normal substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). To determine the kinetics of inhibition by 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA, various concentrations of 32P-labeled normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA substrates were incubated with pol ε in the presence of different fixed concentrations of nonradioactive analogue-terminated or normal DNA hybrids. The dose effect of the two DNA hybrids on the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity of pol ε is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Only the F-ara-AMP-containing DNA showed inhibitory activity. When the velocity of the reaction was plotted as the function of substrate (32P-labeled normal 21-mer/M13mp18 DNA) concentrations in a double reciprocal plot (Fig. 3B), the lines representing reactions without and with different fixed concentrations of the inhibitor (nonradioactive 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18) converged at the ordinate, indicating that the nature of this inhibition was most likely competitive. In fact, computer analysis (33Chou J. Chou T. Dose-Effect Analysis with the Microcomputer. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 5Google Scholar) of the plots revealed a competitive inhibition with a Ki value of 7.5 pM. This is consistent with the high affinity of pol ε for F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA as evidenced by its low Km for excision (7 pM, Table I). Because the nonradioactive normal DNA (3-162 pM) did not inhibit the enzyme activity, the loss of excision activity observed in samples preincubated with F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA was not simply due to competition between the nonradioactive DNA (3-162 pM) and the 32P-labeled DNA substrate (1400 pM). Rather, we postulated that when pol ε was preincubated with 3′-F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA, the enzyme remained associated with the F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA with high affinity and was effectively trapped by the reaction products after the phosphodiester bond between 3′-F-ara-AMP and the adjacent nucleotide (position 20) was cleaved. This hypothesis predicts that the 3′-end of the oligomer (20-mer) would be blocked by pol ε after cleavage of F-ara-AMP. Two different approaches were taken to test this postulate. In the first experiment, pol ε was incubated with 32P-labeled F-ara-AMP-21-mer/M13mp18 DNA for 15 min to generate the 20-base excision product. Our hypothesis predicts that if the enzyme remained bound to DNA, the 3′-end of the 20-mer would not be accessible for further excision by freshly added pol ε. Indeed, the further addition of pol ε to reactions containing F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA preincubated with pol ε led to the accumulation of more 20-base excision product but did not result in significant removal of nucleotide from the 20-mer (Fig. 4, lanes 3-6). This is consistent with the conclusion that the 3′-end of the oligomer was protected or blocked by the enzyme. When the amount of pol ε was increased to a total of 5 µl (0.1 unit/µl), a light band was visible at the 19-mer position (lane 6), suggesting that the binding of the preincubated pol ε to the 20-mer/M13mp18 DNA was tight but still reversible. No mobility shift of the 20-mer was observed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, indicating that pol ε dissociated from the DNA under denaturation conditions (95°C, 50% formamide, and 8 M urea). Therefore, the binding between pol ε and DNA did not appear to involve the formation of a covalent bond. In contrast, the addition of pol ε to reactions preincubated with pol ε and normal DNA led to almost complete digestion of the normal 21-mer (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10). In the second approach to investigating the consequences of 3′-terminal F-ara-AMP excision, we reasoned that if pol ε was not tightly associated to the initial excision products, the 3′-end of the 20-mer should be available for polymerization by DNA pol α in the presence of normal dNTPs.

These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal pair of helices of apoA-I are involved in the initial rapid binding of apoA-I to the lipid surface of HDL. Although the lipid affinity of apoA-II is higher than that of apoA-I, substitution of the carboxyl-terminal helices of apoA-I with those of apoA-II only partially restores its lipoprotein association.

ApoA-I, the major protein component of HDL, is an important determinant of the concentration of HDL in plasma (11Assman G. Brewer Jr., H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 989-993Google Scholar). ApoA-I binds and transports plasma lipids, serves as a cofactor for the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and increases cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues (12Fielding C.J. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 1493-1498Google Scholar, 13Oram J.F. McKnight G.L. Hart C.B. Atherosclerosis Rev. 1990; 20: 103-107Google Scholar, 14Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Google Scholar). In addition, apoA-I is an important ligand in the binding of HDL to cell membranes (15Slotte J.P. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12904-12907Google Scholar, 16Morrison J.R. McPherson G.A. Fidge N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13205-13209Google Scholar). These characteristics contribute to the ability of HDL to induce reverse cholesterol transport and thus to the protective effect of HDL on cardiovascular disease. ApoA-I is synthesized as a prepropeptide, which is cotranslationally cleaved to pro-apoA-I, and then cleaved during secretion to form the mature 243-amino acid apoA-I protein (17Brewer Jr., H.B. Fairwell T. LaRue A. Ronan R. Houser A. Bronzert T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 623-630Google Scholar). The secondary structure of apoA-I contains amphipathic helices composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces (18Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto Jr., A.M.

It has been demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I plays an important role in lipid binding and in the interaction with cell membranes (16Morrison J.R. McPherson G.A. Fidge N.H. J.

Analysis of patients with reduced plasma concentration of HDL revealed that accelerated catabolism, possibly due to enzymatic degradation, of apoA-I is the most common cause of low HDL levels (26Rader D.J.

Recently, we have demonstrated (25Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Google Scholar) that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I decreases the rate but not the extent of in vitro phospholipid association and that this interaction results in the formation of larger discoidal particles with increased apoA-I/phospholipid ratios. The present study compares the in vitro and in vivo lipoprotein binding properties of wild-type human apoA-I, an apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant, and an apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) chimera, in which the carboxyl-terminal pair of helices of apoA-I have been substituted with the pair of helices of apoA-II. Oligonucleotides were obtained by custom synthesis (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium). DNA sequencing was performed on a Pharmacia ALF DNA sequencer. Chromatography materials were obtained from Pharmacia. All DNA manipulations were carried out essentially as described (25Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Google Scholar). cDNAs for expression of wild-type apoA-I and of apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) in Escherichia coli were obtained as described previously (25Holvoet P.

The DNA fragment for the Ser12-Gln77 segment of apoA-II was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in an automated DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using the 5′-deoxyoligonucleotide dATGGCGCCAGACTGTCTCAGTACTTCCAGAGGCGCCAGACTG primer, overlapping the apoA-I (Gly186-Leu189) and the apoA-II (Ser12-Gln16) segments, and the 3′-deoxyoligonucleotide dTAGGCGCCTCACTGGG TGGGTGGCAGGCTGTGTT reversed primer, overlapping the apoA-II (Thr72-Gln77) segment followed with a TGA stop codon and a NarI site. Thirty cycles were performed, consisting of 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 2 min of annealing at 52°C, and 1.5 min of extension at 72°C. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NarI and ligated in the NarI-treated pMc-5-apoA-I transfection vector resulting in the pMC-5-apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) vector for the expression of apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) in E. coli. All cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, as described previously (25Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins were expressed in the periplasmic fractions of E. coli WK6 host cells as described (25Holvoet P.

Standard apoA-I was isolated from normolipemic human plasma as described previously (17Brewer Jr., H.B. Fairwell T. LaRue A. Ronan R. Houser A. Bronzert T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 623-630Google Scholar). The purity of proteins was established by SDS-gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Proteins were iodinated by the Bolton and Hunter method (33Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 329: 318-330Google Scholar). The pharmacokinetic properties of wild-type apoA-I, apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243), and apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/ApoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) in New Zealand White rabbits were determined by measurement of the residual radioactivity after bolus injection of 125I-labeled proteins (3 µg/kg) in blood samples that were taken at times 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 min and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 24, 28, and 31 h. The results were plotted semilogarithmically, and the curves were fitted with a sum of three exponential terms C(t) = Ae−-αt+ Be−βt+ Ce−γt, by graphical curve peeling (34Gibaldi M. Perrier D. Pharmacokinetics. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1983: 45Google Scholar). The coefficients A, B, and C were calculated from the intercepts on the ordinate, whereas the exponents α, β, and γ were calculated from the slopes. The following clearance parameters were calculated using standard formulas derived by Gibaldi and Perrier (34Gibaldi M. Perrier D. Pharmacokinetics. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1983: 45Google Scholar): total volume of distribution VD = dose/C; extrapolated area under the curve (AUC)= A/α+ B/β+ C/γ, and plasma clearance rate Clp = dose/AUC. Statistical differences between these parameters were calculated using the Student t test. Continuous density gradient ultracentrifugation (35Cheung M.C. Segrest J.P. Albers J.J. Cone J.T. Brouillette C.G. Chung B.H. Kashyap M. Glasscock M.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid. Res. 1987; 28: 913-929Google Scholar) was performed using a table top T-100 ultracentrifuge (Analis, Namur, Belgium) in 5-ml tubes. Four hundred µl of rabbit plasma were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 6HR column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.1, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.02 mg/ml sodium azide in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). The levels of phospholipids and cholesterol were determined using standard enzymatic assays (Biomérieux, Marcy, France, and Boehringer Mannheim, Meylon, France, respectively), and the protein levels were determined according to Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Human HDL3, containing 240 µg of apoA-I in 200 µl, was incubated with 30 µg of 125I-labeled apoA-I for 1 h at 37°C. Nonbound radiolabeled apoA-I was separated from the HDL3 fraction by filtration on a Centricon 100 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Radiolabeled HDL3 was diluted 8-fold in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, and 50-µl aliquots, containing 0.80 µg of radiolabeled apoA-I, were mixed with 50 µl of solutions that contained 0.24, 0.48, 0.96, 1.92, 3.84, 7.68, or 15.36 µg of apoA-I, deletion mutant, or chimera. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, free apolipoproteins were separated from the HDL3 by filtration. The HDL3-associated radioactivity and the radioactivity in the filtrate were measured. The percentage of HDL3-associated radiolabeled apoA-I was determined as a function of the amount of competing apolipoprotein in the incubation mixture. The predicted amphipathic helical regions in apoA-I, the apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant, apoA-II, and the apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) chimera, according to Brasseur et al. (37Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 245-252Google Scholar, 38Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Google Scholar), are illustrated in Fig. 1. Edmundson wheel diagrams confirmed that the aligned carboxyl-terminal segments in apoA-I and the chimera indeed may form amphipathic helices and that the orientation of their respective hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces is very similar (Fig. 2). The hydrophobicity of the carboxyl-terminal helix of the chimera was higher than that of the original ninth helix of apoA-I (mean residue hydrophobicities were 0.038 for apoA-I and 0.060 for the chimera).Fig. 2Edmundson wheel diagrams of the Ala190-Ala207 (A) and Pro220-Thr237 (B) α-helical segments of apoA-I and the Ser12-Val29 (C) and Pro51-Val68 of apoA-II (D). Shown are α-helical segments of apoA-II that have been inserted in apoA-I (Asp1-Leu89)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) chimera as indicated in Fig. 1. These segments are indicated as A1-A18, P1-T18, S1-V18, and P1-V18, respectively. Positively (+) and negatively (−) charged amino acids are shown. Hydrophobic residues are shown by thick circles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Apolipoproteins were expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Each of the proteins migrated as a single band with the expected molecular masses on polyacrylamide gels: 28.3 kDa for wild-type recombinant apoA-I, 29.8 kDa for the chimera, and 22.0 kDa for the deletion mutant. The identity of each band was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, using polyclonal sheep anti-human apoA-I and sheep anti-human apoA-II antibodies (data not shown). As previously shown, the molecular masses and the in vitro phospholipid binding properties of wild-type recombinant apoA-I and plasma apoA-I are identical (25Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Google Scholar). To assess the impact of the deletion or the substitution of the carboxyl-terminal domain on protein self-association, the lipid-free apolipoproteins were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline at three concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/ml) and treated with the cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. Fig. 4 illustrates the oligomerization patterns of the different apolipoproteins. At the lowest concentration all apolipoproteins existed predominantly as monomers. At the highest concentration, apoA-I exhibited monomeric (38% of total protein), dimeric (22%), trimeric (16%), and tetrameric (14%) forms (Fig. 4). At the same concentration, the percentage of apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) that existed as monomer was higher (monomer, 75%; dimer, 16%; trimer, 6%; and tetramer, 3%). At all concentrations, >90% of the chimera existed as monomer (Fig. 4). Radiolabeled apolipoproteins with specific radioactivities of 3 × 106 cpm/µg of protein were used within 24 h after radiolabeling and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to exclude degradation and self-association (not shown). The association of radiolabeled apolipoproteins with lipoprotein particles was studied following in vitro incubation in rabbit plasma for 60 min. Fractions of added apolipoproteins that were associated with HDL2,3 particles were 0.60 ± 0.05 for apoA-I (mean ± S.E.; n = 6), 0.32 ± 0.02 for the chimera (p = 0.007 versus apoA-I), and 0.14 ± 0.005 for the deletion mutant (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and versus the chimera). Fractions of added apolipoproteins associated with VHDL particles were 0.20 ± 0.01 for apoA-I, 0.48 ± 0.05 for the chimera (p > 0.001 versus apoA-I), and 0.65 ± 0.06 for the deletion mutant (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and p = NS versus the chimera). Fractions present as free apolipoproteins in the plasma were 0.20 for all three compounds (data not shown). The density distributions of radiolabeled apolipoproteins associated with lipoprotein particles in human plasma are illustrated in Fig. 5. Fractions that were associated with HDL2,3 particles were 0.55 ± 0.06 for apoA-I, 0.30 ± 0.04 for the chimera (p = 0.006 versus apoA-I), and 0.15 ± 0.02 for the deletion mutant (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I, p = 0.007 versus the chimera). Fractions that were associated with VHDL particles were 0.25 ± 0.02 for apoA-I, 0.50 ± 0.06 for the chimera (p < 0.003 versus apoA-I), and 0.65 ± 0.05 for the deletion mutant (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and p = NS versus the chimera). Fractions that were present as free apolipoproteins in the plasma again were 0.20 for all three compounds. The plasma clearance of radiolabeled wild-type apoA-I, apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243), and apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) was analyzed in rabbits (Fig. 6). The disappearance rates of all proteins could be described by a sum of three exponential terms by graphical curve peeling. The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table I. The plasma clearance rate was 0.028 ± 0.0012 ml·min−1 for 125I-labeled apoA-I as compared with 0.025 ± 0.0011 ml·min−1 for apoA-I antigen, as determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on monoclonal antibodies specific for apoA-I following injection of human apoA-I. These data suggest that clearance of apoA-I was not affected by the labeling procedures. Plasma clearance rates of the chimera and of the deletion mutant, respectively, were 3.6-fold and 13.6-fold higher than that of apoA-I (Table I). Values of t1/2α, t1/2β, and t1/2γ were, however, very similar for all apolipoproteins: 3, 220, and 2,300 min, respectively, suggesting that the differences in clearance resulted from differences in the lipoprotein profiles. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, which shows the distributions of cholesterol and phospholipids (upper panel) and of radiolabeled apolipoproteins (lower panel) in the different lipoprotein fractions at 20 min postinjection. Ninety percent of 125I-labeled apoA-I was associated with HDL2 and HDL3 particles (fractions 15-25), whereas only 10% was associated with smaller, phospholipid-rich VHDL particles (fractions 26-35). Corresponding values were 60 and 40% for the chimera and 30 and 70% for the deletion mutant.Table I.Pharmacokinetic parameters of the clearance of 125I-labeled wild-type apoA-I, apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apo A-II (Ser12-Gln77), and apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) from blood following bolus injection of 3 µg/kg in normolipemic New Zealand White rabbitsParameterApolipoproteinApoA-IApoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/ApoA-II (Ser12-Gln77)ApoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243)VD (ml)170 ± 10160 ± 6.1180 ± 8.2AUC (µg ·; min ·; ml−1360 ± 1386 ± 4.9ap < 0.001.26 ± 2.5ap < 0.001.Clp (ml ·; min−10.028 ± 0.00120.10 ± 0.008ap < 0.001.0.38 ± 0.022ap < 0.001.a p < 0.001.

The distribution patterns at 20 min postinjection are illustrated in Fig. 8. At 20 min postinjection, HDL2,3-associated fractions were 0.55 ± 0.06 for apoA-I, 0.25 ± 0.03 for the chimera (p = 0.001 versus apoA-I) and 0.09 ± 0.01 for the deletion mutant (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and versus the chimera) (Fig. 9). At 4 h postinjection HDL2,3- associated fractions were 0.43 ± 0.04, 0.19 ± 0.02 (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I) and 0.08 ± 0.006 (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and versus the chimera), respectively (Fig. 9). At 24 h postinjection, HDL2,3- associated fractions were 0.34 ± 0.05, 0.14 ± 0.02 (p = 0.004 versus apoA-I), and 0.06 ± 0.008 (p < 0.001 versus apoA-I and p = 0.004 versus the chimera), respectively (Fig. 9). Estimated half-lives of HDL2,3-associated protein were 2,200 ± 130 min for apoA-I, 2,500 ± 300 min (p not significant) for the chimera and 2,400 ± 240 min (p not significant) for the deletion mutant, which are very similar to the values of t1/2γ. At 20 min postinjection, VHDL- associated fractions were 0.15 ± 0.006, 0.25 ± 0.03 (p = 0.008 versus apoA-I) and 0.27 ± 0.03 (p = 0.003 versus apoA-I, and p not significant versus the chimera), respectively (Fig. 9). At 4 h postinjection, corresponding fractions were 0.05 ± 0.005, 0.08 ± 0.01 (p = 0.002 versus apoA-I), and 0.10 ± 0.012 (p = 0.003 versus apoA-I and p not significant versus the chimera) (Fig. 9). At 24 h postinjection, fractions were 0.02 ± 0.002, 0.04 ± 0.007 (p = 0.02 versus apoA-I), and 0.04 ± 0.008 (p = 0.04 versus apoA-I and p not significant versus the chimera) (Fig. 9). Estimated half-lives of VHDL-associated proteins were 260 ± 45 min for apoA-I, 240 ± 35 min (p not significant) for the chimera, and 280 ± 25 min (p not significant) for the deletion mutant, which are very similar to the values of t1/2β. Fractions that were not associated with lipoproteins at 20 min postinjection and that most probably were cleared as free apolipoproteins were 0.30 ± 0.04 for apoA-I, 0.50 ± 0.06 (p = 0.02 versus apoA-I) for the chimera, and 0.64 ± 0.07 (p = 0.002 versus apoA-I and p not significant versus the chimera) for the deletion mutant.Fig. 9HDL2,3-associated (right panel) and VHDL-associated fractions (left panel) as a function of time.

Fifty percent displacement was obtained with 0.9 µg of apoA-I, 3.0 µg of the chimera, and 8.7 µg of the deletion mutant, thus at 1:1, 3:1, and 12:1 molar ratios of added protein to HDL3-associated 125I-labeled apoA-I, respectively (Fig. 10). These data indicate that the affinity for HDL3 of 125I-labeled apoA-I was identical to that of nonlabeled apoA-I, whereas the affinities of, respectively, the chimera and the deletion mutant were 3- and 12-fold lower. The variability in HDL cholesterol levels is largely determined by differences in the fractional catabolic rate of apoA-I, which is inversely correlated with HDL particle size (39Ikewaki K. Rader D.J. Schaeffer J.R. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2207-2215Google Scholar). In order to analyze the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I in phospholipid binding, lipoprotein association, HDL particle size distribution, and clearance, mutants of apoA-I have been generated. In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo lipoprotein binding properties of apoA-I, an apoA-I (ΔAla190-Gln243) deletion mutant, and an apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) chimera were compared. In the apoA-I (Asp1-Leu189)/apoA-II (Ser12-Gln77) chimera, the Ala190-Gln243 carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I was substituted with the Ser12-Lys28 and Pro51-Val68α-helical segments of apoA-II. Previously, it has been shown that synthetic peptides overlapping with these apoA-II sequences associated with phospholipids, suggesting that these helical segments constitute phospholipid binding domains (40Chen T.C. Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Morrisett J.D. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1617-1622Google Scholar, 41Mao S.J.T. Sparrow J.T. Gilliam F.B. Gotto Jr., A.M. Jackson R.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4150-4156Google Scholar). Furthermore, epitope-mapping studies showed that antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I bound to an epitope in the Gln36-Gln77 segment of apoA-II, demonstrating significant structural homology between these domains (42Allan C.M. Fidge N.H. Kanellos J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13257-13261Google Scholar). Finally, apoA-II can displace apoA-I from the surface of recombinant HDL particles without loss of phospholipids or major change in particle size (43Rye K.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 227-236Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled apoA-I associated preferentially (60%) with HDL2 and HDL3 particles both in rabbit and human plasma. Deletion of the Ala190-Gln243 carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I did not reduce the extent (80%) of in vitro lipoprotein association in rabbit and human plasma under equilibrium conditions but altered its distribution profile. Only 15% of the apoA-I (Ala190-Gln243) deletion mutant associated with HDL2,3 particles. Although the predicted secondary structure and the amphipathicity of the chimera were very similar to those of apoA-I, only 30% of the chimera associated with HDL2,3 particles. Because lipoprotein distribution profiles in human and rabbit plasma were very similar, rabbits were used as model animals to investigate the effects of changed lipoprotein distribution of both the chimera and the deletion mutant on their pharmacokinetic properties. Following bolus injection of 125I-labeled apoA-I in rabbits, it was cleared with a rate of 0.028 ml·min−1. This value is very similar to that determined by Ikewaki et al. (39Ikewaki K. Rader D.J. Schaeffer J.R. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2207-2215Google Scholar) following bolus injection of either exogenously or endogenously labeled apoA-I in humans. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I resulted in a 13.6-fold increased clearance rate. This was most probably due to an enhanced clearance in the α-phase (64% as compared with 30% for apoA-I) of free apolipoprotein in solution, suggesting a slower rate of in vivo lipoprotein association of the deletion mutant. These data are in agreement with earlier findings that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I reduced the rate of in vitro phospholipid binding (25Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers E. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Google Scholar). Accelerated clearance may further result from a decreased association with HDL2,3 particles (9% as compared with 55% for apoA-I) and from an increased association with smaller, phospholipid-rich VHDL particles (30% as compared with 15% for apoA-I) that were cleared more rapidly from the circulation. Indeed, estimated half-lives of HDL2,3 particles were approximately 2,200 min as compared with approximately 260 min for VHDL particles. These data are in agreement with earlier findings of Schmidt et al. (30Schmidt H.H.J. Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Ronan R. Wellmann A. Thomas F. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Hoeg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5469-5475Google Scholar) that progressive carboxyl-terminal domain truncation of apoA-I resulted in a progressive increase of its clearance rate, resulting from an increased association with VHDL. In aggregate, these data suggest that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I correlated with a decreased rate of lipoprotein association and/or increased rate of dissociation and a preferential association with smaller, phospholipid-rich VHDL particles that are cleared more rapidly. The plasma clearance rate of the chimera was 3.6-fold faster than that of apoA-I but was 3.8-fold slower than that of the deletion mutant. The differences between the chimera and apoA-I could be explained by a decreased rate of lipoprotein association, decreased association with HDL2,3 particles (25% as compared with 55% for apoA-I), and increased association with VHDL (25% as compared with 15%). The differences between the chimera and the deletion mutant could be explained essentially by an increased association of the chimera with HDL2,3 particles (25% as compared with 9%). The finding that α-, β- and γ-half-lives of all apolipoproteins were very similar and corresponded with half-lives of free apolipoprotein, VHDL, and HDL2,3 particles, respectively, indicated that the differences in clearance rate indeed could be explained by differences in distribution profile. These differences in distribution profile could be explained by a 3-fold (for the chimera) and a 12-fold (for the deletion mutant) lower affinity for HDL3 particles. Cross-linking experiments demonstrated that the self-association of both the deletion mutant and the chimera were lower than that of apoA-I. Human apoA-II self-associates in lipid-free solution (44Vitello L.B. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1131-1136Google Scholar, 45Pownall H.J. Hickson D. Gotto Jr., A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9849-9854Google Scholar), resulting in dimerization of the disulfide-linked monomer, but it does not seem to aggregate in a monomer-dimer-tetramer fashion as does apoA-I. It has been suggested that this greater ability of apoA-I to self-associate may shield hydrophobic surfaces within the molecule better and allow apoA-I to be thermodynamically stable when not bound to lipid (46Loeb J. Dawson G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 52: 161-176Google Scholar). On the other hand, apoA-II must bind to lipid in order to form a stable entity and will therefore bind to a more diverse group of lipids (46Loeb J. Dawson G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 52: 161-176Google Scholar). Despite the lack of self-association of the chimera (Fig. 3), the lipoprotein affinity of this molecule was lower than that of apoA-I (Fig. 10). It seems unlikely that the decreased lipoprotein affinity of the chimera results from a stronger intramolecular association of the apoA-II-(51-68) helix with the apoA-II-(12-28) helix relative to that between the apoA-I-(223-239) and apoA-I-(190-206) helices because this putative association does not affect the lipoprotein association of apoA-II. An alternative explanation is that although the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I is important for its initial rapid binding to the lipid surface of HDL, cooperative interactions with the middle six amphipathic helices of apoA-I may be important for its HDL subspecies distribution. Recently such a model has been proposed (47Palgunachari M. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Google Scholar) on the basis of the finding that although only the end 22-residue helices of apoA-I have significant lipid affinity, apoA-I is, on a molar basis, about 10 times more effective than the most effective 22-residue peptide in reducing the enthalpy of the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles. In summary, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I results in a significant decrease of its lipoprotein affinity, a reduction of its HDL3 association, and thus a more rapid clearance. Although substitution of this domain with helices of apoA-II restores the number of amphipathic helices and increases the hydrophobicity of the carboxyl-terminal domain, it does not restore completely its lipoprotein affinity and its HDL3 association, possibly because this substitution affects cooperative interactions with the middle amphipathic helices of apoA-I that are critical for its specific distribution over the HDL subspecies.

Two major conclusions emerge from the experiments presented: (i) permanganate oxidation of the +2T base of the scissile strand interferes with topoisomerase binding to DNA, and (ii) the +1T base of the scissile strand becomes unpaired upon formation of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA intermediate. Disruption of T:A base pairing is confined to the +1-position.

We suggest that a protein-induced DNA conformational change is a component of the strand passage step of the topoisomerase reaction. The eukaryotic family of type I DNA topoisomerases, which includes the nuclear enzymes and the poxvirus topoisomerases, comprises a group of proteins with structural similarity and a common catalytic mechanism. A single catalytic cycle for these proteins entails (i) noncovalent binding of the enzyme to duplex DNA, (ii) scission of one DNA strand with concomitant formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, (iii) strand passage, and (iv) religation across the phosphodiester bond originally broken. The DNA binding, cleavage, and religation steps have been studied in detail using defined model substrates containing high affinity cleavage sites for the cellular or vaccinia virus type I enzymes (Stevnser et al., 32Stevnser T.

Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Google Scholar). The cellular topoisomerases exhibit a loose preference for a four-base motif, 5′-(A/T)(G/C)(A/T)T↓ (Edwards et al., 6Edwards K.A. Halligan B.D. Davis J.L. Nivera N.L. Liu L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2565-2576Google Scholar; Been et al., 1Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J.

A common structure at the topoisomerase catalytic center is likely, insofar as the active site tyrosine of every eukaryotic topoisomerase is located within a conserved motif, Ser-Lys-X-X-Tyr, situated near the COOH terminus of the protein (Lynn et al., 13Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Google Scholar; Eng et al., 7Eng W. Pandit S.D. Sternglanz R. J. Biol.

Shuman S. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 515-524Google Scholar, 15Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Google Scholar; Klemperer and Traktman, 10Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol.

An outstanding question regarding the eukaryotic topoisomerase I family concerns the mechanics of “topoisomerization” (i.e. how the protein, once covalently bound to DNA, permits, executes, or controls the passage of the noncleaved strand of the DNA duplex through the nick in the incised strand). Two formal models have been discussed (Wang, 35Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Google Scholar; Champoux, 3Champoux J.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217Google Scholar). The free rotation model posits that the duplex DNA segment downstream of the cleavage site is unconstrained by the protein and therefore permitted free and unlimited rotation about the phosphodiester bond in the unbroken strand opposite the nick. According to the enzyme-bridging model, topoisomerase maintains noncovalent interactions with the downstream DNA and either actively assists in strand passage or, at the very least, controls the step increment of rotation. Studies of binding, cleavage, and religation by vaccinia topoisomerase on CCCTT-containing linear DNAs, while not directly scoring changes in topology, do shed some light on the choice of models. For example, there is evidence that vaccinia topoisomerase makes contacts with the DNA downstream of the cleavage site. Increasing the length of the duplex region downstream of the scissile bond incrementally from 6 to 10 to 12 bp strongly enhances noncovalent binding (Sekiguchi and Shuman, 19Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (b): 5360-5365Google Scholar). This suggests that the topoisomerase interacts with the DNA duplex at a distance from the CCCTT element of about one helical turn. This is consistent with the DNase footprint of the vaccinia protein, which reaches 9-13 bp downstream of the cleavage site (Shuman, 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (b): 11372-11379Google Scholar). Interaction of topoisomerase with the DNA segment 3′ of the site of strand scission has also been suggested by studies of the cellular type I enzyme (Christiansen et al., 5Christiansen K. Svejstrup A.B.D. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9690-9701Google Scholar). One potential implication of these findings is that the enzyme may control the rate of topoisomerization during relaxation of supercoiled DNA by binding and releasing the downstream segment of the DNA molecule in synchrony with cycles of cleavage and religation. Alternatively, the topoisomerase may actively separate the strands of the duplex immediately 3′ of the cleavage site as part of a gating step in strand passage. We set out in this study to test the latter hypothesis by chemical probing of the topoisomerase-DNA covalent intermediate using potassium permanganate, a reagent that selectively modifies unpaired thymine bases (Hayatsu and Ukita, 8Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Google Scholar). Counter to our expectations, we observed no strand separation 3′ of the cleavage site. Rather, we found that the +1T base on the 5′ side of the cleaved bond became highly accessible to permanganate modification. Wild type vaccinia topoisomerase and the Topo(Phe-274) mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (Shuman et al., 30Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by sequential phosphocellulose and SP5PW ion exchange chromatography steps (Morham and Shuman, 15Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Google Scholar). The SP5PW protein preparations were homogeneous with respect to the topoisomerase polypeptide, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides via DMT-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 394 automated DNA synthesizer. Oligonucleotides were 32P-5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ32P]ATP and then gel-purified and annealed to a complementary DNA strand (present at 4-fold molar excess) as described (Shuman, 23Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (a): 1796-1803Google Scholar). A mixture (0.2 ml) containing 100-200 pmol of 5′ end-labeled 60-mer oligonucleotide (either the scissile or nonscissile strand) and 5 mM KMnO4 (from a freshly made 100 mM stock solution) was incubated at 37°C for 30 s. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 µl of β-mercaptoethanol. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 0.1 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The modified strands were then hybridized to the unlabeled complementary strand. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 pmol of 60-mer duplex DNA (KMnO4-modified and 32P-5′-end-labeled either on the top or bottom strand), and 330 ng of purified topoisomerase were incubated at 37°C for 5 min and then adjusted to 5% (v/v) glycerol. To separate topoisomerase-DNA complexes from unbound 32P-labeled DNA, the samples were electrophoresed through a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mM Tris borate, 0.6 mM EDTA) at 100 V for 3 h. The gel was autoradiographed wet. A discrete topoisomerase-32P-DNA complex was resolved from the free 60-bp DNA; about half of the input DNA was bound. Free and bound DNAs were electroeluted from excised gel slices using an IBI electroelution apparatus (model UEA). The labeled DNA was ethanol-precipitated and then resuspended in 80 µl of 1 M piperidine. The samples were heated at 95°C for 15 min and then subjected to three cycles of lyophilization and resuspension in 50 µl of water, followed by lyophilization and resuspension in 4 µl of formamide. The samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min and then electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M urea in TBE (90 mM Tris borate, 2.5 mM EDTA) at 60 W for 2 h. Reaction mixtures (20 µl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1-2 pmol of 32P-5′-end-labeled DNA, and topoisomerase as specified were incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The mixtures were adjusted to 1 mM KMnO4 (from a freshly made 100 mM stock solution) and incubated at 22°C for 1 min. The modification reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 µl of β-mercaptoethanol, and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Alternatively, the topoisomerase-DNA complexes were first digested with proteinase K (10 µg) in 0.2% SDS for 1 h at 37°C and then extracted sequentially with phenol:chloroform and chloroform. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 18 µl of TE buffer. The deproteinized DNA samples were then treated with 1 mM KMnO4 for 1 min at 22°C, and the reactions were quenched with β-mercaptoethanol. The modified DNAs were cleaved with piperidine and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above for the KMnO4 interference assay. Potassium permanganate oxidizes the 5,6-double bond of the thymine base to produce a 5,6-glycol, thereby altering the DNA surface in the major groove. Initial experiments addressed whether permanganate modification of T residues had any impact on topoisomerase binding to DNA. A 60-bp duplex DNA containing a single CCCTT motif was employed for this analysis; the sequence of the DNA in the vicinity of the cleavage site is shown in Fig. 1. The individual strands were 32P-5′-end-labeled and treated with permanganate prior to hybridization to an unmodified complementary strand. The 60-bp duplex was mixed with purified topoisomerase, and protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound 32P-labeled DNA by native gel electrophoresis. Bound and unbound DNA species were recovered from the gel, and the DNA was cleaved at oxidized T residues by treatment with piperidine. Cleavage products were then analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Modification of the +2T base on the scissile (top) strand interfered with protein-DNA complex formation, as evinced by the exclusion of DNA molecules with a piperidine-cleavable site at +2T from the bound DNA fraction (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 4). Modification of the +1T did not interfere with binding, since the +1T cleavage product was evenly distributed in the bound and free populations. DNAs modified at −2T and −3T positions of the top strand were recovered preferentially in the protein-bound DNA fraction (Fig. 1, lane 4), as was DNA containing an oxidized T at the −1-position of the noncleaved bottom strand (Fig. 1, lane 8). These findings suggest that topoisomerase makes an essential contact with the +2T base of the CCCTT element in the major groove. They also suggest that distortion of the DNA immediately 3′ of the cleavage site enhances DNA binding to the topoisomerase. Acquired permanganate sensitivity in duplex DNA provides a sensitive measure of unpaired thymine bases within protein-DNA complexes. All thymine bases in the top and bottom strands of the topoisomerase substrate were susceptible to permanganate oxidation and piperidine cleavage when the 60-mer oligonucleotides were in single-stranded form (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 8). Modification was suppressed when the strands were annealed to form a fully base-paired duplex (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 9). Remarkably, the addition of topoisomerase to the 60-bp duplex elicited a specific enhancement of sensitivity to permanganate at the +1T position on the scissile strand (Fig. 2, lane 3). No other site of permanganate sensitivity was induced on either the top or bottom DNA strands, even when topoisomerase was added in 10-fold molar excess over the DNA (Fig. 3). Enhancement of permanganate sensitivity at +1T depended on treatment of the topoisomerase-DNA mixture with both permanganate and piperidine; neither reagent alone sufficed (not shown). Enhancement of permanganate sensitivity at +1T was not detected when the experiments were performed with equivalent amounts of Topo(Phe-274), a mutated version of the vaccinia enzyme in which the active site tyrosine is substituted by phenylalanine (not shown). Because Topo(Phe-274) binds to the CCCTT recognition site but does not transesterify (Shuman, 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (b): 11372-11379Google Scholar; Sekiguchi and Shuman, 19Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (b): 5360-5365Google Scholar), we surmise that induction of permanganate sensitivity requires strand cleavage by the topoisomerase.Fig. 3KMnO4 sensitivity as a function of topoisomerase concentration. Reaction mixtures (20 µl) containing 2 pmol of 60-bp DNA substrate (5′-end-labeled either on the top (left panel) or bottom (right panel) strand) and 66, 132, 330, or 660 ng of topoisomerase (proceeding from left to right) were incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The mixtures were treated with KMnO4 and then subjected to cleavage with piperidine. Control reactions containing radiolabeled 60-mer duplex DNA, but no topoisomerase (lane −) or labeled 60-mer single strands (lane T), were processed in parallel. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The nucleotide coordinates of the T-specific cleavage products are indicated at the left of each autoradiogram. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA duplex in the vicinity of the cleavage site is shown at the bottom. The +1T residue rendered KMnO4-sensitive upon topoisomerase binding is circled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Permanganate hypersensitivity upon strand scission by topoisomerase was strikingly asymmetric. The scissile bond is flanked by a T:A base pair on the 5′ side (the +1-position) and an A:T base pair on the 3′ side (the −1-position; refer to Fig. 1), yet only the +1T on the top strand was rendered permanganate-sensitive. If sensitivity were simply a function of strand cleavage and “fraying” of ends at the nick, then we would have expected to see modification of the −1T on the bottom strand. 2Given that transesterification is required for permanganate sensitivity, we could not expect to detect unpairing of the −2T or −3T bases on the top strand, because only the 5′ segment of the incised strand retains the 32P label. Our inability to detect an unpaired −1 thymine on the bottom strand 3′ of the scissile bond is subject to two interpretations: (i) strand separation does not occur; or (ii) the strands are separated, but the bases are inaccessible to the chemical agent because they are bound by protein. We reasoned that if protein contacts prevented permanganate oxidation at −1T on the bottom strand, then elimination of the protein at the nick should render this base permanganate-sensitive. Similarly, if the observed hypersensitivity of the +1T on the top strand was simply a consequence of nicking, then this modification should be unaffected by removal of the protein. On the other hand, if the +1T sensitivity reflected a true disruption of base pairing induced by the topoisomerase, then elimination of the protein should also eliminate the sensitivity to oxidation. We addressed these points by subjecting the topoisomerase-DNA complexes to digestion with proteinase K prior to treatment with permanganate and piperidine (Fig. 2). In the absence of proteinase K treatment, the 5′-labeled 30-mer product of topoisomerase cleavage remained covalently bound to the protein and did not enter the polyacrylamide gel. After proteinase K digestion, the 5′-labeled top strand cleavage product entered the gel and migrated as a cluster of bands with an apparent chain length of 32-34 nucleotides (Fig. 2, lane 4). The heterogeneity of the cleavage product and the slightly retarded mobility of these species relative to the size expected of a +1 topoisomerase cleavage product (30 nucleotides) were attributable to the covalent attachment of one or more amino acids to the 3′ end of the cleaved fragment (Shuman, 23Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (a): 1796-1803Google Scholar, 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (b): 11372-11379Google Scholar). About 15% of the 32P-5′-end-labeled 60-bp DNA was covalently bound to the topoisomerase at saturating enzyme; this reflects the cleavage equilibrium at this particular CCCTT site. Removal of the covalently bound topoisomerase by proteinase K prior to treatment with permanganate and piperidine completely eliminated the sensitivity of the +1T base on the scissile strand to permanganate oxidation (Fig. 2, lane 7). Similar experiments were performed using the 60-bp DNA substrate 5′-labeled on the bottom strand. In this case, prior digestion with proteinase K did not result in the new appearance of a permanganate/piperidine product at −1T or at any other thymine on the bottom strand (Fig. 2, lanes 10-14). We infer from these results that the sensitivity of +1T on the scissile strand to permanganate oxidation is not accounted for by fraying at a nick. Rather, we surmise that the +1T base is specifically unpaired by the topoisomerase in the context of the covalent protein-DNA complex. Covalent adduct formation by vaccinia topoisomerase at a single CCCTT site can be enhanced by truncating the length of the DNA duplex 3′ of the scissile bond (Shuman, 23Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (a): 1796-1803Google Scholar; Sekiguchi and Shuman, 19Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (b): 5360-5365Google Scholar). “Suicide” substrates with less than 10 downstream base pairs have been used extensively to study the specificity and kinetics of the cleavage reaction (Stivers et al., 33Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (a): 327-339Google Scholar, 34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 15449-15458Google Scholar) and, more recently, to probe the structure of the covalent reaction intermediate (Sekiguchi and Shuman, 20Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Google Scholar). An example of such a substrate, in which an 18-mer scissile strand is annealed to a 30-nucleotide bottom strand, is shown in Fig. 4. Without extensive base pairing to tether the 3′ cleavage product to the bottom strand, the 6-mer leaving group AGACAG can be expected to dissociate from the covalent protein-DNA complex, leaving an 18-nucleotide single-stranded tail on the noncleaved strand. With no readily available acceptor for religation, the topoisomerase will become trapped on the DNA. This is reflected in a higher yield of covalent adduct, e.g. 82% of this DNA substrate becomes covalently bound to protein compared with 15% of the 60-bp DNA used above. The +1 and +2 thymines in the top strand of the suicide substrate were susceptible to permanganate oxidation and piperidine cleavage when the 18-mer was in single-stranded form, but modification was suppressed when the 18-mer was annealed to the 30-mer bottom strand (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 3). Treatment of the topoisomerase-DNA complex with potassium permanganate resulted in a profound enhancement of oxidation at +1T on the scissile strand, as demonstrated by the appearance of a prominent T-specific cleavage product (Fig. 4, lane 4). The formation of this species depended on piperidine treatment of the permanganate-modified protein-DNA adduct (Fig. 4, lane 5). Modification of +1T was not observed when Topo(Phe-274) was substituted for the wild type topoisomerase (Fig. 4, lane 6). This demonstrated that the acquisition of permanganate hypersensitivity was dependent on covalent adduct formation. The −9T and −7T bases on the bottom strand of the suicide substrate were susceptible to permanganate oxidation, whereas the −5T, −3T, and −1T bases were shielded by virtue of base pairing to the scissile strand (Fig. 4, compare lanes 9 and 8). In the presence of wild type topoisomerase, the −5, −3, and −1 thymines became sensitive to permanganate oxidation (Fig. 4, lane 10). T-specific strand scission depended on piperidine treatment (lane 11). No enhancement of permanganate sensitivity was seen at the −5T, −3T, and −1T positions when Topo(Phe-274) was substituted for the wild type enzyme. We conclude that the 6-mer leaving group truly did dissociate spontaneously upon cleavage, thereby rendering the unpaired thymines of the bottom strand 5′ tail accessible to permanganate modification. We surmise from this result that the 3′ thymines were not protected from chemical modification by the covalently bound topoisomerase. Does permanganate oxidation of the +1T base on the covalent intermediate affect the strand religation step of the topoisomerase catalytic cycle? This was addressed by assaying the ability of a preformed topoisomerase-DNA complex to transfer the covalently held 32P-5′-end-labeled strand to an exogenous acceptor (Shuman, 26Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (a): 8620-8627Google Scholar, 27Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (b): 16755-16758Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the substrate for covalent adduct formation consisted of a 32P-5′-end-labeled 18-mer scissile strand annealed to a 24-mer bottom strand. The topoisomerase-DNA intermediate was exposed to 1 mM KMnO4 for 1 min, at which point the oxidation reaction was terminated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol. Piperidine treatment at this stage resulted in the appearance of an abundant +1T cleavage product, indicative of unpairing of the +1T base (Fig. 5, lane 3). When the order of addition was reversed, such that β-mercaptoethanol was added prior to KMnO4, the appearance of the +1T piperidine cleavage product was suppressed completely (Fig. 5, lane 4). This proved that all reactive KMnO4 was quenched upon addition of the reducing agent. Religation by the covalent intermediate was initiated by the addition of a molar excess of an 18-mer acceptor strand (5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTTCT) that was complementary to the 5′ tail of the covalent donor complex. Transfer of the 12-mer donor strand to the 18-mer acceptor yielded a 32P-5′-end-labeled 30-mer (Fig. 5, lane 5). Covalent complexes that were treated with permanganate and quenched with mercaptoethanol prior to addition of acceptor DNA catalyzed the same extent of strand transfer as did untreated control complexes (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7, and data not shown). Hence, permanganate treatment did not inactivate the enzyme. The 30-mer religation products were gel-purified and then treated with piperidine. The 30-mer formed by covalent topoisomerase-DNA complexes that had been exposed to permanganate was cleaved by piperidine at +1T (Fig. 5, lane 7), whereas the 30-mer produced in control reactions was unaffected by piperidine (Fig. 5, lane 6). This proved that covalent complexes containing an oxidized +1T base were able to religate the modified strand. We have used potassium permanganate to probe contacts between vaccinia topoisomerase and thymine residues in its CCCTT DNA target site. Two major conclusions emerge from the experiments presented: (i) permanganate oxidation of the +2T base of the scissile strand interferes with topoisomerase binding to DNA, and (ii) the +1T base of the scissile strand becomes unpaired upon formation of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA intermediate. The present results extend our understanding of the DNA component of the protein-DNA interface. Dimethylsulfate methylation interference and methylation protection experiments had shown that vaccinia topoisomerase makes contact in the major groove with the +3G, +4G, and +5G guanine bases on the noncleaved strand (Shuman and Turner, 29Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments demonstrated protein contacts in the major groove with the +4C and +3C bases on the scissile strand (Sekiguchi and Shuman, 18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 31731-31734Google Scholar, 21Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). We now find that oxidation of the +2T base by permanganate, which alters the major groove surface of the 2-position base pair, interferes with topoisomerase binding. It had been suggested earlier that the +2T:A base pair is the most critical position of the topoisomerase binding site, insofar as any base change at +2-position (either on the scissile or the nonscissile strand) abrogates the cleavage reaction (Shuman, 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (b): 11372-11379Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of +2T modification, we find that permanganate oxidation of the +1T base does not interfere with protein binding, which suggests that potential contacts between the protein and the +1 base would not require integrity of the 5,6-double bond of the pyrimidine ring. Earlier base substitution experiments had shown that the requirement for a T:A base pair at the +1-position is less stringent than at the +2-position of the CCCTT motif (Shuman, 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (b): 11372-11379Google Scholar). Oxidation of the −2T and −3T bases on the scissile strand and the −1T base on the noncleaved strand enhanced the binding of vaccinia topoisomerase to DNA. Preferential recovery of these T-specific cleavage products in the protein-bound DNA fraction was observed consistently in multiple binding experiments. The enhancement of binding by the −2T and −3T modifications on the scissile strand cannot be accounted for by hypothetical effects of permanganate oxidation on the cleavage/religation equilibrium (i.e. because the scissile strand is 5′ end-labeled in these experiments, DNA molecules that are bound covalently to the enzyme cannot yield T-specific cleavage products at sites 3′ of the scissile bond). Preformed topoisomerase-DNA complexes were probed with permanganate in an effort to determine whether the DNA strands became unwound during binding and/or catalysis. We expected to detect chemical modification of T residues in the region just 3′ of the cleavage site but found instead that the +1T of the CCCTT element was specifically unpaired upon protein binding. The observation that permanganate sensitivity was conferred by the binding of wild type topoisomerase, but not Topo(Phe-274), engenders the conclusion that unpairing of the +1T base requires transesterification. The simplest explanation for this would be that the thymine base is unpaired either concomitant with or subsequent to the strand cleavage step. A series of control experiments indicated that acquisition of permanganate sensitivity at the +1T base is not simply a consequence of strand nicking; base unpairing requires that an intact topoisomerase molecule be bound to the CCCTT site. The finding of robust permanganate sensitivity at +1T in the suicide cleavage complex argues that strand religation is not germane to the unpairing step. The present data correlate nicely with recent kinetic studies of the vaccinia topoisomerase, which reveal a conformational step occurring between the strand cleavage and strand religation reactions (Stivers et al., 34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 15449-15458Google Scholar). The kinetic argument for a conformational step is based on the differing responses of the cleavage and religation rate constants to pH changes plus the disparate effects of phosphorothioate substitution at the scissile bond on cleavage and religation kinetics (Stivers et al., 33Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (a): 327-339Google Scholar, 34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 15449-15458Google Scholar). Whereas covalent chemistry is rate-limiting during the single-turnover cleavage reaction, it is the conformational step, rather than reaction chemistry, that appears to be rate-limiting for strand religation. The conformational change is suggested to be part of the topoisomerization or strand passage step of DNA relaxation (Stivers et al., 34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 15449-15458Google Scholar). We suggest that unpairing of the +1 thymine base by the topoisomerase constitutes a component of this conformational step. According to this view, the +1T base would be distorted prior to strand passage and returned to the paired state prior to strand religation. Our demonstration that covalently bound DNAs that have experienced disruption of the +1T:A pair (such DNAs being marked by oxidation at +1T) are fully capable of being religated is at least consistent with the idea that the permanganate-oxidized unpaired state is a reaction intermediate rather than a dead-end product of a side reaction. The extent of oxidation at +1T in the suicide cleavage complexes during a 1-min reaction with permanganate is remarkably high. This raises the possibility that the +1T base is held by the enzyme in the unpaired state in the absence of an acceptor strand. What purpose might disruption of the +1T:A base pair serve during the topoisomerase reaction? We speculate that this structural distortion permits access of key functional groups on the topoisomerase to the 5′-OH end of the cleaved strand, the 3′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate, or the noncleaved strand opposite the nick and that these interactions may be necessary to control the strand passage step. In other words, unpairing the +1T base would open a conformational gate. A clearer picture of the disposition of the vaccinia protein on the DNA will be needed before these ideas can be tested. Conformational changes during topoisomerization need not be confined to the DNA substrate; indeed, the occurrence of protein conformational changes is likely in a reaction as complicated as DNA relaxation (Lima et al., 12Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Google Scholar; Sekiguchi and Shuman, 18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 31731-31734Google Scholar, 20Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Google Scholar). We suspect that disruption of base-pairing interactions upon covalent binding of topoisomerases to DNA are not be unique to the vaccinia protein. A similar mechanism may apply to the eukaryotic cellular type I topoisomerases, which are closely related structurally and functionally to the vaccinia enzyme, and perhaps to the recombinases, which, although structurally distinct, employ a broadly similar transesterification reaction mechanism involving a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosine-DNA intermediate. The vaccinia topoisomerase functionally resembles the recombinases with respect to its ability to promote sequence-specific recombination in vivo and to resolve recombination intermediates in vitro (Shuman, 25Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88 (c): 10104-10108Google Scholar; Sekiguchi et al., 22Sekiguchi J. Seeman N.C. Shuman S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 785-789Google Scholar). When potassium permanganate was used to probe the complex of FLP recombinase bound to its DNA target site, no evidence was obtained for unpairing of thymines located 3′ of the scissile bond (Panigrahi et al., 16Panigrahi G.B. Beatty L.G. Sadowski P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5827-5935Google Scholar); this is consistent with our findings for the vaccinia topoisomerase-DNA complex. However, because the nucleotide immediately 5′ of the scissile bond in the FLP target site is a cytosine, permanganate probing would not have revealed the type of specific unpairing that we encountered with the vaccinia protein. In summary, our data show that covalent binding of vaccinia topoisomerase to DNA elicits a structural distortion 5′ of the scissile bond, manifest by accessibility of +1T to permanganate oxidation. Loss of T:A base pairing is confined to the +1-position; no evidence for disruption of the adjacent +2T:A or −1A:T base pairs was obtained. Note that this highly localized effect differs from the more extensive structural changes detected by permanganate probing of the open complex of RNA polymerase bound at a promoter or the complex of SV40 T antigen bound at the replication origin (Sasse-Dwight and Gralla, 17Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Google Scholar; Borowiec and Hurwitz, 2Borowiec J.A. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3149-3158Google Scholar). Thus, hyperreactivity to permanganate at +1T in the topoisomerase-DNA complex is more likely to reflect protein-induced kinking of the DNA at or near the site of strand scission rather than duplex DNA melting, as invoked for RNA polymerase. Our results can also be accommodated by the DNA base-flipping paradigm described for HhaI DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase. In the crystal structure of HhaI methyltransferase chemically trapped as the covalent enzyme-DNA reaction intermediate, the target cytosine base is flipped completely out of the helix (Klimasauskas et al., 11Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Google Scholar). Of course, without a crystal structure for the vaccinia topoisomerase bound covalently to DNA, we cannot tell if the topoisomerase flips the +1T out of the helix or whether the structural distortion at the +1-position is more subtle."

In this process, RuvA acts as a specificity factor that targets RuvB, a hexameric ring motor protein, to the junction. Because elevated concentrations of RuvB can promote branch migration in the absence of RuvA, it has been suggested that RuvA acts as a molecular matchmaker. In the studies presented here, we compared the requirements for RuvAB- and RuvB-mediated branch migration reactions and found that reactions catalyzed by RuvB alone were highly sensitive to inhibition by NaCl, temperature, ADP, and ATPγS. Our observations indicate that the two reactions occur by distinct mechanisms and support the notion that RuvAB-mediated branch migration is physiologically more relevant than that catalyzed by RuvB. We also show that ongoing RuvAB-mediated branch migration reactions were blocked by the addition of polyclonal antibodies raised against RuvA. The role of RuvA is therefore unlikely to be restricted to RuvB targeting; instead, it is required continually during branch migration. Competition with excess synthetic Holliday junctions, sufficient to sequester released RuvA, failed to cause an immediate block and leads us to suggest that RuvAB promote branch migration by a processive mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2135828555,"Nuclear hormone receptors bind to hormone response elements in DNA consisting of two half-sites of 6 base pairs. The P-box amino acids of each receptor determine the identities of the central nucleotides of the half-site. 57 P-box variants of the human thyroid hormone receptor (hT3Rβ) were used to demonstrate the relationship between P-box sequence and DNA binding specificity by homodimers and heterodimers formed with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In general, the formation of heterodimers relieved many of the constraints on the compatibility of hT3Rβ P-box sequences with DNA binding. Effects were most dramatic for heterodimers bound to a direct repeat spaced by four base pairs. RXR also overrides the P-box-derived DNA binding specificity of hT3Rβ when heterodimers are bound to inverted or everted repeat elements. These effects of RXR are most pronounced on AGGCA half-sites but are squelched when the RXR partner of the heterodimer is bound to an AGGCA half-site. The influence of RXR on hT3Rβ DNA binding specificity varies with the orientation of half-sites in the element, the identity of the fourth base pair of the half-site, and the spacing between the half-sites of direct repeats. These differences suggest that the DNA binding domains of RXR-hT3Rβ heterodimers are not positioned equivalently on the various elements, affecting the manner in which the P-box amino acids of hT3Rβ interact with base pairs within the half-site."
https://openalex.org/W1976043160,"Previous studies (Sivaram, P., Choi, S. Y., Curtiss, L. K., and Goldberg, I. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9409-9412) from this laboratory showed that the NH2-terminal region of apoB (NTAB) has binding domains for lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL binding to endothelial cells, we hypothesize, involves interaction both with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and with a protein that has homology to NTAB. To test whether cell-surface NTAB would increase the amount and affinity of LPL binding to cells, we produced stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that have NTAB anchored to the cell surface. A cDNA encoding the amino-terminal 17% of apoB (apoB17) was fused to a cDNA coding for the last 37 amino acids of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which contains the signal for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The fused construct was sequence-verified and cloned into expression vector pCMV5. The pCMV5-apoB17-DAF plasmid was cotransfected with a neomycin resistance gene into wild-type (WT) cells and mutant heparan sulfate proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (745 cells), and stable cell lines were established. Expression of apoB17 on the cell surface was confirmed by the release of apoB17 by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. LPL binding to WT and apoB17-DAF-transfected cells was determined. Using 0.8-6 µg of LPL, 1.3-2.2-fold more LPL associated with apoB17-DAF WT cells compared with WT cells; apoB17-DAF also increased LPL binding to 745 cells. After heparinase treatment, LPL binding to apoB17-DAF cells was still greater than to treated WT cells. This increased binding to apoB17-DAF cells was almost abolished by treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. LPL dissociated from WT cells with k−1 = 2.55 × 10−2 min−1, whereas LPL dissociated more slowly from apoB17-DAF-containing cells with k−1 = 1.08 × 10−2 min−1. Furthermore, almost 95% of the LPL on WT cells was dissociated by 1 M NaCl, while only 65% of the LPL dissociated from apoB17-DAF cells at the same high salt concentration. Similarly, in high salt, more LPL remained associated with apoB17-DAF cells than with nontransfected 745 cells. These data show that NTAB on cell surfaces can function as a LPL-binding protein. Moreover, they demonstrate that LPL association with cells can be increased by simultaneously binding to both proteoglycan and non-proteoglycan binding sites. Previous studies (Sivaram, P., Choi, S.

It is widely believed that LPL binds to endothelial cells via an electrostatic interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (2Cheng C.F. Oosta G.M. Bensadoun A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12893-12896Google Scholar, 3Shimada K. Gill P.J. Sillbert J.E. Douglas W.H.J. Fanberg B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 995-1002Google Scholar, 4Wang I.P. Jaffe E.A. Brown W.V.

Earlier studies from this laboratory suggested that LPL binding to endothelial cells also involves a 116-kDa non-proteoglycan LPL-binding protein (6Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar, 7Stins M.F. Sivaram P. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1853-1861Google Scholar). The 116-kDa LPL-binding protein has homology to the NH2-terminal region of apoB (NTAB) (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that endothelial cells synthesize a full-length apoB protein and process it to generate the 116-kDa LPL-binding fragment (10Sivaram P. Vanni-Reyes T.

Several lines of evidence suggested that LPL interacts with NTAB. Ligand blotting of apoB fragments generated by thrombin digestion of LDL showed that labeled LPL bound specifically to NTAB. In addition, LPL bound to NH2-terminal fragments obtained from apoB-transfected CHO cells (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). 125I-LPL binding to endothelial cells was inhibited by antibodies to NH2-terminal regions of apoB, but not by antibodies that recognize epitopes closer to the carboxyl terminus of apoB. Based on these data, it was hypothesized that NTAB mediates LPL binding to cells and may confer specificity to LPL binding to endothelial cells. The amino-terminal region of apoB is relatively hydrophilic. Models of LDL suggest that NTAB extends away from the lipid core (9Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Google Scholar). Similarly, NTAB on the surface of a cell would not be expected to be buried within the cellular phospholipid bilayer and thus should be available to interact with LPL. Cells that overexpress truncated apoB fragments have been generated by other investigators. These cells, however, either secrete the small NH2-terminal fragments of apoB or degrade them intracellularly (11Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Google Scholar, 12Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.L. Humiston P. Davis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Google Scholar, 13Herscovitz H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Walsh M.T. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7313-7317Google Scholar). Thus, these cells cannot be used to assess cell-surface actions of NTAB. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a 70-kDa protein that contains sequences for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment in the carboxyl-terminal region (14Caras I.W. Weddell G.W. Davitz M.A. Nussenzweig V. Matin Jr., D.W. Science. 1987; 238: 1280-1283Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that NTAB can function as a LPL-binding protein, we generated several CHO cell lines that overexpress NTAB as a fusion protein with a 37-amino acid peptide of DAF such that apoB was expressed as a GPI-anchored membrane protein. Our results show that NTAB present on cell surfaces mediates high affinity LPL binding. Na125I was obtained from Amersham Corp.; 48-well plates were from Falcon (Oxnard, CA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), heparin, heparinase, and heparitinase were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Coon's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12; 1:1) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Prepacked PD-10 (Sephadex G-25) columns and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Heparin-agarose and horseradish peroxidase-staining reagent were from Bio-Rad. Anti-apoB polyclonal antibody, sheep anti-human apoB antiserum, and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep Ig were from Boehringer Mannheim. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC; Staphylococcus aureus) was a gift from Dr. Martin G. Low (Columbia University). Anti-apoB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. L. Curtiss (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type (WT) CHO cells and mutant CHO 745 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey D. Esko (University of Alabama at Birmingham). CHO 745 cells have 6% of normal HSPG (15Esko J.D. Sternart T.E. Yaylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar). The pCMV5-apoB17-transfected CHO cells was obtained from Drs. X. Wu and H. Ginsberg (Columbia University). All the CHO cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Conditioned medium, i.e. medium from cells grown in the absence of serum, was prepared by incubating the cells overnight in DMEM/F-12 containing 3% BSA. The medium was then filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane, concentrated, and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The apoB17 expression plasmid (pCMV5-apoB17) was from Dr. Z. M. Yao. The pUC plasmid containing DAF cDNA was provided by Dr. I. W. Caras (Genentech, Inc.). The sequence for the GPI anchor of DAF (nucleotides 1139-1621) was released by digestion with XmnI/EcoRV and ligated to the blunted MluI site of the 3′-terminus of apoB17 cDNA in pCMV5, shown in Fig. 1. The pCMV5-apoB17-DAF plasmid construct was verified by sequencing. 24 h before transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated in 75-cm2 culture flasks (1-2 × 106 cells/flask). Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16Murray E.J. Gene Transfer Expression Protocols. Vol. 7. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 245-257Google Scholar). Attached cells were transfected by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 2 ml of a calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitate containing 20 µg of pCMV5-apoB17-DAF plasmid DNA, 1 µg of SV2NEO selection maker, and 20 µM chloroquine. After 6 h, the cells were washed once, and fresh medium was added. After incubation for 48 h, fresh medium containing G418 (40 µg/ml) was added. The medium containing G418 was replaced every 48 h for 2-3 weeks. Then individual colonies were isolated using micropipette tips and transferred to 24-well plates (16Murray E.J. Gene Transfer Expression Protocols. Vol. 7. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 245-257Google Scholar). High expression clones were selected by Western blotting. Either conditioned media or total cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation. Total cell extracts were prepared from WT and transfected cells by incubation in cell extraction buffer (2 M sucrose, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 µM EDTA, 0.2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 1 µg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin) for 4-16 h. Conditioned media were collected, concentrated to ~0.5 ml, and diluted with an equal volume of cell extraction buffer. Cell extracts and media were incubated overnight at 4°C with 0.05 volume of 1:50 diluted anti-apoB polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with 0.05 volume of 10% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 3 h. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 100 µl of sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Released proteins were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody as described previously (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were treated with 1 unit/ml PIPLC, and released fractions were immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose strips were incubated with the antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature, washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The peroxidase reaction was developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (peroxidase substrate) as described (6Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar). LPL was purified from fresh bovine milk according to the method of Socorro et al. (17Socorro L. Green C.C. Jackson R.L. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 133-143Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C. Enzyme protein was measured by the method of Bradford et al. (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Enzyme activity was measured using a glycerol-containing triolein emulsion (19Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Google Scholar) as described previously (20Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17516-17521Google Scholar). LPL was radioiodinated using glucose oxidase and lactoperoxidase as described (6Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar). 125I-LPL (750-1000 cpm/ng) was stored in 0.1% BSA at −70°C. CHO cells or transfected CHO cells were incubated with DMEM/F-12/BSA (3%) containing various concentrations of 125I-LPL (0.05-10 µg) at 4°C for 2 h in the absence or presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled LPL. After 2 h, the cells were washed, and the cell surface-associated LPL was released with DMEM/F-12/BSA (3%) containing 100 units/ml heparin for 30 min at 4°C as described previously (21Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12880-12886Google Scholar). Specific binding was defined as the difference between binding in the absence or presence of unlabeled ligand. CHO cells or transfected CHO cells were incubated with DMEM/BSA (3%) containing 1 unit/ml heparinase and 0.1 unit/ml heparitinase (Sigma) or 1 unit/ml PIPLC at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with cold DMEM/BSA (0.3%) and incubated with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL at 4°C for 2 h. Cell surface-associated LPL was determined as described above. For antibody experiments, cells were preincubated with a 1:500 dilution of mAb19 ascites at 4°C for 2 h, and then 125I-LPL was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1.5 µg/ml. For heparin experiments, 0.1-10 µg/ml heparin was added with 125I-LPL to the cells. Confluent cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL as described above, and then the media were removed and replaced with DMEM/F-12/BSA (3%) containing 75 µg/ml unlabeled LPL or no LPL. Media were collected at various time points to assess LPL dissociation, and the dissociation rates were determined from the computer-generated regression lines as described previously (22Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Google Scholar). For some experiments, the above media were removed, and the cells were washed twice with DMEM/F-12/BSA (3%) containing different concentrations of NaCl (0-2 M). The 125I-LPL released and that remaining on the surface were determined as described (21Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12880-12886Google Scholar). 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL was allowed to bind to cells for 2 h at 4°C as described above. The cells were washed and incubated with fresh DMEM/F-12/BSA (3%) at 37°C. Cell surface-associated LPL was released with 100 units/ml heparin in DMEM/BSA (3%) for 30 min at 4°C, and intracellular LPL was assessed by solubilizing cells with 0.1 N NaOH. LPL degradation in the media was assessed by measuring the trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts as described (21Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12880-12886Google Scholar). The apoB17-DAF construct was cotransfected with the Neor gene into WT CHO and mutant CHO 745 cells. Stable transfectants were then selected in G418. To assess the expression of apoB17 and apoB17-DAF, transfected cells and conditioned media were collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Nontransfected cells (WT CHO) did not express apoB (lane 1). ApoB17-transfected cells secreted apoB17 into the media (lane 2), although a portion of apoB that probably represents intracellular apoB17 was still associated with the cells. ApoB17-DAF-transfected WT and 745 cells expressed apoB17 as a cell-associated protein (lanes 3 and 4), and no apoB17 was detected in the media. These results show that in apoB17-DAF cells, apoB17 was cell-associated. We next tested whether cell-associated apoB17-DAF was on the cell surface and was anchored by a GPI anchor. ApoB17-DAF WT and 745 cells were incubated with 1 unit/ml PIPLC for 1 h at 37°C, and the released proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-apoB polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2B). PIPLC treatment released (media) a portion of the apoB17 from apoB17-DAF-transfected WT (lane 3) and 745 (lane 4) cells. There was some apoB17 still associated with apoB17-DAF WT and 745 cells even after treatment with PIPLC. This may represent the intracellular pool of proteins that are in the process of transport to the plasma membrane. Thus, these results show that apoB17-DAF was expressed on the cell surface of the transfected CHO cells and was anchored via a GPI moiety. We next tested whether LPL binding to apoB17-containing cells was increased. WT CHO and apoB17-DAF cells were incubated with 0.05-6 µg of 125I-LPL in the presence or absence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled LPL at 4°C for 2 h. Specific binding was defined as the difference between binding in the presence and absence of unlabeled LPL. At LPL concentrations of 0.8-6 µg/ml, the amount of LPL (5.2-57.1 ng/106 cells) associated with apoB17-DAF WT cells was 33-115% higher than the amount of LPL (3.9-26.5 ng/106 cells) associated with WT cells (Fig. 3A). 2.8-25 ng of 125I-LPL/106 cells specifically bound to the apoB17-DAF 745 cells when 0.2-6 µg/ml LPL was included in the medium (Fig. 3B). In contrast, CHO 745 cells, which have neither HSPG nor apoB, had no specific binding (Fig. 3B). For this reason, the 745 cells were not used in subsequent experiments. Specific binding to apoB was estimated in two ways: 1) as the amount of LPL on apoB17-DAF WT cells minus the amount of LPL on WT cells and 2) as the specific binding of LPL to apoB17-DAF 745 cells. These two estimates gave comparable results, i.e. at 6 µg/ml LPL, 25 ng of LPL/106 cells bound to apoB17-DAF 745 cells, while the difference in LPL binding between apoB17-DAF WT cells and WT cells was 30.6 ng/106 cells. LPL binding to apoB17-transfected cells was also assessed. ApoB17 cells bound the same amount of LPL as WT cells (data not shown). Therefore, cell-surface apoB led to a significant increase in the amount of LPL that associated with WT and HSPG-deficient cells. To further confirm that the increased binding to the apoB17-DAF cells was due to the apoB and not to an alteration in cell-surface HSPG, confluent monolayers of cells were treated with 1 unit/ml heparinase and 0.1 unit/ml heparitinase or with 1 unit/ml PIPLC at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed and incubated with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL at 4°C for 2 h, and the total amount of heparin-releasable cell-surface LPL was assessed as described under “Materials and Methods.” ApoB17-DAF WT cells bound 14.7 ng/106 cells (48%) more LPL than WT CHO cells (45.6 ± 1.9 versus 30.9 ± 0.6 ng/106 cells) (Fig. 4A). After heparinase/heparitinase treatment, apoB17-DAF WT cells still bound 17.2 ng/106 cells (103%) more 125I-LPL than WT cells. The increased binding was comparable to the difference in LPL binding between untreated apoB17-DAF WT and WT cells, suggesting that the increased binding was not due to increased HSPG. Pretreatment with PIPLC did not affect 125I-LPL binding to WT cells, but decreased 125I-LPL binding to apoB17-DAF WT cells by 44%, making the amount of LPL binding to these cells almost comparable to that to WT cells. The effect of anti-apoB mAb19, which recognizes NTAB, on LPL binding to cells was also assessed. Cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of mAb19 ascites at 4°C for 2 h, and 125I-LPL binding to cells was determined as described “Materials and Methods.” mAb19 did not affect 125I-LPL binding to WT cells, but decreased 125I-LPL binding to apoB17-DAF cells by 30%. A control experiment was also performed using monoclonal antibody 47, which binds to a region of apoB not within apoB17. This antibody did not affect LPL association with the apoB17-DAF cells (data not shown). These results suggest that NTAB on cell surfaces can function as a LPL-binding protein. A similar series of experiments were performed using apoB17-DAF CHO 745 cells. As expected, heparinase treatment had no effect on LPL binding to the cells (Fig. 4B). Since a greater percent of the LPL binding to these cells should have been via NTAB, not surprisingly, the effects of PIPLC and anti-apoB antibodies were more marked. Both treatments reduced total (specific plus nonspecific) binding to the cells by ~50%. Therefore, a greater percent of LPL association with the cells was due to NTAB in HSPG-deficient cells versus apoB17-DAF WT cells. Previous studies with basic fibroblast growth factor, which has both proteoglycan and non-proteoglycan receptors, showed that binding to HSPG was more sensitive to heparin than binding to a non-HSPG receptor (22Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Google Scholar). We tested the effect of heparin on 125I-LPL binding to cells to determine if this was also true for LPL. In the presence of 1 µg/ml heparin, binding of 125I-LPL to all three cell types was almost abolished (Fig. 4, A and B). LPL binding to cells was then assessed using heparin concentrations of 0.1-10 µg/ml. 125I-LPL binding was similar between control and transfected cells at every concentration (data not shown). Thus, it appears that unlike basic fibroblast growth factor binding, LPL binding to both HSPG and NTAB is heparin-sensitive. We assessed the dissociation of LPL bound to WT and transfected cells. Cells were incubated with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL for 2 h at 4°C to equilibrate cellular binding sites, washed, and then incubated with fresh medium containing either a 0- or 50-fold excess of unlabeled LPL. At various times, the amount of 125I-LPL remaining on the cells was assessed, and the dissociation rates were obtained from the computer-generated regression lines. If no unlabeled LPL was included in the medium, 125I-LPL release was slow and reached an equilibrium in 1 h, with 70% of the initial amount still bound on the surface (Fig. 5). Presumably, 125I-LPL that dissociated from one binding site was able to rapidly rebind to another unoccupied low affinity site when these sites were not saturated. When an excess of unlabeled LPL was included in the medium to saturate all LPL-binding sites, 125I-LPL release was rapid. In the presence of excess unlabeled LPL, the time required for the loss of one-half of the initial cell-surface 125I-LPL from WT cells was ~17.9 min (k−1 = 2.55 × 10−2 min−1) (Fig. 5A). The half-life of cell-surface 125I-LPL on apoB17-DAF WT cells was ~43.1 min (k−1 = 1.08 × 10−2 min−1) (Fig. 5B), which was more than twice that on WT cells. The half-life for apoB17-DAF 745 cells was 41.5 min (k−1 = 1.09 × 10−2 min−1), close to that for apoB17-DAF WT cells. These data further suggest that apoB mediates high affinity binding of LPL and that LPL binding to apoB is at a higher affinity than its binding to HSPG alone. The previous experiment suggested that apoB has a higher affinity for LPL than does HSPG. However, as mentioned above, this could not be discriminated by heparin. Hence, we used different concentrations of NaCl to discriminate between binding to HSPG and NTAB. Cells were incubated with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL at 4°C for 2 h. Unbound LPL was removed, and cells were washed with different concentrations of NaCl. The remaining cell-surface binding was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The effect of NaCl on 125I-LPL binding was concentration-dependent. 125I-LPL dissociation increased with increased NaCl concentration and reached an equilibrium at higher salt concentrations (1-2 M) (Fig. 6). At this higher NaCl concentration, in WT CHO cells, <2% of the original cell-associated LPL remained. In contrast, apoB17-DAF WT cells retained 33.4 ± 2.8% at 1 M NaCl and 20.7 ± 1.5% at 2 M NaCl. Similarly, of the initially bound LPL, apoB17-DAF 745 cells retained 42 ± 1.1% at 1 M NaCl and 39.6 ± 1.6% at 2 M NaCl. These results show that 125I-LPL on the surface of WT cells can be completely released by 1-2 M NaCl. In contrast, apoB, when present on the CHO cell surface, mediates high affinity binding that is more resistant to high salt. We next determined whether cell-surface apoB affects the internalization and degradation of cell-surface LPL. WT CHO and apoB17-DAF WT and 745 cells were incubated with 1.5 µg/ml 125I-LPL at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were then washed, and 125I-LPL internalized and degraded at 37°C was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Table I, in this experiment, 1.5-fold more LPL associated with apoB17-DAF WT than WT cell surfaces. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, 31% of the cell-surface LPL was internalized by WT cells, and only 21% remained on the cell surface. In contrast, apoB17-DAF 745 cells had relatively more LPL (29%) remaining on the cell surface and less LPL inside the cells (17%). An almost equal amount of LPL was found inside the cells (26%) and on the cell surface (23%) of apoB17-DAF WT cells. WT and apoB17-DAF cells degraded approximately the same amount of LPL. If calculated as a percent of the original cell-surface LPL, however, the apoB17-DAF cells actually degraded a smaller amount of LPL than the WT cells (7.3 versus 10.6%). ApoB17-DAF 745 cells degraded the least amount of 125I-LPL, 0.8 ± 0.04 mg/106 cells or 3% of the original cell-surface LPL. These results show that cell-surface apoB was less effective at targeting LPL to a degradation pathway than cell-surface HSPG. Thus, compared with HSPG, LPL associated with cell-surface apoB was more stable and less likely to be degraded.Table IUptake and degradation of LPLCellsTotal bindingSurfaceIntracellularDegradationWT35.7 ± 0.67.37 ± 0.411.2 ± 0.883.8 ± 1.11% of initial binding10020.631.410.6ApoB17-DAF WT52.75 ± 1.912.3 ± 1.713.6 ± 1.033.79 ± 0.13% of initial binding10023.325.87.2ApoB17-DAF 74526.56 ± 1.577.3 ± 0.364.4 ± 0.240.77 ± 0.04% of initial binding10027.517.23.0 Open table in a new tab Our experiments show that NTAB on the surface of cells can mediate the association of LPL with the cells and that the LPL-NTAB association is more stable than the LPL-HSPG association. To show this, we first produced an apoB17 DNA fragment that was fused to the 37 amino acids of DAF. When transfected into CHO cells, apoB17-DAF was expressed on the cell surface and released by treatment of cells with PIPLC, which specifically cleaves the GPI anchor. ApoB17-DAF-transfected WT and HSPG-deficient cells were then used to test the hypothesis that NTAB mediates LPL binding. Cell-surface NTAB increased the amount, the affinity, and the stability of LPL associated with the surface of CHO cells. Cells expressing NTAB bound up to 2.2-fold more LPL than WT cells. Several experiments were done to prove that the increased binding was due to NTAB. 1) The increased binding was abolished by PIPLC treatment. 2) Heparinase had no significant effect on the increased binding. 3) The increased binding was inhibited by mAb19, which recognizes the amino-terminal region of apoB. LPL-apoB binding was of a higher affinity than LPL-HSPG binding. Binding to cell-surface HSPG in WT cells was rapidly reversible (k−1 for LPL binding to HSPG = 2.55 × 10−2 min−1). In contrast, LPL dissociation from apoB-containing cells was much slower (k−1 = 1.08 × 10−2 min−1). This suggests that LPL associates more tightly with apoB. Previous studies with basic fibroblast growth factor showed differential sensitivity of high and low affinity binding sites to heparin (22Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Google Scholar). We, however, failed to detect such differences at heparin concentrations ranging from as low as 0.1 to 10 µg/ml. A very likely explanation for this is that both LPL-HSPG and LPL-apoB interactions are sensitive to heparin. LPL has several putative heparin-binding domains (23Berryman D.E. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3272-3276Google Scholar, 24Hata A. Ridinger D.N. Sutherland S. Emi M. Zhang S. Myers R.L. Ren K. Cheng T. Inoue I. Wilson D.E. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8447-8457Google Scholar, 25Ma Y. Henderson H.E. Liu M.S. Zhang H. Forsyth I.J. Clarke-Lewis I. Hayden M.R. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2049-2059Google Scholar), one of which may be involved in apoB binding, thus making it sensitive to heparin. NTAB by itself also binds heparin (6Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar, 8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that heparin prevents LPL from binding to apoB. A second method to show the relative stability of the LPL-NTAB and LPL-HSPG interactions was used. LPL purification commonly includes an affinity chromatography step in which the LPL is dissociated from heparin using high concentrations of NaCl (17Socorro L. Green C.C. Jackson R.L. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 133-143Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether a similar concentration of NaCl would affect LPL-apoB association. At 1 M NaCl, most of the LPL-HSPG interaction was abolished, while significant association of LPL with apoB persisted. This was also found in experiments using apoB17-DAF 745 cells, which do not express HSPG. Thus, although not differentially sensitive to heparin, LPL-NTAB association was more resistant to salt. Although NTAB provided high affinity binding for LPL, it did not increase LPL degradation. Both WT and apoB17-DAF cells degraded only a small portion of LPL, <10%. Most of this LPL degradation was via a HSPG-mediated pathway. ApoB17-DAF 745 cells, which do not express HSPG, bound similar amounts of LPL as WT cells, but degraded much less LPL. Several studies have examined the metabolic fate of LPL in adipocytes (26Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Google Scholar, 27Cupp M.

Acta. 1983; 752: 106-117Google Scholar), and liver (30Chajek-Shaul T. Friedman G. Ziv E. Bar-On H. BengtssonOlivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 183-191Google Scholar, 31Vilaro S. Llobera M. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G711-G722Google Scholar). Cultured adipocytes and heart cells internalize and degrade LPL in the lysosomal compartment (26Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Google Scholar, 27Cupp M. Bensadoun A. Melford K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6383-6388Google Scholar, 29Friedman G. Chajck-Shaul T. Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 106-117Google Scholar). Similarly, when isolated rat livers are perfused with LPL-containing media, LPL is taken up and degraded (31Vilaro S. Llobera M. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G711-G722Google Scholar). Cultured endothelial cells, however, do not degrade LPL significantly compared with the above-mentioned cell types (21Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12880-12886Google Scholar, 32Friedman G. Chajck-Shaul T. Olivecrona T. Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 711: 114-122Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that endothelial cells internalize LPL, store it in a non-lysosomal acidic compartment (endocytotic vesicle), and then recycle the LPL either to the medium or the cell surface (21Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12880-12886Google Scholar). Based on the present study showing that apoB-expressing CHO cells degrade only a small portion of LPL and our recent observation that endothelial cells have NTAB (6Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar, 8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar), we hypothesize that apoB on the surface of endothelial cells provides a high affinity LPL-binding site that stabilizes LPL activity and delays its release into the bloodstream and eventual catabolism in the liver (33Wallinder L. Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 166-173Google Scholar). A number of proteins that bind to cell-surface HSPG also have a second non-proteoglycan receptor. They include basic fibroblast growth factor (34Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 35Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Google Scholar). These proteins bind to HSPG with low affinity, but with high capacity. This initial binding is often necessary for the subsequent binding to the higher affinity non-proteoglycan receptor. Such a scenario is to some extent also true for LPL. LDL receptor-related protein can bind LPL and mediate its uptake and degradation (43Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Google Scholar, 43Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Endothelial cells, on the other hand, do not express LDL receptor-related protein (28Lupu F. Heim D. Bachmann F. Kruithof E.K. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1438-1444Google Scholar). Previous results from this laboratory showed that endothelial cells contain a 116-kDa LPL-binding protein that has sequence homology to NTAB (8Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). By employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and metabolic labeling, we further demonstrated that endothelial cells synthesize apoB mRNA and protein (10Sivaram P. Vanni-Reyes T. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15261-15266Google Scholar). Our studies also showed that the 116-kDa LPL-binding NTAB is generated by proteolysis of full-length apoB. Thus, NTAB is in a position to interact with LPL on the endothelial cell surface. We postulate, based on our current data, that NTAB increases the affinity of LPL binding to cells. Moreover, a dual molecular interaction of LPL with both HSPG and NTAB leads to the most stable association of LPL with cells. In the turbulent in vivo environment along the luminal endothelial surface, maintenance of high concentrations of LPL might require such dual interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1968287790,"Abstract A hammerhead ribozyme designed to cleave the yeast ADE1 mRNA has been expressed in yeast under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. RNA prepared from the galactose-induced yeast cultures possesses an activity that cleaves ADE1 mRNA in vitro. However, in spite of high expression levels of the ribozyme, no cleavage activity could be demonstrated in vivo. On the other hand, when the yeast cells expressing hammerhead RNA were treated with the α-factor mating pheromone, the level of ADE1 mRNA was reduced by 50%. Similar reductions were observed when this strain was cultured in the presence of lithium acetate or in nitrogen-free medium. Moreover, control experiments in which disabled hammerhead genes were expressed showed no such reductions. Extension of the length of the flanking recognition arms of the ribozyme from a total of 10 to 16 or 24 nucleotides diminished the inhibitory effect of the ribozyme. These data suggest that ribozymes are able to cleave a trans-RNA target in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2008990338,"Folding of polypeptides emerging from the protein translocase in the membrane of mammalian microsomes was analyzed after synthesis of corresponding precursor proteins in a mammalian translation system. Firefly luciferase was used as a model protein; the corresponding hybrid precursor contained the preprolactin signal peptide. The rates and efficiencies of folding of luciferase in microsomes were compared with those of folding of luciferase in the cytosol. Furthermore, folding of luciferase in microsomes was compared with that in proteoliposomes, i.e. in the absence of luminal molecular chaperones and folding catalysts. Folding in microsomes was less efficient compared with folding in the cytosol.

Thus, firefly luciferase emerging from translocase can efficiently fold to its native conformation without chaperoning by any luminal proteins.

Little is known about protein folding and subunit assembly in the various compartments of the eukaryotic cell following de novo synthesis of polypeptides. Nevertheless, the latter is generally assumed to be assisted by molecular chaperones and folding catalysts (Ellis and van der Vies, 3Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev.

Recently, various laboratories started to address questions related to protein folding either in the mammalian cytosol, by employing rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a translation and folding system (Frydman et al., 4Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar; Kruse et al., 13Kruse M. Brunke M. Escher A. Szalay A.A. Tropschug M. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2588-2594Google Scholar), or in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, by employing rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a translation system and dog pancreas microsomes as a folding system (Marquart et al., 15Marquart T. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19618-19625Google Scholar). 1Brunke, M., Dierks, T., Schlotterhose, P., Escher, A., Schmidt, B., Szalay, A. A., Lechter, M., Sandholzer, U., and Zimmermann, R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, in press. Specifically, it was asked what are the folding mechanisms of model proteins such as light-emitting luciferases (Frydman et al., 4Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar; Kolb et al., 12Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Google Scholar; Kruse et al., 13Kruse M. Brunke M. Escher A. Szalay A.A. Tropschug M. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2588-2594Google Scholar).1 The first luciferase is a heterodimeric enzyme from Vibrio harveyi, and the second luciferase is a monomeric enzyme from the firefly. It was observed that (i) folding of monomeric luciferase depends on a highly organized chaperone machinery comprising Hsp40, Hsp60, and Hsp70 in the mammalian cytosol (Frydman et al., 4Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar) and that (ii) heterodimeric luciferase involves ATP-dependent molecular chaperones and peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases in its folding and assembly in the mammalian cytosol (Kruse et al., 13Kruse M. Brunke M. Escher A. Szalay A.A. Tropschug M. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2588-2594Google Scholar) as well as in mammalian microsomes.1 To investigate whether microsomal molecular chaperones or folding catalysts can functionally substitute for the cytosolic chaperone machinery involving Hsp60, we here addressed questions related to folding of firefly luciferase in mammalian microsomes by employing rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a translation system and dog pancreas microsomes as a folding compartment. Firefly luciferase was specifically used here as a model protein in order to look at general phenomena, i.e. to exclude from the analysis molecular chaperones and folding catalysts that are specific for glycoproteins and disulfide-containing proteins (Helenius et al., 9Helenius A. Marquart T. Braakman I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 227-231Google Scholar; Bergeron et al., 1Bergeron J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Buchler. Cholate was purchased from Calbiochem. BspEI was from New England Biolabs Inc. All other restriction enzymes, DNA-modifying enzymes, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. SP6 polymerase, plasmid pGEMluc, and luciferase assay reagent were from Promega. X-ray films (X-Omat AR) were from Eastman Kodak Co. Plasmids pCA37 (containing the SP6 promoter, the preprocecropin A signal peptide, and a unique BspEI site) and pCA38 (containing the SP6 promoter, the preprolactin signal peptide, and a unique BspEI site) were as described (Schlenstedt et al., 17Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24328-24332Google Scholar). For construction of plasmids coding for pLuc, 2The abbreviations used are: pLucartificial precursor of luciferaseLucfirefly luciferasegLucglycosylated luciferaseCsAcyclosporin ABiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein. the Luc coding region within pGEMluc was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and simultaneously, a piece of DNA was “added on,” which introduced a unique BspEI site upstream of the original initiating methionine. The polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into plasmid pSP65, resulting in plasmid pML21. A BspEI/StuI fragment, derived from pML21, was inserted into plasmids pCA37 and pCA38, which had been cleaved with BspEI and PvuII, resulting in plasmids pMB10 and pMB9, respectively. All plasmid constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. artificial precursor of luciferase firefly luciferase glycosylated luciferase cyclosporin A immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein. The preparation of proteoliposomes began with ribosome-depleted microsomes, which were obtained by puromycin/high salt treatment of rough microsomes. Proteoliposomes were produced as described previously1 according to the protocol of Görlich and Rapoport (7Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Google Scholar). Transcripts of the plasmids were used to synthesize the respective proteins in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine (final concentration of 1.4 mCi/ml) or in the presence of unlabeled methionine following the supplier's recommendations. Where indicated, dog pancreas microsomes or proteoliposomes were present during the translation. Dog pancreas microsomes and proteoliposomes were prepared as described (Schlenstedt et al., 16Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Google Scholar).1 To prevent N-linked glycosylation of luciferases in microsomes, the acceptor peptide Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (final concentration of 0.1 mM) was present simultaneously. The acceptor peptide was synthesized as described previously.1 Reisolation of microsomes was carried out as described previously (Schlenstedt et al., 16Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Google Scholar). Radiolabeled translation products were analyzed by electrophoresis on high Tris/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Schlenstedt et al., 16Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Google Scholar). The gels were treated with 1 M sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. Densitometric analysis was performed with an LKB Ultrascan XL laser densitometer. Unlabeled translation products were analyzed for luciferase activity with luciferase assay reagent. Specifically, 2.5 µl of translation mixture were transferred into a luminometer vial and supplemented with 50 µl of luciferase assay reagent and 2.5 µl of 2% Triton X-100. The vial was immediately transferred into a luminometer (Berthold Model LB 9501), and bioluminescence was measured for 10 s as relative light units. Enzyme activities are given as relative light units × 10−3. The cDNA coding for firefly luciferase was used for the construction of three artificial cDNAs. One coded for a luciferase with an additional tetrapeptide (Met-Ala-Pro-Asp) in front of the initiating methionine of firefly luciferase. The other two cDNAs coded for hybrid precursor proteins that comprised either the preprocecropin A signal peptide, the first amino acid residue of procecropin A (Ala), a dipeptide (Pro-Asp), and luciferase or the preprolactin signal peptide, the first amino acid residue of prolactin (Thr), a dipeptide (Pro-Asp), and luciferase. Thus, in both precursor constructs, the original cleavage site of either preprocecropin A or preprolactin for signal peptidase was preserved. We note that there are three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation in luciferase. Transcripts of the plasmids coding for luciferase (Luc) and the two related precursor proteins (pLuc) were used to program translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence or presence of dog pancreas microsomes. According to the accepted rules for cotranslational amino-terminal processing in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, the signal peptide-free luciferase can be expected to contain the amino-terminal tetrapeptide Ac-Ala-Pro-Asp-Met (Met represents the initiating methionine of firefly luciferase) (Kendall et al., 10Kendall R.L. Yamada R. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 398-407Google Scholar). After processing by signal peptidase, the two luciferases can be expected to contain the amino-terminal tetrapeptides Ala-Pro-Asp-Met and Thr-Pro-Asp-Met, respectively (Schlenstedt et al., 16Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Google Scholar). To follow the efficiencies of synthesis and transport of the polypeptide chains, the translation reaction was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine, and aliquots of the translation or transport reactions were taken and subjected to sequestration analysis, followed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The polypeptides Luc and pLuc were synthesized in the absence of microsomes, in the presence of microsomes, or in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide that inhibits N-linked glycosylation (Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2) (Figs. 1A and 2A). After synthesis of Luc under these three conditions, a single translation product was detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 4, and 7). After synthesis of pLuc, comprising the preprolactin signal peptide, in the absence of microsomes, a single translation product was detected (Fig. 2A, lane 1) with the identical apparent molecular mass compared with Luc. Thus, the gels were unable to resolve pLuc and Luc (see below). After synthesis of pLuc in the presence of microsomes, two additional translation products were detected (Fig. 2A, lane 4), a major one that had a higher apparent molecular mass compared with pLuc (termed gLuc) and a minor one that had an intermediate apparent molecular mass compared with pLuc and gLuc. After synthesis of pLuc in the presence of microsomes and the inhibitory acceptor peptide, two translation products were detected (Fig. 2A, lane 7), a major product that had the identical apparent molecular mass compared with pLuc and Luc and a minor product that had an intermediate apparent molecular mass compared with pLuc and gLuc. Thus, in the presence of microsomes, pLuc was processed by signal peptidase (see below) and either glycosylated (resulting in gLuc) or not glycosylated (resulting in Luc) depending on the presence of the inhibitory acceptor peptide. We suggest that the translation product that had an intermediate apparent molecular mass compared with pLuc and gLuc corresponds to partially glycosylated Luc. The following data can be taken as evidence for the fact that transport of the precursor protein into the microsomes had occurred. (i) Signal peptide-free Luc was protease-sensitive under all conditions (Fig. 1A). (ii) The precursor protein pLuc, present in the absence of microsomes, was protease-sensitive in the absence and presence of detergent (Fig. 2A). (iii) The glycosylated (gLuc) and mature (Luc) proteins, observed in the presence of microsomes, were resistant to protease in the absence of detergent and protease-sensitive in the presence of detergent (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained by using precursor proteins that contained the preprocecropin A signal peptide instead of the preprolactin signal peptide (data not shown).Fig. 2Folding of Luc after synthesis of pLuc in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes. Transcripts of plasmid pMB9 were used to synthesize pLuc in rabbit reticulocyte lysate under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1. Protein synthesis, transport, and folding were evaluated and are shown as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the first set of folding experiments, the kinetics of synthesis of Luc and synthesis and transport of pLuc were compared with the kinetics of luciferase folding. We observed that luciferase folding was as fast as protein synthesis or synthesis and transport (data not shown). In the second set of folding experiments, Luc and pLuc were synthesized in the absence of microsomes, in the presence of microsomes, or in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide that inhibits N-linked glycosylation. According to the folding kinetics of Luc, efficient folding occurred in the absence as well as presence of microsomes and irrespective of whether the acceptor peptide was present or not (Fig. 1B). According to the folding kinetics of pLuc, efficient folding occurred only in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide (Fig. 2B). Apparently, the presence of the signal peptide as well as the glycosylation of the mature protein interfered with the folding reaction. This view was supported by fractionation and sequestration analysis, i.e. by the observations that after synthesis of Luc in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide, the active enzyme was found in the supernatant after centrifugation and was completely sensitive to protease in the absence and presence of detergent (Table I) and by the observations that after synthesis of pLuc in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide, the active enzyme was found in the pellet after centrifugation and was completely resistant to protease in the absence of detergent and protease-sensitive in the presence of detergent (Table I). Similar results were obtained with the precursor protein that contained the preprocecropin A signal peptide (data not shown). Thus, folding of luciferase to the native state occurred after synthesis of pLuc in reticulocyte lysate and concomitant with transport into dog pancreas microsomes. On the basis of parallel experiments that were carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine, apparent specific activities were calculated for luciferase after synthesis of Luc and pLuc in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide (i.e. by dividing activity by the relevant amount of protein). The apparent specific activity of luciferase after folding in the cytosol (14.5) was found to be twice as high compared with the apparent specific activity of luciferase after folding in microsomes (7.2).Table ILocalization of enzymatically active luciferase after synthesis of Luc and pLuc in the presence of dog pancreas microsomesActivity after synthesis (in the presence of microsomes)LucpLucCentrifugationTotal42.83824.515Supernatant42.2936.646Pellet2.63820.572SequestrationTotal16.6489.913Protease1.9009.609Protease + Triton X-1000.9850.681 Open table in a new tab To determine the possible involvement of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts in luciferase folding in mammalian microsomes, the kinetics of folding were studied after transport into proteoliposomes. These proteoliposomes were previously observed to be depleted with respect to luminal proteins, i.e. ATP-dependent molecular chaperones and folding catalysts (Görlich and Rapoport, 7Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Google Scholar).1 The precursor pLuc was synthesized in the presence of the acceptor peptide and either microsomes or proteoliposomes. To follow the efficiencies of transport of the precursor polypeptide, the translation reaction was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine, and aliquots of the translation reactions were taken and subjected to sequestration analysis, followed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 3A). The data from the sequestration analysis can be taken as an indication of the fact that transport of the precursor protein into the proteoliposomes had occurred. To follow the kinetics of folding, the translation was carried out in the absence of a labeled amino acid, and aliquots were taken and analyzed in the presence of the required substrates of the luciferase reaction by luminometry. To determine the location of the active luciferases, the translation was carried out in the absence of a labeled amino acid, and aliquots were taken and subjected to sequestration analysis, followed by luminometry (Table II). The data from the sequestration analysis can be taken as an indication of the fact that folding in the lumen of proteoliposomes was analyzed under these conditions. To be able to directly compare the efficiencies of luciferase folding in microsomes and proteoliposomes, the folding kinetics were corrected for identical luciferase contents of microsomes and proteoliposomes (Fig. 3B). Thus, folding of luciferase in proteoliposomes was approximately twice as efficient compared with folding in microsomes.Table IILocalization of enzymatically active luciferase after synthesis of pLuc in the presence of microsomes or proteoliposomesActivity after synthesis of pLuc in the presence ofMicrosomesProteolipsomesTotal7.4025.439Protease7.7854.568Protease + Triton X-1001.3630.377 Open table in a new tab To corroborate the lack of a role of luminal molecular chaperones and peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases in luciferase folding in the microsomes, the folding kinetics of luciferase were studied after pretreatment of microsomes with inhibitors of either ATP-dependent molecular chaperones (8-azido-ATP plus UV light) (Klappa et al., 11Klappa P.

Sci. 1993; 18: 334-338Google Scholar; Schreiber, 18Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Google Scholar). The pretreatment with 8-azido-ATP plus UV light interfered (~60% inhibition) and the pretreatment with CsA and FK506 did not interfere with subsequent protein transport (data not shown). In the first experiment, the precursor pLuc was synthesized in the presence of microsomes and the acceptor peptide and in the additional presence of either Me2SO or CsA plus FK506 (Fig. 4A). The enzyme activities were measured and corrected for identical luciferase contents in the two types of microsomes (as described above). Folding of Luc was not sensitive to the two drugs. We conclude from this set of data that peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases are not involved in folding of Luc. Furthermore, we conclude that proline isomerization does not play a role in folding of Luc. This finding is consistent with the observation that cis/trans-isomerization of proline-containing peptide bonds is not rate-limiting during luciferase refolding (Kolb et al., 12Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Google Scholar). In the second experiment, the precursor pLuc was synthesized in the presence of the acceptor peptide and in the additional presence of microsomes pretreated with 8-azido-ATP in the absence or presence of UV light (Fig. 4B). The enzyme activities were measured and corrected for identical luciferase contents in the two types of microsomes (as described above). Folding of Luc was approximately twice as efficient in microsomes that had been photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP compared with untreated microsomes. Folding of firefly luciferase in the mammalian cytosol had previously been shown to involve a highly organized chaperone machinery comprising Hsp40, Hsp60, and Hsp70 (Frydman et al., 4Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar). Up to now, there has been no indication of a member of the Hsp60 protein family present in the endoplasmic reticulum. To investigate which microsomal molecular chaperones or folding catalysts can functionally substitute for the cytosolic chaperone machinery, folding of firefly luciferase, emerging from the protein translocase in the membrane of mammalian microsomes, was analyzed after synthesis of the corresponding hybrid precursor protein in a mammalian translation system. Firefly luciferase was specifically used here as a model protein in order to exclude from the analysis molecular chaperones and folding catalysts that are specific for glycoproteins and disulfide-containing proteins. The rates and efficiencies of folding of luciferase in the cytosol were compared with those of folding of luciferase in microsomes and in microsomes that had been pretreated with inhibitors of either ATP-dependent molecular chaperones (such as BiP) or peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases (cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins). Inhibition of such molecular chaperones had previously been shown to affect folding of heterodimeric luciferase in mammalian cytosol and microsomes (Kruse et al., 13Kruse M. Brunke M. Escher A. Szalay A.A. Tropschug M. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2588-2594Google Scholar).1 Furthermore, folding of luciferase in microsomes was compared with folding in proteoliposomes, i.e. in the absence of luminal molecular chaperones (such as BiP) and folding catalysts (such as cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins). The rate and efficiency of folding of heterodimeric luciferase in the absence of luminal chaperones were previously found to be dramatically reduced compared with those of folding in the presence of luminal proteins.1 Furthermore, it was observed that the residual folding of heterodimeric luciferase in proteoliposomes was not sensitive to inhibitors of BiP and peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases.1 Folding of firefly luciferase in microsomes was as fast as but less efficient than folding in the cytosol (Frydman et al., 4Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar; Kolb et al., 12Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Google Scholar). Folding of firefly luciferase in the absence of luminal proteins and after inhibition of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones was more efficient compared with folding in the presence of luminal molecular chaperones and was indistinguishable from folding in the cytosol. Therefore, we suggest that a luminal protein with an affinity for 8-azido-ATP, most likely BiP (Clairmont et al., 2Clairmont C. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Google Scholar), interfered with luciferase folding in microsomes. Thus, firefly luciferase emerging from translocase can efficiently fold to its native conformation without any help from soluble molecular chaperones. Therefore, we conclude that there are molecular chaperones present in the microsomal membrane that can efficiently substitute for the cytosolic chaperone machinery with respect to folding of firefly luciferase. However, an alternative interpretation has to be considered. The possibility cannot be dismissed that firefly luciferase can spontaneously fold to its native state with high efficiency under conditions of its de novo synthesis. We favor the first possibility since spontaneous folding of luciferase after denaturation and subsequent renaturation of the purified enzyme was found to be slow (half-time of 14 min to hours, depending on the conditions) (Kolb et al., 12Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Google Scholar). 3R. Herbst, U. Schäfer, and R. Seckler, manuscript in preparation.
