https://openalex.org/W2031087463,"O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosylation is a dynamic modification of eukaryotic nuclear and cytosolic proteins analogous to protein phosphorylation. We have cloned and characterized a novel gene for an O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that shares no sequence homology or structural similarities with other glycosyltransferases. The OGT gene is highly conserved (up to 80% identity) in all eukaryotes examined. Unlike previously described glycosyltransferases, OGT is localized to the cytosol and nucleus. The OGT protein contains multiple tandem repeats of the tetratricopeptide repeat motif. The presence of tetratricopeptide repeats, which can mediate protein-protein interactions, suggests that OGT may be regulated by protein interactions that are independent of the enzyme's catalytic site. The OGT is also modified by tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades may play a role in modulating OGT activity.

Unlike other forms of protein glycosylation, serine (threonine)-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is found primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is not modified or elongated to more complex structures (1Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.C. Arnold C.S. Snow D.S. Ye Z. Chen X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J. Akimoto Y. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 711-716Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Since it was first described in 1984 (3Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Google Scholar), the O-GlcNAc modification (termed O-GlcNAcylation) has been found on a myriad of eukaryotic nuclear and cytosolic proteins, including RNA polymerase II and its transcription factors, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, tumor suppressor proteins, and oncoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.C. Arnold C.S. Snow D.S. Ye Z. Chen X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J. Akimoto Y. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 711-716Google Scholar and 2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Direct evidence is rapidly accumulating in support of the role of O-GlcNAcylation as a regulatory modification. O-GlcNAc appears to be as abundant as phosphorylation, and several of the known sites of attachment are similar to those used by proline-directed kinases (4Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Google Scholar, 5Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 121-134Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic modification exhibiting properties more like phosphorylation than typical O- and N-linked glycosylation (1Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.C. Arnold C.S. Snow D.S. Ye Z. Chen X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J. Akimoto Y. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 711-716Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The turnover rate of the O-GlcNAc moiety on cytokeratins (6Chou C.-F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Google Scholar) and the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin (7Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Google Scholar) is much higher than the turnover rate of the protein. O-GlcNAcylation also has been shown to regulate a number of cellular functions. For example recent studies have shown the following. 1) O-GlcNAcylation modulates the DNA binding activity of the p53 tumor suppressor (8Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930Google Scholar). 2) O-GlcNAcylation of p67 regulates protein synthesis by controlling the phosphorylation state of the elongation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) (9Chakraborty A. Saha D. Bose A. Chatterjee M. Gupta N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6700-6706Google Scholar, 10Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Google Scholar). 3) O-GlcNAcylation of the head domain of neurofilament-H appears to regulate neurofilament assembly (11Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Hart G.W. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20845-20852Google Scholar). 4) The O-GlcNAc and phosphate modifications of the RNA polymerase II COOH-terminal domain are reciprocal and are likely to regulate transcription (12Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Google Scholar, 13Comer F.I. Hart G.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1119Google Scholar). 5) O-GlcNAc has a reciprocal relationship with phosphorylation at the site on the c-Myc protein, which has been implicated in modulating its oncogenic activity (14Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Google Scholar). Consistent with the dynamic nature of O-GlcNAcylation, both a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase) (15Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Google Scholar), specific for the attachment of O-GlcNAc to proteins, and a soluble N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase with a neutral pH optima (O-GlcNAcase) (16Dong L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Google Scholar), specific for the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins have been purified and characterized. These two enzymes appear to regulate the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc in much the same way that kinases and phosphatases regulate protein phosphorylation. Taken together these observations suggest that O-GlcNAc may play a role in modulating either the phosphorylation state or the assembly and disassembly of multimeric protein complexes in several key cellular systems, including transcription, nuclear transport, and cytoskeletal organization. The O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) 1The abbreviations used are: OGTO-GlcNAc transferaseTPRtetratricopeptide repeatPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRP-HPLCreverse phase high performance liquid chromatographyHPAE-PADhigh pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed-amperometric detectionPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHOChinese hamster ovaryPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s) (EC 2.4.1) purified from rat liver cytosol appears to be a heterotrimer composed of two catalytic 110-kDa (p110) subunits and one 78-kDa (p78) subunit (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the gene encoding the catalytic p110 subunit. The gene is highly conserved throughout evolution, consistent with the ubiquitous nature of the O-GlcNAc modification. We also find that, like many other regulatory proteins, OGT contains several tandem repeats of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif (reviewed in Refs. 18Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Google Scholar and 19Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Google Scholar), suggesting that OGT can interact with other proteins via the TPR domain, to form a regulatory complex. Examination of the posttranslational modifications of OGT shows that the enzyme is modified by both O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation. The subcellular localization of the cloned gene is consistent with O-GlcNAcylation as a nuclear and cytosolic modification.

Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). The purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The material corresponding to the 110-kDa subunit was visualized, excised, and subjected to in-gel protease digestion with trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim sequencing grade or Worthington tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin) by the method of Rosenfeld et al. (21Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In addition, a second sample was electroblotted to Immobilon-Psq (Millipore) after SDS-PAGE separation and the protein stained with Amido Black 10B (Sigma) as per manufacturer's recommendations. The band corresponding to the 110-kDa subunit was excised and submitted to the Harvard Microchem protein sequencing facility (Boston, MA) for both NH2-terminal sequencing and internal sequence analysis. The tryptic peptides were purified by several rounds of RP-HPLC. A Vydac 5-μm C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) or a Rainin Microsorb-MV 5-μm C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) was used for first and second-dimension RP-HPLC. A Vydac narrow-bore C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm) was used for third-dimension RP-HPLC. The peptides were bound to the column in either 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.1% phosphoric acid containing 100 mM sodium perchlorate at pH 2 or pH 7 (22Meek J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1632-1636Google Scholar), and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile. The RP-HPLC-purified peptides were sequenced by gas phase automated Edman degradation on either a Porton Instruments (Tarzana, CA) model PI 2090E microsequencing system, or an Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA) model 470A gas phase sequenator. Polyclonal antibodies to the OGT protein were generated as follows. His-tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pTrcHis vector, and the protein was purified as described below. The purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized, and excised from the gel as described below. The gel slices were homogenized and used directly as immunogens by Hazelton Research Products (Denver, PA) to produce polyclonal antisera in two rabbits designated AL-24 and AL-25. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified by passing the rabbit antiserum over a protein A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) as per manufacturer's recommendations. Crude protein extracts were prepared either from the dissected tissue of 3-6-month-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats or from transfected HEK293 cells by following the first two steps of the purification protocol as described previously (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Purified rabbit polyclonal IgG AL-24 (1:5000), or monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Sigma, 1:2000) was used as a primary antibody with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) as the secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution). Detection of the horseradish peroxidase activity was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and fluorography as described by the manufacturer (Amersham). Purifed OGT from rat liver (through step 8, as described by Haltiwanger et al. (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar)) was probed for terminal GlcNAc using Galβ(1Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.C. Arnold C.S. Snow D.S. Ye Z. Chen X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J.

Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Google Scholar). The subunits were then resolved on a 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gel, and proteins tagged with [3H]galactose were detected by fluorography of the gel treated with 1 M sodium salicylate. The p110 subunit of OGT was excised, and the O-linkage of the labeled sugar on p110 was demonstrated by its sensitivity to β-elimination and reduction (24Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Google Scholar). The released O-linked sugar was desalted over a Dowex AG 50W-X8 (hydrogen form)/Dowex AG 1-X8 (formate form) run in series. Identification of the β-eliminated products was performed by high pH anion-exchange chromatorgraphy with pulsed-amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) by isocratic elution in 200 mM NaOH at 0.4 ml/min for 25 min on a Dionex Bio-LC equipped with a CarboPac-MA1 column. Partially purified OGT from rat liver (through step 4, and desalted as described; 17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar) was incubated with AL-25 or preimmune IgG (see above) on ice for 3 h. The IgGs were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL4-B (Pharmacia) in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The resin was washed extensively in TBST, followed by a desalting wash in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol (desalt buffer), while the supernatant was desalted over a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 (Sigma) column in desalt buffer. The resin and supernatant was then resuspended to equivalent volumes in either SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis, or in desalt buffer for OGT activity assay as described previously (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions and ligations were carried out as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using Wizard Prep Kits (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Two oligonucleotides were synthesized (ATGGGAAATACTTTGAAA = forward, ATGGATTATATATCACT = reverse), and PCR was carried out in 50-μl reactions containing ≈107λ-ZAPII rat liver cDNA library (no. 936513, Stratagene) phage, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.5 μM each primer, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The λ-ZAPII phage were first denatured by boiling for 10 min in dH2O and then added to the PCR reactions and amplified in a DNA Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc.) using a step gradient annealing temperature cycle starting at 48°C (1 min) decreasing 0.5°C/cycle for 20 cycles, an additional 20 cycles were performed at 38°C (1 min) annealing temperature. A 65°C (2 min) elongation step followed by a 92°C (1 min) denaturing step was used in all cycles. The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml), gel-purified using a silica suspension (26Boyle J.S. Lew A.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 8Google Scholar), and subcloned into the pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega). Subcloned PCR products and excised cDNA λZAPII clones were subjected to double-stranded DNA sequencing using deoxyadenosine 5′-[α-[35S]thio]triphosphate and Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), as described by the manufacturer. Additional sequence information of the cDNA clones was obtained by automated DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer. Two rat liver cDNA λ-ZAPII libraries (nos. 936513 and 936507, Stratagene) were plated on XL-1 Blue host cells (Stratagene) and screened by hybridization in 50% formamide (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), with the PCR-22b probe (see above) labeled to a specific activity of ≈8 × 108 dpm/μg using the Ready·To·Go DNA Labeling Kit (Pharmacia). Hybridization was performed at 42°C, and the filters were washed in 0.2 × SSC at 70°C. Nine positive clones were isolated, ranging in size from 1-3.2 kb (designated H1-H9). The longest H1 (Fig. 1A), contained a putative start site, 310 base pairs of upstream untranslated DNA, and an open reading frame encoding 958 residues; however, no in-frame stop codon was present. A rat hippocampus λ-ZAPII library kindly provided by Anthony Lanahan (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) was screened as above, except that a gel-purified SacI restriction enzyme fragment representing the 3′ end of the partial clone was used as probe (Fig. 1A); all other conditions were identical. Five clones were isolated (designated LTP1-LPT5), ranging in size from 2.5 to 4.6 kb. All of these clones overlapped the H1 clone by 0.3-2.2 kb, and all contained a poly(A) tail. A total of 8 × 105 recombinant phage from each library were screened. Positive clones were subjected to in vivo excision protocol according to the manufacturers' directions, to recover a pBlueScript plasmid containing the cDNA clone of interest for further analysis. A full-length cDNA clone was constructed by ligation of the 5′-end of the H1 clone to the 3′-end of LTP3 at a convient XhoI site (Fig. 1A). DNA analysis was performed on a prepared Zoo-Blot (Clontech) as per manufacturer's directions with a PCR-22b probe labeled as above. In addition, total genomic DNA was isolated from HEK293 cells (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), digested to completion with EcoRI, resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell) filter according to manufacturer's directions. This blot was probed with a PCR-22b probe as described above. Total RNA was isolated from the dissected tissue of 3-6-month-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats using RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's directions. 25 μg of each RNA was resolved on 1% agarose gels, transferred to a Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell) filter according to manufacturer's directions, and probed with the PCR-22b fragment (see above) as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). The coding region of the GTF was assembled from two cDNA clone fragments at a unique XhoI site. The 5′-untranslated region was removed and replaced with a linker restoring the start codon, and a BamHI site was added 5′ to the start (Fig. 1B). The coding region was then subcloned as a BamHI/HindIII fragment into the polylinker of the pTrcHis Xpress vector (Invitrogen), designated pLK51, for expression in E. coli, or into pGW1 (a kind gift of Mike Lee) designated pLK61, for transient expression in mammalian cells. pLK51 was transformed into the XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) strain of E. coli and grown to midlog phase, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM final concentration of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 6 h after induction and protein was purified on Hi-Trap Chelating Columns (Pharmacia) under urea denaturing conditions as per manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were grown in six-well plates for protein expression assays, or on glass coverslips for immunolocalization in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum until 50% confluence. The cells were then transfected with pLK61 by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and grown for an additional 24-48 h to allow protein expression. Transfected HEK293 cells (see above) or CHO cells, grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until 50% confluence, were washed twice in serum-free medium and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (PBS), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed in PBS and blocked with goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (1:3) for 15 min at 37°C. The cells were then incubated in primary antibody for 30 min at 37°C. Excess primary antibody was washed away with four 10 min incubations in PBS, and the cells were incubated in secondary antibody, at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The cells were rinsed as for the primary antibody and mounted onto slides in 0.1% paraphenylenediamine in 90% glycerol. Secondary antibody alone gave no signal, and no signal was observed in non-permeabilized cells. Primary antibodies, AL-25 or preimmune, were used at a 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted 1:200; DAPI stain was used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. All antibodies were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Fourteen unique peptide sequences were obtained from protease digests of the p110 subunit of OGT purified from rat liver (underlined in Fig. 1A). Polymerase chain reaction amplification and standard cDNA library screening techniques were combined to clone the gene encoding the p110 subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two overlapping clones were isolated and the open reading frame was reconstructed at a convenient XhoI restriction site (Fig. 1B). The full-length cDNA contains a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 1037 residues, designated p110OGT. Computer searches of the standard GenBank™ data bases using the BLAST algorithm (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) revealed 61% sequence identity between p110OGT and a hypothetical 1194 residue protein encoded at locus K04G7.3 of Caenorhabditis elegans (accession number U21320). A matrix plot of the predicted C. elegans protein and p110OGT is shown in Fig. 2A The homology extends through the entire clone with regions as long as 350 residues sharing >80% identity. A recently cloned gene in Arabidopsis, SPINDLY, involved in gibberellin signal transduction (29Jacobsen S.E. Binkowski K.A. Olszewski N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9292-9296Google Scholar) also shares extensive homology with p110OGT throughout the entire coding region. Thus, both K04G7.3 and SPINDLY are likely to encode homologues of p110OGT. In addition, searches of the dbEST data base of expressed sequence tags (30Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Google Scholar) revealed homology between p110OGT and the conceptual translation products of expressed sequence tags from human (R7594; 93% identity over 414 residues), Schistosoma mansoni (T14553; 65% identity over 442 residues), and rice (D24403; 67% identity over 326 residues). The amino-terminal portion of p110OGT shares homology with a diverse group of proteins all containing a common motif designated the TPR motif (18Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Google Scholar, 19Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Google Scholar), while the carboxyl terminus shares no significant homology to any known protein in the data bases. Thus, the p110OGT appears to consists of two distinct domains: the amino-terminal 463 residues containing 11.5 tandem repeats of the TPR motif (Fig. 1C), and the carboxyl-terminal 563 residues representing a novel polypeptide perhaps encoding the catalytic activity. Southern blot analysis was used to determine if the OGT clone represents a family of O-GlcNAc transferase genes. Rat genomic DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI and SacI) and probed with an 850-base pair fragment (PCR-22b, see Fig. 1B). Only one or two bands of equal intensity are seen in most lanes (Fig. 2B). The EcoRI lane has three bands, which is consistent with the expected restriction pattern of the cloned cDNA. The absence of several bands of varying intensity in each lane indicates that the Ogt gene is not a member of a closely related multigene family. To further examine the level of conservation among higher eukaryotes, genomic DNA from rat, mouse, dog, cow, rabbit, and human was probed with PCR-22b (see above). A specific signal is seen in all lanes (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that a single related gene is present in many higher eukaryotes. Polyclonal rabbit antibody (designated AL-25) was prepared against purified, recombinant p110OGT overproduced in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). AL-25 immunoglobulin G (IgG) is highly specific for the OGT and shows no cross-reactivity to other proteins present in partially purified preparation of rat liver OGT designated the Q-Sepharose pool (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Preimmune IgG shows no reactivity (data not shown). On Western blots, AL-25 antibody recognizes both the p110 and the p78 subunits of the rat liver OGT (lane 2), suggesting that p110 and p78 are related at the polypeptide level. Similar results were obtained with antibodies raised against synthetic peptides derived from the p110 subunit sequence (data not shown). Both the p110 and p78 subunits of the native OGT are immunoprecipitated from the Q-Sepharose pool using AL-25, while no protein is precipitated using preimmune IgG (lanes 3 and 4). The pellets and supernatants from the immunoprecipitation were assayed for OGT enzyme activity (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). OGT enzymatic activity is precipitated from the Q-Sepharose pool using AL-25, while no activity is precipitated by buffer alone or preimmune IgG (Fig. 3B). These studies demonstrate that the cloned cDNA indeed represents the p110 subunit of the rat OGT. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A) indicates that there are four transcripts ∼of 8.0, 6.0, 4.2, and 1.7 kb, present in all rat tissues examined thus far. The 6.0-kb transcript is closest in size to the cloned cDNA (5.7 kb). The larger 8.0-kb transcript may be an alternate splicing product containing additional exons, as is seen in C. elegans, which has two distinct cDNAs representing alternative splicing events at the 5-prime end of the message. The longer message produces a 130-kDa protein as predicted (by Wilson et al., 31) (accession number U21320), while the smaller message would produce a 112-kDa protein. 2L. K. Kreppel and W. G. Kelly, unpublished observation. The pattern of protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis of 30% ammonium sulfate cytosolic pellets (30% pellet) from rat tissues using the AL-25 antibody (Fig. 4B). The p110 band is clearly detectable in all tissues except the kidney, while the p78 band is detectable only in kidney, liver, and muscle, and an 80-kDa band is present only in muscle. Additional bands are visible upon longer exposure (data not shown), including a faint 110-kDa band in kidney as well as a 190-kDa band in liver, indicating that there are several Ogt-derived proteins present in most tissues. The 30% pellets were also assayed for enzyme activity (17Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar), the results are shown in Fig. 4C All the extracts contained enzymatically active OGT, with brain and thymus having the highest specific activities and liver the lowest. However, the amount of enzyme activity did not always correlate well with the amount of OGT protein present in each extract, or with the transcript levels seen in each tissue. Western blot analysis of the Q-Sepharose pool using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody shows that the p110 and p78 subunits are immunoreactive. This reactivity is blocked by the addition of 10 mM phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2), but not 10 mM tyrosine (data not shown). Similar experiments using antibodies against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine showed no immunoreactivity (data not shown). Examination of the p110OGT amino acid sequence indicates that there is only one well conserved receptor protein-tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, Tyr979 (32Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Esch F.S. Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 973-977Google Scholar, 33Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 441-488Google Scholar) (outlined in Fig. 1A). To determine if OGT was itself modified by O-GlcNAc, highly purified OGT was probed with galactosyltransferase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Galactosyltransferase is a specific probe for terminal GlcNAc resides (24Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Google Scholar, 34Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G.

Since S100 proteins lack structural requirements for secretion via the classical endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi route, the process of secretion is unclear. We now demonstrate the specific, energy-dependent release of MRP8 and MRP14 by human monocytes after activation of protein kinase C. This secretory process is not blocked by inhibitors of vesicular traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and comparative studies on tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β indicate that MRP8 and MRP14 follow neither the classical nor the interleukin-1-like alternative route of secretion. Inhibition by microtubule-depolymerizing agents revealed that MRP8/MRP14 secretion requires an intact tubulin network. Accordingly, upon initiation of MRP8/MRP14 secretion, immunofluorescence microscopy showed a co-localization of both proteins with tubulin filaments. Release of MRP8 and MRP14 is associated with down-regulation of their de novo synthesis, suggesting that extracellular signaling via MRP8/MRP14 is restricted to distinct differentiation stages of monocytes.

Members of this family are defined by their homologies to two calcium-binding proteins highly enriched in nervous tissue, S100α and S100β. S100 proteins are characterized by the presence of two calcium-binding sites of the EF-hand-type, the N-terminal of which differs from the conserved EF motive by two additional amino acids. They have a relatively small molecular mass of around 10 kDa and, in contrast to other calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin, show tissue-specific expression patterns. S100 proteins play a role in cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, regulation of kinase activities, and cytoskeletal-membrane interactions (4Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Google Scholar, 5Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Google Scholar). In addition, extracellular functions have been reported for distinct S100 proteins; S100β, the prototypic member of this family, can be found as an extracellular protein inducing neurite extension (5Kligman D.

MRP8 and MRP14 are expressed at high concentrations by granulocytes and during early differentiation stages of monocytes but are absent in lymphocytes and mature tissue macrophages (9Zwadlo G.

Phagocytes express MRP8 and MRP14 under multiple inflammatory conditions, e.g. during rheumatoid arthritis, allograft rejections, or inflammatory bowel diseases (9Zwadlo G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. J.

Roth J. Burwinkel F. Vollmer E. Böcker W. Sorg C. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 355-361Google Scholar). Inflammatory disorders as chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis are associated with elevated serum levels of MRP8 and MRP14 (16Roth J. Teigelkamp S. Wilke M. Grün L. Tümmler B.

The close correlation between serum levels and disease activity led to the assumption that MRP8 and MRP14 are released from leukocytes during inflammatory events (4Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W.

Immunobiology. 1992; 186: 304-314Google Scholar), e.g. during transendothelial diapedesis (11Hogg N. Allen C. Edgeworth J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1053-1061Google Scholar). The mechanism of release, either after cell death or by an active secretory process, has yet not been elucidated. In recent years several studies reported extracellular functions of MRP8 and MRP14, including antimicrobial, cytostatic, or chemotactic activities (18Steinbakk M. Naess-Andresen C.F. Lingaas E. Dale I. Brandtzaeg P. Fagerhol M.K. Lancet. 1990; 336: 763-765Google Scholar, 19Murao S. Collart F. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 447-454Google Scholar, 20Lackmann M. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7499-7504Google Scholar), thus favoring an active mechanism of secretion. However, neither MRP8 and MRP14 nor any other S100 protein has a signal sequence for secretion via the classical ER/Golgi route. They therefore resemble cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are released into the extracellular space via a so-called alternative pathway of secretion (21Muesch A. Hartmann E. Rohde K. Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Rapoport T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 86-88Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether all nonclassically secreted proteins use the same mechanisms of release. Since the pathway of S100 protein release has not yet been examined (4Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Google Scholar), we intended to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the release of MRP8 and MRP14 by human monocytes. Here we provide evidence that MRP8 and MRP14 are secreted after activation of protein kinase C via a novel pathway requiring an intact microtubule network. Human peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained from buffy coats which arise during preparation of packed red blood cell concentrates. Monocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque and Percoll (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG) density gradient centrifugation or by leukapheresis of individual donors using a cell separator CS 3000 plus Omnix (Baxter, Unterschleißheim, FRG) and were cultured for 1-3 days in Teflon bags as previously reported (9Zwadlo G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 512-518Google Scholar). MRP8 and MRP14 were detected by noncross-reactive affinity-purified rabbit antisera (a-MRP8, a-MRP14) the monospecifity of which was evaluated by immunoreactivity against recombinant proteins and transfected cell lines as described previously (1Odink K.

The sensitivities were less than 5 and 1 pg/ml for TNF-α and IL-1β, respectively. Monocytes of culture day 1 were stimulated as described above and processed for flow cytometry. Immunostaining procedures were performed as reported earlier employing mAb 27E10 (9Zwadlo G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 512-518Google Scholar, 10Roth J. Goebeler M. van den Bos C.

Monocytes of culture day 1 were harvested, washed, and preincubated in modified Eagle's medium without methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Monocytes were then labeled by adding 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham-Buchler) to the same medium for 2 h. Medium was removed and replaced by McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Cells (2 × 107) were treated for another 4 h with either medium, 10 nM PMA, or 10 nM PMA plus 20 nM staurosporine. Thereafter, supernatants were collected, and cells were washed and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Supernatants and lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described earlier (13Roth J. Goebeler M. Wrocklage V. van den Bos C. Sorg C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 655-660Google Scholar) using monospecific affinity-purified antisera against MRP8 or MRP14, mAb 27E10, mAb H21 against p11, or nonspecific isotype-matched antibodies as a control. Samples were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The relative amounts of MRP8 and MRP14 monomers were determined densitometrically by scanning of autoradiography bands using a Fast Scan supplied with Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunny Vale, CA). Monocytes cultured for 3 days on fibronectin (Becton Dickinson)-coated Lab-Tec chamber slides (Nunc, Wiesbaden, FRG) were either left untreated or incubated for 4 h with 10 nM PMA. In some experiments 5 μg/ml colchicine, 2 μg/ml nocodazole, 1 μM demecolcine, or 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B was added during the last hour of the incubation period. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized by 10 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 200 mM saccharose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (CS buffer) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min, washed twice in CS buffer for 5 min, subsequently fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min and methanol for 6 min at −20°C, and processed for single- or double-labeling immunofluorescence as described earlier (25Goebeler M. Roth J. van den Bos C. Ader G. Sorg C. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 419-424Google Scholar) using a-MRP8, a-MRP14, mAb 27E10, phalloidin-FITC, mAb TUB 2.1 against β-tubulin, and mAb V9 against vimentin as primary antibodies. For double-labeling experiments staining of MRP8 or MRP14 with a polyclonal rabbit serum was followed by detection of cytoskeletal components employing mAbs from mice. No cross-reactivity or spillover was detected in control experiments after omitting specific antibodies or replacing them by isotype-matched control antibodies of irrelevant specifity. Fluorescence stainings were analyzed on a Zeiss photomicroscope. Total RNA of monocytes was prepared according to the guanidine hydrochloride method (13Roth J. Goebeler M. Wrocklage V. van den Bos C. Sorg C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 655-660Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized with cDNA probes specific for MRP8 or MRP14 which were labeled with 32P by a random primer method (Multiprime DNA labeling system; Amersham). Membranes were reprobed with cDNAs described above with stripping the blots in between employing 0.1% SDS at 95°C. Autoradiographic bands were quantified by densitometrically scanning. Data obtained from MRP8 or MRP14 mRNA bands were normalized to the corresponding 18 S rRNA bands. The U test according to Mann-Whitney (for values without normal distribution) was performed to determine significant differences in MRP8/MRP14 secretion. Values of p > 0.05 were considered not to be significant. To study the regulation of MRP8 and MRP14 secretion, monocytes were cultured for 1 day and subsequently stimulated with GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, interferon-γ, or lipopolysaccharide for 4 h. Thereafter, supernatants were analyzed for MRP8/MRP14 content by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1A, GM-CSF, IL-1β, and lipopolysaccharide induced significant MRP8/MRP14 release by human monocytes. MRP8 and MRP14 have earlier been demonstrated to assemble to noncovalently linked di-, tri-, and tetraheteromeric complexes (26Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Google Scholar, 27Edgeworth J. Gorman M. Bennett R. Freemont P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7706-7713Google Scholar). A sandwich ELISA using a mAb against MRP14 does not provide information about the stoichiometric ratio of heteromeric complexes; therefore, the data presented refer to MRP8/MRP14 (MRP8/14). The exact molecular ratio of secreted MRP8 and MRP14 was determined by metabolic labeling (see below). To consider nonspecific MRP8 and MRP14 release due to cell lysis, lactate dehydrogenase activity in the supernatant was determined concomitantly. Specific release was then presented as the ratio of MRP:lactate dehydrogenase (nanograms/unit). To analyze intracellular signaling pathways resulting in MRP8/MRP14 release, monocytes were exposed to PMA, Bt2cAMP, choleratoxin, pertussis toxin, or forskolin. ELISA assays revealed a strong induction of MRP8/MRP14 release by PMA. Modulators of intracellular cAMP had no effect (Fig. 1B). PMA effects on MRP8/MRP14 release could be inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitors H-7 (inhibitory concentration (IC) 50 = 8 μM), HA-1004 (IC50 = 18 μM), and staurosporine (IC50 = 2 nM); IC50 of these inhibitors resembled their Ki regarding protein kinase C, thus confirming involvement of the latter (Fig. 2A). The PMA analogue 4aPMA which does not exhibit intrinsic activity regarding protein kinase C activation (28van Duuren B.L. Tseng S.S. Segal A. Smith A.C. Melchionne S. Seidman I. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 2644-2646Google Scholar) had no effect on MRP8/MRP14 release even at 10-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 2B). dPPA, an agonist of the protein kinase C isotype β1 (29Ryves W.J. Evans A.T. Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Google Scholar), the most abundant protein kinase C isoform in monocytes (30Chang Z.L. Beezhold D.H. Immunology. 1993; 80: 360-366Google Scholar), did not affect MRP8/MRP14 release, indicating a protein kinase C subtype-specific pathway of intracellular signaling. PMA- and cytokine-induced release of MRP8/MRP14 was not associated with translocation of the latter to the cell surface as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). To study potential complex assembly of released MRP8/MRP14, supernatants of monocytes exposed to [35S]methionine and stimulated with PMA were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. Using a-MRP8, a-MRP14, or mAb 27E10 against the complex of MRP8/MRP14, all antibodies precipitated a similar pattern of MRP8 and MRP14, indicating that complexes of both represent the predominant extracellular form (Fig. 3 A-D). Quantification of precipitated MRP8 and MRP14 by densitometrical scanning revealed a ratio of MRP8:MRP14 of 1:3 which reflects the relative methionine content of both proteins (2 in MRP8 and 6 in MRP14). Furthermore, there was no difference between the intracellular and extracellular MRP8:MRP14 ratio, indicating that both are released at similar rates. To exclude nonspecific release of MRP8 and MRP14 into the supernatant, parallel immunoprecipitation experiments were performed for p11, another member of the S100 family expressed by myelomonocytic cells (4Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 3E, p11 expression was induced by exposure to PMA. In contrast to the strong [35S]methionine incorporation into intracellular p11, no p11 could be detected in the supernatant of PMA-treated monocytes. This observation adds to the evidence that PMA-stimulated cells were viable and that MRP8 and MRP14 were selectively released. In the next set of experiments we analyzed molecular mechanisms involved in PMA-induced MRP8/MRP14 release. To evaluate dependence of PMA-induced MRP8/MRP14 secretion on de novo protein synthesis, monocytes were exposed to cycloheximide. Treatment with this protein synthesis inhibitor did not affect the amount of MRP8 and MRP14 in the supernatant (Fig. 4A). In contrast, concomitant incubation with PMA and either one of the two inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism, dinitrophenol or CCCP, led to a significa"

In the past few years, several genes involved in the transport and trafficking of copper and iron have been identified in this yeast. CTR1 encodes a high affinity transporter for copper ions (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). Once copper enters the cell via Ctr1p, it can transported to various distinct cellular locations. First copper can be transported to the mitochondria where the metal is needed to activate cytochrome oxidase. This pathway requires both Ctr1p and a small cytosolic protein, Cox17p (2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar, 3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). Secondly, copper is needed to activate cytosolic copper-binding proteins such as the copper and zinc requiring superoxide dismutase (Sod1p). Accordingly, ctr1 mutants are defective in Sod1p activity (2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). Ctr1p is also necessary for efficient copper-regulated expression of the Cup1 metallothionein, and thus may be needed for copper transport to the nucleus (2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). Additionally, Ctr1p is involved in the delivery of copper ions to the secretory pathway. One protein requiring this mode of copper delivery is Fet3p, a multi-copper oxidase that is needed for high affinity iron uptake (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 5Yuan D.S. Stearman R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Google Scholar). The copper-loaded Fet3p functions as part of a complex with the iron permease Ftr1p to mediate iron uptake at the plasma membrane (7Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Google Scholar, 8Stearman R. Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwan Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because of this requirement for copper-Fet3p in iron transport, cells lacking Ctr1p are defective in iron uptake (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar). An additional component of the copper delivery pathway to Fet3p is CCC2 (5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar, 9Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-293Google Scholar), the yeast homologue of the human Wilson (10Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Gitlin J.D. Biochem.

Like its mammalian counterparts, Ccc2p possesses sequences common to P-type ATPases and also copies of the conserved copper-binding motif MTCXXC (9Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-293Google Scholar). These reputed ATPases of yeast and man are believed to function in the translocation of copper across intracellular membranes into the secretory pathway. Indeed, the Menkes protein has been localized by Gitlin and co-workers to a compartment in the Golgi (16Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Google Scholar). Although CCC2 functions in copper delivery, the CCC2 transcript falls under the transcriptional control of the iron-responsive trans-activator Aft1p (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). This is consistent with the role of Ccc2p in copper delivery to Fet3p involved in iron uptake. By contrast, CTR1 is involved in global copper trafficking and is regulated by the copper-responsive activator, Mac1p. 2The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescein isothiocyanate 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole The mechanism(s) by which Ccc2p and the Menkes/Wilson gene products obtain their copper for translocation into the secretory pathway has been unknown. By virtue of its cytotoxic nature, copper is unlikely to exist free in the cytosol. One hypothesis is that a cytosolic carrier for copper delivers the metal to the ATPase for transport into the secretory pathway. The studies presented here focus on one likely candidate for such a copper carrier: the small copper homeostasis factor, Atx1p. We originally isolated ATX1 (ni-oidant) as a multi-copy suppressor of oxygen toxicity in yeast devoid of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1p) (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). Cells lacking Sod1p exhibit a number of metabolic defects when grown in air, including aerobic auxotrophies for lysine and methionine (20Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Google Scholar–23Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar). Overexpression of ATX1 suppresses all the Sod1p-linked defects in a manner dependent upon cellular copper uptake (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). ATX1 encodes an 8.2-kDa polypeptide homologous to the MerP mercury transport proteins of bacteria (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). Close homologues to ATX1 were also identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, and more recently, in humans (33Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Google Scholar). In each case, the Atx1-like protein contains a single copy of the MTCXXC metal binding motif also found in Ccc2p and the Wilson and Menkes gene products (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide strong evidence that yeast Atx1p is localized to the cytosol and functions in a copper trafficking pathway (Ctr1p-Atx1p-Ccc2p) mediating delivery of copper to Fet3p. The S. cerevisiae strain SL202 was obtained by deleting the SOD1 gene of YPH250 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) using a sod1Δ::LEU2 plasmid (25Culotta V.C. Joh H.-D. Lin S.-J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Google Scholar). Strains SL108 and SL214-SL217 were constructed by creating an atx1Δ mutation in AA255 (26Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Google Scholar), SL202, YPH250 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar), RH144-3D, and SM2186, respectively (isogeneic wild type and end3ts mutant strains; kind gifts of S. Michaelis), using either the atx1Δ::HIS3 plasmid described below (for SL214) or the atx1Δ::LEU2 plasmid (remaining strains) described earlier (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). M2P is the AFT-1up derivative of wild type CM360 (2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). Strain 3 is a ccc2 mutant strain obtained from T. Dunn (5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Strains EG103 and the corresponding atx1Δ derivative SL103ΔA1 have been described (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar, 23Liu X.F. Elashvili I.

The pDA1-HIS atx1Δ::HIS3 deletion plasmid was constructed by mobilizing the atx1Δ deletion fragment from plasmid pDA1J (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar) through digestion with XhoI and SacI, and then by inserting this fragment into the XhoI and SacI sites of the HIS3 integrating vector, pRS403 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). p413-A1 represents an ATX1 CEN vector constructed by amplifying ATX1 sequences −397 to +800 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1A. Dancis, unpublished data. inserting the product into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and subcloning the ATX1 fragment into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pRS413 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). To insert ATX1 into the overexpression vector pET11d, the ATX1 coding region was amplified by PCR using mutagenic primers to introduce unique restriction sites at both the 5′ (NcoI) and 3′ (BamHI) ends of the gene. The PCR product and pET11d vector were both digested with NcoI and BamHI, the desired fragments were purified from low melt agarose gels and subsequently ligated to produce the pET11d-ATX1 expression vector. Stocks of yeast strains were maintained on a standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). Iron dependence tests were carried out as described (8Stearman R. Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwan Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar) on synthetic dextrose (SD) minimal medium plates containing 1-3.0 mM ferrozine (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine; Sigma) and supplemented with ferrous ammonium sulfate (Sigma) as needed. Agarose substituted for agar to minimize contamination of iron. Measurements of ferrous iron uptake were conducted in triplicate samples essentially as described (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar). All yeast transformations were carried out by electroporation (28Becker D. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Google Scholar). Transformants of strains containing sod1Δ mutations required initial cultivation in anaerobic culture jars (23Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar). Atx1p was purified from an E. coli strain carrying a T7 expression vector containing the ATX1 gene. Complete details regarding Atx1p overexpression and purification will be published later. 3A. Pufahl and T. V. O'Halloran, manuscript in preparation. Purified Atx1p was judged to be greater than 95% homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry to confirm the size of the intact protein. The purified Atx1p was used to produce anti-Atx1p antibodies in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. The antibody was purified using an ImmunoPure IgG (Protein A) purification kit, according to manufacturer's specifications (Pierce). For Western blot analysis, yeast cells were initially grown overnight in selecting SD medium to confluence, then diluted in 50 ml of SD medium to an A600 nm of 0.3 and allowed to grow for an additional 6 h. Cells were then broken by glass bead homogenization in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM each of EDTA and EGTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using the purified anti-Atx1 IgG at a 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibody consisted of anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) diluted 1:10,000. Detection employed the ECL kit (Amersham), according to manufacturer's specifications. For resolution of membrane and soluble components, extracts were prepared by osmotic shock as described previously (29Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Google Scholar), and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman 50 Ti-50 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer to the same volume, and all samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, as above. For detection of Atx1p by immunofluorescence, the atx1Δ strain SL108 transformed with pRS-A1 (2μ ATX1) was grown in 10 ml of selecting SD medium to a final A600 nm of 1.0. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized by zymolyase treatment, and prepared for antibody staining (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 97-105Google Scholar). Incubation with rabbit anti-Atx1p (diluted 1:250) proceeded for 2 h. Detection was carried out with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and utilized a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:500) coupled to FITC. Nucleic acids were stained by DAPI (Sigma), and FITC and DAPI staining was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. The CTR1 and CCC2 genes of yeast are involved in distinct copper transport steps (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Mutants at these loci are defective in the high affinity uptake of ferrous iron (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar) and require iron supplemented medium for growth. To study whether ATX1 participates in the same pathway of copper trafficking, we tested the effects of an atx1Δ gene deletion on iron dependent growth. An isogeneic pair of atx1Δ and wild type strains was plated onto a minimal medium prepared with the iron-specific chelator ferrozine (31Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Google Scholar, 32Chaney R.L. J. Plant Nutr. 1988; 11: 1033-1038Google Scholar), and growth was monitored. As shown in Fig. 1A, the atx1Δ strain exhibited no growth on this medium, and this defect was reversed by transforming the mutant with a CEN vector harboring wild type ATX1. The growth inhibition of atx1Δ strains on ferrozine was also completely reversed by supplementation with iron concentrations sufficient to reverse the effects of the iron chelator (Fig. 1A). We also obtained direct measurements of ferrous iron uptake. As shown in Fig. 1B, iron uptake in a wild type strain was reduced by treatment with the BCS copper-specific chelator, confirming the copper dependence of high affinity iron transport (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (5Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar), ferrous iron uptake was undetectable in a strain containing a ccc2 gene deletion and this deficiency was completely rescued by supplementation with copper (Fig. 1B). The atx1Δ strain also exhibited a reduction in iron uptake that was corrected by copper. However, the atx1Δ mutation resulted in an incomplete blockage (65-70% inhibition) of iron uptake, compared with the total inhibition of transport observed with ccc2Δ strains (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, the effects of atx1 mutations on the uptake and dependence on iron suggested that Atx1p operates in the same pathway as Ctr1p and Ccc2p to deliver copper to Fet3p. This notion is confirmed in the accompanying paper, where an atx1 mutant strain is shown to be deficient in the production of copper-Fet3p (33Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Google Scholar). To understand further how ATX1 functions in copper metabolism, we examined the intracellular localization of the encoded polypeptide. Atx1p is a small protein that lacks transmembrane domains or other localization signals (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be cytosolic. To monitor Atx1p production, we prepared anti-Atx1p antibodies. Purified Atx1p protein was obtained following expression in E. coli and used to produce polyclonal rabbit antibodies. The efficacy of this anti-Atx1 was then assessed by Western blot. As seen in Fig. 2A, a single major band exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 7.0 kDa was visualized from a strain harboring ATX1 on a 2μ vector, but was absent in the isogeneic atx1Δ strain. Atx1p produced from a CEN vector or the single-copy chromosomal gene could also be visualized (Fig. 2B), but yielded weak signals, suggesting that ATX1 may be normally expressed at low levels in yeast. In all cases, Atx1p migrated slightly faster on SDS gels than would be expected from its predicted molecular mass of 8.2 kDa, and this has also been observed with purified Atx1p produced in E. coli Overexpression of Atx1p in E. coli resulted in a full-length protein lacking its N-terminal methionine as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. 4A. Pufahl and T. V. O'Halloran, unpublished results. A cell fractionation experiment was conducted to test whether Atx1p is a soluble cytosolic protein. Extracts were prepared by gentle lysis as described (29Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Google Scholar) from cells harboring ATX1 on a CEN vector and were subjected to high speed centrifugation to resolve soluble and membrane-associated cellular constituents. As a control for these experiments, we monitored fractionation of the Atx2-HA protein, which is known to localize to vesicles in the secretory pathway (29Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2C, Atx1p was totally recovered in the supernatant following a 100,000 × g centrifugation, whereas this same treatment caused precipitation of the Golgi-localized Atx2-HA protein. The Golgi protein was only solubilized upon treatment of extracts with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2C). This fractionation study demonstrated that Atx1p is a soluble protein and is most likely cytosolic. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to study Atx1p localization further. Cells harboring the ATX1 2μ plasmid were fixed and permeabilized, and were probed with the rabbit anti-Atx1 antibody and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to FITC. By FITC straining, Atx1p exhibited uniform staining throughout the cytosol and was excluded from the nucleus, as defined by co-staining with DAPI (Fig. 3). Atx1p produced from the CEN vector showed a similar pattern of staining, although the immunofluorescence signal was much weaker in this case (data not shown). Our immunofluorescence experiments together with the cell fractionation study strongly indicated that Atx1p is a cytosolic protein. The complete absence of Atx1p in the nucleus rules against a possible role for the protein as a copper-transcription factor. The localization of Atx1p to the cytosol suggested that this protein may be involved in the cytosolic trafficking of the metal to Ccc2p and then to Fet3p. As an alternative scenario, Atx1p and Ccc2p could act in parallel, redundant pathways to separately deliver copper to Fet3p. If this latter possibility were true, Ccc2p and Atx1p should cross-compensate for one another. We therefore tested whether multi-copy CCC2 and ATX1 could suppress the effects of an atx1Δ and ccc2Δ null mutation, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4B, multi-copy ATX1 was incapable of suppressing the iron deficiency of a ccc2 mutant, even though the Atx1p protein was clearly overproduced under these conditions (Fig. 2 and 19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). This result indicated that Atx1p does not function in parallel with Ccc2p. However, in contrast to results obtained with multi-copy ATX1, overexpressed CCC2 was capable of suppressing the iron dependence of an atx1Δ mutant (Fig. 4A). The ability of multi-copy CCC2 to compensate for ATX1 (but not the converse) supports the notion that Ccc2p functions downstream of Atx1p. These studies also show that an Atx1p-independent pathway can substitute for Atx1p when Ccc2p is overproduced. Additional evidence for the Atx1p-independent pathway of copper transport was obtained through iron uptake studies. As seen in Fig. 1B, ferrous iron uptake was reduced in the atx1Δ deletion strain, in comparison to the total elimination of iron transport associated with a deletion of CCC2 This partial effect of atx1 mutations was also seen in a growth test for iron dependence. atx1Δ strains exhibited no growth on ferrozine-containing medium that was not supplemented with additional iron (Fig. 1A). However, the addition of 50 μM ferrous iron to the ferrozine medium supported growth of the atx1Δ strain, but not of the ccc2Δ mutant (Fig. 5). These observations suggested that a “back up” system for copper delivery exists in atx1Δ mutants. Possible candidates for this auxiliary system included Sod1p and the Cup1p and Crs5p metallothioneins, as all three are small soluble copper-binding proteins (34Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Google Scholar, 35Byrd J. Berger R.M. McMillin D.R. Wright C.F. Hamer D. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6688-6694Google Scholar, 36Chang L. Slot J.W. Geuza H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Google Scholar). However, we observed that ferrous iron uptake was not eliminated in an atx1Δ strain also containing mutations in SOD1 (Fig. 1B) or in a strain containing triple deletions in ATX1, CUP1, and CRS5 (data not shown). Thus the metallothioneins and Sod1p do not aid in copper delivery to Fet3p. Endocytosis is another method by which copper could be delivered to intracellular locations. We therefore tested the role of endocytosis as the secondary means of trafficking copper in atx1Δ strains. These studies utilized a temperature-sensitive end3 mutation known to block endocytosis at 37°C (37Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Google Scholar). end3 mutants are defective in both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis, yet other vesicle-mediated processes are not affected (37Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutation in END3 did not cause growth inhibition on the low iron medium (Fig. 5), consistent with other studies showing that end3 mutants are not defective in high affinity ferrous iron uptake.1 However, at the non-permissive temperature, this end3 mutation did enhance the iron deficiency of an atx1Δ strain. At 37°C, but not at 25°C, an atx1Δ end3 double mutant exhibited the same iron dependence of a ccc2 mutant and showed no growth on ferrozine medium supplemented with only 50 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate (Fig. 5). Growth of the atx1Δ end3 double mutant was stimulated by 350 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate and also by 500 μM CuSO4 (Fig. 5), indicating that iron deficiency resulted from inadequate copper delivery to Ccc2p and Fet3p. Hence, the apparent residual trafficking of copper to Fet3p in atx1 mutants involves endocytosis. The genes required for high affinity ferrous iron uptake in yeast fall under the control of the iron-sensing trans-activator, Aft1p (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). Included in this list of iron regulated genes are FRE1 (encoding ferric reductase; 38Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Google Scholar), FTR1 (iron permease), FET3, and CCC2 (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). In comparison, CTR1, which is involved in global copper homeostasis, is regulated by Mac1p (39Jungmann J. Reins H. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 5051-5056Google Scholar), a copper-sensing trans-activator.1 Upon inspection of ATX1 upstream sequences we noted a single Aft1p consensus sequence TGCACCC at nucleotides −110 to −116 (Fig. 6A). However, possible recognition sequences for the Mac1p trans-activator could not be found. This observation suggested that ATX1 may fall under the Aft1p regulon. Northern blot analysis was used to test the regulation of ATX1 by copper and iron. For studies on copper, ATX1 expression was monitored in strains treated with the copper chelator bathocuproine sulfonate under conditions known to induce the CTR1 and CTR3 copper transport genes (2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar, 40Knight S. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Google Scholar). We also tested the effects of null and hyper-active alleles of MAC1 (39Jungmann J. Reins H. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 5051-5056Google Scholar) on ATX1 mRNA levels. However, in all cases, ATX1 gene expression remained unaffected by copper depletion or by mutations in MAC1 (data not shown), indicating that ATX1 is not copper-regulated. To examine the possible regulation by iron and Aft1p, ATX1 gene expression was monitored in strains containing either an aft1 null mutation or a hyper-active allele of AFT1 (AFT1-1up; 18Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, ATX1 mRNA was up-regulated in a strain containing the hyper-active AFT1-1up allele, as was FET3 mRNA known to be a target for Aft1p-regulation (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). Densitometric tracings revealed that the induced level of ATX1 and FET3 mRNA in the AFT1-1up strain compared with the isogeneic wild type was 3.0- and 3.6-fold, respectively. Surprisingly however, the basal level of ATX1 gene expression was unaffected in strains containing an aft1Δ null mutation (Fig. 6B) or in wild type strains treated with repressing concentrations of iron that inactivate Aft1p (data not shown; 17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). In comparison, FET3 expression was virtually eliminated in the aft1Δ strain (Fig. 6B). CCC2 mRNA levels are also known to be markedly decreased in an aft1Δ strain (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). Hence unlike CCC2 and FET3, ATX1 is not absolutely dependent on Aft1p, and other trans-acting factors must be involved in ATX1 regulation. In bakers' yeast, multiple pathways of copper trafficking emerge from the plasma membrane copper transporter, Ctr1p. Copper taken up by Ctr1p is delivered to the mitochondria where the metal is needed for electron transport, to a compartment needed for activation of cytosolic copper proteins (such as Sod1p), and to the secretory pathway (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 2Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwan Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The studies presented herein describe a small copper carrier, Atx1p, that functions in the Ctr1 pathway that delivers copper to secretory compartments. Several lines of evidence support a role for Atx1p in the trafficking of copper from Ctr1p to the secretory pathway. Like the copper transporters Ctr1p and Ccc2p, Atx1p is required for activation of Fet3p, a multi-copper oxidase involved in iron transport (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 5Yuan D.S.

Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Strains containing mutations in ATX1 are deficient in ferrous iron uptake and show iron-dependent growth. Furthermore, experiments in the accompanying paper (33Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Google Scholar) demonstrate that atx1Δ mutants are defective in production of copper-Fet3p, in vivo Our localization of Atx1p to the cytosol, together with our genetic epistasis experiment, indicates that Atx1p functions as a cytosolic carrier for copper, shuttling the metal from the cell surface Ctr1p to the copper translocating ATPase, Ccc2p, in the secretory pathway. Consistent with its role as a soluble copper carrier, purified Atx1p specifically coordinates copper ions in vitro4 It is noteworthy that the bacterial homologue to Atx1p, MerP, likewise functions as a small metal carrier and is believed to help shuttle mercury ions across the periplasmic space to the MerT mercury transporter in the cell membrane (41Morby A.P. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 25-35Google Scholar, 42Hamlett N.V. Landale E.C. Davis B.H. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6377-6385Google Scholar). Ccc2p and Fet3p can also obtain copper ions in an ATX1-independent manner. atx1 mutants exhibited partial inhibition of ferrous iron uptake. In comparison, iron uptake was eliminated in ccc2 mutants. Our studies show that the apparent residual copper trafficking in atx1 mutants involves endocytosis. A blockage in endocytosis together with a mutation in atx1 conferred a dependence on iron for growth that was indistinguishable from that observed with ccc2Δ mutations. The mechanism by which endocytosis could facilitate intracellular copper transport is currently not known. One possibility is that Ctr1p vesicles are involved. Ctr1p has been shown to be internalized to vesicles by endocytosis (43Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Google Scholar). A mutation in CTR1 blocks not only the Atx1p-dependent pathway of copper delivery, but also the endocytosis pathway, since ctr1Δ mutants do not exhibit the back-up system for copper delivery that is evident in atx1Δ mutants (1Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar). We therefore propose that Ctr1p may bypass Atx1p through vesicle fusion events and directly deliver copper to Ccc2p, as illustrated in the model of Fig. 7. In any case, the contribution of endocytosis to cytosolic copper trafficking appears minor in comparison to the predominant role of Atx1p. Atx1p is not a global facilitator of intracellular copper transport. Our other studies5 show that Atx1p does not function in copper delivery to cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondria or to Sod1p in the cytosol. How then does cytosolic Atx1p favor Ccc2p/Fet3p in the secretory pathway over other copper-requiring targets? It is noteworthy that Atx1p and Ccc2p share the same MTCXXC consensus metal-binding motif that serves to coordinate copper ions. It is therefore possible that this motif mediates the direct delivery of copper from Atx1p to Ccc2p and may also facilitate interactions between the two proteins. ATX1 was originally identified, not as a copper trafficking protein, but rather as a multi-copy suppressor of oxidative damage in sod1Δ mutants (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). Is the apparent anti-oxidant activity of Atx1p related to its role in iron transport? Our studies suggest not. We observed that multi-copy ATX1 can still suppress Sod1p deficiency in strains containing deletions in either CCC2 or FET3 5S.-J. Lin and V. C. Culotta, unpublished data. Hence, suppression of oxidative damage does not require copper delivery to Fet3p. However, ATX1 suppression of sod1Δ is dependent on the Ctr1p copper transporter (19Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that multi-copy ATX1 suppresses sod1Δ by increasing delivery of redox active copper ions to a target in the cytosol where Sod1p is normally needed. This target may represent a non-Sod1 copper complex that is capable of neutralizing oxygen radicals. Our gene regulation studies also suggest that the role of Atx1p may not be restricted to iron uptake. Aft1p is an iron-sensing trans-activator that is essential for the expression of genes involved in iron uptake, including the FRE1 ferric reductase gene, the FTR1 ferrous permease, FET3, and CCC2 (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that ATX1 can also fall under Aft1p control; however, unlike other Aft1p-regulated genes, ATX1 does not show an absolute requirement for Aft1p. The bulk of ATX1 expression is unaffected by a null mutation in AFT1, and another trans-activator must be responsible. Our preliminary studies suggest that Atx1p also falls under the control of the oxygen-sensing trans-activator, Yap1p (44Harshman K.D. Moye-Rowley W.S. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 321-330Google Scholar). The regulation of ATX1 by both iron status and oxidative stress would be consistent with the dual roles for copper-Atx1p in protection against oxygen radical toxicity and in the delivery of copper to Fet3p. We are indebted to Dr. S. Michaelis for the end3 mutant, to Dr. T. Dunn for strain 3, and to Dr. D. Kosman for the YPH250Δaft1 strain and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1965202020,"To search for a mammalian homologue of <i>ATX1</i>, a human liver cDNA library was screened and a cDNA clone was isolated, which encodes a protein with 47% amino acid identity to Atx1p including conservation of the MTC<i>X</i>GC copper-binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2074049733,"Although studies have shown that the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (mGR) contains eight phosphorylation sites (Bodwell, J. E., Orti, E., Coull, J. M., Pappin, D. J. C., Smith, L. I., and Swift, F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7549-7555), the effect of phosphorylation on receptor function is unclear. We have examined the consequences of single or multiple phosphorylation site mutations on several properties of mGR including receptor expression, ligand-dependent nuclear translocation, hormone-mediated transactivation, ligand-dependent down-regulation of mGR, and receptor protein half-life. Mutations had little effect on receptor expression, subcellular distribution, ligand-dependent nuclear translocation, or on the ability to activate hormone-mediated transcription from a complex (murine mammary tumor virus) promoter. In contrast, the phosphorylation status of the mGR had a profound effect on the ability to transactivate a minimal promoter containing simple glucocorticoid response elements after hormone administration. Similarly, ligand-dependent down-regulation by glucocorticoids of both receptor mRNA and protein was abrogated in mutants containing three or more phosphorylation site alterations. Finally, we show that the phosphorylation status of mGR has a profound effect on the stability of the glucocorticoid receptor protein. Receptors containing seven or eight mutated sites have a markedly extended half-life and do not show the ligand-dependent destabilization seen with wild type receptor. These data show that receptor phosphorylation may play a crucial role in regulating receptor levels and hence control receptor functions."
https://openalex.org/W2090000200,"Crude enzyme obtained from chondroitin sulfate-induced Proteus vulgaris NCTC 4636 has been fractionated into 1) an endoeliminase capable of depolymerizing chondroitin sulfate and related polysaccharides to produce, as end products, a mixture of Δ4-unsaturated tetra- and disaccharides and 2) an exoeliminase preferentially acting on chondroitin sulfate tetra- and hexasaccharides to yield the respective disaccharides. Isolation of the two enzymes was achieved by a simple two-step procedure: extracting the enzymes from intact P. vulgaris cells with a buffer solution of nonionic surfactant and then treating the extract by cation-exchange chromatography. Each of the enzymes thus prepared was apparently homogeneous as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and readily crystallized from polyethylene glycol solutions. Both enzymes acted on various substrates such as chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and dermatan sulfate at high, but significantly different, initial rates. They also attacked hyaluronan but at far lower rates and were inactive to keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin. Our results show that the known ability of the conventional enzyme called “chondroitinase ABC” to catalyze the complete depolymerization of chondroitin sulfates to unsaturated disaccharides may actually result from the combination reactions by endoeliminase (chondroitin sulfate ABC endolyase) and exoeliminase (chondroitin sulfate ABC exolyase).

Chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) was first purified from extracts of Proteus vulgaris NCTC 4636 adapted to chondroitin 6-sulfate (1Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar). It is believed to be an endoeliminase that splits β1,4-galactosaminidic bonds between N-acetylgalactosamine and either D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic acid and degrades, therefore, a variety of glycosaminoglycans of the chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate type to the respective unsaturated disaccharides. Using this enzyme, both chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfates were shown to contain, in addition to predominant 4- or 6-sulfated disaccharide residues, a smaller proportion of nonsulfated or disulfated disaccharide residues, or both (2Suzuki S. Saito H. Yamagata T. Anno K. Seno N. Kawai Y. Furuhashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1543-1550Google Scholar). A variety of studies have since shown that the proportion of these disaccharide residues varies greatly with species and anatomical sites, during development and aging, and in pathology (3Kimata K.

Many of these data suggest that variation in the carbohydrate sequence and sulfation pattern may be used to specify the functional properties of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. There is a commercially available chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (“chondroitinase ABC” from P. vulgaris, the product of Seikagaku Corp.) which has found wide applications including the quantification of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (12Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Google Scholar), the structural analysis of the carbohydrate moiety of proteoglycans (13Hascall V.C. Riolo R.L. J. Biol.

Because of the increased use of the enzyme, more attention has been directed in our laboratories toward understanding its purity, specificity, and mode of action. A purification procedure yielded a chondroitin sulfate-degrading enzyme with a higher specific activity whose end products were tetrasaccharides in addition to disaccharides (21Hashimoto, N., Hamai, A., Mochizuki, H., Ishikawa, S., Torikai, M., Miyachi, I., (1993) European Patent Publication 0576294-A2.Google Scholar, 22Yoshida K.

Portland Press Ltd., London1993: 55-70Google Scholar). In the meantime, Sugahara et al (23Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Google Scholar) reported that a highly purified chondroitinase ABC preparation (commercially available as “protease-free chondroitinase ABC”) was unable to degrade the unsaturated tetrasaccharides irrespective of their sulfation patterns. These findings suggested the possibility that the conventional chondroitinase ABC preparation contained a tetrasaccharide-degrading enzyme that may have been removed during the process to prepare the protease-free enzyme. We report here the isolation and crystallization from P. vulgaris of two distinct eliminases, one to catalyze the endolytic cleavage of chondroitin sulfate and related compounds and the other to split off disaccharide residues from the nonreducing ends of both polymeric chondroitin sulfates and their oligosaccharide fragments produced by the endoeliminase. The following compounds were the products of Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo: hyaluronan from human umbilical cords; chondroitin prepared by desulfation of chondroitin 4-sulfate; chondroitin 4-sulfate from whale cartilage (75% 4-sulfate and 20% 6-sulfate); chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage (Mr 20-80 × 103, 15% 4-sulfate, 75% 6-sulfate, and 10% 2,6-disulfate); chondroitin sulfate D from shark cartilage (20% 2,6-disulfate, 25% 4-sulfate, and 45% 6-sulfate); chondroitin sulfate E from squid cartilage (60% 4,6-disulfate, 25% 4-sulfate, and 10% 6-sulfate); dermatan sulfate from pig skin (90% 4-sulfate, 2% 6-sulfate, and 7% 2,4-disulfate); keratan sulfate from bovine cornea, and heparan sulfate from bovine kidney. Heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma; POELE 1The abbreviations used are: POELEpolyoxyethylene lauryl etherChS ABC lyasechondroitin sulfate ABC lyasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography was from Nikko Chemicals Co., Tokyo; and CM-Sepharose FF was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides and hexasaccharides were prepared from chondroitin 6-sulfate by testicular hyaluronidase digestion followed by Cellulofine GCL-90sf gel chromatography, according to the method of Rodén et al. (24Rodén L. Baker J.R. Helting T. Schwartz N.B. Stoolmiller A.C. Yamagata S. Yamagata T. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 638-676Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (A1D1 fraction) was prepared from bovine nasal septum cartilage by the procedure described by Oegema et al. (25Oegema Jr., T.E. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6151-6159Google Scholar). polyoxyethylene lauryl ether chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography ChS ABC lyase activity was measured based on the increase in A232 essentially as described by Yamagata et al. (1Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar). A typical incubation mixture contained a measured quantity of enzyme, 150 μg of poly- or oligosaccharide substrate, 10 μmol of sodium acetate, and 5 μg of casein in 250 μl of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Control medium contained heat-inactivated enzyme in the above mixture. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by heating for 1 min in a boiling water bath. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 10 volumes of 50 mM HCl, and UV absorption of the resultant solution was measured at 232 nm against the corresponding blank mixture. One unit of enzyme is the amount required for the eliminative cleavage of substrate, yielding UV-absorbing materials corresponding to 1 μmol of Δ4-hexuronate residues per min, as calculated with a value of 5,500 for its molar absorption coefficient. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin as a standard. P. vulgaris NCTC 4636 was routinely grown at 30°C in the medium containing peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, and NaCl, as described previously (1Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar), with chondroitin 6-sulfate (5 g/liter) as the inducer. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C) at the end of logarithmic phase. Approximately 150 g (wet weight) of cells were obtained in a 20-liter fermentation. A 100-g portion of collected cells was suspended in 400 ml of 5% (w/v) POELE in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and allowed to stand at 35°C with gentle stirring for 2 h. The resultant suspension was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C. Cold water was added to the supernatant fluid, bringing the final concentration of POELE to 1.5% (w/v), and the solution was applied to a CM-Sepharose column (3 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was washed successively with each 100 ml of 0.5% (w/v) POELE in water and 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.2. The column was then subjected to elution with a linear gradient of 0-0.2 M NaCl in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.2. The total volume of gradient elution was 320 ml. The flow rate was 1.6 ml per min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing the major portion of each enzyme peak were pooled and dialyzed against cold water for desalting. To the resultant nondiffusible fraction was added 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, until a slight turbidity appeared. It was then allowed to stand in a cold room until crystals appeared. Amino acid analyses were performed on a Hitachi L-8500 amino acid analyzer. Samples were hydrolyzed at 110°C for 24 h in gaseous 6 M HCl under nitrogen vacuum. N-terminal amino acid residue was identified by Edman degradation using Tosoh phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analytical HPLC system. SDS-PAGE was carried out in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Before electrophoresis, sample solutions were diluted with sample buffer (1.2% w/v SDS, 1.0% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) at 100°C for 2 min. The molecular weight markers consisted of myosin (Mr 212,000), α2-macroglobulin (Mr 170,000), β-galactosidase (Mr 116,000), transferrin (Mr 76,000), and glutamic dehydrogenase (Mr 53,000). After electrophoresis, the proteins in gel were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Isoelectric point was determined on a gel of PhastGel isoelectric focusing pH 3-9 by PhastSystem™ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a pI calibration kit 3-10 as a standard. Immunochemical examination of enzymes was performed with rabbit antiserum prepared against each purified enzyme, according to the method of Ouchterlony (27Ouchterlony O. Ark. Kemi Mineral. Geol. 1948; 26: 1-9Google Scholar). To prepare the antisera, white rabbits (18-week-old males) were immunized with two injections of 1 mg of each enzyme emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Yatoron Co., Tokyo) by an interval of 1 week. At three subsequent intervals, a booster injection of approximately 0.5 mg of enzyme protein was given. The animals were bled 7 days later, and the sera were pooled. To the antiserum was added ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate emerging with the range from 20 to 50% saturation was collected, dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and dialyzed for 20 h against three 2-liter changes of the same buffer. To measure the change in viscosity and to determine the size distribution of oligosaccharide intermediates produced during enzymatic digestion, assay solutions were prepared that contained 10 mg of glycosaminoglycan per ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in 37°C water bath. Sufficient enzyme was then added so that there was 0.015 unit of enzyme per mg of substrate, and incubation was continued at 37°C. At specific times, an aliquot was withdrawn and heated in a boiling water bath for 1 min. Then the aliquot was subjected to the following three measurements. The viscosity of the aliquot diluted with an equal volume of 0.4 M NaCl was measured in an Ubbelohde-type automatic viscometer VMC-052 (Rigosha, Tokyo) at 30°C. Each of the heated aliquots was diluted with 50 volumes of 50 mM HCl and 40 volumes of 0.2 M NaCl, respectively. The former was used for A232 measurement and the latter for gel permeation HPLC to determine the size distribution of oligosaccharides generated at the specific times. The analytical HPLC columns used were TSKgel G3000PWXL and G2500PWXL connected in this order. Gel permeation HPLC was performed with a flow rate of 0.5 ml per min with 0.2 M NaCl at 35°C. The elution was monitored with Tosoh UV (232 nm) monitor UV8010 and Tosoh differential refractometer RI8010 in this order. In initial experiments we noticed that ChS ABC lyases could efficiently be extracted from intact P. vulgaris cells at 35°C with 5% (w/v) POELE, a nonionic surfactant, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (see Table I, Footnote a). Fig. 1 shows the fractionation of the 16,000 × g supernatant of POELE extracts by CM-Sepharose column chromatography. A large portion of the contaminant proteins including possible proteolytic enzymes and sulfatases were passed through and removed by washing the column with 0.5% (w/v) POELE in H2O and then with 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.2. Little or no chondroitin sulfate lyase activity was detected in the washings (data not shown). Subsequent elution of the washed column with a linear NaCl gradient yielded two major protein peaks (I and II) that accounted for ∼70 and ∼25%, respectively, of the total protein eluates. When aliquots of each fraction were checked for lyase activity on chondroitin 6-sulfate and on the tetrasaccharide prepared from it, the elution curves were obtained which suggest that the protein peaks I and II may actually represent different lyases. The peak I enzyme acted on the chondroitin 6-sulfate substrate but not on the tetrasaccharide substrate. In contrast, the peak II enzyme acted on the tetrasaccharide substrate at about 5 times higher initial rate than on the polysaccharide substrate. The fractions collected in peak II displayed similar ratios of activity against polysaccharide and tetrasaccharide substrates, suggesting that both reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme. The fractions containing the major portion of each enzyme peak were pooled for further analyses; hereinafter the peak I and peak II enzyme will be referred to as ChS ABC lyase I and II, respectively. A summary of the purification procedure is shown in Table I. SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions illustrated that the peak I and peak II proteins were apparently homogeneous (Fig. 2). On the basis of their mobilities relative to those of molecular weight (Mr) standards, the molecular weight of ChS ABC lyase I and II were estimated to be 100 × 103 and 105 × 103, respectively. Both peak I and peak II enzyme proteins were crystallized from solutions of polyethylene glycol (Fig. 3). No significant reduction was observed in their specific activity by repeating recrystallization, suggesting that the enzyme preparations are at a high state of purity. However, isoelectric focusing of the two enzymes on PhastGel IEF with a pH gradient of 3.50-9.30 showed that ChS ABC lyase II migrated as a single band, pI = 8.45, whereas ChS lyase I migrated as a doublet of bands, pI = 8.25 and 8.50. Although the results suggest the presence of two isoforms of ChS lyase I, further work is needed to understand this phenomenon. On double immunodiffusion analysis using anti-lyase I antiserum, a precipitin line was detected against ChS ABC lyase I but not against ChS ABC lyase II (data not shown). Using anti-lyase II antiserum, on the other hand, a precipitin line was detected against ChS ABC lyase II but not against ChS ABC lyase I. The results indicate that the two enzymes are immunochemically distinct proteins. Amino acid analyses of the two enzymes are shown in Table II. The lyase I and lyase II proteins are similar in overall compositional features, e.g both have high Asx, Glx, and Leu contents. The N-terminal amino acids of the lyase I and lyase II protein were determined to be alanine and leucine, respectively. To measure the lyase activity, chondroitin 6-sulfate and the tetrasaccharide prepared from it were chosen as substrate (for relative activities on other substrates, see below). Unless otherwise indicated, an incubation time of 20 min was selected. The pH optima determined at 37°C in 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer were around 8.0 for both ChS ABC lyase I and II (Fig. 4). The optimum temperatures for activity determined at pH 8.0 were 37°C for lyase I and 40°C for lyase II, respectively. The small temperature difference between ABC lyase I and II may reflect, at least in part, their temperature stability optima at pH 8.0. Thus, the activity losses at 37 and 40°C in 30 min were 39 and 47%, respectively, for lyase I and 10 and 23%, respectively, for lyase II (data not shown). Both ChS ABC lyase I and II were almost completely inhibited by Zn2+ at 1 mM. At the same cation concentration, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ produced 80-90% inhibition of lyase I, whereas they had little or no effect on lyase II. Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ showed no effect on both lyase I and II. Both enzymatic reactions of lyase I and II to chondroitin 6-sulfate exhibited typical saturation behavior. Analysis of their Lineweaver-Burk plots (not shown) exhibited an apparent Km of 66 μM and a Vmax of 310 μmol/min/mg of protein for lyase I and an apparent Km of 80 μM and a Vmax of 34 μmol/min/mg of protein for lyase II, based on hexuronate residues. In a similar way, an apparent Km and a Vmax value for the lyase II acting on tetrasaccharide were shown to be 33 μM and 155 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, based on hexuronate residues. The specificity of ChS ABC lyase I and II was determined using various polysaccharide substrates (Table III). The chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate samples were degraded at high, but significantly different, initial rates. In contrast, hyaluronan was degraded at very low rates with both lyase I and II. Even on the same glycosaminoglycan substrate, a significant difference in activity was observed between ChS lyase I and II, e.g. lyase I degraded both chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate E at one-third to one-forth the rate for chondroitin 6-sulfate, whereas lyase II degraded these three glycosaminoglycans at comparable rates. Keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin were not substrates for lyase I or II. The activity of the enzymes was greatly influenced by the size of chondroitin sulfate chain. The specific activities of ChS ABC lyase I on the poly-, hexa-, and tetrasaccharide substrates were 330, 75, and 0 units/mg of protein, respectively. In contrast, the activity of ChS ABC lyase II increased with the decrease of chain size, 30, 110, and 150 units/mg of protein on the poly-, hexa-, and tetrasaccharide substrates, respectively. The lyase-catalyzed breakdown of chondroitin 6-sulfate was followed by using both UV and viscosimetric assays. While the change in A232 reflects the number of sites cleaved, the change in viscosity is an indicator of the change in average polysaccharide chain length. As Fig. 5, a and b shows, a marked difference between ChS ABC lyase I and II in the rates of viscosity decrease was observed. Thus, lyase I caused a rapid drop in viscosity even before any extensive cleavage has occurred (a). Lyase II, in contrast, showed a slow viscosity change that was approximately proportional to the increase of A232 (b). The results indicate that ChS ABC lyase I acts endolytically on chondroitin 6-sulfate, whereas ChS ABC lyase II acts on the same substrate in an exolytic fashion. When acting on dermatan sulfate, lyase I again gave a concave curve of viscosity change (Fig. 5c), but its shape is significantly shallower than that for chondroitin 6-sulfate (a). This difference appears to be primarily the result of the difference of initial viscosity of each polymer, 0.22 and 0.85 for 0.5% (w/v) solution of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate, respectively. ChS ABC lyase II, on the other hand, acted on dermatan sulfate with an ideal exolytic pattern (d). Nearly identical curves with an endolytic and an exolytic action pattern were given by lyase I and II, respectively, when acting on chondroitin 4-sulfate whose initial viscosity is 0.28 (0.5%, w/v) (data not shown). These results, coupled with the size distribution patterns of digest products (see below), show that lyase I acts on polysaccharides of the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate type in an endolytic fashion, while lyase II acts in an exolytic fashion, irrespective of their sulfation/5-epimerization pattern. The size distribution of oligosaccharides generated at different digestion stages was determined by gel permeation HPLC monitored with both a differential refractometer and UV (232 nm) monitor (Fig. 6). Panels b-b′ and c-c′ show that, in relatively short-term incubation, ChS ABC lyase I acted on chondroitin 6-sulfate to give rise to a wide range of differently sized Δ4-oligosaccharides and that their average size was progressively reduced with time. After exhaustive digestion (5 h), two end products corresponding in size to tetra- and disaccharides were detected (d-d′). In contrast, the digest products by ChS ABC lyase II were of disaccharide size throughout the digestion periods (f-f′, g-g′, and h-h′). Gel permeation HPLC was used to further confirm the action patterns of ChS ABC lyase I and II on dermatan sulfate. As shown in Fig. 7, relatively short term digestion with lyase I resulted in the appearance of differently sized intermediates (b-b′ and c-c′), whereas the digest products by lyase II were of disaccharide size throughout the digestion time (f-f′, g-g′, and h-h′). The results are nearly identical with those obtained by digestion of chondroitin 6-sulfate (see above), except that the intact dermatan sulfate sample chromatographed as a smaller polysaccharide than did the intact chondroitin 6-sulfate sample (Fig. 7, a and e; cf Fig. 6, a and e). Also to be noted is the appearance of a shoulder just before, but overlapping, tetrasaccharides even after a 5-h digestion with lyase I (Fig. 7, d-d′, retention time of ∼ 29 min). This fraction was not studied further. Since, however, the proportion of the reducing terminal portion to the interior portion should be high in relatively short glycosaminoglycan chains, such as the dermatan sulfate used here, it would be possible that the shoulder represents oligosaccharides derived from the reducing terminal portion of dermatan sulfate where some non-cleavable sites are present. When digest products of chondroitin 4-sulfate were examined in a similar way, their size distribution patterns on HPLC were nearly the same as those of dermatan sulfate digest products shown in Fig. 7 (data not shown). Using the hexasaccharide substrate prepared from chondroitin 6-sulfate by testicular hyaluronidase digestion, the products at 100% reaction completion with ChS ABC lyase I and II were analyzed in a similar way (Fig. 8). The lyase I digest of hexasaccharide was composed of two fractions corresponding in size to tetra- and disaccharide (b). In this case, the disaccharide fraction exhibited little A232 (b′), indicating that the enzyme removed saturated disaccharide residue from the nonreducing end of hexasaccharide thereby leaving unsaturated tetrasaccharide. Panels d-d′ show that the digest products by ChS ABC lyase II were exclusively disaccharides. In a separate experiment, the chondroitin sulfate moiety of bovine nasal chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (where the reducing ends of polysaccharide chains are all linked to the core protein) was extensively cleaved by digestion with lyase II; over 95% of the total hexuronate residues were converted to unsaturated disaccharides at an initial rate comparable to the rates of degradation of free chondroitin sulfates (see Table III). Collectively, the results in Figs. 6, 7, 8 are entirely consistent with the data of viscosity change (Fig. 5) and provide a sound basis for the characteristic reaction mode of lyase I and II action; the former acts endolytically on chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, whereas the latter functions as a typical exoeliminase capable of splitting off disaccharide residues from the nonreducing end of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and related oligosaccharides. The major finding in this report is that the extract of P. vulgaris contains two distinct enzymes that are both able to degrade chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. This finding was accomplished by introducing the new purification methodology including 1) the use of POELE buffer for extracting the enzymes from intact P. vulgaris cells and 2) the use of two different substrates, chondroitin 6-sulfate and the tetrasaccharide prepared from it, for monitoring the elution from CM-Sepharose (Fig. 1). Each of the resultant enzymes was apparently homogeneous as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and readily crystallized from polyethylene glycol solutions (Fig. 3). As shown by the high yields of enzymes (Table I, Footnote a), the POELE buffer extraction is a key step in the purification procedure. The POELE treatment of intact P. vulgaris cells had almost negligible effects on both morphology and total dry weight of the cells (data not shown), suggesting a high degree of selectivity of POELE buffer solution in releasing chondroitinase enzymes from the cells. The failure in early studies to distinguish the two enzymes may be due, in part, to the molecular resemblance between the two enzyme proteins (see Fig. 2 and Table II). It is also pertinent that the early studies did not use sulfated tetra- or hexasaccharides as substrate for survey of chondroitin sulfate-degrading enzymes, whereas here these oligosaccharide substrates are most effective in distinguishing the exoeliminase from the endoeliminase (Fig. 1). Evidence from early studies on P. vulgaris chondroitinase suggested that the depolymerization of both chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate to the respective unsaturated disaccharides involves an endoeliminative attack by a single enzyme (28Sanderson P.N. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 347-354Google Scholar, 29Jandik K.A. Gu K. Linhardt R. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 289-296Google Scholar). Using both UV and viscometric assays, Jandic et al (29Jandik K.A. Gu K. Linhardt R. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 289-296Google Scholar) showed that the conventional chondroitinase ABC preparation deviates from an ideal endolytic mode when acting on bovine trachea chondroitin 4-sulfate (product of Celsus Laboratories, Inc.; 60% 4-sulfate and 36% 6-sulfate). One interpretation by these investigators is that the shallowness of the concave curve of viscosity change may be attributable to a limited number of cleavable sites present in this polysaccharide or to a non-random distribution of cleavable sites within the polysaccharide chain. However, it is also possible that the failure of the chondroitin 4-sulfate sample to give a steep concave curve may be due to the relatively small size of the substrate molecules, since our data showed that the shallowness of the concave curve given by lyase I was influenced by the initial viscosity of each polysaccharide and that a decrease in the polysaccharide chain size caused an increase in the specific activity of lyase II concomitantly with a decrease in the lyase I activity. Whatever explanation is correct, these results suggest that more attention should be focused on the structural diversity of polysaccharides of the chondroitin sulfate family. On the basis of the data obtained in the present study, we concluded that the complete depolymerization to disaccharides cannot be achieved by the endoeliminase alone. Our results strongly suggest that it is the combination reactions by endoeliminase (ChS ABC lyase I) and exoeliminase (ChS ABC lyase II) that results in the complete depolymerization, irrespective of their sulfation/5-epimerization pattern (Table III and Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). A clue to the nature of P. vulgaris chondroitinase ABC was advanced recently by Ryan et al (30Ryan, M. J., Khandke, K. M., Tilley, B. C., Lotvin, J. A., (1994) (international application published under the patent cooperation treaty) Patent WO 94/25567.Google Scholar). These investigators reported the cloning of cDNAs encoding chondroitinase ABC subcomponents, 110- and 112-kDa proteins, which are copurified by extensive chromatographic procedures (following mechanical or enzymatic cell disruption) but are separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two components show that the 110-kDa component is composed of 997 amino acid residues with alanine at the N-terminal, whereas the 112-kDa component has a different sequence of 990 amino acid residues with leucine at the N-terminal. Independent of this work, Sato et al (31Sato N. Shimada M. Nakajima H. Oda H. Kimura S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 39-46Google Scholar) demonstrated by cDNA cloning the deduced amino acid sequence of a major protein component of P. vulgaris chondroitinase ABC which is closely related to the 110-kDa component as above. More recently, Khandke et al (32Khandke, K. M., Gotto, J., Eul, U., (1995) (international application published under the patent cooperation treaty) Patent WO 95/29256.Google Scholar) have reported that the 110- and 112-kDa components are separated by Macro Prep High S chromatography and that extensive digestion of chondroitin sulfate (source not shown) or proteoglycan (product of ICN Biochemical Costa Mesa) by the 110-kDa component generates three end products (di- and oligosaccharides), whereas the 112-kDa component by itself is not capable of cleaving the polymeric chondroitin sulfate/proteoglycan substrates. Since, however, a mixture of the two protein components digests all the material to the disaccharides, they suggested that depolymerization to the small oligosaccharide fragments is a prerequisite for the action of the 112-kDa component to yield disaccharides. Our demonstration that the POELE extract of P. vulgaris contained two separate chondroitin sulfate ABC lyases would seem to consist with this idea. However, in the present study, the specificity of ChS ABC lyase II (105 kDa) was found to be different from that of the 112-kDa component reported by Khandke's group. In contrast to the 112-kDa component, it was found that ChS ABC lyase II by itself was able to split off disaccharide residues directly from polymeric chondroitin sulfate/proteoglycan in an exolytic pattern. Since a lyase which acts only on small-sized oligosaccharide chains was not detected by the present methodology, additional studies are needed to fully understand the nature of chondroitin sulfate-degrading enzymes occurring in P. vulgaris cells. Available evidence shows that all chondroitin sulfate chains are polydisperse in molecular weight (10-350 × 103) and that one chondroitin sulfate chain can often consist of various proportions of mono- and disulfated disaccharide repeats, e.g GlcA→GalNAc (4- or 6-sulfate), GlcA (2-sulfate)→GalNAc (6-sulfate), and GlcA→GalNAc(4, 6-disulfate) (2Suzuki S. Saito H. Yamagata T. Anno K. Seno N. Kawai Y. Furuhashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1543-1550Google Scholar). The identification of the specific sequences of those disaccharide units that are responsible for their physiological activities is a most interesting challenge that is developing in the chondroitin sulfate field (6, 7, 10, 16, among others). It must be recalled in this respect that it is difficult to obtain a pure chondroitin sulfate for sequence analyses. Therefore, detection of desired sequences will require the partial cleavage of starting polysaccharide samples to obtain oligosaccharide fragments in which desired (bioactive) sequences will be detected. The ability of ChS ABC lyase I to catalyze the endolytic cleavage of chondroitin sulfate chains, coupled with its lack of exolyase activity, will permit the use of this enzyme as an effective reagent in preparing the tetra- and higher oligosaccharides for structure-function studies. Recent analysis of the unsaturated tetrasaccharides derived from shark fin chondroitin sulfate (33Yoshida K. Kikuchi H. Miyazono H. Maeyama K. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 488Google Scholar) has indeed shown that the profile of sulfation is much less random than has previously assumed, e.g the disaccharide units linked by β-1,4 to GlcA(2-SO4)→GalNAc(6-SO4) are exclusively GlcA→ GalNAc(4-SO4), and there are no disulfated disaccharide units linking by β-1,4 to each other. The highly purified lyase II preparation that splits off disaccharide residues in an exolytic fashion from the nonreducing end may be used to get more detailed sequence information. The commonly used P. vulgaris chondroitinase enzymes are designated as “chondroitinase ABC” and “chondroitinase ABC, protease-free” by Seikagaku Corp. It is now clear that the the former is a mixture of ChS lyase I and II (and some proteases) and the latter a ChS ABC lyase I enzyme free of both lyase II and proteases. When cleaving proteoglycan samples by extensive digestion with these enzymes, we must consider the possibility that the resulting core preparations may be different in the size of chondroitin sulfate remnants attached. Hascall and Riolo (13Hascall V.C. Riolo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4529-4538Google Scholar) showed that limiting digestion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (from bovine nasal cartilage) with the conventional chondroitinase ABC leaves a residual disaccharide on the chondroitin sulfate chains in the core protein preparation. It is possible then that the use of protease-free chondroitinase ABC in place of the conventional enzyme would result in the production of core preparations bearing tetra- or higher chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharide remnants. If this is so, the commercially available enzyme designated as “chondroitinase ABC, protease-free” may be used to prepare octa- or higher oligosaccharide chains (including the linkage tetrasaccharide) closest to core protein for structural analyses. We propose that the endo- and exoeliminase are to be named chondroitin sulfate ABC endolyase and exolyase or, a shorter form, endochondroitinase ABC and exochondroitinase ABC, respectively. We are grateful to Dr. Sanae Kato for her skillful technical assistance, to Dr. Keiichi Yoshida for his helpful suggestions and discussions, and to Keiko Morimoto for her help in the preparation of this manuscript."

The mechanisms that control the expression of genes operate at a variety of levels that include all the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages. In a rapidly growing number of examples, gene expression is regulated also at the level of translation, usually involving the translational initiation step. mRNA leaders that mediate efficient translation initiation are short (50-70 nt), 1The abbreviation used are: ntnucleotide(s)PDGFplatelet-derived growth factor5′-UTR5′ untranslated regionIRESinternal ribosomal entry siteD-IRESdifferentiation-linked IRESTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatebpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseLUCluciferaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseCMVcytomegalovirusEMCVencephalomyocarditis virusHAVhepatitis A viruskbkilobase pair(s) contain 5′-m7G cap structure, and lack stable secondary structures as well as upstream AUG codons (reviewed in 1Merrick W.C.

Interestingly, genes encoding for regulatory proteins involved in growth and development often do not meet these criteria and produce long, structured, and upstream AUG-burdened mRNA leaders. These features are incompatible with efficient translation by the ribosomal scanning mechanism which is considered valid for the translation of the vast majority of cellular and viral mRNAs (2Kozak M.

PDGF consists of homo- or heterodimers of two protein chains, PDGF-A and PDGF-B. The PDGF-B chain is the product of the PDGF2/c-sis proto-oncogene, which has a neoplastic transformation potential and is expressed in various types of tumor tissues. Normally, the expression of PDGF2/c-sis is tightly regulated due to multiple control mechanisms at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. PDGF2/c-sis mRNA has a striking architecture: it has a 723-nt coding region and exceptionally long 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of 1022 and 1625 nt, respectively. The extraordinarily long 5′-UTR contains stable secondary structures and three mini-open reading frames upstream of the translation initiator AUG codon. As such, it imposes a significant barrier to the linear ribosomal scanning from the 5′-m7G cap structure toward the fourth AUG codon, thereby serving as a potent translational inhibitor (reviewed in 3Dirks R.H. Bloemers H.P.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 22: 1-24Google Scholar). One of the major sites of PDGF synthesis is within bone marrow megakaryocytes, the platelets progenitor cells. As shown in our earlier work, the 5′-UTR-mediated translational inhibition was relieved at a certain time window during megakaryocytic differentiation (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar). The translation inhibitory effect of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR was not relieved by elevated levels of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar), nor by mutations of the upstream AUG codons (5Rao C.D. Pech M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 284-292Google Scholar, 6Horvath P. Suganuma A. Inaba M. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K. Cell Growth & Diff. 1995; 6: 1103-1110Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine whether during the differentiation process PDGF2/c-sis mRNA is translated by an alternative cap-independent initiation mechanism. A cap-independent mechanism for translation initiation has been demonstrated for picornaviruses, which lack 5′-m7G cap and have long, structured, AUG-burdened mRNA leaders. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was found in members of the cardio-, aphto-, entero-, rhino-, and hepatoviruses, as well as in pestiviruses. Although there is no similarity in the primary sequences of the different IRES elements, there are similarities in their secondary structural features (reviewed in Refs. 7Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N.Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000Google Scholar and 8Rivera V.M. Welsh J.D. Maizel J.V. Virology. 1988; 165: 42-50Google Scholar). Interestingly, internal translation has been found also for the cellular genes of mammalian Bip (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar), FGF2 (10Vagner S. Gensac M.-C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Google Scholar), IGF-II (11Teerink H. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that the PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR contains an IRES element that responds to changes in the cellular milieu and facilitates translation of the mRNA during megakaryocytic differentiation. Computer analysis involving inspection of compensatory base changes among divergent PDGF2/c-sis sequences from human, cat, and mouse predicts structural features within the 5′-UTR that are common to known IRES elements. This study provides the first example for a differentiation-linked IRES (D-IRES) element, which might be one of many inducible IRES elements in extraordinary mRNA leaders of cellular genes encoding critical regulatory proteins. pT7CAT-LUC obtained from Dr. Sarnow (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) was digested with SalI, filled in, and ligated with 1-kb NcoI-MluI filled in fragment of pPD1 (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar), to create pT7CPL. pT7CEL was constructed by three-part ligation of the following fragments: (i) 0.3-kb SalI(filled-in)-NcoI fragment from pT7CAT-LUC, (ii) 0.5-kb ApaI(filled-in)-NcoI fragment of pEMCV-CAT (14Whetter L.E. Day S.P. Elroy-Stein O. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5253-5263Google Scholar), and (iii) the backbone NcoI fragment of pT7CAT-LUC. To construct pT7CHL, 0.7-kb SalI fragment was generated from pHAV/7 template (15Cohen J.I. Ticehurst J.R. Feinstone S.M. Rosenblum B. Purcell R.H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3035-3039Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGGGTCGACCTCACCGCCGT-3′ and 5′-GGGGGTCGACCTAAATGCCCC-3′, followed by SalI digestion and ligation into the SalI site of pT7CAT-LUC. The bi-cistronic plasmids under the CMV promoter were generated using pBI-FC1 or pHP-FC1 from Dr. A.-C. Prats as backbones (10Vagner S. Gensac M.-C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Google Scholar). The following cloning steps were performed: 1.8-kb NotI-SacI fragment harboring the LUC gene was generated by polymerase chain reaction using pT7CAT-LUC (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) as template and oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGGTCGACGCGGCCGCCCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATA-3′ and 5′-CCCCGAGCTCCATTCATCAATTTGC-3′ and was inserted into NotI and SacI sites of pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) downstream of the T7 promoter to create pBS-LUC. In addition, the 1.8-kb SacI-NotI fragment harboring the LUC gene was ligated with the 4.1-kb SacI-NotI fragment of pBI-FC1 to create the bi-cistronic pCL plasmid. Intact or truncated c-sis 5′-UTRs were inserted into pBS-LUC plasmid, upstream to LUC. This was done by ligating pBS-LUC SpeI-NcoI fragment with polymerase chain reaction fragments which were generated by using psis4.0 (5Rao C.D. Pech M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 284-292Google Scholar) as template and oligonucleotide primers homologous to specific c-sis 5′-UTR sequences. The following oligonucleotides, which bear synthetic SpeI or NcoI sites, were used: 5′-CCCCACTAGTGGCAACTTCTCCTCC-3′ (JB7) and 5′-CCCCCCATGGCGACTCCGGGCCCGGCCC-3′ (OS35) to amplify the intact 5′-UTR (1–1022); 5′-CCCCACTAGTAACCGGAGCAGCCGCAGC-3′ (OS64) and 5′-CCAACCATGGCTTTGCAACGGCAGC-3′ (OS65) to amplify region 215-488; and 5′-GGGTACTAGTGCTGCCGTTGC-3′ (OS66) and 5′-CTCACCCCCATGGCCCCGGC-3′ (OS67) to amplify region 475-870. The ATG of the NcoI site was designed to match exactly with the ATG of LUC. The SpeI-SacI fragment containing the full-length 5′-UTR fused to LUC was ligated with the 4.1-kb SpeI-SacI fragment of pBI-FC1 or pHP-FC1 to create pCPL or pHCPL, respectively. The SpeI-SacI fragments containing the truncated 5′-UTR fused to LUC were ligated with the 4.1-kb SpeI-SacI fragment of pSCT Bi28 to create pC(215–488)L and pC(475–870)L. Megakaryocytic differentiation was induced by treatment of exponentially growing K562 cells with TPA (Sigma) at concentration of 5 nM for 48 h. Infection-transfection was carried out in a six-well dish using 106 cells and 5 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA/well. 30 min prior to transfection, control or TPA-treated cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 at multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell, followed by liposome-mediated transfection, as described previously (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar). 100 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA per a total of 107 exponentially growing K562 cells resuspended in 0.8 ml of RPMI 1640 without serum were used for each electroporation pool, using an electric pulse of 240 V, 1500 microfarads (Easy Ject+ electroporator, Equibio). Immediately following the electric pulse, the cells were transferred to RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 15% fetal calf serum. 24 h after electroporation the cells were diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 105 living cells (as determined by using trypan blue for counting) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, with or without 5 nM TPA (Sigma), for 48 h. The TPA-treated and control transfected cells were harvested simultaneously for CAT and luciferase assays, as well as for RNA analysis. For the enzymatic activity assays, the cell pellet was lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles in 0.1 M Tris, pH = 8.0. CAT activity in the cells lysates was determined by a phase extraction assay, which quantified butyrylated 3H-labeled chloramphenicol products by liquid scintillation counting, followed by xylene extraction (pCAT reporter gene system, Promega). LUC activity in the cell lysate was determined using TD-20e-Luminometer (Turner) following 15-s incubation of 1-5 μg of the protein extract with 470 μM luciferin (Sigma) and 270 μM coenzyme A (Sigma) in 20 mM K-Hepes, pH = 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgAc, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 530 μM ATP. Total protein concentration in each sample was determined by the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 cells using Tri Reagent procedure (Tri Reagent®, MRC, Inc.), which is based on the phenol and guanidine thiocyanate in a monophase solution. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from 150 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Dynatech, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis according to standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using 32P-labeled cDNA probes specific for the CAT, PDGF2/c-sis, LUC, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes. To quantify the RNA, the intensities of specific bands were determined using the phosphorimager (Fujix Bas 100, Fuji). The leader of PDGF2/c-sis mRNA is highly complex and imposes a major difficulty to linear ribosomal scanning. However, as demonstrated previously, megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells alleviates its translational inhibitory effect (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar). We therefore wished to examine whether PDGF2/c-sis mRNA leader harbors a weak IRES element which is activated upon differentiation. Since internal translation activity is known to be dependent on trans-acting factors (reviewed in Refs. 7Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N.Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000Google Scholar and 18Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar), the performance of IRES elements is assumed to be affected by the cellular availability of such factors. Hence, the first objective was to determine whether the cellular environment created by the TPA-induced differentiation is more supportive for internal translation. Internal ribosomal entry is traditionally demonstrated using bi-cistronic expression plasmids. In these plasmids, the second cistron is not translated unless it is located immediately downstream to an active IRES which is downstream to the stop codon of the first cistron. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase (LUC) reporter genes were used as the first or second cistrons, respectively, under control of the T7 promoter. The well characterized IRES elements of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or hepatitis A virus (HAV) were inserted between the two cistrons, downstream to the CAT translational stop codon, to create plasmids pT7CEL or pT7CHL, respectively. In addition, the 5′-UTR of PDGF2/c-sis was inserted between the two cistrons to create pT7CPL. Plasmid pT7CL, in which LUC is located immediately downstream to the stop codon of CAT (Fig. 1A), served as the control plasmid. The hybrid T7/vaccinia expression system was employed to express bi-cistronic mRNA from T7 promoter in the cytoplasm of control or TPA-treated K562 cells. Control or TPA-treated K562 cells were infected with vTF7-3, a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the T7 RNA polymerase in the cytoplasm, and transfected with one of the above bi-cistronic plasmids. 24 h after the infection-transfection experiment, CAT and LUC enzymatic activities were measured. Fig. 1B illustrates the LUC/CAT ratio obtained in the differentiated cells relative to the control cells for each of the plasmids. As shown, the differentiation process generated a cellular milieu that facilitated the internal translation conferred by the viral IRES elements. The enhancement of EMCV IRES activity was about 3-fold whereas that of HAV was less prominent (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, differentiation-linked activation of the second cistron translation was also observed upon insertion of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR (Fig. 1B, pT7CPL). This phenomenon led us to speculate that the mRNA leader of PDGF2/c-sis might contain an IRES element that gains activity upon certain cellular changes. From studies on picornaviruses, IRES elements are known to have structural features that are important for their role as mediators of internal ribosomal entry (7Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N.Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000Google Scholar, 18Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). The RNA structural analysis of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR was performed by theoretical prediction of RNA folding and phylogenetic analysis. In the structural analysis, the thermodynamically favored helical stems folded in the 5′-UTR were predicted by EFOLD, a method that computes all possible alternative RNA structures based on the fluctuation of thermodynamic energy parameters within the range of experimental errors for these parameters (19Le S.-Y Chen J.-H. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2173-2178Google Scholar). These computed helical stems were evaluated by a statistical simulation SEGFOLD (20Le S.-Y Maizel Jr., J.V. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 138: 495-510Google Scholar, 21Le S.-Y Chen J.-H. Maizel Jr., J.V. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure and Methods: Human Genome Initiative and DNA Recombination. Vol. 1. Adenine Press, New York1990: 127-136Google Scholar) and verified by inspecting their conservation of complementarity and compensatory base changes among divergent PDGF sequences from human, cat, and mouse. Based on both the conserved and thermodynamic favored helical stems within these divergent 5′-UTR sequences, the possible RNA secondary structure was constructed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the predicted common RNA secondary structure is divided into six domains, A-F Domain B, composed of the sequence from 191-685, was predicted to be an extensive RNA secondary structure of sufficient stability to inhibit the ribosome scanning process. Distinct Y-type stem-loop structures were observed just upstream of the first, third and fourth AUG codons. These conserved Y-type structures, denoted B5, D, and F (Fig. 2A), have significance scores of −1.75, −1.87, and −2.57, respectively. Such significance scores suggest structural role for these regions (19Le S.-Y Chen J.-H. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2173-2178Google Scholar). Structure B5 (512–581) is just 1 nt upstream of the first AUG triplet. Structures D (784–860) is just 9 nt upstream of the third AUG triplet, and structure F (934–1005) is about 17 nt upstream of the fourth AUG triplet. Structures D and F are composed of GC-rich sequences (more than 84% GC). Polypyrimidine sequences rich in U residues, that have been found to be important for viral IRES activity (22Pilipenko E.V. Gmyl A.P. Maslova S.V. Svitkin Y.V. Sinyakov A.N. Agol V.I. Cell. 1992; 68: 119-131Google Scholar), are located in the Y-type structure B5 and in the stem-loop structure designated as B8 (Fig. 2B). Two pseudoknot structures, denoted by the letter K in Fig. 2, were predicted. One (K1) is formed by interaction between sequences in loop B5b of Y-type structure B5 with sequences in the loop of structure B7. The potential pseudoknot is present in the human, mouse, and cat structures, although the interacting sequences are not phylogenetically conserved. The second pseudoknot (K2) is formed by interaction of CCCG in the Y-type structure F loop (F1′, Fig. 2B), with CGGG just downstream of it. The evolutionary conservation of this interaction suggests that the structure has a functional relevance. A sequence complementary to the conserved 3′-end of 18 S rRNA was found at the 3′-end of the 5′-UTR, just upstream of the fourth AUG codon, from which the PDGF2/c-sis open reading frame begins. The region of complementarity was predicted to be single-stranded (G, Fig. 2, A and B). It is noteworthy that picornavirus IRES elements share a conserved complementary sequence to the 3′-end of human 18 S rRNA (23Le S.-Y Chen J.-H. Sonenberg N. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2445-2451Google Scholar, 24Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 271-275Google Scholar). All the above features are compatible with the notion that cis- elements within the 5′-UTR of PDGF2/c-sis confer internal translation initiation. A Y-type structure, followed by a pseudoknot interaction and a sequence complementary to 18 S rRNA, immediately upstream to the start codon of the internal translation, is a common structural feature observed in all IRES elements of picornaviruses, hepatitis C virus, and pestiviruses RNAs (23Le S.-Y Chen J.-H. Sonenberg N. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2445-2451Google Scholar, 24Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 271-275Google Scholar, 25Le S.-Y Siddiqui A. Maizel Jr., J.V. Virus Genes. 1996; 12: 135-147Google Scholar). All the Y-type structures predicted for human PDGF2/c-sis mRNA leader were found to be conserved in the feline and murine PDGF2 mRNA leaders. The evolutionary conservation of these distinct structures suggests a role in the IRES-dependent translation. The relevance of the results shown in Fig. 1B to a cellular setup in which transcription takes place in the nucleus was verified by determining the behavior of the bi-cistronic mRNA in the absence of vaccinia virus infection. To that end, another set of bi-cistronic plasmids was constructed employing the CMV promoter (Fig. 3A). In pCL plasmid, the LUC reporter gene was located immediately downstream to the translational stop codon of CAT, whereas in pCPL the entire PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR was located between the two cistrons. To determine the ability of specific structural motifs to mediate the TPA-linked IRES activity, two additional plasmids, pC(215–488)L and pC(475–870)L, were constructed according to the structural model of the 5′-UTR presented in Fig. 2A In these plasmids, the regions spanning nucleotides 215-488 or 475-870 of the 5′-UTR were located between the two cistrons, respectively. Each of these plasmids was introduced into K562 cells by electroporation, followed by incubation of the cells in medium with or without TPA for 48 h. Following TPA treatment, CAT and LUC enzymatic activities and mRNA levels were detected. The integrity of the bi-cistronic mRNA was verified by Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled cDNA probes specific for the CAT, LUC, or GAPDH genes. The endogenous GAPDH mRNA level served as internal control to monitor the plasmid-derived mRNA level present in each of the different samples. As observed in Fig. 3B, the expected 3.8-kb bi-cistronic mRNA was detected by both CAT and LUC probes. The anticipated reductions in the bi-cistronic mRNAs length were observed, as expected, from plasmids that contained the truncated 5′-UTR. An additional, unexpected, smaller mRNA picked up by the CAT probe probably reflects cross-hybridization with cellular mRNA, as seen previously by others (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar). However, the LUC probe picked exclusively the bi-cistronic mRNA, indicating its integrity. Longer exposure of the blot after its hybridization with 32P-labeled LUC cDNA clearly demonstrated the absence of smaller LUC mRNA molecules (Fig. 3B), implying that LUC protein synthesis results from translation of the second cistron. Unexpectedly, TPA treatment led to elevation in the steady-state level of all the CMV promoter-driven mRNAs. However, in view of the integrity of the bi-cistronic mRNA molecules, both CAT and LUC proteins are believed to be translated from an intact bi-cistronic mRNA. Thus, the LUC/CAT ratio deduced from LUC and CAT enzymatic activities in the different samples reflects the relative translation efficiencies of both cistrons, regardless of the absolute mRNA level in the samples. Fig. 3C shows the LUC/CAT ratio obtained in the differentiated cells relative to control cells for each of the plasmids. The pCL-derived LUC activity, which represents second cistron translation from an IRES-less mRNA, probably reflects some level of read-through, leaky scanning, re-initiation, or translation of undetectable degradation products of the bi-cistronic mRNA. However, such pCL-derived second cistron translation was hardly affected by TPA treatment (Fig. 3C, pCL). Insertion of region spanning nucleotides 215-488, which harbor structure B3 of the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2A) upstream of LUC, decreased LUC translation level about 2-fold compared with pCL (not shown), but did not change the relative LUC/CAT upon differentiation (Fig. 3C, pC(215–488)L). Insertion of the full-length (1022 nt) or a 395-nt segment spanning nucleotides 475-870, which harbor structures B4-D of the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2A), also decreased the second cistron translation by 5- or 2-fold, respectively, compared with pCL (not shown). However, these two segments were able to confer differentiation-linked LUC translation enhancement (Fig. 3C, pCPL and pC(475–870)L). In summary, the LUC/CAT ratio was not affected by the TPA treatment unless the full-length or a specific region of the 5′-UTR was inserted between the cistrons. These specific segments conferred about 2-fold enhancement in translation efficiency of the second cistron over the first cistron due to the TPA treatment. These observations suggest the presence of a differentiation-linked internal ribosomal binding site within the 5′-UTR of PDGF2/c-sis To verify the ability of the 5′-UTR to confer internal translation, we tested its ability to confer 5′-end-independent translation to the second cistron. For that purpose, a hairpin structure with stability of ΔG= −40 kcal mol−1 was inserted upstream of the first cistron of pCPL to create plasmid pHCPL (Fig. 3A). Both pCPL and pHCPL plasmids contain the entire PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR between the CAT and LUC cistrons. K562 cells were transfected with each of the plasmids, followed by 48-h incubation in control or TPA containing medium prior to detection of CAT and LUC enzymatic activities. The CAT or LUC expression levels obtained from the 5′ hairpin-containing plasmid pHCPL were compared with those from plasmid pCPL which lacks the 5′ hairpin. As shown in Fig. 4A, translation of the first cistron represented by CAT activity was inhibited about 10-fold, whereas the second cistron translation represented by LUC activity was inhibited only about 3-fold by the 5′ hairpin. The lower CAT and LUC levels obtained from pHCPL plasmid compared with pCPL might result in part from lower transfection efficiencies of pHCPL. However, variation in transfection efficiencies cannot account for the difference between the relative expression of the two reporter genes. The relative CAT expression was always 3-fold lower than the relative LUC expression (Fig. 4A). Thus, the 5′ hairpin inhibitory effect on the first cistron was 3-4-fold stronger than on the second cistron. This absolute dissimilarity of the 5′ hairpin effect on translation of the two cistrons points to the ability of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR to confer 5′-end-independent translation to the second cistron. As shown in Fig. 4A, PDGF2/c-sis conferred the 5′-end-independent translation in both the control (−TPA) as well as in the differentiated (+TPA) K562 cells. This observation indicates that the 5′-UTR harbors an IRES element that is active in both cellular conditions. However, the IRES potency varies with changes in the cellular milieu, as shown in Fig. 4B illustrating the LUC/CAT ratio in the differentiated cells relative to the control cells for each of the plasmids. The relative LUC/CAT ratio of the IRES-less plasmid was hardly changed by TPA treatment, while the effectiveness of the IRES was enhanced about 2-fold by the TPA treatment regardless of the 5′-end, as demonstrated for both pCPL and pHCPL. This experiment further signifies the differentiation-linked IRES activity of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR. Structural elements that determine the efficiency of translation initiation include the 5′-m7G cap structure, the context surrounding the initiator codon, 5′-UTR length, stability of secondary structures in the 5′UTR, and presence or absence of open reading frames upstream of the initiator codon (uORFs) (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). A hairpin structure with predicted stability of ΔG= −50 kcal mol−1 in the 5′-UTR was found to significantly inhibit protein synthesis (26Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Google Scholar). In addition, uORFs, which in some cases have a regulatory role (27Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar), were found to decrease the frequency of initiation of the major ORF. Thus, it is not surprising that the extraordinarily long PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR, which contains stable secondary structures and three uORFs acts as a strong translational inhibitor (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar, 5Rao C.D. Pech M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 284-292Google Scholar, 6Horvath P. Suganuma A. Inaba M. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K. Cell Growth & Diff. 1995; 6: 1103-1110Google Scholar, 28Ratner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4101-4115Google Scholar). Mutations of the uORFs did not relieve the inhibitory effect (5Rao C.D. Pech M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 284-292Google Scholar, 6Horvath P. Suganuma A. Inaba M. Pan Y.-B. Gupta K. Cell Growth & Diff. 1995; 6: 1103-1110Google Scholar, 28Ratner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4101-4115Google Scholar). This observation, together with the highly stable secondary structures (ΔG = −270 kcal mol−1) within the PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR, raised a question about the ability of ribosomes to linearly scan along this mRNA leader from its 5′-end according to the conventional scanning model (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, when the PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR was placed upstream of the second cistron in a bi-cistronic vector, it conferred a differentiation-linked enhancement of translation with preference for the second cistron (Figs. 3C and 4B). However, regardless of the cellular conditions, the 5′ hairpin inhibitory effect on the first cistron was 3-4-fold stronger than on the second cistron, indicating the inherent ability of PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR to confer internal translation to the second cistron even before differentiation (Fig. 4A). These observations indicate the presence of an IRES element within PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR which has low or high activity depending on the cellular milieu. As shown in Figs. 1B, 3C, and 4B, the PDGF2/c-sis IRES potency was enhanced about 2-fold by TPA treatment. These data do not match our previous experiments with monocistronic vectors showing 8-fold 5′-UTR-mediated translational enhancement upon TPA treatment (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar). We strongly believe that the stronger effect observed using monocistronic vectors reflects the behavior of the authentic PDGF2/c-sis mRNA. Sequences flanking the 5′-UTR in the bi-cistronic vector may dramatically affect its folding and consequently its IRES activity. This discrepancy is analogous to the discrepancies reported previously for other IRES elements studied in the context of mono- and bi-cistronic vectors (11Teerink H. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 403-408Google Scholar, 30Van der Velden A. Kaminski A. Jackson R. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1995; 214: 82-90Google Scholar, 31Witherell G.W. Schultz-Witherell C.S. Wimmer E. Virology. 1995; 214: 660-663Google Scholar). In addition, since luciferase protein is very unstable compared with CAT (32Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar), LUC activity reflects the level of newly synthesized LUC molecules, whereas CAT activity represents the total accumulated CAT enzyme. Thus, the relative LUC/CAT ratio, which in this study was used to measure IRES potency, can detect only the differentiation-linked enhancement phenomenon and not its actual intensity. The evolutionary conservation of the stable secondary structures predicted for the PDGF2/c-sis mRNA leader, and the conserved complementarity to 18 S rRNA immediately upstream of the major ORF (Fig. 2), strongly suggest a role in mediating internal translation. The D-IRES activity was conferred by the full-length (1022 nt) 5′-UTR or by a 395 nt segment spanning nucleotides 475-870 of the 5′-UTR. In contrast, the 273-nt segment spanning nucleotides 215-488 of the 5′-UTR did not confer D-IRES activity and thereby served as a negative control in our experiments (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this non-IRES segment, harboring structure B3 (Fig. 2A), is composed of highly stable stem-loop structures and is located upstream of the D-IRES-conferring segment. Hence, we suggest that the role of structure B3 is to inhibit PDGF2/c-sis mRNA translation in case it is present at the wrong tissue or time, by imposing a barrier to ribosomal scanning. As shown previously, the 5′-UTR-mediated translation inhibition is relieved during megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (4Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that translational inhibition relief is achieved by enhanced activity of an IRES element that resides downstream of structure B3, the scanning barrier. It can be argued that expression of the major ORF reflects translation of undetectable shorter transcripts that are transcribed from a cryptic promoter and therefore lack most of the inhibitory 5′-UTR. Our data rule out this possibility for PDGF2/c-sis, since we used both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression systems. The cytoplasmic system employed the bacteriophage T7 promoter in the cytoplasm of vaccinia virus-infected cells, in which the host protein synthesis is shut off by the virus. The fact that the D-IRES phenomenon was observed in that cytoplasmic expression system (Fig. 1B) proves that a cryptic promoter activity within the PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR is not responsible for the differentiation-linked enhanced expression effect. We cannot rule out possible translation of degradation products that contain only the second cistron, but such a phenomenon does not negate our interpretation, since the small amount of potential degradation products is probably similar in all the samples, including the control plasmid pCL (Fig. 3B). It has become clear that a given cell type can qualitatively and quantitatively affect the expression of the PDGF A and B chains at the levels of transcription, RNA processing, translation, and post-translation modifications (3Dirks R.H. Bloemers H.P.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 22: 1-24Google Scholar). The presence of an IRES element within PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR defines a functional role to the cumbersome mRNA leader and justifies its conserved unusual architecture. The evolutionary conservation of the secondary structures hints that the IRES activity is mediated by evolutionary conserved RNA-binding proteins. We speculate that the availability of such trans-acting factors differs in response to specific signals according to the cell's need. The differentiation-linked enhancement of PDGF2/c-sis IRES activity might involve post-translational modifications of existing proteins or synthesis of new proteins with RNA binding activity. Apparently, the profile of proteins that bind to PDGF2/c-sis 5′-UTR dramatically changes due to differentiation of K562 cells. 2O. Sella, J. Bernstein, and O. Elroy-Stein, manuscript in preparation. It has become evident that viral IRES elements require cellular trans-acting RNA binding proteins for their function (reviewed in 7Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N.Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000Google Scholar). Thus, some of the differentiation-induced trans-acting factors might also mediate the IRES activity of certain viruses. The enhanced IRES activity of EMCV in the TPA-treated K562 cells (Fig. 1) supports this notion and underscores the importance of cell type to virulence potential. In addition, the variable potency of different known IRES elements might result from variable binding affinities to common factors and/or different requirements for additional tissue-specific factors. In contrast to viral IRES elements, cellular IRES elements are expected to be much less potent. Indeed, we found that PDGF2/c-sis IRES is about 10-fold less active in TPA-treated K562 cells than EMCV IRES (not shown). PDGF belongs to a subclass of genes that encode for regulatory proteins with a major role in cell proliferation. Among these are several proto-oncogenes as well as growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and transcription factors (2Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar). A typical property of these genes is their tight expression regulation to guarantee correct protein level at the appropriate time and location. An associated feature is their complex architecture, that is, cis-regulatory elements that mediate expression level in response to signals. The stringent regulation is a result of various mechanisms that simultaneously control expression at multiple levels. One of the cis-elements shared by the above subclass of genes is their extraordinarily long, structured and AUG-burdened mRNA leader, which provides a built-in blockade against efficient ribosomal scanning. Although leaky scanning and reinitiation are the mechanisms responsible for some translation modulation phenomena (reviewed in 27Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar), a conditional internal ribosomal entry may also provide a widespread mechanism for translation regulation. First, it gives certain mRNA molecules cap-independent translation ability in response to viral infection or stress conditions, as was shown for immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) IRES (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) and recently proposed for eIF4G IRES (12Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). Second, it can enforce an alternative translational start site, resulting in translation of different proteins from the same mRNA molecule, as mediated by the IRES element of FGF2 (10Vagner S. Gensac M.-C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Google Scholar). Third, it may provide a developmentally regulated protein synthesis like that proposed for the homeotic gene Antennapedia of D. melanogaster and for human IFG-II leader 1 IRES elements (13Oh S.-K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Google Scholar, 11Teerink H. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 403-408Google Scholar). The present study provides evidence for a differentiation-linked IRES element residing within a cumbersome mRNA leader. In the absence of appropriate trans-acting factors, it may provide a double safety control mechanism, since it prevents efficient translation of the mRNA in cases of uncontrolled transcription. Upon differentiation, the IRES becomes more active, leading to efficient protein synthesis. The translational enhancement has an additive effect with other levels of control to achieve significant expression enhancement in the appropriate time window during differentiation. This mechanism, which provides an additional step to the fine tuning of PDGF2/c-sis gene expression, might be employed by numerous critical regulatory genes with unusual 5′-UTRs and might have widespread implications for cellular growth and development. After completion of the study, we have noticed that TPA from Calbiochem is more potent than that of Sigma with regards to the effects measured in this research. We thank P.

This model, which is consistent with the available data, suggests that there are two classes of IL-4 receptors but a single class of IL-13 receptors. In the case of IL-4, binding occurs initially to the IL-4Rα, and this complex then interacts with either IL-2Rγ or IL-13Rα to yield a high affinity receptor capable of signal transduction. Reciprocally, IL-13 is thought to first bind to the IL-13Rα and then to recruit IL-4Rα to form a functional receptor. IL-2Rγ does not appear to play a central role in IL-13 receptor function.In addition to cell surface IL-4Rα, many studies have described the presence of a secreted form of the IL-4Rα (5Mosley B.

Soluble forms of many members of the hemopoietin receptor family have been described (22Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Google Scholar). These include the IL-2 receptor α-chain, IL-6 receptor α-chain (IL-6Rα), IL-7 receptor α-chain, IL-9 receptor α-chain, GM-CSF receptor α-chain, and LIF receptor α-chain (LIFRα). Soluble receptors have been implicated in both enhancing and reducing the biological effect of their cognate cytokine. For example, the complex of IL-6Rα and IL-6 is capable of interacting with cell surface gp130 to trigger a variety of biological responses (23Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamata H. Natsuka S. Yasukawa K. Totsuka T. Yamasaki K. Hirano T. Kishomoto T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 713-722Google Scholar), the complex of IL-4Rα and IL-4 inhibits the biological response of IL-4 in some settings and augments the response in other situations (24Sato T.A. Widmer M.B. Finkelman F.D. Madani H. Jacobs C.A. Grabstein K.H. Maliszewski C.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2717-2723Google Scholar), while the LIFRα appears to act only as an inhibitor of LIF function (25Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8616-8620Google Scholar, 26Tomida M. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Hozumi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 193-197Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the presence of a high affinity binding protein for IL-13 in mouse serum and urine. This protein is shown to be functionally, structurally, and antigenically distinct from a recently cloned IL-13Rα and to act as a potent inhibitor of IL-13 binding to its cell surface receptor.RESULTSGiven the expression of transmembrane and secreted forms of many members of the hemopoietin receptor family from alternatively spliced transcripts or via proteolysis (22Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Google Scholar), we sought evidence for the existence of a soluble form of the IL-13Rα. Using a gel filtration-based assay, mouse serum and urine were examined for the presence of an IL-13BP. Gel filtration chromatography of 125I-IL-13 alone resulted in elution of radioactivity in fractions 35-39 (Fig. 1,A and B). Prior addition of mouse serum or urine to the 125I-IL-13 resulted in the presence of an additional peak of 125I-IL-13 eluting earlier in fractions 27-30 (Fig. 1, C and D). The formation of this higher molecular weight peak was competed for by the addition of an excess of unlabeled IL-13 but not by unlabeled IL-4, demonstrating that the interaction with the binding protein was specific (Fig. 1, E and F).In contrast to crude mouse urine, purified soluble IL-13Rα appeared unable to bind IL-13 as assessed by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Given the very low affinity of IL-13 for the IL-13Rα and the fast kinetic dissociation rate (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), this result was not surprising but did suggest that the serum and urine binding proteins were either distinct from the IL-13Rα or contained other components in addition to IL-13Rα. An obvious candidate for a protein capable of interaction with IL-13Rα to generate a high affinity IL-13 receptor was the IL-4Rα. The presence of soluble IL-4Rα in urine and serum has been described in a number of previous studies (17Fanslow W.C. Clifford K. Vanden Bos T. Teel A. Armitage R.J. Beckmann M.P. Cytokine. 1990; 2: 398-401Google Scholar, 18Fernandez-Botran R. Viteffa E.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 673-681Google Scholar, 20Christie G. Dacey I. Weston B.J. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 305-310Google Scholar), and this result was confirmed by the cross-linking experiments described below. Despite the presence of an IL-4 binding protein (IL-4BP) in urine and serum, addition of purified IL-4Rα to purified IL-13Rα did not recapitulate the properties of the IL-13BP found in serum and urine as assessed by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Moreover, the apparent molecular weight of the IL-13/IL-13BP complex from serum and urine (60,000-65,000) was not consistent with a complex of IL-13 with IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα (predicted molecular weight of ≈100,000).To assess the size of the IL-13BP and its relationship to the IL-4BP, mouse urine was fractionated on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2A). Aliquots from each fraction were then mixed with 125I-IL-13 or 125I-IL-4 in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled IL-4 or IL-13 and subjected to cross-linking using the bifunctional reagent BS3. The products of the cross-linking reaction were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cross-linking of 125I-IL-13 to unfractionated mouse urine revealed the presence of a major band that migrated with a Mr of approximately 60,000-65,000 (Fig. 2B). Given that 125I-IL-13 migrates with a Mr of ≈15,000, this would suggest that the IL-13BP has a Mr of 45,000-50,000. Cross-linking to the IL-13BP was specific, since it was abolished by competition with unlabeled IL-13 (Fig. 3B) but not IL-4 (Fig. 4). The 45,000-50,000 Mr IL-13BP eluted from the gel filtration column in fractions 27 to 29, consistent with its molecular weight estimated from the cross-linking experiment. Additional apparently nonspecific lower molecular weight radioactive products were also observed in the cross-linking studies with 125I-IL-13. One of these eluted from the gel filtration column in fractions 29 and 30, after the 45,000-50,000 Mr IL-13BP, but in a similar position to an IL-4BP (Fig. 2C). The complexities of this interaction will be discussed in more detail below. Cross-linking of 125I-IL-4 to the IL-4BP resulted in a species migrating with a Mr of approximately 50,000 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the binding protein itself had a Mr of ≈35,000.Fig. 2Fractionation of crude mouse urine by gel filtration chromatography.

Although binding of 125I-IL-13 to purified IL-13Rα was not detected by gel filtration chromatography, an interaction was observed using cross-linking (Fig. 3, lane 1). Consistent with previous studies (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), this interaction was competed for by unlabeled IL-13 but not unlabeled IL-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). When cross-linking studies were performed using 125I-IL-13 and purified IL-4Rα, a product with a Mr of ≈50,000 was observed (Fig. 3, lane 4). Surprisingly, cross-linking of 125I-IL-13 to IL-4Rα was in competition with unlabeled IL-4 (Fig. 4, lane 5) but not unlabeled IL-13 (Fig. 3, lane 6). Combining purified IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα with 125I-IL-13 resulted in the generation of species similar in molecular weight and specificity to reactions containing each receptor alone (Fig. 3, lanes 7-9). No higher molecular weight complexes were observed, suggesting that formation of ternary IL-13/IL-13Rα/IL-4Rα complexes or their capture with the cross-linker occurred inefficiently in solution, even at high concentrations of each component. Consistent with our initial experiments (Fig. 2B), crude mouse urine contained a major 45,000-50,000 Mr IL-13BP (Fig. 3, lane 10). Cross-linking of 125I-IL-13 to this species was in competition with unlabeled IL-13 (Fig. 3, lane 11) but not unlabeled IL-4 (Fig. 3, lane 12). The lower molecular weight species observed in our initial experiments (Fig. 2B, fractions 29 and 30), was again observed. As before, cross-linking of 125I-IL-13 to this protein was not in competition with unlabeled IL-13 (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11); however, like cross-linking of 125I-IL-13 to purified IL-4Rα, cross-linking to this protein was competed for by unlabeled IL-4 (Fig. 3, lane 12). Although the addition of purified IL-4Rα to purified IL-13Rα did not alter the pattern of cross-linking observed to either component alone, we sought to determine whether purified IL-4Rα could interact with partially purified 45,000-50,000 Mr IL-13BP from mouse urine (Fig. 2A, fraction 27). As with the purified receptor components, no additional effect of adding IL-4Rα was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 13-15).While interaction between IL-13 and both purified soluble IL-13Rα and the 45,000-50,000 Mr binding protein was demonstrable by cross-linking, only the interaction with the binding protein was detectable using gel filtration chromatography. These results suggested that the affinity of IL-13 for the binding protein was higher than for soluble IL-13Rα. To test this formally, saturation binding experiments were performed. Scatchard transformations revealed that, consistent with previous studies (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of IL-13 for the IL-13Rα expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells was approximately 10 nM (data not shown). However, the affinity of IL-13 for the serum and urinary binding protein was 100-300-fold higher, with KD values ranging from 20 to 90 pM (data not shown). The difference in affinity was confirmed in cross-linking experiments in which 125I-IL-13 was mixed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled IL-13 prior to cross-linking to soluble IL-13Rα (Fig. 4A) or urinary binding protein (Fig. 4B). Densitometric analysis of these data demonstrated that half-maximal inhibition of binding to soluble IL-13Rα occurred with approximately 100 ng/ml IL-13, a 40-fold higher concentration than required to inhibit 50% of the cross-linking to the 45,000-50,000 Mr urinary binding protein.The structural relationship between soluble IL-13Rα and the 45,000-50,000 Mr urinary IL-13BP was examined by cross-linking 125I-IL-13 to both proteins and isolating the resultant complexes from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Each complex was then subjected to exhaustive deglycosylation using N-glycanase F and digestion with various concentrations of Staphylococcus V8 protease. The products of these treatments were then resolved by further SDS-PAGE. The untreated and deglycosylated complexes of IL-13 and the soluble IL-13Rα appeared slightly larger than the corresponding complexes with the urinary binding protein (compare Fig. 5, lane 1 with lane 10 and lane 2 with lane 9). In addition, the products of V8 proteolysis of the two complexes were clearly different, emphasizing the structural difference between the IL-13Rα and the 45,000-50,000 Mr urinary IL-13BP (compare Fig. 5, lanes 3-5 with lanes 6-8).Fig. 5Deglycosylation and V8 digestion of 125I-IL-13 cross-linked to IL-13BP or soluble IL-13Rα.

This antiserum was capable of immunoprecipitating the cross-linked product of 125I-IL-13 with IL-13Rα (Fig. 6, lane 10), while no immunoprecipitation was observed with a preimmune rabbit serum (Fig. 6, lane 12). Immunoprecipitation of the radioactive complex was not inhibited by the FLAG peptide which is present in our soluble recombinant IL-13Rα (Fig. 6, lane 11) but was inhibited by an excess of IL-13 (Fig. 6, lanes 13 and 14). In contrast to the IL-13Rα complex, the complex between the 45,000-50,000 Mr urinary IL-13BP and 125I-IL-13 was not recognized by the rabbit antiserum to IL-13Rα (Fig. 6, lanes 3-9), suggesting that these proteins are antigenically as well as structurally and functionally distinct.Fig. 6Immunoprecipitation by anti-IL-13Rα antiserum of 125I-IL-13 cross-linked to soluble IL-13Rα but not of 125I-IL-13 cross-linked to IL-13BP.

To gain information on whether the purified soluble IL-13Rα or the urinary binding protein could influence IL-13 action we examined their effects on binding of 125I-IL-13 to peritoneal macrophages. Fig. 7 demonstrates that even though both the urinary IL-13BP and the soluble IL-13Rα could inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-13 to cell surface receptors expressed by macrophages the latter was far less efficient, raising the possibility that the soluble IL-13BP may be used to modulate the effects of IL-13 in vivoFig. 7Comparison of the ability of IL-13BP and soluble IL-13Rα to inhibit the binding of IL-13 to its cell surface receptor. 105 cpm of 125I-IL-13 or 125I-GM-CSF were incubated for 40 min at 4°C with the indicated dilution of partially purified urinary IL-13BP (A) or with the indicated concentration of soluble IL-13Rα (B). The labeled ligands and the soluble IL-13Rα or IL-13BP were then added to 50 μl of medium containing 1.5 × 106 peritoneal cells from a GM-CSF transgenic mouse. Incubation was continued for a further 2 h at 4°C before cell-associated and free 125I-IL-13 or 125I-GM-CSF were separated by centrifugation of cells through 200 μl of fetal calf serum. The resulting cell pellets and supernatants were then counted in a γ-counter, and specific binding was calculated as the difference between the 125I-ligand bound in the absence and presence of the unlabeled competitors. In turn this was expressed as a percentage of that observed in the absence of either soluble IL-13Rα or IL-13BP (•). As a control, both soluble IL-13Rα and IL-13BP showed no inhibition of 125I-GM-CSF binding (○) to peritoneal cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The soluble IL-13BP was purified from 2.2 liters of mouse urine by affinity chromatography on immobilized IL-13 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 2-4 μg of the purified protein was obtained and electrophoresed as a single silver staining protein of Mr 45,000-50,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 8A). Chemical cross-linking of this protein incubated with 125I-IL-13 revealed a complex of Mr 60,000-65,000 (Fig. 8B) similar to that seen with crude urine preparations (Fig. 2). Moreover, chemical cross-linking of this purified preparation incubated with unlabeled IL-13 and visualization of the products by silver staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed that a significant proportion of the major protein band of Mr 45,000-50,000 could interact with IL-13 and shift to a band of Mr 60,000-65,000 (Fig. 8C, lanes 3 and 4).Fig. 8Properties of purified IL-13BP.

This sequence is clearly different from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the cloned mouse IL-13Rα (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar). An initial search of the GenBank™ data base identified a human expressed sequence tag (accession number R52795/clone 41648) derived from an infant brain cDNA library with an identical sequence stretch except for conservative amino acid changes at positions 13 (L→V), 17 (L→Y), and 26 (K→Q). Moreover, this sequence was preceded by a typical leader sequence of 27 amino acids and signal sequence cleavage site in the expressed sequence tag suggesting that its predicted mature amino acid sequence would start at the same position as that identified for the IL-13BP. The 3′ end of clone 41648 (the sequence of which is represented by expressed sequence tag R52796) was also deposited in the GenBank™ data base and revealed sequences suggesting that this protein was a member of the type I cytokine receptor family including the diagnostic sequence WSEWS.DISCUSSIONAt least one form of the cell surface receptor complex for IL-13 is composed of the IL-4Rα (5Mosley B.

A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar). Despite its low affinity, the specificity of the interaction between IL-13 and the soluble IL-13Rα was demonstrable by cross-linking, since IL-13 but not IL-4 was capable of competing for binding. In the course of the cross-linking studies, an unexpected, puzzling, and to date unexplained observation was made. 125I-IL-13 was found to cross-link to purified recombinant IL-4Rα. This interaction was capable of being competed for by IL-4 but not by unlabeled IL-13. The possibility that iodination of IL-13 on tyrosine residues using the iodine monochloride technique altered its receptor specificity was thought to be unlikely, since a similar result was observed with IL-13 labeled on lysine residues using the Bolton-Hunter reagent.Murine serum and urine were found to contain a protein capable of binding IL-13. However, such a protein was not detected in human plasma and urine (data not shown). The mouse urinary IL-13BP was characterized in detail and shown to be structurally, antigenically, and functionally distinct from the cloned mouse IL-13Rα (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar). These differences could not be explained in terms of an association of the IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα in these biological fluids but rather suggested the existence of an independent protein capable of binding IL-13. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the mouse urinary IL-13BP was different from the cloned mouse IL-13Rα (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar): (a) the size of the binding protein was smaller than the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-13Rα, and the pattern of V8 protease digestion of the two molecules was clearly different; (b) an antiserum raised against the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-13Rα failed to recognize the binding protein found in urine; (c) most dramatically, the binding protein interacted with IL-13 with a 100-300-fold higher affinity than the soluble IL-13Rα (KD = 20-90 pM versus 3-10 nM) (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar); and (d) N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two proteins were different. Moreover, unlike the soluble IL-13Rα, the urinary binding protein was an efficient inhibitor of IL-13 binding to its cell surface receptor.These characteristics suggest that the soluble IL-13BP should be an effective inhibitor of IL-13 biological activities and it may serve to dampen the proinflammatory activities of IL-13 such as macrophage and eosinophil activation and, in humans, IgE production by B-lymphocytes (2McKenzie A.N.J. Zurawski G. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. 1994: 92-95Google Scholar, 3Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Google Scholar, 34Luttmann W. Knoechel B. Foerster Matthys H. Virchow Jr., J.C. Kroegel C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1678-1683Google Scholar).The recent cloning of an alternate IL-13 cell surface receptor from human renal carcinoma cells by Caput et al (35Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar) has indicated that the IL-13BP is almost certainly a murine soluble analogue of this human receptor chain. This conclusion is based on the near identity of the first 27 amino acids of the predicted mature form of the human receptor with that of the soluble IL-13BP, the high affinity with which it binds IL-13 (KD = 250 pM), and its absolute specificity for binding IL-13 but not IL-4.Caput et al (35Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar) presented evidence that their IL-13 receptor shows little alteration of binding affinity or specificity when it is co-expressed with IL-4Rα and, surprisingly, a diminution of IL-13-binding when it is co-expressed with γc. This contrasts with our data with IL-13Rα (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), where higher affinity IL-13/IL-4-cross-reactive receptors were generated by co-expression with IL-4 receptor.The evidence of two alternative IL-13-binding receptor chains and the possible involvement of IL-4Rα and γc in forming IL-13 receptor complexes points to a very complex pattern of IL-13 and IL-4 recognition and signal transduction at different cell surfaces. The existence of a soluble IL-13 receptor adds a further layer of complexity in the control of IL-13 responses. Issues yet to be addressed include whether the IL-13 receptor described by Caput et al (35Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar) is capable of functional signaling and how the soluble form of this receptor is generated and controlled (e.g. by alternative splicing or proteolytic release from the cell surface). Clearly, very careful reconstitution experiments with all of the receptor components described above will be required to begin to understand this complex regulatory system.

Harada N. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, 1994: 44-46Google Scholar, 2McKenzie A.N.J. Zurawski G. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. 1994: 92-95Google Scholar, 3Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-13 exhibit approximately 30% amino acid sequence similarity and are encoded by genes with a similar intron/exon structure that are closely linked on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 11. Both cytokines are produced by activated T-cells and act to regulate the immune response by, for example, inducing immunoglobulin class switching in B-lymphocytes to IgG1 and IgE isotypes and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators by macrophages (2McKenzie A.N.J. Zurawski G. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. 1994: 92-95Google Scholar). IL-4 but not IL-13 also regulates a variety of aspects of T-cell differentiation and function (4de Vries J.E. Zurawski G. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1995; 106: 175-179Google Scholar).Three components of functional IL-4 and IL-13 receptors have been cloned. These are the IL-4 receptor α-chain (IL-4Rα) (5Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D. VandenBos T. Friend D. Alpert A. Anderson D. Jackson J. Wignall J.M. Smith C. Gallis B. Sims J.E. Urdal D. Cosman D. Park L.S. Cell. 1989; 89: 335-348Google Scholar), IL-13 receptor α-chain (IL-13Rα) (6Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), and the IL-2 receptor γ-chain (IL-2Rγ) (7Takeita T. Asano H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Google Scholar). The relationships between the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors have been gleaned from many studies (5Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D.

Yamaauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Google Scholar). This model, which is consistent with the available data, suggests that there are two classes of IL-4 receptors but a single class of IL-13 receptors. In the case of IL-4, binding occurs initially to the IL-4Rα, and this complex then interacts with either IL-2Rγ or IL-13Rα to yield a high affinity receptor capable of signal transduction. Reciprocally, IL-13 is thought to first bind to the IL-13Rα and then to recruit IL-4Rα to form a functional receptor. IL-2Rγ does not appear to play a central role in IL-13 receptor function.In addition to cell surface IL-4Rα, many studies have described the presence of a secreted form of the IL-4Rα (5Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D. VandenBos T. Friend D. Alpert A. Anderson D. Jackson J. Wignall J.M. Smith C. Gallis B. Sims J.E. Urdal D. Cosman D. Park L.S.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3606-3614Google Scholar). mRNA for the cell surface and secreted forms of the IL-4Rα are transcribed from a single gene and arise by alternative splicing (5Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D. VandenBos T. Friend D. Alpert A. Anderson D. Jackson J. Wignall J.M. Smith C. Gallis B. Sims J.E. Urdal D. Cosman D. Park L.S.

Soluble forms of many members of the hemopoietin receptor family have been described (22Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Google Scholar). These include the IL-2 receptor α-chain, IL-6 receptor α-chain (IL-6Rα), IL-7 receptor α-chain, IL-9 receptor α-chain, GM-CSF receptor α-chain, and LIF receptor α-chain (LIFRα). Soluble receptors have been implicated in both enhancing and reducing the biological effect of their cognate cytokine. For example, the complex of IL-6Rα and IL-6 is capable of interacting with cell surface gp130 to trigger a variety of biological responses (23Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamata H. Natsuka S. Yasukawa K. Totsuka T. Yamasaki K. Hirano T. Kishomoto T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 713-722Google Scholar), the complex of IL-4Rα and IL-4 inhibits the biological response of IL-4 in some settings and augments the response in other situations (24Sato T.A. Widmer M.B. Finkelman F.D. Madani H. Jacobs C.A. Grabstein K.H. Maliszewski C.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2717-2723Google Scholar), while the LIFRα appears to act only as an inhibitor of LIF function (25Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl.

In this study, we describe the presence of a high affinity binding protein for IL-13 in mouse serum and urine. This protein is shown to be functionally, structurally, and antigenically distinct from a recently cloned IL-13Rα and to act as a potent inhibitor of IL-13 binding to its cell surface receptor."

Previous studies attributed collagen IV and high affinity calcium binding of BM-40 to its EC module, which was shown by x-ray crystallography to consist of an EF-hand pair surrounded by several α-helical and loop segments. This module was now shown by surface plasmon resonance assay to bind with similar affinities to collagens I, III, and V. Cleavage of recombinant BM-40 and its EC module by collagenase-3, gelatinases A and B, matrilysin, and stromelysin-1 showed similar fragment patterns, whereas collagenase-1 was inactive. Some differences were, however, observed in cleavage rates and the preference of certain cleavage sites. Edman degradation of fragments demonstrated only three to four major cleavage sites in the central region of domain I and a single uniform cleavage in helix C of the EC module. Cleavage is accompanied by a 7-20-fold increase in binding activity for collagens I, IV, and V but revealed only small effects on calcium-dependent α-helical changes in the EC module. The data were interpreted to indicate that helix C cleavage is mainly responsible for enhancing collagen affinity by exposing the underlying helix A of the EC module.

https://openalex.org/W1975702359,"The molecular mechanisms underlying protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme-mediated control of cell growth and cell cycle progression are poorly understood. Our previous analysis of PKC isozyme regulation in the intestinal epithelium in situ revealed that multiple members of the PKC family undergo changes in expression and subcellular distribution precisely as the cells cease proliferating in the mid-crypt region, suggesting that activation of one or more of these molecules is involved in negative regulation of cell growth in this system (Saxon, M. L., Zhao, X., and Black, J. D. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 126, 747-763). In the present study, the role of PKC isozyme(s) in control of intestinal epithelial cell growth and cell cycle progression was examined directly using the IEC-18 immature crypt cell line as a model system. Treatment of IEC-18 cells with PKC agonists resulted in translocation of PKC α, δ, and ϵ from the soluble to the particulate subcellular fraction, cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and delayed transit through S and/or G2/M phases. PKC-mediated cell cycle arrest in G1 was accompanied by accumulation of the hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive form of the retinoblastoma protein and induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. Reversal of these cell cycle regulatory effects was coincident with activator-induced down-regulation of PKC α, δ, and ϵ. Differential down-regulation of individual PKC isozymes revealed that PKC α in particular is sufficient to mediate cell cycle arrest by PKC agonists in this system. Taken together, the data implicate PKC α in negative regulation of intestinal epithelial cell growth both in vitro and in situ via pathways which involve modulation of Cip/Kip family cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and the retinoblastoma growth suppressor protein.

However, understanding of the biological functions of individual isozymes and of the molecular regulatory pathways in which they participate remains limited. protein kinase C diacylglycerol retinoblastoma protein cyclin-dependent kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phorbol 12 13-dibutyrate 12-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline The growth-regulatory consequences of PKC activation suggest a link between PKC signaling and control of the cell cycle machinery. Activation of PKC has been shown to result in alterations in cell cycle progression in either stimulatory or inhibitory directions in several systems (14Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23041-23048Google Scholar, 19Gruber J.R. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Google Scholar, 20Coppock D.L. Tansey J.B. Nathanson L.

Moreover, limited evidence supports a role for individual isozymes in modulation of major cell cycle transitions. For example, PKC α/ϵ (29Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Hirata M. Masuda J. Shimokado K. Fujishima M. Ogata J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 311-320Google Scholar) and η (31Livneh E. Shimon T. Bechor E. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1545-1555Google Scholar) have been implicated in control of the G1→ S transition in vascular smooth muscle cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, respectively, while PKC βII has been shown to play a requisite role in progression from G2 into M phase in HL-60 cells (30Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Google Scholar), and PKC δ has been associated with control of M phase in Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Google Scholar). Orderly progression through the cell cycle is now known to be dependent on the coordinated interaction between key cell cycle regulatory molecules including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), and cdk inhibitory proteins such as p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1 (33Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar, 34Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Google Scholar, 35Hirama T. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1995; 86: 841-854Google Scholar). Together, these molecules control the activity of a number of important substrates including the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), a critical regulator of the G1→ S transition (36Sherr C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 15-18Google Scholar, 37Ewen M.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 45-66Google Scholar). The interplay between specific PKC isozyme signaling and control of the cell cycle machinery is an important question that remains to be addressed at the molecular level. Previous studies in this laboratory have identified the mammalian intestinal epithelium as a useful model system in which to define the physiological role(s) of individual PKC isozyme(s) in control of cell growth and cell cycle progression (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). This dynamic and complex tissue system undergoes continuous and rapid renewal (38Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Google Scholar); its polarized architecture, with well-defined regions of cell proliferation, growth arrest, and differentiation, allows correlation of the expression and activation of PKC isozymes with specific stages of cell development (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). Using a combined biochemical and morphological approach to detect changes in PKC isozyme expression and activation status at the individual cell level, our previous studies revealed that multiple PKC isozymes are expressed in the intestinal epithelium and that they are differentially regulated with respect to cell growth and differentiation (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). Of particular note was the finding that four members of the PKC family, PKC α, βII, δ, and ζ, undergo marked changes in expression and subcellular distribution indicative of activation precisely at the point in the mid-crypt at which cells cease dividing, suggesting that one or more of these molecules are involved in negative growth-regulatory signaling pathways in this tissue. In the present study, we have extended the characterization of PKC isozyme expression and activation in the rat intestinal epithelium in situ and, based on this analysis, have explored the role of PKC isozyme(s) in control of cell growth and cell cycle progression using the non-transformed IEC-18 immature crypt cell line as a complementary in vitro model system. In keeping with the finding that activation of specific isozymes coincides with cell growth arrest in the intestinal crypt, PKC agonists were found to block IEC-18 cell cycle progression in G1 and delay transit through S and/or G2/M phases. Analysis of the mechanism(s) underlying PKC-mediated regulation of the G1→ S transition revealed that PKC agonist-induced G1 arrest is accompanied by Rb hypophosphorylation and rapid induction of the Cip/Kip family cdk inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. Taking advantage of differential down-modulation of individual PKC isozymes under different PKC agonist treatment conditions, PKC α was identified as sufficient to mediate these negative growth-regulatory effects. Taken together, the data presented provide evidence for control of the cell cycle machinery in the intestinal epithelium by PKC-mediated pathways and demonstrate a mechanism for the integration of environmental anti-mitogenic stimuli with regulation of cell division in this tissue. Furthermore, they indicate that PKC α, in particular, is linked to a pathway which negatively modulates cell growth and cell cycle progression in intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in situ Monoclonal antibody specific for the catalytic domain of PKC α was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal rabbit anti-PKC α, βII, δ, ϵ, and ζ were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for PKC θ, ι, λ, and η were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies used in this study have been extensively characterized for the absence of cross-reactivity with other PKC isozymes (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). To ensure reliability of the data obtained, at least two antibodies were used for each isozyme studied. Polyclonal antibody specificity was confirmed by competition assays with the appropriate antigenic peptide as described previously (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Rb and anti-p21waf1/cip1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody specific for p27kip1 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Immunofluorescence analysis of PKC isozyme expression and subcellular distribution in rat intestinal epithelial tissue was performed on 4-6-μm cryosections as described previously (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). Sequential release of epithelial cell populations from rat small intestine was performed as described previously (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar, 39Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Google Scholar). Briefly, populations of cells at different developmental stages were isolated using timed incubations in a calcium-chelating buffer. Cells were washed in PBS, and fractions were pooled into crypt (proliferating), lower villus (differentiating), and upper villus (functional) populations. Membranes were prepared from isolated crypt or villus cells as described previously (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). The IEC-18 cell line (ATCC CRL-1589) is an immature, non-transformed cell line derived from rat ileal epithelium which maintains many characteristics of proliferating crypt cells (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar, 40Quaroni A. May R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21B: 403-427Google Scholar, 41Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 1353-1362Google Scholar). IEC-18 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 4 mM glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). PKC isozymes were activated in IEC-18 cells by treatment with either 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma), 100 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; Sigma), or 20 μg/ml 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8; Sigma) for various times. PMA and PDBu were dissolved in ethanol, with a final vehicle concentration in the medium of <0.1%; DiC8 was dissolved in acetone, with a final vehicle concentration of <0.2%. Control cells were treated with the appropriate vehicle alone. PMA was administered either as a 15-min pulse, followed by two washes in PBS and a return to fresh medium for various times, or in continuous exposure. DiC8 treatments required addition of fresh drug every 6 h, as DiC8 is rapidly metabolized by the cell (42Severson D.L. Hee-Cheong M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C11-C17Google Scholar, 43Aihara H. Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11062-11066Google Scholar). Depletion of PKC α, δ, and ϵ from IEC-18 cells was accomplished by treatment with 1 μM PDBu for 24 h. IEC-18 cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum deprivation. Briefly, subconfluent cells growing in complete medium were washed twice in DMEM with no FCS and incubated with DMEM containing 0.5% FCS and 4 mM glutamine (no insulin) for 72 h. More than 90% of cells were arrested in G0/G1 by this method, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were released from G0/G1 arrest by addition of complete growth medium containing 5% FCS and 10 μg/ml insulin. IEC-18 cells were synchronized in G1/S phase by incubation with 1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 24 h. Cells were released from G1/S arrest by removal of aphidicolin and incubation in complete growth medium. Subconfluent IEC-18 cells were briefly washed in PBS, harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol, and treated with 0.04 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.37% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Cellular DNA was stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in 0.05% sodium citrate and quantified by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Winlist and Modfit programs (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). IEC-18 cells were partitioned into soluble (cytosolic) and particulate fractions essentially as described previously (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and scraped in an extraction buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml digitonin, 10 mM NaF, 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (digitonin buffer). Digitonin-soluble (cytosolic) and -insoluble (particulate) fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4°C. The cytosolic protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice, pelleted, washed in acetone, solubilized in 100 mM NaOH, and neutralized by the addition of 100 mM HCl. The particulate pellet was incubated on ice for 30 min in digitonin buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (Triton buffer). The membrane sample was then cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g) for 30 min at 4°C. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Subconfluent IEC-18 cells were rapidly washed twice in PBS at 4°C and incubated for 5-15 min on ice in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 200 μM Na3V04, 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Cell extracts were cleared by a 30-min centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4°C and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Cell lysates (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), using 7.5% (Rb), 10% (PKC isozymes), or 15% (p21waf1/cip1, p27kip1) polyacrylamide gels. Protein was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 5% non-fat dried milk (TBS/milk) for 30 min at 37°C. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with primary antibody in TBS/milk with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBSt/milk; Sigma), followed by six 5-min washes in TBSt/milk. Blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in secondary HRP-conjugated antibody in TBSt/milk, followed by six 5-min washes in TBSt/milk and three 5-min washes in TBS. Bound horseradish peroxidase was then detected using the SuperSignal CL system (Pierce). Specificity of the antibodies was determined using the relevant antigenic peptide in competition experiments as recommended by the manufacturer. All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. IEC-18 cells are non-transformed, immature intestinal epithelial cells derived from rat ileum, which retain many phenotypic characteristics of proliferating intestinal crypt cells (40Quaroni A. May R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21B: 403-427Google Scholar, 41Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 1353-1362Google Scholar). To evaluate this cell line as an in vitro model system in which to examine directly the involvement of PKC isozymes in intestinal epithelial cell growth regulation, we compared PKC isozyme profiles in proliferating crypt cells in situ and cultured IEC-18 cells. Previous morphological and biochemical analysis of the expression and subcellular distribution of individual PKC isozymes in the rat intestinal epithelium revealed that PKC α, βII, δ, ϵ, and ζ, but not PKC γ or βI, are present in cells of the crypt-villus unit and are differentially regulated with respect to cell growth and differentiation (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar). In situ immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that marked changes in the expression and subcellular distribution of several PKC isozymes coincides precisely with cell growth arrest in the mid-crypt region. Representative data are shown for PKC α in Fig. 1A: proliferating lower crypt cells exhibit diffuse cytosolic immunostaining for this isozyme (arrowhead), presumably reflecting its presence in an inactive conformation. At cell position 14-18 from the crypt base (i.e. the mid-crypt), the region in which cells cease division and commit to differentiation (38Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Google Scholar), levels of PKC α expression markedly increase, and PKC α immunostaining becomes clearly detectable in the lateral membrane domains and in the developing brush-border microvilli. Similar changes, confirmed by biochemical analysis (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar), were observed for PKC βII, δ, and ζ (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more of these PKC isozymes play a role in signaling pathway(s) related to negative control of cell growth in the intestinal epithelium in situ Further analysis has revealed the presence of three additional isozymes, PKC η, θ, and ι, in this tissue (Fig. 1B). Based on the premise that association of PKC isozymes with the particulate fraction may be indicative of activation (6Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Google Scholar), the pattern of regulation of these PKC isozymes along the crypt-to-villus axis was examined by comparing the level of membrane-associated expression in isolated proliferating (crypt), differentiating (lower villus), and functional (upper villus) intestinal epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, crypt cell membranes express low levels of PKC ι, and only trace amounts of PKC η and θ. Since PKC η and θ were also essentially undetectable in whole cell extracts of intestinal crypt cells (data not shown), these isozymes appear to be absent from proliferating cells. Thus, taken together with our previous findings (27Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that in situ proliferating cells of the intestinal crypts express PKC α, βII, δ, ϵ, ζ, and ι. Interestingly, in contrast to cells of the proliferation zone, differentiating and functional cells of the villus express readily detectable levels of membrane-associated PKC η, θ, and ι (Fig. 1B), indicating that increased expression/activation of these isozymes is associated with post-mitotic events in intestinal epithelial cells in situ Immunofluorescence localization of PKC η revealed that this isozyme is expressed mainly in cells of the mid- to upper villus, in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown), suggesting a role in enterocyte mature function (45Osada S. Hashimoto Y. Nomura S. Kohno Y. Chida K. Tajima O. Kubo K. Akimoto K. Koizumi H. Kitamura Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. Kuroki T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 167-175Google Scholar). Due to a lack of suitable reagents, we were unable to perform morphological analysis of the distribution of PKC θ and ι in tissue enterocytes. As shown in Fig. 1C, Western blot analysis revealed that IEC-18 cells express the same panel of PKC isozymes as tissue crypt cells. While PKC α, βII, δ, ϵ, ζ, and ι were readily detectable in IEC-18 whole cell extracts, PKC η and θ, which are expressed only in villus cell populations in situ, were found to be absent from these cells. In the present study, the IEC-18 cell line was used as an in vitro model system in which to address the hypothesis that one or more PKC isozymes play a role in negative regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression in the intestinal epithelium in situ To determine the effects of PKC activation on IEC-18 cell cycle progression, asynchronously growing IEC-18 cell populations were treated with a panel of PKC agonists to activate PKC isozyme(s) directly, and perturbations in cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometric analysis after various times over a 24-h period. Three PKC agonists were used for this analysis: the phorbol esters PMA (100 nM) and PDBu (100 nM) and the DAG analogue, DiC8 (20 μg/ml). Phorbol esters are potent activators of most members of the PKC family, with the exception of PKC ζ and ι (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 10Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Google Scholar, 22Blumberg P.M. Acs G. Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Szallasi Z. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 387: 3-19Google Scholar), and can be used to mimic the effects of DAG and to bypass normal agonist-mediated control of the enzyme. The use of two phorbol esters in this study was based on evidence that different members of this class of agents can induce distinct cellular responses (22Blumberg P.M. Acs G. Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Szallasi Z. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 387: 3-19Google Scholar). The membrane-permeant DAG analogue DiC8, a less potent but more physiological PKC agonist, was used to confirm the involvement of a PKC-mediated pathway in observed phorbol ester cell cycle-specific effects. PMA was administered either as a 15-min pulse or in continuous exposure, while PDBu and DiC8 were added only in continuous exposure. As shown in Fig. 2A.i, treatment of IEC-18 cells with P"

In steroidogenic cells, the cholesterol ester-rich lipid storage droplets are encoated with perilipins A and C. This study describes the dependence of perilipin levels on neutral lipid storage in cultured Y-1 adrenal cortical cells. The addition of fatty acids and cholesterol to the culture medium of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells greatly increased the storage of cholesterol esters and triacylglycerols concomitant with the formation of many new lipid storage droplets. The addition of fatty acids to the culture medium also produced a transient 6-fold increase in levels of perilipin A, but not C, mRNA, while much larger and stable increases in both perilipin A and C proteins were observed. The increases in perilipin protein levels were dependent upon the metabolism of fatty acids to triacylglycerol or cholesterol esters, since the incubation of cells with bromopalmitate, a poorly metabolized fatty acid, failed to yield large increases in lipid content or perilipin levels. Constitutive expression of epitope-tagged perilipins in transfected Y-1 adrenal cortical cells was regulated by lipid similarly to expression of the endogenous perilipins despite an absence of untranslated perilipin mRNA sequences in the expression constructs. Epitope-tagged perilipin A mRNAs were efficiently loaded with polyribosomes whether or not fatty acids were added to the culture medium; therefore, the increase in perilipin levels in the presence of fatty acids is likely due to factors other than increased translational efficiency. We suggest that the large increase in cellular perilipin levels upon lipid loading of cells is the result of post-translational stabilization of newly synthesized perilipins by stored neutral lipids.

Many cells of the body, including steroidogenic cells, store excess cholesterol as cholesterol esters in lipid storage droplets. Steroidogenic cells use this stored cholesterol as a substrate for steroid hormone synthesis (1Gwynne J.T. Strauss J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 299-329Google Scholar, 2Freeman D.A. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that the lipid storage droplets of steroidogenic cells are surrounded by perilipins (5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol.

Blanchette-Mackie, manuscript in preparation. a family of phosphorylated proteins encoded by a single gene and detected thus far only in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. Steroidogenic cells such as Y-1 adrenal cortical cells have a different distribution of the perilipin isoforms from adipocytes; while adipocytes express predominantly perilipin A, with smaller amounts of perilipin B, Y-1 adrenal cortical cells express primarily perilipin A, with smaller amounts of a unique isoform, perilipin C, and trace quantities of perilipin B (5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Google Scholar). Although the functions of the perilipins have yet to be determined, we propose a role in lipid metabolism based on the unique tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and metabolic properties. All cell types expressing the perilipins have a common mechanism of lipid hydrolysis; extracellular hormones stimulate production of cAMP, thus activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of cholesterol ester hydrolase in steroidogenic cells or hormone-sensitive lipase in adipocytes; moreover, these hydrolytic enzymes are probably identical (6Cook K.G.

Phosphorylation of the lipase facilitates its translocation to the surface of the lipid storage droplet (9Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The expression of the perilipins is closely linked to the storage of neutral lipids in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. The perilipins are found surrounding the earliest detectable deposits of triacylglycerols in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3C. M. Rondinone, T. Takeda, J. Theodorakis, T. Barber, E. J.

Inhibition of triacylglycerol deposition by biotin depletion of culture media concomitantly inhibits perilipin accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes; fatty acid supplementation of these biotin-depleted culture media restores triacylglycerol synthesis and perilipin accumulation. 3C.

The current study addresses the relationship between perilipin expression and neutral lipid storage in cultured Y-1 adrenal cortical cells. Y-1 adrenal cortical cells are a particularly attractive model for studying lipid regulation of perilipin expression, since they are maintained in culture as fully differentiated cells expressing lipid storage droplet proteins. The present study demonstrates that stored intracellular neutral lipids regulate levels of perilipins A and C in Y-1 adrenal cortical cells primarily by a post-translational mechanism. Horse serum, fetal bovine serum, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were purchased from Intergen. TRIzol and actinomycin D were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cholesterol and oleic acid were purchased from Calbiochem; bromopalmitate, cycloheximide, heparin, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. PRIME RNase inhibitor was purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime (Boulder, CO). Ammonium sulfate-impregnated silica gel H thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Analtech. The 12CA5 monoclonal antibody raised against an epitope from the hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus was purchased from BAbCo (Richmond, CA). The cDNA probe for c-myc (probe S107) was kindly provided by Dr. Beverly Mock; the cDNA probe for histone H4 was kindly provided by Dr. Hitoshi Kurumizaka. Y-1 adrenal cortical cells (12Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cohen A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1184-1188Google Scholar) were cultured in 100-mm dishes, as described previously (5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Google Scholar). Fatty acids were coupled to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at a ratio of 6:1 mol:mol oleic acid to albumin; the final fatty acid concentration was 400 μM in culture media. Cholesterol was added to culture media as an ethanolic solution to a final concentration of 130 μM cholesterol in 0.5% ethanol. Cells were collected and fractionated for immunoblot analysis essentially as described previously (10Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Google Scholar) but using a Beckman tube slicer (catalog number 303811) to facilitate removal of the floating cholesterol ester droplet fractions with as little contaminating supernatant as possible. Lipid storage droplets were further purified by a second centrifugation step of 27,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins in the floating lipid droplet fractions were precipitated in cold acetone and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% acrylamide and 0.2% N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Sample loads were equalized by loading lipid storage droplet fractions from equivalent cell numbers determined by DNA quantitation (14Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies with reactivity against full-length perilipin A were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera raised against perilipin A purified from fat cakes of primary rat adipocytes (10Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Google Scholar). These antibodies also recognize perilipin C. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence procedures with reagents from Amersham Corp. or Pierce. Cellular lipid content was determined by extracting cells with 2:1 chloroform:methanol (15Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar) and spotting lipid extracts onto ammonium sulfate-impregnated silica gel H thin layer chromatography plates. Plates were developed in 90:10:1 hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid and charred at 160°C for 1-2 h. Spots corresponding to the various lipid classes were quantitated by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer; relative spot densities were calculated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and compared with lipid standards resolved on the same plates. RNA was extracted from cultured Y-1 adrenal cortical cells with TRIzol according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, and the RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose or Hybond N+ (Amersham Corp.). High stringency Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the full-length coding region of perilipin A; this probe recognizes perilipins A, B, C, and D, the four murine perilipin mRNAs (5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Google Scholar). Other cDNA probes included probes for c-myc and histone H4 where noted. The polylinker sequence of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) was removed between the HindIII and ApaI restriction sites. Cassettes containing the nucleotide sequence for the 9 amino acids of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein epitope recognized by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (17Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Google Scholar) 5′ or 3′ to a new polylinker containing HpaI, SacI, BstEII, NotI, and XbaI restriction sites were inserted into the cut vector using 5′ HindIII and 3′ ApaI restriction sites. The coding nucleotide sequence of perilipin A was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers containing HpaI (for 5′“sense” primer) or XbaI (for 3′“antisense” primer) restriction site sequences. The amplified product was cleaved with HpaI and XbaI and ligated into the appropriately cleaved vectors to create expression vectors encoding perilipin A with epitope tag sequences on either the amino or the carboxyl terminus. The fidelity of amplification of perilipin A cDNA by Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Plasmids containing the epitope-tagged perilipin A sequences were transfected into Y-1 adrenal cells by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected with 0.3 or 0.6 mg/ml of active geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cultures were maintained in 0.3 mg/ml active geneticin. Polysome profiles (18Rogers J. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Google Scholar, 19Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Google Scholar) were obtained from 10-50% sucrose gradients of postmitochondrial supernatants of control and lipid-loaded Y-1 adrenal cells expressing perilipin A epitope-tagged at the carboxyl terminus. RNA extracts from equal volumes of fractions from the sucrose gradients were subjected to high stringency Northern blot analysis. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy (20Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Google Scholar) and stained with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against perilipin A and/or the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against the epitope tag. Rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used to visualize perilipin staining, and fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies were used to visualize the epitope tag sequence. Neutral lipids were visualized by staining paraformaldehyde-fixed cells for 10 min with 0.01% Nile Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were viewed with a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal imaging system (20Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Google Scholar). Densely subconfluent Y-1 adrenal cortical cells were incubated in culture medium containing 200 μM cholesterol ester contributed by the serum component or in medium supplemented with 130 μM cholesterol and 400 μM oleic acid coupled to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. By 48 h, the cellular content of neutral lipids, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol esters, increased by 3.5-fold when compared with cells incubated for the same period of time in unsupplemented culture medium (Table I). Although cholesterol esters increased modestly, the most dramatic change was the selective increase in triacylglycerol content; cells grown in medium supplemented with fatty acids and cholesterol showed a 12-fold increase in triacylglycerol content when compared with cells grown in unsupplemented media The selective increase in triacylglycerol content may have been due in part to more efficient uptake of fatty acids than of cholesterol by the cells. We did not attempt to increase the efficiency of cholesterol uptake using cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Cells grown in medium supplemented with cholesterol alone showed increased cholesterol ester storage (data not shown), while cells grown in medium supplemented with fatty acids alone showed increased triacylglycerol storage (see Table II). Nile red staining of cells grown in medium supplemented with oleic acid and cholesterol showed many very small brightly stained lipid storage droplets compared with few stained lipid droplets in cells grown in culture medium without additions (Fig. 1). In contrast to adipocytes, which accumulate neutral lipid in large storage droplets during differentiation, coalescence of lipid droplets into successively larger structures was not observed in Y-1 adrenal cortical cells.TABLE ILipid content of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells grown in culture medium without additions or with 400 μM oleic acid and 130 μM cholesterol for 48 hGrowth conditionsTriacylglycerolCholesterol esterNo added lipids0.035 ± 0.0040.219 ± 0.034With added lipids0.411 ± 0.0960.490 ± 0.061 Open table in a new tab TABLE IILipid content of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells grown in culture medium without additions, with 400 μM bromopalmitate, or with 400 μM oleate for 48 hGrowth conditionsTriacylglycerolCholesterol esterNo added lipids0.064 ± 0.0210.079 ± 0.013Bromopalmitate0.236 ± 0.0290.098 ± 0.021Oleate0.771 ± 0.0800.054 ± 0.025 Open table in a new tab Incubation of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells in medium supplemented with fatty acids and cholesterol led to very large increases in perilipins A and C (Fig. 2). While the total neutral lipid content increased by approximately 3.5-fold (triacylglycerol by 12-fold), large increases in perilipin mass were observed; densitometric scanning of immunoblots showed increases of at least 30-fold for perilipin C and more than 140-fold for perilipin A. The increased perilipin in the lipid-loaded cells was found almost exclusively in the floating fat cake fractions of homogenized cells. We have previously reported that centrifugation of Y-1 adrenal cortical cell homogenates fractionates the vast majority of perilipin in a floating fat cake with a minor amount of perilipin in the supernatant and membrane pellet (5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Google Scholar). The large increases in cellular perilipin levels with lipid loading and the localization of perilipin to lipid droplet surfaces were confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). Cells grown in unsupplemented medium and stained with antibodies raised against perilipin showed few brightly stained lipid droplets arrayed singly or in small clusters of 2-6 droplets, while cells grown in medium supplemented with fatty acids and cholesterol showed large clusters of dozens of very small brightly stained lipid storage droplets. Staining of the perilipins appeared as very small rings around the perimeters of phase dense lipid storage droplets and nowhere else in the cells. To test whether fatty acids or their metabolic products are required for the increased expression of perilipins, α-bromopalmitate, a poorly metabolized fatty acid (21Grimaldi P.A. Knobel S.M. Whitesell R.R. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10930-10934Google Scholar), was added to cultures of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells. Bromopalmitate has previously been shown to mimic fatty acid effects in regulating gene expression (21Grimaldi P.A. Knobel S.M. Whitesell R.R. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10930-10934Google Scholar, 22Amri E.-Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Google Scholar) but provides a poor substrate for fatty acyl-CoA synthase; hence, it is minimally incorporated into triacylglycerols or cholesterol esters. In this study, bromopalmitate was less efficiently metabolized to triacylglycerols than oleate in cultured Y-1 adrenal cortical cells (Table II). Supplementation of culture medium with 400 μM bromopalmitate increased triacylglycerol storage in Y-1 adrenal cortical cells by less than 4-fold when compared with normal culture conditions, while 400 μM oleate increased triacylglycerol levels by greater than 10-fold over unsupplemented culture medium. Correspondingly, bromopalmitate supplementation of culture medium increased perilipin A protein levels slightly while failing to increase perilipin C levels; oleate addition to culture medium increased levels of both perilipins A and C dramatically (Fig. 4). The increases in perilipin levels with bromopalmitate supplementation were less than one might expect given the moderate increase in triacylglycerol stores. We attempted to determine whether the mechanisms leading to the increased levels of perilipin were transcriptional or post-transcriptional. Since both fatty acids and cholesterol can contribute to regulated transcription of some genes, we tested the effects of these compounds on levels of perilipin mRNAs both in combination and separately. Analysis of the separate addition of fatty acids or cholesterol to cells indicated greater effects of oleic acid than of cholesterol on perilipin A mRNA levels; incubation of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells with 400 μM oleic acid led to an approximate 6-fold increase in perilipin A mRNA over 12 h, followed by a decline to levels that remained elevated above control levels for up to 48 h; there was no significant increase in perilipin C mRNA (Fig. 5). By contrast, incubation with 130 μM cholesterol led to slight increases in perilipin A mRNA levels. Combinations of cholesterol and oleic acid gave the same results as the addition of oleic acid alone (data not shown). Perilipin A mRNA levels showed only minor increases after refeeding of cells in the absence of supplemental fatty acids. The very large increases (30- to >100-fold) in protein levels of perilipins A and C observed in response to fatty acid additions to cells were in contrast to the relatively small differences in perilipin mRNA levels. Furthermore, no changes in perilipin C mRNA levels were observed while significant changes in protein levels of perilipin C were detected. Thus, the changes in perilipin mRNA levels are only a minor component of the overall regulation of perilipin levels by fatty acids. To determine whether the effect of fatty acids on perilipin A mRNA levels was due to changes in mRNA stability, we examined the decay of perilipin mRNA levels in the absence of continued RNA synthesis. Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from actinomycin D-treated cells revealed little decay of perilipin mRNAs from cells incubated in the presence or absence of oleic acid for 10 h (Fig. 6). By contrast, the degradation of a control (c-myc) mRNA showed a short half-life of less than 1 h (23Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Google Scholar). The perilipin A mRNA degradation rates for both lipid loaded and unsupplemented conditions were too low to account for the observed transient increase in perilipin A mRNA levels over 12 h. These data imply that fatty acid-induced increases in perilipin A mRNA levels are likely due to transcriptional control. However, consistent with the exceedingly low levels of perilipin mRNAs in steroidogenic cells (less than 0.01% of total mRNA; see 5Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Google Scholar), we were unable to reliably detect perilipin-specific hybridization to radiolabeled RNA synthesized in nuclei isolated from Y-1 adrenal cortical cells incubated with or without fatty acids. The above data indicated that fatty acids contribute to a post-transcriptional control mechanism. To address whether this additional mechanism was due to control of translation or a post-translational mechanism, we studied the effects of fatty acids on the expression of epitope-tagged perilipin A driven by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. Perilipin A was expressed as a fusion protein with an epitope tag from the hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus added to the carboxyl terminus. These constructs were constitutively and stably expressed in Y-1 adrenal cells using a vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and a selectable marker for neomycin resistance. Only the coding sequence of the perilipin A cDNA was used in preparing these constructs; hence, potential 5′ and 3′ regulatory elements were eliminated. The mRNA encoding the fusion protein was easily detected in stably transfected cells and was approximately 100-fold more abundant than that of the endogenous perilipins (Fig. 7A). By contrast, extremely low levels of the fusion proteins were detected in these cells by immunoblotting of lipid storage droplet proteins (Fig. 7B) or by immunofluorescence (data not shown). When fatty acids and cholesterol were added to cells expressing the fusion protein, neutral lipid storage increased (as in Table I and Fig. 1), and levels of both native perilipins A and C and epitope-tagged perilipin A increased dramatically (Fig. 7B). Levels of mRNA for epitope-tagged perilipin were unaffected by these lipid-loading conditions (Fig. 7A), while the endogenous perilipin A mRNA in these cells was increased, as described above. Immunoblots revealed that the final levels of endogenous and epitope-tagged perilipin A in lipid-loaded cells were similar, despite the presence of a 100-fold excess of mRNA for the fusion protein in these cells. The association of epitope-tagged perilipin A with lipid storage droplets was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8). Carboxyl terminally tagged perilipin A was found to associate exclusively with lipid storage droplets by immunofluorescence microscopy. Amino terminally tagged perilipin A was also found to target to lipid storage droplets (data not shown), but we have not studied the regulation of this construct under lipid-loading conditions. Hence, epitope-tagged perilipin A shows similar behavior to the native perilipins in targeting to lipid storage droplets. To further address the regulation of perilipin levels by neutral lipids, we asked whether there was an increase in the efficiency of perilipin translation in cells grown with supplemental lipids. Y-1 adrenal cortical cells expressing epitope-tagged perilipin A were used for these studies, since the fusion protein mRNA levels are significantly higher than those of endogenous perilipin A. Furthermore, as demonstrated above, levels of these perilipin fusion proteins were regulated by supplemental lipids similarly to those of the endogenous perilipins. Critical to these experiments was the observation that the perilipins are translated on unbound ribosomes. 4C. J. Schultz, N. E. Wolins, and C. Londos, unpublished observations. Postmitochondrial supernatants from cells grown in the presence or absence of 400 μM oleic acid were fractionated on sucrose gradients. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from gradient fractions revealed that the epitope-tagged perilipin A mRNA was as efficiently loaded with polyribosomes whether the cells were grown in the presence or absence of supplemental lipids (Fig. 9). Very little perilipin A mRNA was found in fractions representing unbound RNA in control cells; hence, there is no latent pool of mRNA that becomes associated with ribosomes when the cells are supplemented with lipids. The extent of ribosome recruitment to perilipin mRNA in cells grown in the presence or absence of supplemental lipids was compared with that of histone H4, a 10-kDa protein. In several experiments, the peak of maximal perilipin mRNA levels from cells grown under both conditions was consistently in a more dense sucrose fraction than that of the histone H4 mRNA (Fig. 9, D and E); hence, perilipin A mRNA recruits more ribosomes than the smaller histone H4 mRNA regardless of the growth conditions. Reproducibly, there was no observable difference in the ribosomal recruitment by perilipin A mRNA whether or not the media of the cells were supplemented with lipids. Thus, within the limits of resolution of this method, supplementation of cells with fatty acids does not increase the efficiency of perilipin translation. The current study demonstrates a close relationship between cellular levels of stored neutral lipid and perilipins. Levels of perilipins in Y-1 adrenal cortical cells in culture increase dramatically with the addition of fatty acids and cholesterol to the culture medium. Furthermore, metabolism of fatty acids to triacylglycerols or cholesterol esters is required for the observed increases in perilipin levels. Thus, the abundance of perilipins in cells reflects the availability of substrates for neutral lipid synthesis and, hence, the amount of deposited neutral lipid. A number of observations in the present study provide evidence that neutral lipids regulate perilipin levels via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Lipid loading of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells produces large increases in cellular levels of perilipin A and C proteins, while comparatively small increases are observed in levels of perilipin A mRNA; perilipin C mRNA is unchanged. Additionally, lipid-induced increases in epitope-tagged perilipin can be observed when the fusion protein expression is driven by a constitutive viral promoter. The perilipin cDNA in these constructs lacks all potential 5′ or 3′ untranslated regulatory sequences, and while levels of the exogenous transcript are unaffected by fatty acids, the fusion protein levels are acutely regulated by the availability of fatty acids. We have demonstrated that the metabolism of fatty acids to triacylglycerols or cholesterol esters is essential for the observed increases in perilipin levels; bromopalmitate, a poorly metabolized fatty acid, fails to increase perilipin C protein levels while increasing perilipin A protein levels only slightly. Additional evidence points to a post-translational regulatory mechanism. The loading of polyribosomes onto perilipin A mRNA was comparable whether or not cells were incubated with supplemental fatty acids. Hence, neither the initiation nor the elongation of translation of perilipin A appears to be affected by lipids. The most likely mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of perilipins A and C by fatty acids is post-translational stabilization of newly synthesized perilipins by neutral lipids. We have never been able to detect perilipins unaccompanied by triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters from cell extracts of either steroidogenic cells or adipocytes; thus, a lipid-protein association probably occurs co-translationally or very soon after translation. This observation suggests that cells do not accumulate the perilipins in a non-lipid-associated pool that is recruited when the cells begin to accumulate lipid. Rather, we suggest that perilipin synthesized in excess of that needed to associate with the available stored neutral lipid pool is degraded. Further evidence from adipocyte models suggests that once the perilipins are associated with lipid, they are quite stable in the cells; the half-life for perilipin A associated with lipid storage droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is approximately 40 h. 5C. J. Schultz and C. Londos, unpublished data. Based on the accumulated evidence, we propose the following model. Perilipins may exist in two intracellular pools: 1) a free or non-lipid-associated pool that has an extremely short half-life, and 2) a stable, lipid-associated pool that degrades very slowly. The addition of substrates for neutral lipid synthesis may increase the partitioning of newly synthesized perilipins into the stable lipid storage droplet-associated pool. We are currently attempting to develop methods to detect the putative transient pool of free perilipin. The mechanism for post-translational stabilization of the perilipins by stored neutral lipids may be analogous to that observed for apolipoprotein B (apoB) synthesized by liver cells. Intracellular and secreted levels of apoB are acutely regulated by the availability of fatty acids in the culture medium of hepatoma cells (Refs. 24Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Google Scholar, 25Boren J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar, 26Sakata N. Wu X.

McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of apoB-containing lipoproteins is very similar to that of intracellular lipid storage droplets; both consist of a core of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipid and cholesterol into which proteins are embedded. ApoB is co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, where lipids rapidly associate with the nascent peptide sequences, thus nucleating lipoprotein formation. Triacylglycerol synthesis is essential to stabilize apoB; in the absence of adequate substrate for triacylglycerol synthesis, the majority of newly synthesized apoB is degraded (24Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Google Scholar, 25Boren J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Google Scholar, 28Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Google Scholar). Proposed mechanisms include neutral lipid-mediated shielding of vulnerable residues on the the nascent protein from endogenous proteases and the facilitation of translocation of nascent apoB through the secretory pathway and away from a protease-containing compartment. Both similarities and some obvious differences exist between the pathways for the incorporation of apoB into developing lipoproteins and the association of the perilipins with nascent lipid storage droplets. Like apoB, the perilipins lack a recognizable signal sequence. Perilipin A that is epitope-tagged on the amino terminus targets to lipid storage droplets and remains intact, suggesting that proteolytic processing of a signal sequence on perilipin is not required for its association with the lipid droplet. We do not yet know which organelle(s) is involved in assembly of lipid storage droplets, but these lipid droplets retain an intracellular localization and hence do not follow the same assembly pathway as secreted lipoproteins. Interestingly, the levels of endogenous and carboxyl terminally epitope-tagged perilipin are similar in lipid-loaded cells despite higher levels of the epitope-tagged perilipin mRNA relative to the endogenous perilipin mRNA; this may suggest that perilipins modified at the carboxyl terminus are less efficiently targeted to or incorporated into lipid storage droplets. The perilipins lack extensive sequences containing the motifs known to mediate lipid-protein associations (16Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Google Scholar); hence, the nature of the lipid-protein interactions required for lipid stabilization of newly synthesized perilipin remains obscure. It is possible that the perilipins associate with a protein that embeds into the lipid storage droplet and that the observed lipid dependence of perilipin expression is a function of the ability of lipids to stabilize this anchoring protein. If an anchor protein is required for perilipin association, then the required protein-protein interactions must be quite strong, since isolating lipid storage droplets by centrifugation through 100 μM sodium carbonate, pH 11, fails to strip the perilipins from lipid droplets. 6N. E. Wolins and C. Londos, unpublished observations. It is probable that transcriptional control mechanisms account for a portion of the regulatory effects of fatty acids on perilipin expression in steroidogenic cells. Levels of mRNA for perilipins A and C are regulated differently by fatty acids; while levels of perilipin A mRNA are increased approximately 6-fold by the addition of oleic acid to culture medium, perilipin C mRNA levels are unaffected by fatty acid. These increases in perilipin A mRNA in response to fatty acid are probably due to increased transcription rather than to lipid-mediated stabilization of the mRNA. Fatty acids are involved in the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism through activation of the transcription of members of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor family of transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 29Bocos C. Gottlicher M. Gearing K. Banner C. Enmark E. Teboul M. Crickmore A. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 467-473Google Scholar and 30Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether a member of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor family is involved in the regulation of perilipin expression in steroidogenic cells. The addition of fatty acid and cholesterol to the culture medium of Y-1 adrenal cortical cells promotes the increased storage of neutral lipids leading to the formation of a multitude of minute lipid storage droplets encoated with perilipin. This is in sharp contrast to the pattern of lipid storage droplet accumulation in differentiating adipocytes; as adipocytes store triacylglycerol during differentiation, small lipid droplets appear to coalesce into larger structures, eventually resulting in very large, often unilocular lipid storage droplets. The lipid droplets of cultured steroidogenic cells fail to coalesce into larger structures, even after extensive lipid loading over the course of a week. 7D. L. Brasaemle and C. Londos, unpublished observations. This morphological observation suggests that the lipid storage droplets of steroidogenic cells may lack a coalescence factor present in adipocytes or perhaps contain a factor that prevents coalescence of the droplets. Consequent to the increased surface area of the lipid storage droplets of steroidogenic cells may be the ability to respond very rapidly to trophic hormones; the extra surface area may facilitate the rapid hydrolysis of stored cholesterol esters to provide substrate for steroid hormone synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1586663904,"Modeling of the active site of prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) onto PGHS-1 utilizing the known crystal structure of PGHS-1 shows that the only residues impinging directly on the active site that were not conserved in the two enzymes are His513 and Ile523 of PGHS-1 (Arg499 and Val509 of PGHS-2). These residues of human PGHS-1 were each mutated to the corresponding PGHS-2 residues (His513→ Arg and Ile523→ Val) and a double mutant (His513→ Arg,Ile523→ Val) containing both residues was also constructed. The mutant enzyme forms were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their properties were compared with those of the normal isoforms using microsomal membranes. The mutated enzyme forms all had apparent Km values within 1.4-fold that of the wild type enzyme, and the specific activity of the mutants were within 2-fold of that of PGHS-1. DuP697, NS-398, DFU, and SC-58125 are selective PGHS-2 inhibitors that act as time-dependent inhibitors of PGHS-2 and rapidly reversible competitive inhibitors of PGHS-1. The single Ile523→ Val mutation increased the sensitivity to each of these selective inhibitors with most of the effect detected using instantaneous inhibition assays, except for DuP697, whose potency was further increased by preincubation with the enzyme. The double PGHS-1 His513→ Arg,Ile523→ Val mutant became more sensitive to inhibition by NS-398 and DFU than the single IV mutant, and time-dependent inhibition was observed. In contrast, the single HR mutation did not increase the sensitivity to inhibition by the selective PGHS-2 inhibitors. The potency of a selective PGHS-1 inhibitor, L-745,296, was decreased 5- and 13-fold in the HR and HR-IV mutants, respectively. All the results indicate that mutations of His513 and Ile523 residues of PGHS-1 can strongly increase sensitivity to selective PGHS-2 inhibition and restore time-dependent inhibition. They also suggest that the corresponding Arg499 and Val509 residues of PGHS-2 are essential determinants in differentiating between the interaction of nonselective NSAIDs and selective PGHS-2 inhibitors and their mechanism of action.

Prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid and act as mediators of pain, fever, and other inflammatory responses (1DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Google Scholar).

Prostaglandin H2 is the precursor to the formation of all prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and indomethacin, abrogate prostaglandin synthesis through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase reaction of PGHS (4Vane J. Botting R.

This has lead to the development of selective PGHS-2 inhibitors, which have demonstrated that inhibition of PGHS-2 alone is sufficient to obtain an anti-inflammatory effect while eliminating the gastric ulceration seen in animal models with NSAIDs, which inhibit both PGHS-1 and −2 without a large degree of selectivity (9Seibert K.

The observation with selective PGHS-2 inhibitors and the difference in the regulation of the expression of the two isoforms has led to the suggestion that PGHS-1 is responsible for normal physiological PG synthesis, whereas PGHS-2 is the main isoform responsible for elevated PG production during inflammatory responses (9Seibert K.

These compounds have similar mechanisms of action, and they inhibit PGHS-2 by a time-dependent mechanism, whereas inhibition of PGHS-1 is through a time-independent and competitive mechanism (13Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Google Scholar, 16Ouellet M. Percival M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 247-251Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this time-dependent inhibition has not been elucidated. The cDNA and corresponding amino acid sequences of both human PGHS isoforms have been published, and the two enzyme forms have 63% sequence identity (17Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of sheep seminal vesicle PGHS-1 has demonstrated that the cyclooxygenase active site is comprised of a long hydrophobic channel that is also the site for binding of NSAIDs (18Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar). Several distinctive features of the active site are: 1) an Arg120 residue at the mouth of the channel that has been demonstrated to be important for binding of arachidonic acid and NSAIDs containing a carboxylic acid residue (19Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.-P. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29372-29377Google Scholar, 20Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Rieke C.J. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2179-2184Google Scholar); 2) a Tyr385 residue at the upper portion of the active site that is involved in the formation of a radical at the C-13 position of arachidonic acid (21Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Google Scholar); and 3) a Ser530 residue (just below Tyr385) is the residue that is the site of acetylation by aspirin (22DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar). The aspirin acetylated PGHS-2 results in an enzyme form that oxidizes arachidonic acid to 15-HETE (23Mancini J.A. O'Neill G.P. Bayly C. Vickers P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 33-37Google Scholar) with altered sensitivity to inhibition by certain NSAIDs (24Mancini J.A. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. Boily C. Falgueyret J.-P. Riendeau D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 52-60Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the active site of PGHS-2 using the coordinates of PGHS-1 and site-directed mutagenesis have identified Val509 of PGHS-2 as essential for inhibition by PGHS-2 selective inhibitors (25Gierse J.K.

We have utilized molecular modeling of the active site of PGHS-2 to determine residues of PGHS-1 that could be mutated to recover inhibition of PGHS-2 selective inhibitors on a modified form of PGHS-1. Diclofenac was obtained from Sigma and indomethacin and arachidonic acid were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Sulindac sulfide, DFU, DuP697, NS-398, SC-58125, and L-745,296 (compound 23) (27Leblanc Y. Gauthier J.-Y. Ethier D. Guay J. Mancini J. Riendeau D. Tagari P. Vickers P. Wong E. Prasit P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 2123-2128Google Scholar) were synthesized by the Medicinal Chemistry Department of the Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research. Hematin and glutathione were purchased from Sigma; phenol was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Human PGHS-2 was homology built based upon an amino acid sequence alignment with residues 33-586 of sheep PGHS-1 using GCG and the published crystal structure of sheep PGHS-1. For amino acid changes between the two isoforms, the sheep PGHS-1 side chains were replaced with those corresponding to human PGHS-2. Following manual correction of the worst steric clashes of the introduced side chains, an all atom model was built and progressively minimized using AMBER 4.1 (28Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Google Scholar, 29Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S.

Restraints to the sheep PGHS-1 peptide backbone were maintained at all times. The protein was heated to 300 K over 10 ps and equilibrated over 45 ps in vacuo using a distance-dependent dielectric constant. Snapshots of the trajectory at 0, 15, 30, and 45 ps were cooled and minimized; comparison of the resulting structures showed little structural variation. In the active site where flurbiprofen was shown to bind in sheep PGHS-1, there was almost no structural variation between the human PGHS-2 minimized structures. A solvent accessible surface area was generated (water probe radius, 1.4 Å) around the area corresponding to the flurbiprofen binding site in sheep PGHS-1. The three mutants of PGHS-1 (His513→ Arg; Ile523→ Val; and His513→ Arg,Ile523→ Val) were constructed by using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.). The coding region of PGHS-1 was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of Bluescript SK (Stratagene), and single stranded DNA was obtained using M13 K07 helper phage (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) with a one- or two-nucleotide mismatch. The oligonucleotides were hybridized to the single stranded DNA, and mutants were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutants were confirmed by sequencing using a Prism DyeDeoxy Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 373 DNA sequencer. The correct mutants were completely sequenced on both cDNA strands to confirm no misincorporation of nucleotides during the mutagenesis procedure. The cDNA of interest was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for transient expression in COS-7 (ATCC) cells. PGHS-1 cDNA constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were washed with fresh medium 24 h after transfection and harvested 72 h post-transfection. The harvested cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disrupted with a Kontes Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor for 3 × 10 s. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant fraction was then subjected to a 100,000 × g spin for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting microsomal pellet fraction for each mutant and the wild type PGHS-1 was resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA. The protein concentration was quantitated by using the Pierce Coomassie protein assay as described by the manufacturer. Protein expression was quantitated by immunoblot analysis. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The PGHS-1 protein was detected with a PGHS-1 polyclonal antiserum (30Kargman S. O'Neill G.P. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Mancini J.A. Jothy S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2556-2559Google Scholar), and a secondary antibody developed with enhanced chemiluminesce (DuPont NEN). The immunoblot was exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film. The developed film was analyzed for expression levels by laser densitometric scanning using a Molecular Dynamics Laser Densitometer. PGHS activity was determined based on the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2 by radioimmunoassay. Microsomal membrane protein preparations (final concentration, 15 μg/ml) of PGHS-1 were incubated in the absence or the presence of inhibitor for various times in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM glutathione, 0.5 mM phenol, 100 μM hematin. The reaction was initiated with either 2 or 10 μM arachidonic acid and was terminated at 1 or 3 min by acidification with 0.1 N HCl (final concentration). This mixture was neutralized with an equivalent amount of NaOH and analyzed for PGE2 formation using the methyl oximated PGE2 RIA kit (Amersham Corp.). A time course of PGE2 formation for all of the microsomal preparations was obtained and found to result in a rapid product formation that was linear for the first minute and reached a maximum after 3-5 min. The Km was determined using a reaction time of 1 min over a broad range of arachidonic acid concentrations (0.1-10 μM) and was calculated using a hyperbolic regression program created by Dr. J. S. Easterby (University of Liverpool, UK). The IC50 calculations of the inhibitors tested were determined ± standard error from at least four values. Microsomal PGHS-2 was prepared from COS-7 cells infected with a vaccinia virus PGHS-2 construct as described previously (12O'Neill G.P. Mancini J.A. Kargman S. Yergey J. Kwan M.Y. Falgueyret J.-P. Abramovitz M. Kennedy B.P. Ouellet M. Cromlish W. Culp S. Evans J.F. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Vickers P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 245-254Google Scholar). The development of selective PGHS-2 inhibitors has led to attempts to identify residues of PGHS-2 involved in the binding of these inhibitors. Molecular modeling of the three-dimensional structures of the human isoforms was performed utilizing the published crystal structure of sheep PGHS-1 (18Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar) to identify residues of PGHS-1 that can be converted to PGHS-2 to mimic the inhibitor binding site of PGHS-2. The predicted structure of PGHS-2 demonstrates that the majority of the changes between the two isoforms occur at the N-terminal region forming the amphipathic helices and at the C-terminal tail. The cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1 and 2 are very similar. The important features of the active site are depicted in Fig. 1 with Tyr385 (PGHS-1 residues, Fig. 1A) representing the upper part of the active site located just below the heme moiety and presumably responsible for the abstraction of the hydrogen atom at the C-13 position of arachidonic acid. The Ser530 residue is the site of aspirin acetylation and is equivalent to Ser516 in PGHS-2 (Fig. 1B). Arg120 (Arg106 in PGHS-2) is the proposed interaction site of the acid moiety of several NSAIDs and of the carboxylic acid group of arachidonic acid. His513 of PGHS-1 (Arg499 of PGHS-2) and Ile523 of PGHS-1 (Val509 of PGHS-2) are two residues that impinge on the active site and that are not conserved between the two isoforms. The solvent accessible space in the active site of these isoforms (depicted as blue dots in Fig. 1) shows that the His513 and Ile523 of PGHS-1 allow for only a small available space in the vicinity of these residues for inhibitor interaction. Specifically, Ile523 appears to severely restrict access to this space. In contrast, the Val509 and Arg499 of PGHS-2 result in the creation of a larger active site of PGHS-2 accessible to substrates and inhibitors. We have replaced the residues His513 and Ile523 of PGHS-1 with the corresponding residues of PGHS-2 to mimic the inhibitor binding site of PGHS-2. The double mutant of PGHS-1 (PGHS-1 His513→ Arg,Ile523→ Val (HR-IV)) was constructed to completely mimic the lower end of the active site of PGHS-2 and the single mutants (PGHS-1 His513→ Arg (HR) and PGHS-1 Ile523→ Val (IV)) were constructed to establish the contribution of the single residue on the inhibitor selectivity. Levels of PGHS protein expression of the various mutants in microsomal membranes from transfected COS-7 cells were quantitated by immunoblot analysis using a specific anti-PGHS-1 antiserum (Fig. 2). Laser densitometric scanning indicates that the level of expression of each of the various proteins was very similar with relative levels of 0.9-, 0.6-, and 0.9-fold that of PGHS-1 for HR, IV, and HR-IV mutants, respectively. The PGHS activity of the various mutants, as assessed by conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2 ranged from 0.6 to 2-fold that of the wild type PGHS-1 (Table I). Membranes from mock transfected COS-7 cells contained less than 3% of the PGHS activity measured for any of the recombinant PGHS proteins. The time course of PGE2 production was similar for all recombinant PGHS preparations with a rapid substrate conversion over the first minute of the reaction and a plateau of product formation after a 3-5-min reaction as previously reported (19Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.-P. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29372-29377Google Scholar). The apparent Km values for arachidonic acid were determined and found to be very similar for PGHS-2, PGHS-1, and the mutants of PGHS-1 (0.5-0.9 μM) (Table I).TABLE ICharacterization of PGHS-1 mutant enzyme formsRecombinant enzymePGHS activityKmpmol PGE2/mg protein/3 minμM arachidonic acidPGHS-14380.7PGHS-1 H513R5950.5PGHS-1 I523V2530.8PGHS-1 H513R,I523V8700.8PGHS-21890.9 Open table in a new tab The effect of the various mutations introduced into PGHS-1 on inhibitor sensitivity was evaluated using selective PGHS-2 inhibitors (DuP697, NS-398, SC-58125, and DFU), nonselective NSAIDs (sulindac sulfide, indomethacin, and diclofenac), and a selective PGHS-1 inhibitor (L-745,296). The results are summarized in Table II, and titration curves for the selective PGHS-2 inhibitors are shown in Fig. 3. The HR mutant resulted in an enzyme form that was inhibited by NSAIDs with similar potencies as observed for wild type PGHS-1, and there was no significant change in sensitivity to PGHS-2 selective inhibitors. The most significant change for the HR mutant was a 5-fold increase in the IC50 for the selective PGHS-1 inhibitor, L-745,296. In contrast to the modest effect of the HR mutation on inhibitor sensitivity, the IV mutant was found to have an increased sensitivity to all of the PGHS-2 inhibitors. For example, DuP697 was about 300-fold and SC-58125 at least 15-fold more potent at inhibiting the IV mutant than the wild type PGHS-1. The IV mutant was also more sensitive to inhibition by NS-398 or DFU, and the IC50 for these selective inhibitors was at least 4-fold lower than that observed for PGHS-1. The double mutant HR-IV was more sensitive to inhibition by the selective PGHS-2 compounds, NS-398, SC-58125, and DFU, than either of the single point mutants. DFU and SC-58125, which both have IC50s of >50 μM for the inhibition of PGHS-1, inhibited HR-IV with IC50 values of 1.6 and 1.8 μM, respectively. The HR-IV mutant remained sensitive to inhibition by the PGHS-1 selective inhibitor L-745,296, although the potency of this inhibitor was decreased by more than 10-fold as compared with native PGHS-1.TABLE IISensitivity of PGHS-1, PGHS-2, and mutant forms of PGHS-1 to inhibition by NSAIDs and selective PGHS-2 inhibitorsInhibitorIC50PGHS-1PGHS-1 H513RPGHS-1 I523VPGHS-1 H513R, I523VPGHS-2nMSulindac sulfide80 ± 40140 ± 56 ± 260 ± 20310 ± 40Indomethacin95 ± 1550 ± 219 ± 240 ± 201,000 ± 300Diclofenac21 ± 118 ± 511 ± 311 ± 162 ± 10DuP697110 ± 3096 ± 150.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.18 ± 3NS-39832,000 ± 13,00016,000 ± 5,0007,500 ± 1,600940 ± 30080 ± 8SC-58125>50,000>50,0003,400 ± 4001,600 ± 500190 ± 40DFU>50,000>50,00021,000 ± 5,0001,800 ± 200700 ± 200L-745,296110 ± 20510 ± 11024 ± 61,400 ± 140>50,000 Open table in a new tab The inhibition of PGHS-2 by selective compounds such as DuP697 is time-dependent for PGHS-2 and rapidly reversible for PGHS-1 (13Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Google Scholar, 16Ouellet M. Percival M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 247-251Google Scholar). This difference is readily observed with microsomal preparations where only the inhibition of PGHS-2 was found to depend on the time of preincubation with enzyme as shown in Fig. 4 (A and B). We examined this time dependence for inhibition of the IV mutant, and as shown in Fig. 4C, inhibition of this mutant by DuP697 follows a similar pattern as that seen for inhibition of PGHS-2. DuP697 was also found to be a time-dependent inhibitor of HR-IV (data not shown). SC-58125 was a time-independent inhibitor of both the IV and HR-IV mutant (data not shown). Both instantaneous inhibition assays in which the inhibitor was added at the time of initiation of the reaction and time-dependent inhibition have been used to evaluate the effect of NSAIDs and PGHS-2 inhibitors on enzyme activity (31Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1995; 271: 927-934Google Scholar). IC50 values were determined for both the IV and HR-IV mutants using assays with either no preincubation or a 15-min preincubation of the inhibitor prior to initiation of the enzyme reaction. These results are summarized in Table III for DuP697, DFU, and NS-398. The single IV mutation caused only a slight increase in inhibitor potency as determined for instantaneous inhibition, which was not further modified by increasing the preincubation time in the case of DFU and NS-398. In contrast, DuP697, for which an IC50 value of 0.1 μM for PGHS-1 is observed independently of the time of preincubation, was a more potent inhibitor of the IV mutant after a 15-min preincubation (IC50 = 0.3 nM), consistent with the time-dependent inhibition observed in Fig. 4C The introduction of the second HR mutation did not further change the parameters for the inhibition by DuP697. For DFU and NS-398, the second HR mutation caused a further decrease in IC50 values for instantaneous inhibition to 5.2 and 2.6 μM, respectively. In addition, the IC50 values for these two inhibitors were about 3-fold lower using the 15-min preincubation assay. All of these selective PGHS-2 inhibitors are essentially inactive when tested for instantaneous inhibition versus PGHS-2 (IC50 > 50 μM). Altogether, the results of Table III and Fig. 4 demonstrate that the IV mutant is inhibitable in a time-dependent fashion by DuP697, and the HR-IV mutant is inhibitable in a time-dependent fashion by DuP697, NS-398, and DFU.TABLE IIIInstantaneous and time-dependent inhibition of PGHS mutants by selective PGHS-2 inhibitorsCompoundPGHS-1IC50PGHS-1 I523VPGHS-1 H513R, I523V15 min0 min15 min0 min15 minnMDuP697110 ± 3048 ± 80.3 ± 0.143 ± 160.4 ± 0.1DFU>50,00022,000 ± 3,00021,000 ± 5,0005,200 ± 5001,800 ± 170NS-39832,000 ± 13,0006,300 ± 5007,500 ± 1,6002,600 ± 100940 ± 250 Open table in a new tab The discovery of a second isoform of PGHS several years ago has led to the identification of several selective inhibitors of PGHS-2 that have anti-inflammatory properties and a significantly decreased capacity for gastric ulceration. The mechanism of action of these selective PGHS-2 inhibitors is through a two-step mechanism. The first step involves the formation of an enzyme inhibitor complex (EI) followed by the slower formation of a tightly bound EI* complex as shown in the equation below. E+I⇌kiEI⇌k−2k2EI*(Eq. 1) The method of inhibition for PGHS-1 by PGHS-2 selective inhibitors is via a competitive rapidly reversible mechanism (13Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Google Scholar, 16Ouellet M. Percival M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 247-251Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the active site of PGHS-2 based on the known structure of PGHS-1 was performed to predict the major differences in the active sites of the two enzymes. The model suggests that in PGHS-2, the solvent accessible surface area is increased by the residues Val509 and Arg499 of PGHS-2 (Fig. 1), resulting in the ability of PGHS-2 to utilize a variety of lipid substrates (16Ouellet M. Percival M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 247-251Google Scholar) and a larger active site for inhibitor binding. Because the only primary structure of the differences in the active site were localized to these latter residues and the equivalent PGHS-1 residues are His513 and Ile523, we constructed mutants of PGHS-1 in attempts to convert the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-1 into that of PGHS-2. Because the apparent Km values of the mutants are within 1.4-fold and the specific activity is within 2-fold of that of PGHS-1 and the mutants retained sensitivity to inhibition by all NSAIDs tested, the mutations have not significantly altered the cyclooxygenase active site of prostaglandin synthase. The single IV mutation in PGHS-1 results in an enzyme form that is more sensitive to inhibition by all four of the PGHS-2 selective inhibitors, although NS-398 and DFU are much weaker inhibitors of this mutant compared with either the double HR-IV mutant or PGHS-2. The single IV mutant was also more sensitive to inhibition by nonselective NSAIDs and the selective PGHS-1 inhibitor L-745,296, although the effect was most pronounced with the PGHS-2 selective inhibitors. The increase in potency for the IV mutant as compared with the wild type PGHS-1 is observable at instantaneous inhibition for DFU, SC-58125, and NS-398 with a further increase in the potency of DuP697 by preincubation of the inhibitor with enzyme before the measurement of activity. These results suggest that the IV mutation has increased the affinity of PGHS-1 for all selective PGHS-2 inhibitors but without a change in the mechanism of inhibition (rapidly reversible) for DFU, SC-58125, and NS-398. However, this single mutation was sufficient to change the rapidly reversible mechanism of inhibition of PGHS-1 by DuP697 to the time-dependent mechanism characteristic of PGHS-2 inhibition. Reconstitution of time-dependent inhibition would be consistent with a two-step mechanism as shown above for PGHS-2, although alternate mechanisms cannot be ruled out. The introduction of the second HR mutation to generate the HR-IV mutant resulted in an enzyme form very sensitive to inhibition by all four of the PGHS-2 selective inhibitors with DFU and NS-398 now showing time-dependent inhibition in addition to DuP697. It is of interest to note that the changes of the HR mutation on inhibitor potency were observed on the IV mutant of PGHS-1 rather than on PGHS-1, demonstrating the advantage of combining mutations to show the importance of the various residues. Another difference in the active site of PGHS-2 as compared with PGHS-1 is the increased capacity of PGHS-2 to synthesize 15-R-HETE from arachidonic acid when acetylated by aspirin (23Mancini J.A. O'Neill G.P. Bayly C. Vickers P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 33-37Google Scholar, 24Mancini J.A. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. Boily C. Falgueyret J.-P. Riendeau D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 52-60Google Scholar). Both the single IV and the double mutant HR-IV did not synthesize any appreciable 15-R-HETE as compared with PGHS-2 when treated with 100 μM aspirin (data not shown). This suggests that the major determinants for the binding of selective PGHS-2 inhibitors by the PGHS-1 mutants are not sufficient to restore all of the properties of the active site of PGHS-2. Two recent reports have shown that mutation of Val509 of PGHS-2 to the corresponding Ile523 in PGHS-1 results in the loss of sensitivity to PGHS-2 inhibition (25Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D. Rangwala S.H. Koboldt C. Seibert K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15810-15814Google Scholar, 26Guo Q. Wang L.-H. Ruan K.-H. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19134-19139Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the converse in PGHS-1 is sufficient to gain partial sensitivity to PGHS-2 inhibitors, but the double HR-IV mutation results in an enzyme form that is more sensitive to a greater number of PGHS-2 selective inhibitors from three diverse structural classes, with most having a similar mechanism of inhibition. These data suggest that the molecular modeling of PGHS-2 has accurately predicted residues that are important for PGHS-2 inhibitor selectivity. During preparation of this manuscript, the crystal structure of PGHS-2 was published and confirms the major points depicted by the molecular modeling (15Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Google Scholar). The crystal structure data demonstrate the importance of Val509 as the residue that provides access to a larger active site for PGHS-2 as compared with PGHS-1. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combination of molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and inhibitor characterization have delineated both residues Arg499 and Val509 to be essential determinants in the differentiation between interaction of nonselective NSAIDs and selective PGHS-2 inhibitors and their mechanism of inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2037195066,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a heparin-binding polypeptide that stimulates cell proliferation, motility, and morphogenesis by activation of its receptor, the c-Met tyrosine kinase. HGF/SF consists of a series of structural units, including an amino-terminal segment with a hairpin loop, four kringle domains, and a serine protease-like region. In this study, we demonstrate that the amino-terminal (N) domain retains the heparin-binding properties of full-length HGF/SF. In contrast to a previous hypothesis, selected basic amino acid residues in the hairpin loop are not critical for heparin binding, although alanine substitution at a subset of these sites markedly reduced the biological activity of the HGF/SF isoform, HGF/NK1. Covalent cross-linking experiments performed with wild-type and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSGAG)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed that Met-HGF/NK1 binding was strongly dependent on HSGAG. Addition of heparin to HSGAG-deficient CHO cells not only restored ligand binding, but also increased ligand-dependent Met tyrosine phosphorylation and c-fos expression. Moreover, our results showed that heparin stimulated ligand oligomerization through an interaction with the N domain. These findings establish the importance of the N domain for heparin-ligand and ligand-ligand interactions, and demonstrate a crucial role for HSGAG in receptor binding and signal transduction."

Several SH3 interactions were shown to participate in translocation and assembly of the active membrane-bound enzyme in whole cells (12Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 6: 241aGoogle Scholar). The first p47phox SH3 domain engages a membrane-bound proline-rich target in p22phox (17de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Google Scholar), while the second SH3 domain of p67 phox binds to a carboxyl-terminal p47phox target and is critical for p67phox membrane translocation (12Leto T.L.

Kaulferch W. Seger R.A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2329-2334Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the SH3 domain of p40phox also binds the same carboxyl-terminal target in p47phox that binds p67phox (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar, 22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar). Other SH3 domain interactions have been demonstrated, including intramolecular contacts within p47phox (12Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite work in several laboratories on the interactions between oxidase components, the function of p40phox has remained unclear (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem.

Antibodies against p40phox were shown to inhibit NADPH oxidase in vitro (25Tsunawaki S. Kagara S. Yoshikawa Yoshida L.C. Tadatoshi K. Namiki H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 893-902Google Scholar), although the effects of p40phox on oxidase activity have not been examined directly, and CGD patients with lesions in the p40phox gene have not been described. Furthermore, p40 phox is not needed to reconstitute high levels of oxidase activity in cell-free systems containing purified p21rac, p47phox, p67phox, and relipidated flavocytochrome b558 (26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Google Scholar, 27Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Google Scholar). Like several of the core oxidase components, p40phox expression is myeloid-specific (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar). The fact that p40phox is bound in a complex with p67phox and p47phox that translocates to the membrane upon activation suggests that p40phox could have a role in modulating the respiratory burst. Here we report about interactions of p40phox with other oxidase components and explore the effects of these interactions on oxidase activity, both in cell-free and whole cell reconstituted systems. Based on these observations, we provide evidence for yet another SH3 domain-mediated interaction, which in this case appears to inhibit oxidase function. The full coding sequence of p40phox was cloned from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; catalog No. HL4014AB) using the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification primers were targeted to sequences beginning 21 bases upstream from the start codon and ending 30 bases after the stop codon of the p40phox cDNA (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar). The p40phox polymerase chain reaction product was first cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for sequencing and then subcloned (EcoRI fragment) into pGEX3X for production of recombinant p40phox-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli The fusion protein was affinity purified from induced bacteria on glutathione-Sepharose as described elsewhere (28Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.F. Kingston R. Moorer D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 16.7.1-16.7.8Google Scholar). Production of recombinant p40phox baculovirus for infection of cultured Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells was performed by methods described earlier (29Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fuji H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The p40 cDNA was subcloned (EcoRI fragment) into pVL1392 (Invitrogen) and used for co-transfection of Sf9 cells along with linearized, deleted baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. High titer p40phox baculovirus was used to infect large scale suspension cultures (100 ml) grown at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in Sf900-II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The protein was harvested from the cleared soluble fraction of sonicated cells harvested 3 days after infection as described (29Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fuji H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Google Scholar). These preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and were used in cell-free oxidase reconstitution studies without further purification. Affinity-purified full-length p40phox used for immunization was obtained by binding to a recombinant GST fusion protein constructed with the carboxyl-terminal domain of p47phox (residues 358-390) (12Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9: 10650-10654Google Scholar). GST-p40phox fusion protein preparations from inclusion bodies were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie blue. The full-length protein was excised and used to immunize rabbits (primary immunization, 150 μg in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by two boosts in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2-week intervals). Subsequent boosts used affinity-purified baculovirus-derived p40phox eluted from SDS-PAGE gels. The antiserum obtained after 10 weeks of immunization cross-reacted specifically with p40phox in neutrophil cytosol and recombinant p40phox from Sf9 cells. The p40phox cDNA was excised from the TA-p40 vector with KpnI (5′) and XbaI (3′) and subcloned into the episomal vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) restricted with KpnI and NheI. The carboxyl-terminal-deleted form of p40phox (residues 1-260) was constructed by restriction of full-length cDNA with KpnI (5′ polylinker) and BglII (internal) sites and subcloned into KpnI and BamHI-digested pCEP4. The segment encoding the SH3 domain of p40phox (residues 172-229) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. pREP episomal expression vectors carrying p47phox and p67phox cDNAs were described earlier (13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar, 30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar). Co-transfection of pCEP or pREP plasmids containing p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox cDNAs (20 μg each) into transduced K562 (gp91phox-expressing) cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (16de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Google Scholar, 30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar). In control experiments, pCEP4CAT vector (Invitrogen) was used in place of pCEP40. At 48 h post-transfection, 105 cells/ml were selected for 5 days in complete medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. Production of p40phox in hygromycin-resistant cells was confirmed by immunoblotting of cytosolic fractions with rabbit p40 antiserum (1:1000 dilution). All functional assays were performed within 2 weeks of hygromycin selection. Whole cell superoxide production in response to PMA stimulation (2 μg/ml) was determined as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence detected with an enhancer-containing luminol-based detection system as described (DIOGENES™, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) (16de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Google Scholar, 30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar), using a multiwell plate-reading luminometer (Luminoskan, Labsystems). Both experimental and superoxide dismutase-inhibited reactions were monitored at 1-min intervals for at least 15 min at 37°C following PMA activation. The DIOGENES™ reagent is >1000 times more sensitive to superoxide than hydrogen peroxide due to the presence of a redox active compound that facilitates direct transfer of electrons from superoxide to luminol (Dr. G. Kitzler, National Diagnostics). As noted earlier (16de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Google Scholar, 30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar), chemiluminescence signals were completely abolished in the presence of superoxide dismutase and were catalase-insensitive (G. Kitzler), indicative of a superoxide-specific assay. The yeast Gal4 two-hybrid expression system (31Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Field S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 99: 9578-9582Google Scholar, 32Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Google Scholar, 33Bartel Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar) from Clontech (San Diego, CA) was used to study interactions of NADPH oxidase components as fusion proteins produced in yeast. In this system, two proteins of interest are expressed as hybrids of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (pGBT9) or the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (pGADGH or pGAD424). An interaction between the two hybrid proteins results in transactivation of the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Full-length coding sequences of p40phox and p47phox were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGADGH in frame with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain. Full-length p67phox cDNA was derived from pREP10/67 (13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar). Deleted forms of p67phox cDNA were made as follows: p67NT (residues 1-246) was excised from full-length cDNA using EcoRI and BglII sites and ligated into EcoRI and BamHI (or BglII) sites in pGBT9 and pGAD424. The region between the two SH3 domains of p67phox (CT), residues 293-465, was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned into pGBT9. Sequence encoding the p47phox proline-rich tail region (residues 351-390) was amplified and subcloned into pGBT9 and pGAD424. p40ΔCT (residues 1-260) and p40CT (residues 260-340) were obtained by restricting p40phox cDNA in the pGADGH with BglII (internal site) and SpeI (5′ MCS) or SalI (3′ MCS) and subcloning SpeI-BglII or BglII-SalI fragments into appropriately cut pGADGH. Expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing and in some cases by Western blotting. All manipulations in yeast strains HF7c or CG1945 were according to manufacturers' directions. Interactions between fusion proteins were monitored by histidine prototropy and β-galactosidase activity detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-β-D-galactopyranoside within lysed colonies that were adsorbed onto nitrocellulose filters (33Bartel Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar). All constructs were co-expressed along with appropriate control (nonrecombinant or empty) vectors to test for false positive signals. Cell-free superoxide production was determined from the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described earlier (13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar, 29Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fuji H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Google Scholar). Reactions (100 μl) contained varying amounts of Sf9 cell cytosols derived from uninfected or p40phox baculovirus-infected cultures (0-20 μg) along with 5 × 105 cell equivalents of deoxycholate-solubilized neutrophil membranes, 0.8 μg each of recombinant p47phox, and p67phox (29Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fuji H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Google Scholar) and 1 μg of the mutant form of p21rac1 (Q61L) preloaded with GTPγS. This mutant form of p21rac1 was expressed in pGex-2T (4Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5711-5717Google Scholar) and was more active than wild-type p21rac1 as noted earlier with p21rac2 (34Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Google Scholar). Negative control reactions contained 5 μg of superoxide dismutase, in which case cytochrome c reduction did not exceed 5% of the activity observed in the absence of superoxide dismutase. Maximum rates of superoxide generation were calculated from a linear least-squares fit of 5 consecutive 1-min data points based on reactions performed in duplicate. Attempts to isolate intact recombinant p40phox from E. coli were not successful due to the proteolytic susceptibility of GST-p40phox fusion protein. The affinity-purified fusion protein contained a predominant breakdown product ∼46 kDa in size, suggesting cleavage of a ∼19-kDa fragment from the N terminus of p40phox. However, a nondegraded form of the GST-p40phox fusion protein was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies of induced cells by preparative SDS-PAGE and was used for primary immunization of rabbits against p40phox. The baculovirus expression system was used for production of native, full-length recombinant p40phox, since earlier work showed that this system was efficient in production of other cytosolic oxidase proteins (29Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fuji H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Google Scholar). Sonicated lysates from p40phox baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (72 h post-infection) contained a prominent 40-kDa species (Fig. 1A), which demonstrated immuno-cross-reactivity with a 40-kDa band in neutrophil cytosol (Fig. 1B). The Sf9 lysates were considerably enriched in p40phox in comparison with neutrophil cytosol on a specific weight basis. These Sf9 preparations were used without further purification as a source of p40phox in subsequent cell-free oxidase reconstitution studies. Baculovirus-derived p40phox also exhibited binding to immobilized GST fused with the proline-rich, C-terminal (33-residue) segment of p47phox, while not binding to unfused GST (Fig. 1C), consistent with interactions detected in the yeast two-hybrid system (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar, 22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar) (see below). This affinity system was scaled up to purify p40phox used in later immunizations. Recombinant p40phox was also expressed in the cell line K562. These cells lack the neutrophil oxidase components p47phox, p67phox, and gp91phox and proved to be an efficient transfectable model for reconstitution of NADPH oxidase following transduction with gp91phox retrovirus and co-transfection of p47phox and p67phox cDNAs in Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal expression vectors (pREP4 or pREP10) (16de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Google Scholar, 30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar). To confirm expression of p40phox in K562 cells, protein lysates from hygromycin-resistant K562 cells transfected with pCEPp40phox or control vectors were compared by p40phox immunoblotting. Endogenous p40phox was not detected in K562 cells transfected with pCEPCAT (control) (Fig. 2, lane 1), while production of recombinant p40phox in K562 cells transfected with pCEP40phox was evident by detection of a 40-kDa immunoreactive species at levels similar to neutrophil cytosol (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 5). Co-expression of recombinant p40phox was confirmed in hygromycin-selected K562 cells co-transfected with three episomal vectors, pCEP4/p40phox, pREP4/p47phox, and pREP10/p67phox (Fig. 2, lane 3). The diminished levels of p40phox seen in this case were consistent with previous experience, where lower expression was observed with co-transfection of several constructs bearing the same selection marker (30de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Google Scholar). In the absence of pCEP40phox, immunoblotting of K562 cells did not reveal any endogenous p40phox stabilized by the other recombinant oxidase components (Fig. 2, lane 4) as was observed in mature CGD neutrophils. These results, showing the absence of endogenous p40phox in K562 cells and efficient production of p40phox with this vector, established the utility of these transfectable cells for exploring the role of p40phox in whole cell NADPH oxidase function. Retroviral gp91-transduced K562 cells were co-transfected by electroporating 20 μg each of pREP4/p47phox, pREP10/p67phox, and pCEP4/p40phox (or pCEP4CAT (control)) plasmids. Immunoblotting of protein lysates from hygromycin-resistant cells confirmed expression of all three recombinant oxidase proteins in these experiments (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Oxidase activity in response to PMA activation was monitored by chemiluminescence. Four independent co-transfection experiments were performed and the results of one representative experiment are shown in Fig. 3. A significant inhibition of oxidase activity was observed in the presence of p40phox, typically resulting in 35-40% reduction in chemiluminescence signals in comparison to control transfections with pCEP4CAT (Fig. 3). The extent of oxidase inhibition attributed to p40phox expression was significant when considering that this vector lacks a unique selection marker. Since the levels of p47phox and p67phox detected were comparable in cells expressing p40phox or CAT (Fig. 3, inset), variable expression of the other oxidase components did not account for the reduced oxidase activity in the presence of p40phox. While the yield of active oxidase in the presence of p40phox based on the magnitude of the chemiluminescence peak was consistently diminished, the overall kinetic profiles of PMA-elicited respiratory bursts appeared to be similar to control reactions, showing maximum activity 5-10 min after stimulation. The effects of p40phox on NADPH oxidase activity reconstituted in vitro were examined following preincubation of recombinant baculovirus-derived p40phox lysates with one or the other pure cytosolic factors (p67phox, p47phox). Measurements of superoxide production in a system containing recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and p21rac1 (Q61L) showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of oxidase activity associated with increasing amounts of p40phox Sf9 cell lysates, in comparison with the same quantities of lysates from uninfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 4). These inhibitory effects were evident irrespective of the order of addition of the other cytosolic factors shown to bind p40phox. Predictably, low levels of oxidase inhibition (<25%) were also seen with excessive amounts of control uninfected lysates, although these effects were likely due to effects of high protein concentrations on free arachidonate levels. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to delineate interacting domains within cytosolic oxidase proteins that were shown to exist as a complex in resting neutrophils (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar, 6Someya A. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Google Scholar, 7Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O.

This system has advantages over other in vitro binding assays, since the interactions between proteins occurs in vivo and no protein purification or renaturation from SDS-PAGE gels is required (31Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Field S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 99: 9578-9582Google Scholar, 32Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Google Scholar, 33Bartel Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar). While the system permits qualitative assessment of weak protein-protein interactions (Kd < ∼10−6 M), quantitative binding data are not obtained by this approach. The p40phox cDNA sequences corresponding to various domains tested were subcloned into activation domain vectors pGADGH or pGAD424. Coding sequences for p67phox and p47phox domains were engineered in frame with the Gal4 binding domain in pGBT9. As summarized in Table I, a positive interaction was observed between full-length p40phox and p67phox, which was abolished by deletion of 80 residues from the carboxyl-terminal end of p40phox (p40ΔCT). Consistent with this, residues 260-340 (CT) of p40phox were sufficient to observe an interaction with full-length p67phox. The corresponding domain of p67phox that interacts with p40phox was identified within a 172-residue segment (residues 293-465) bounded by the two SH3 domains, consistent with similar two-hybrid studies reported recently (22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar). The interaction between p40CT and residues 293-465 of p67phox was also confirmed when these cDNAs were expressed in the reciprocal vectors (data not shown). There was no evidence for interaction between the isolated SH3 domain of p40phox and full-length p67phox or p67NT (residues 1-246), although a weak positive signal detected in a prolonged β-galactosidase assay was observed with co-expression of full-length p40phox and the amino-terminal domain (246 residues) of p67phox (NT) or a smaller fragment (residues 155-246, data not shown). Others have characterized an interaction between 67 NT and p40phox by surface plasmon resonance, although binding of residues 293-465 of p67phox with p40phox was not examined in this case (24Weintjes F.B. Panayotou G. Reeves O. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 919-924Google Scholar). The interaction between p40phox and p47phox was mapped to the SH3 domain (residues 172-229) of p40phox and the proline-rich tail region (residues 351-390) of p47phox, consistent with yeast two-hybrid experiments reported elsewhere (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar, 22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar, 23Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Google Scholar). An SH3 domain interaction between GRB-2 and human SOS-1 was also demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid expression (33Bartel Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar). The p40phox SH3 domain interaction with the C-terminal domain of p47phox was confirmed by expression in reciprocal vectors (data not shown). To explore the significance of interactions between p40phox and other essential components on whole cell NADPH oxidase function, truncated forms of p40phox were co-expressed in the episomal vector pCEP4 along with full-length p47phox and p67phox; this work used the deleted form of p40phox, p40ΔCT, lacking the p67phox binding domain (C-terminal 80 residues) and pCEP40SH3, encoding the isolated SH3 domain that interacts with p47 phox. As shown in Fig. 5, there was no significant difference between oxidase activity observed in cells expressing full-length p40phox or p40phoxΔCT, indicating that the oxidase inhibitory effects of p40phox do not involve the p67phox interaction. In contrast, expression of the isolated SH3 domain of p40phox, which we and others (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar, 22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar, 23Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Google Scholar) have shown interacts with the proline-rich C terminus of p47phox, resulted in inhibition of oxidase activity that was even greater than observed with full-length p40phox (60% versus 35% inhibition, respectively). Previous studies using purified proteins establish five core NADPH oxidase components as necessary and sufficient for reconstitution of high levels of oxidase activity in vitro (26Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Google Scholar, 27Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Google Scholar). Recently, p40phox was identified in resting neutrophil cytosol as yet another protein bound within a high molecular complex (∼250 kDa) with two essential cytosolic components, p67phox and p47phox. The three proteins appear to co-translocate to the membrane as a complex that interacts with cytochrome b558 during oxidase activation (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar, 9Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1996; 308: 991-994Google Scholar). We have now shown that p40phox can significantly inhibit oxidase activity, whether added to the other cytosolic components in a cell-free assay system or when co-transfected into K-562 cells which lack the endogenous protein. These studies confirm and extend the findings of others by defining precise binding sites between the cytosolic oxidase factors and exploring the role of p40phox in whole cell oxidase function. Work in several laboratories suggested that the primary association in this cytosolic oxidase complex occurs between p67phox and p40phox. In vitro binding studies suggested that the entire pool of cytosolic p40phox was bound in a tight complex with p67phox in resting neutrophils (6Someya A. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Google Scholar, 7Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O. Kuratsuji T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Google Scholar). Deficiencies in either p47phox or p67phox seen in autosomal recessive forms of CGD resulted in diminished translocation of p40phox to the membrane (9Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1996; 308: 991-994Google Scholar), although only the patients deficient in p67phox showed dramatically reduced levels of total cellular p40phox, suggesting that p67phox stabilizes p40phox in neutrophils. Direct interactions have also been demonstrated between p47phox and p40phox, although these interactions were not readily detected by methods involving immobilized proteins, such as surface plasmon resonance or blotting techniques (8Leusen J.H.W. Fluiter K. Hilarius P.M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11216-11221Google Scholar, 24Weintjes F.B. Panayotou G. Reeves O. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 919-924Google Scholar). We detected this interaction in solution with recombinant fusion proteins and in the yeast two-hybrid system, as shown by others (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar, 22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar, 23Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Google Scholar). Early work identified p40phox by two-hybrid interactions using p47phox as bait to screen a cDNA library from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cells (23Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Google Scholar). The importance of the p47phox interaction is evident in our current findings which correlate delineation of binding sites in p40phox with whole cell oxidase function. The p40phox interaction with p47phox was critical for inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, while deletion of the p67phox binding site in p40phox did not affect its ability to inhibit oxidase activity in whole cells. These observations were not reconciled with recent findings showing in vitro inhibition of the oxidase by antibodies directed against p40phox (C-terminal, p67phox-binding domain), although these investigators did not study the proteins directly (25Tsunawaki S. Kagara S. Yoshikawa Yoshida L.C. Tadatoshi K. Namiki H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 893-902Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase inhibition we observed by p40phox is thought to involve the interaction between its SH3 domain and a target within p47phox previously shown to participate in assembly of p67phox in the active oxidase complex (12Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9: 10650-10654Google Scholar, 13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar, 14Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 241aGoogle Scholar). The isolated SH3 domain of p40phox inhibited whole cell oxidase activity to an extent that exceeded the inhibition by full-length p40phox. The demonstration of an interaction between the SH3 domain of p40phox and the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of p47phox (residues 358-390) was supported by earlier work in which p47phox was shown to bind to a central 115-residue segment of p40phox, half of which included the SH3 domain (22Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 39-47Google Scholar, 23Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Google Scholar). More recent studies showed the SH3 domain of p40phox binds to the proline-rich tail region of p47phox and thereby inhibits binding of the C-terminal p67phox SH3 domain to the same region p47phox, when over-expressed in yeast (21Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Google Scholar). These authors suggested that competitive binding between p40phox and p67phox could modulate oxidase activity. Our observations of inhibitory effects of p40phox or its isolated SH3 domain on whole cell oxidase function lend further support to this competitive binding model. Our results also provide additional evidence for the importance of the tail-tail interaction between p47phox and p67phox in oxidase activation. The role of this C-terminal domain interaction had been disputed because neither tail domain was necessary for cell-free reconstitution of NADPH oxidase activity (8Leusen J.H.W. Fluiter K. Hilarius P.M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11216-11221Google Scholar, 13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar). However, work in whole transfected cells showed that deletions or mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domains of either protein dramatically affected whole cell oxidase activity and p67phox membrane translocation (13de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar, 16de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Google Scholar, 18Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 241aGoogle Scholar). Since the tail-tail interaction is not essential for cell-free oxidase activity and cell-free oxidase inhibition was not influenced by the order of addition of the three cytosolic proteins, it is unclear whether p40phox inhibits the cell-free system by the same mechanism suggested from the whole cell studies. In summary, we have examined the role of interactions between p40phox and two other essential oxidase components, both in vitro and in transfected cells where expression of NADPH oxidase components could be genetically manipulated. Based on these findings, we suggest a model outlined in Fig. 6 in which clear distinctions can be made in terms of function between two interactions of p40phox. In one case, the interaction of p40phox with p67phox appears to play no obvious role in the oxidase activation process, although its importance is evident in neutrophils where p40phox stability is affected by the absence of p67phox seen in CGD (5Wientjes F. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar, 7Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O. Kuratsuji T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1996; 308: 991-994Google Scholar). In the second, the interaction between p47phox and p40phox is not readily detected in resting neutrophil cytosol but was shown to play a predominant role during activation through its inhibition of productive interactions between two other essential oxidase components. These findings again illustrate the central role played by multiple SH3 domain interactions in modulation of NADPH oxidase activity. In this case, we demonstrated down-regulation by an accessory SH3 domain-containing protein (p40phox), which by virtue of its homology to one essential oxidase component (p67phox) competes for a common target site on another. This SH3 target site in p47phox is flanked by sites that were recently shown to be phosphorylated during oxidase activation (35El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Google Scholar). Future work will examine whether phosphorylation alters binding affinities of these competing SH3 domains and whether these changes are critical in the activation process. We thank Dr. C. K. Kwong for providing the Rac61L vector and Dr. H. L. Malech for providing the gp91phox retrovirus."

INTRODUCTIONTissue type II transglutaminase (R-glutaminylpeptide: amine γ-glutamyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.13) is a member of the transglutaminase family that catalyzes Ca2+-dependent acyl transfer reactions between γ-carboxamide groups of the Gln residues in peptides and either primary amines or ϵ-amino groups of the Lys residues in peptides, resulting in the formation of new γ-amides of glutamic acid or ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds and ammonia (1Lorand L.

PTN has been shown to be mitogenic for endothelial cells (26Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

MK is highly expressed in many human cancers (31Tsutsui J. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara S. Nakagawara A. Hamanoue M. Takao S. Shimazu H. Ohi Y. Muramatsu T.

Growth & Diff. 1994; 36: 1-8Google Scholar, 16Kurtz A. Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1995; 6: 151-177Google Scholar). MK is a 13-kDa heparin-binding polypeptide rich in basic amino acids and cysteine (17Kadomatsu K. Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1312-1318Google Scholar, 34Tomomura M. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara S. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10765-10770Google Scholar), and exhibits 46% sequence identity with PTN (15Muramatsu T. Dev. Growth & Diff. 1994; 36: 1-8Google Scholar). Both MK and PTN are largely composed of two domains, called the N-half (N1/2; Lys1-Gly59 in human MK) and the C-half (C1/2; Ala60-Asp121 in human MK), each of which contains a couple of intra-disulfide linkages (35Fabri L. Nice E.C. Ward L.D. Maruta H. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 1-9Google Scholar, 36Fabri L. Maruta H. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 213-225Google Scholar). Of these two domains C1/2 is responsible for heparin-binding, neurite outgrowth-promoting, and PA-enhancing activities (37Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Song X. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1131-1139Google Scholar, 38Kojima S. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 468-473Google Scholar).During the course of studying the PA-enhancing properties of MK, we discovered that MK serves as a good substrate for tissue transglutaminase (22Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Google Scholar). BAECs constitutively produce and secrete MK, which forms a transglutaminase-mediated complex in cultures. Prior to this discovery, a 29-kDa MK-related protein, which is now recognized as a dimer of MK, had been detected in a variety of tissues, such as the lymphonode, spleen, testis, small intestine, stomach, lung, kidney, and liver (39Muramatsu H. Shirahama H. Yonezawa S. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 392-402Google Scholar). Furthermore, Haynes and colleagues (40Perry M.J.M. Mahoney S.-A. Haynes L.W. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 1063-1076Google Scholar, 41Mahoney S.-A. Perry M. Seddon A. Bohlen P. Haynes L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 147-152Google Scholar) reported similar dimer formation by MK in the developing brain. These lines of accumulating evidence suggest that the cross-linking of MK by tissue transglutaminase may occur and play an important role in MK biology in vivoIn the current study, we have investigated the mechanism underlying the transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking reaction and the relevance of dimer formation to MK activity.DISCUSSIONRetinol (vitamin A) and its derivatives (retinoids) have profound effects on the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (44Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar). Using BAEC cultures, we found that retinoids induce the production of PA (45Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. Schleuning W.-D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 177-183Google Scholar), transglutaminase (46Nara K. Nakanishi K. Hagiwara H. Wakita K. Kojima S. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19308-19312Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; 47Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 323-332Google Scholar), and MK (22Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Google Scholar), and that these retinoic acid-inducible factors interact with each other. In retinoic acid-treated BAECs, PA and transglutaminase are required to promote the activation of latent TGF-β (11Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Google Scholar, 47Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 323-332Google Scholar), whereas MK and TGF-β regulate PA activity, respectively, in the opposite way (11Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Google Scholar, 22Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Google Scholar). The present paper describes an additional relationship between transglutaminase and MK.MK was proved to be an excellent substrate for transglutaminase in that 1 mol of MK incorporated as much as 2 mol of [14C]putrescine. MK formed the dimer, tetramer, and hexamer on incubation with transglutaminase. Among multimers dimer seemed to be dominant. Whereas the results in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 suggest that Gln42 and Gln44 in N1/2 as well as Gln95 in C1/2 may function as potential amine-accepting sites, the results in Fig. 3 suggest the existence of one Gln site in each of N1/2 and C1/2. The most likely explanation for this difference is that although both Gln42 and Gln44 are competent enough to serve as amine-accepting sites, only one of them is exposed to the surface of the MK molecule. The second likely explanation is that Gln42 and Gln44 serve heterogeneously as amine-accepting sites. Namely, when Gln42 is used to form an ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bridge between a Lys residue in another MK molecule, or putrescine in the present experiment, neighboring Gln44 becomes inaccessible for further bridge formation due to stereohindrance by the MK molecule cross-linked to Gln42. Conversely, when Gln44 is cross-linked to another MK molecule, Gln42 becomes no longer accessible. Stereohindrance will also happen when Factor XIIIa is used as the enzyme. As Factor XIIIa is larger than tissue transglutaminase (∼300 kDa versus 80 kDa), the cross-linking of MK molecules may not be performed by Factor XIIIa, even though it can stimulate putrescine incorporation into MK molecules. It is notable that these three acyl-donating Gln residues are conserved among the MK/PTN family, whereas the other two Gln residues are not (48Sekiguchi K. Yokota C. Asashima M. Kaname T. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 94-100Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, the dimer and tetramer of MK C1/2 migrated slower than those of N1/2. This might be due to that C1/2 is much more highly charged being basic. The three-dimensional structure of MK C1/2 recently clarified by NMR spectroscopy 2F. Inagaki, personal communication. is consistent with the results of the present investigation. In C1/2, basic amino acids, which are expected to form the heparin binding site (Arg81, Lys86, and Lys87), are clustered on one side. Site-directed mutagenesis of these amino acids resulted in decreased heparin-binding and neurite-promoting activities. 3N. Asai, unpublished result. Gln95, which was shown to be involved in the dimerization, is located on the opposite side. This distinct localization of the heparin binding site and the cross-linking site will permit the cross-linking between two MK molecules after binding to heparin. Thus, heparin may potentiate the cross-linking with transglutaminase by stabilizing the conformation of dimer. In addition, heparin increases the amount of products, too, by preventing the loss of MK molecules from the reaction mixture that happens due to static adherence of MK molecules to the vessel wall (43Kojima S. Inui T. Muramatsu H. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 574-581Google Scholar). Because of this reason and because we supposed the physiological reaction on the cell surface as discussed below, we analyzed the dimer formation in the presence of heparin. We are currently trying to determine the amine-donating Lys sites in the MK molecule. It is also of great importance to clarify the structural requirements for the substrate for transglutaminase, i.e. the role of flanking sequences in the Ala41-Pro51 peptide, and to compare it with the result obtained with fibronectin-derived sequence (49Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Wilson J. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8472-8475Google Scholar).We have concluded that dimerization of MK by cell surface transglutaminase potentiates MK activity, based upon the fact that the Ala41-Pro51 peptide inhibits both the cross-linking and PA-enhancing activity of the MK monomer, with a double mutated peptide as an inactive control. We did not obtain additional proof utilizing an anti-transglutaminase antibody, because the antibody could inhibit the formation of TGF-β, which counteracts MK activity (22Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Google Scholar). Since the activation of latent TGF-β is required for transglutaminase to localize latent TGF-β on the surface, the inclusion of an anti-transglutaminase antibody in the culture medium prevents the formation of active TGF-β (11Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Google Scholar). Hence, the peptide was a strong tool to prove our hypothesis, although the specificity of the inhibition by the peptide was critical to obtain a conclusion. As a receptor interacting site(s) is located in C1/2 (37Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Song X. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1131-1139Google Scholar, 38Kojima S. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 468-473Google Scholar), there is a low possibility that the Ala41-Pro51 peptide competes with the binding of MK to its receptor(s). Actually, the dimer exerted the PA-enhancing activity in the presence of this peptide. As Factor XIIIa functions only in putrescine incorporation, it is possible that Factor XIIIa might be used to cross-link peptide to MK molecule, serving as a control for this issue. It is true that when the PA-enhancing effect of the MK monomer is blocked by Ala41-Pro51, cross-linking of the MK monomer, especially formation of the dimer, is suppressed completely. However, it is possible that other transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking reactions were affected by the Ala41-Pro51 peptide, and that this caused the inhibition of MK activity by the peptide. In this context, we need to examine the specificity of the inhibition by this peptide. Although the peptide inhibited the cross-linking of intact MK, N1/2, and C1/2 by 80% at a concentration of as much as a 50-fold molar excess, a 200-fold molar excess of this peptide caused only weak (less than 5%) inhibition of the cross-linking of pro-SPAI (data not shown; 10Nara K. Ito S. Ito T. Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Google Scholar). We are now investigating whether the peptide affects the cross-linking of other hitherto known substrates for transglutaminase. Nevertheless, we believe that the present conclusion is correct, because in the experiment in Fig. 9, whether an inhibitory effect of the peptide was observed or not depended only upon whether activity was derived from the monomer or dimer, and all other conditions were the same. Therefore, no matter what other cross-linking this peptide may interfere with, or if MK is cross-linked to other proteins such as matrix components and if the peptide blocks such cross-linking, we think that the results in Fig. 9 strongly suggest the relevance of the formation of the MK dimer.The formation of the non-covalently associated dimer and other multimers explains why the MK monomer has always been detected on Western blotting, even on incubation with transglutaminase overnight. The Ala41-Pro51 peptide inhibited both the cross-linking and the non-covalent association through being incorporated into the Lys sites of MK molecules by transglutaminase. It appears that the peptide cannot dissociate the dimer once formed via either covalent cross-linking or even non-covalent association, as the peptide did not affect the PA-enhancing activity in the dimer fraction (Fig. 9). Once non-covalent association occurs between MK molecules, the cross-linking sites are supposed to be hidden, and thus the MK molecules might no longer act as a substrate for transglutaminase. Therefore, the non-covalently associated dimer co-existed with the cross-linked dimer, and the peptide was not cross-linked to the non-covalently associated dimer and, thus, did not affect its activity. We cannot explain why in the presence of Ala41-Pro51, the peak of the mixture of the tetramer and hexamer split into the hexamer and tetramer (Fig. 10); nor can we explain why the peptide did not inhibit non-covalent formation of the hexamer and tetramer completely, although the peptide inhibited the formation of the dimer completely. The non-covalent association may be apt to occur when the concentration of MK is unphysiologically high. At a physiological concentration, the chances of MK associating non-covalently will be low, whereas cross-linking may occur at sites where transglutaminase is exposed. Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 suggest that dimer/oligomer formation alone is sufficient to stimulate increases in PA-enhancing activity and that binding of MK to cells via cell surface transglutaminase is not necessary. However, since plasma Factor XIIIa is not able to cross-link MK molecules and tissue transglutaminase is not released from the cells (46Nara K. Nakanishi K. Hagiwara H. Wakita K. Kojima S. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19308-19312Google Scholar), the surface reaction may be physiologically most important. The susceptibility of MK to transglutaminase suggests a mechanism whereby the interaction of MK with surface receptors and other surface-oriented structures could be enzymatically altered. Tissue transglutaminase is distributed mainly intracellularly and partially on the cell surface (11Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Google Scholar, 46Nara K. Nakanishi K. Hagiwara H. Wakita K. Kojima S. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19308-19312Google Scholar), suggesting either that newly synthesized MK is cross-linked before secretion or that secreted MK is cross-linked on the cell surface as discussed above. The results in Fig. 2 suggest that the latter reaction may proceed very efficiently with the aid of heparan sulfate present on the cell surface. Recently, it was reported that hetero- or homodimerization of cytokine and hormone receptors is important for the emission of signals inside cells (50Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar, 51Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Google Scholar). Together with the finding that the cross-linking is important for PA-enhancing activity, we imagine that the MK dimer, cross-linked on the cell surface, may activate its unidentified receptors by making them form the dimer. An experiment addressing this hypothesis is in progress.The current study provided additional evidence for the hypothesis concerning the mechanism whereby transglutaminase plays a role in the regulation of cellular physiology through the cross-linking of cytokines such as TGF-β (11Kojima S. Nara K. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Google Scholar), interleukin 2 (12Eitan S. Schwartz M. Science. 1993; 261: 106-108Google Scholar) and, now, MK. INTRODUCTIONTissue type II transglutaminase (R-glutaminylpeptide: amine γ-glutamyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.13) is a member of the transglutaminase family that catalyzes Ca2+-dependent acyl transfer reactions between γ-carboxamide groups of the Gln residues in peptides and either primary amines or ϵ-amino groups of the Lys residues in peptides, resulting in the formation of new γ-amides of glutamic acid or ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds and ammonia (1Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Google Scholar, 2Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Google Scholar). The molecular structure of tissue transglutaminase has been reported (3Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Google Scholar), its physiological function is not well established compared those of other members of the transglutaminase family, e.g. the formation of cross-linkages between fibrin molecules by plasma Factor XIIIa (1Lorand L.

Vasopressin, endothelin, bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate also stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Bombesin-induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation could be dissociated from both protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. In contrast, cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas by bombesin. Platelet-derived growth factor, at low concentrations (1-5 ng/ml), also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas via a pathway that depended on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. The phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in response to platelet-derived growth factor but not in response to neuropeptides, lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. All agonists that induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation also promoted the formation of a p130cas·Crk complex in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Thus, our results identified distinct signal transduction pathways that lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in the same cells and suggest that p130cas could play a role in mitogen-mediated signal transduction.

Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Google Scholar) also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the previously reported p130 substrate of pp60v-src (25Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Google Scholar, 29Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.-C.R. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 30Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Google Scholar). Subsequently, this protein has been shown to be closely related or identical to the most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Crk transformed cells (31Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Google Scholar, 32Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Google Scholar, 33Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Google Scholar). The molecular cloning of this p130 v-Crk associated substrate (p130cas) revealed an adaptor protein that contains an SH3 domain, proline-rich regions, and a cluster of 15 putative SH2-binding motifs; 9 of these are YD(V/T)P which corresponds to the binding motif for the Crk SH2 domain (33Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Google Scholar). The unique structure of p130cas suggests a role of this protein in assembling multiple SH2-containing proteins in signaling complexes. However, neither the signal transduction pathways leading to p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation nor the existence of signaling complexes involving p130cas have been identified in cells stimulated by mitogenic neuropeptides or other growth factors. In the present study we report that p130cas is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to bombesin, other neuropeptides, phorbol esters, bioactive lipids, and PDGF. Our findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and is stimulated through PI3′-kinase- and PKC-dependent and independent pathways. Furthermore, we also show that neuropeptides, bioactive lipids, and PDGF induce the formation of a complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas and c-Crk in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37°C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (1-2 × 106) were washed twice with DMEM, treated with bombesin or other factors in 10 ml of DMEM for the times indicated, and lysed at 4°C in 1 ml of a solution containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4°C for 14 h with anti-mouse IgG-agarose-linked mAb directed against anti-Tyr(P) (Py72), p130cas or c-Crk mAbs as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted for 10 min at 95°C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mM Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated for 2 h at 22°C with either the anti-Tyr(P) mAb (4G10, 1 μg/ml) or the anti-p130cas mAb (1 μg/ml) as indicated. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer, and labeled bands were quantified using an Ultrascan XL internal integrator. The values were expressed as percentages of the maximum increase in tyrosine phosphorylation above control values. Phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms were down-regulated in Swiss 3T3 cells by prolonged pretreatment with PDB (34Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 152: 240-244Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez P.A. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 77-83Google Scholar). In the present study, confluent and quiescent cultures were pretreated with 800 nM PDB for 48 h in conditioned medium, which was depleted of growth-promoting activity. Bombesin, vasopressin, endothelin, bradykinin, SPC, LPA, PDB, cytochalasin D, wortmannin, and agarose-linked anti-mouse IgG were obtained from the Sigma. Recombinant PDGF (BB homodimer) and 125I-sheep anti-mouse IgG (15 mCi/mg) were from Amersham, UK. The PKC inhibitor GF 109203X and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). The 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAb was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, New York). The anti-Tyr(P) mAb Py72 was obtained from the hybridoma development unit, Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The mAbs directed against p130cas or c-Crk were from Transduction Laboratories. LY294002 was provided by Dr. S. Cartlidge, Zeneca, UK. Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10 nM bombesin for 10 min, a concentration and a time that causes maximum stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation (7Zachary I. Gil J. Lehmann W. Sinett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4577-4581Google Scholar, 8Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24126-24133Google Scholar, 13Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Google Scholar), and lysed. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with p130cas mAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, bombesin caused a striking increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (5.6 ± 0.8 fold; n = 12). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas by bombesin was also demonstrated when the cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-p130cas mAb and then analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation using anti-p130cas mAb followed by Western blotting with the same antibody showed that the recovery of p130cas from cell lysates was not altered by treatment with bombesin. Other mitogenic neuropeptides such as vasopressin, endothelin, and bradykinin, and the bioactive lipids SPC and LPA, elicit a pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands similar to that induced by bombesin, including a broad band migrating in the Mr 110,00-130,000 range (13Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Google Scholar, 16Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Google Scholar, 17Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24343-24351Google Scholar). To examine the effect of these stimuli on p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, Swiss 3T3 cells were treated for 10 min with 20 nM vasopressin, 10 nM endothelin, 20 nM bradykinin, 2 μM LPA, or 5 μM SPC and lysed. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and the immunoprecipitates analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p130cas mAb. As shown in Fig. 1B, all of these agonists induced a marked increase in p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of bombesin on p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, as revealed by anti-p130cas immunoblotting of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates, was concentration- and time-dependent. Half-maximum and maximum effects were achieved at 0.3 and 10 nM, respectively (Fig. 2, left panel). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas could be detected as early as 30 s after addition of 10 nM bombesin, reaching a maximum after 1-2.5 min (Fig. 2, right panel). Thereafter, p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation declined but remained above base-line levels for at least 1 h. Activation of PKC and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores are two prominent early signals elicited by mitogenic neuropeptides and bioactive lipids (17Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24343-24351Google Scholar, 36Rozengurt E. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 397-398Google Scholar). In addition, direct activation of PKC increases tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates migrating in the Mr 110,000-130,000 range in Swiss 3T3 cells. Consequently, we examined the possibility that these early events mediated bombesin-induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), direct activation of PKC by PDB enhanced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. An increase was detectable after 1 min, reached a maximum after 5 min, and remained elevated for at least 1 h (not shown). To investigate the involvement of PKC activation in bombesin-induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, PKC was selectively inhibited by pretreatment of quiescent cells with 3.5 μM GF109203X for 1 h (37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with either 10 nM bombesin or 200 nM PDB for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 3 (central panel), pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with GF 109203X blocked PDB stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas was not prevented by pretreatment with 3.5 μM GF109203X. Identical results were obtained when the cells were challenged with bombesin or PDB for 2.5 min instead of 10 min (Fig. 3, central panel, inset). Similarly, down-regulation of phorbol ester-sensitive isoforms of PKC markedly reduced the effect of PDB but did not prevent bombesin stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Next, we investigated the role of [Ca2+]i in bombesin stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation using the tumor promoter thapsigargin. This agent specifically inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and thereby depletes Ca2+ from intracellular compartments (38Thastrup O. Linnebjerg H. Bjerrum P.J. Knudsen J.B. Christensen S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 65-73Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (lower panel), pretreatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 with 30 nM thapsigargin for 30 min did not have any effect on bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas but blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i by bombesin (data not shown). Thus, neither PKC activation nor Ca2+ mobilization is responsible for the rapid bombesin-induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells. As p130cas is localized at focal adhesion plaques (39Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Google Scholar, 40Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Google Scholar), the distinct sites on the plasma membrane where actin stress fibers emanate, we examined whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton could interfere with p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by bombesin. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of cytochalasin D and then stimulated with 10 nM bombesin for another 10 min. As shown in Fig. 4, cytochalasin D blocked bombesin stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner; half-maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 0.4 μM and a maximum effect was achieved at 1 μM, a concentration that is known to completely disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and the assembly of focal adhesions in Swiss 3T3 cells. The drug also inhibited PDB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (Fig. 4, inset). Thus, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for PKC-dependent and PKC-independent signal transduction pathways leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. p130cas has a cluster of 15 potential SH2-binding motifs, nine of these are YDXP sequences that are expected to have a preferential affinity for Crk-SH2 domain (33Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas could lead to the formation of a complex between endogenous c-Crk and p130cas in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Anti-p130cas Western blotting of c-Crk immunoprecipitates revealed that bombesin stimulated an association of p130cas with c-Crk (Fig. 5A). We verified that similar amounts of c-Crk were recovered from lysates of cells treated without or with bombesin. The association of p130cas with c-Crk reached a maximum after 1 min of bombesin stimulation then declined, remaining at about 50% of the maximum level for the next 10 min (Fig. 5B). Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with vasopressin, endothelin, LPA, SPC, or PDB, all of which induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (Fig. 1), also induced complex formation between p130cas and c-Crk (Fig. 5C). To assess whether the complex formation between p130cas and Crk depended on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated for 2 h with or without 1.2 μM cytochalasin D and then stimulated with 10 nM bombesin. Fig. 5D shows that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with cytochalasin D, at a concentration shown in Fig. 4 to inhibit p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, prevented the association of p130cas with c-Crk induced by bombesin. Thus, mitogenic neuropeptides and bioactive lipids induce rapid association of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas with c-Crk in Swiss 3T3 cells. Next, we examined the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas by PDGF BB, which binds to the PDGF receptor a and b chains in Swiss 3T3 cells (41Seifert R.A. Hart C.E. Phillips P.E. Forstrom J.W. Ross R. Murray M.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8771-8778Google Scholar, 42Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Yu J.-C. Lombardi D. Artrip J.E. Fleming T.P. Thomason A. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20232-20237Google Scholar). PDGF caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (Fig. 6A). Maximum response was observed at 5 ng/ml PDGF. At higher concentrations of PDGF the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas was drastically reduced. PDGF, at 5 ng/ml, also induced the formation of a complex between p130cas and c-Crk (Fig. 6B). PDGF, at low concentrations, is known to stimulate the accumulation of actin into membrane ruffles, and at higher concentrations PDGF induced actin disorganization and focal adhesion disassembly (18Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Google Scholar). Thus, the bell-shaped dose-response curve of PDGF on tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas could be explained by the ability of PDGF (at high concentrations) to disrupt actin organization and focal adhesion formation in Swiss 3T3 cells. In accord with this interpretation, disruption of actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D prevented the increase in p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 5 ng/ml PDGF (Fig. 6A, inset). Treatment with cytochalasin D also inhibited the formation of a complex between p130cas and c-Crk (Fig. 6B). Since high concentrations of PDGF disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (18Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PDGF at 30 ng/ml on bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas was determined in cells treated with 10 nM bombesin for 20 min either in the absence or presence of 5 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml PDGF. PDGF at 30 ng/ml but not at 5 ng/ml completely inhibited p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation by bombesin (Fig. 6C). PDGF, at low concentrations, induces the recruitment of actin into membrane ruffles through a PI3′-kinase-dependent signaling pathway (43Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidisson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Walsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660Google Scholar, 44Wennström S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Google Scholar, 45Wymanin M. Arcaro A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 517-520Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the role of PI3′-kinase in PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in Swiss 3T3 cells. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were treated for 20 min with wortmannin, which binds to and inhibits the catalytic (110 kDa) subunit of PI3′-kinase (46Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Google Scholar, 47Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Google Scholar), at concentrations (0-40 nM) that inhibit PI3′-kinase activity and actin cytoskeleton reorganization in PDGF-treated Swiss 3T3 cells (27Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7829-7834Google Scholar). The cells were then stimulated with 3 ng/ml PDGF for a further 10 min. As shown in Fig. 7A), wortmannin induced a striking dose-dependent inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in response to 3 ng/ml PDGF. At 40 nM, wortmannin inhibited PDGF-stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation by 90%. In contrast to PDGF, bombesin acts through a seven transmembrane receptor that does not stimulate PI3′-kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells (7Zachary I. Gil J. Lehmann W. Sinett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4577-4581Google Scholar, 48Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Google Scholar, 49Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Google Scholar). Hence, bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas should not be inhibited by wortmannin in these cells. As shown in Fig. 7A, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas stimulated by 10 nM bombesin was not inhibited by preincubation of the cells with wortmannin up to 40 nM. Wortmannin, therefore, differentially inhibited PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, while having no effect on bombesin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of this substrate. To extend the results presented above we examined the effect of wortmannin on p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation in response to other neuropeptides and bioactive lipids. Fig. 7B shows that in contrast to the result obtained with PDGF, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas induced by vasopressin, endothelin, LPA, and SPC was not affected by pretreatment with 40 nM wortmannin. To substantiate the results obtained with wortmannin, we examined if a structurally unrelated compound, LY294002 (a flavonoid related to quercetin), which inhibits PI3′-kinase by a distinct mechanism (50Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar) also prevents PDGF-stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation in a selective manner. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were preincubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of LY94002 (0-10 μM) and then stimulated with either 3 ng/ml PDGF or 10 nM bombesin for further 10 min. As shown in Fig. 7C, pretreatment with LY294002 inhibited p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, LY294002 did not affect p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation in response to bombesin. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas can be stimulated through a PI3′-kinase-dependent and -independent pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells. The findings presented here demonstrate that p130cas is a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated by bombesin, vasopressin, endothelin, and bradykinin. The rapidity of bombesin-induced p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that this event may be functionally important in the action of this neuropeptide. In addition, the bioactive lipids LPA and SPC that are thought to act through G protein-coupled receptors (51Van der Bend R. Bruner J. Jalink K. Van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.E. Van Blitterswijk W.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2495-2501Google Scholar, 52Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24334-24342Google Scholar) also induce p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. At present very little is known about the signaling pathways that link the bombesin receptors to tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Bombesin and other neuropeptides are known to induce the rapid hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides to generate the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which activate PKC and mobilize Ca2+, respectively. As shown in the present study, direct activation of PKC by addition of PDB also stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, PKC activation is a potential signaling pathway that could mediate bombesin stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. However, our results indicate that bombesin stimulates p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation through a signal transduction pathway that is independent of either PKC activation or Ca2+ mobilization. Bombesin, endothelin, LPA, and SPC have been shown to induce a rapid increase in stress fibers and in focal adhesions (17Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24343-24351Google Scholar, 53Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Google Scholar), an effect apparently mediated by Rho (54Miura Y. Kikuchi A. Musha T. Kuroda S. Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 510-515Google Scholar, 55Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar), which belongs to the Ras-related small G protein superfamily (56Hall A. Science. 1990; 249: 635-640Google Scholar). Focal adhesions that form at the termini of actin stress fibers are thought to play a central role in the processes that regulate cell adhesion and motility (57Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 7: 337-374Google Scholar). In view of the localization of p130cas in the focal adhesions (39Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Google Scholar) and recent findings that integrin activation also leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein (39Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Google Scholar, 40Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Google Scholar, 58Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Google Scholar), we examined whether the actin cytoskeleton played a role in bombesin stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results with cytochalasin D indicate that the maintenance of cytoskeletal organization is essential for the stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. PDGF, at low concentrations (5 ng/ml), also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas through a pathway that is critically dependent on the integrity of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions. The structurally unrelated PI3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (46Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Google Scholar, 47Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Google Scholar) and LY294002 (50Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar) prevented PDGF-mediated stimulation of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, implicating a PI3′-kinase-dependent pathway in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. It has been demonstrated that PI3′-kinase activation is required for the formation of membrane ruffles and that the small G protein Rac lies downstream of PI3′-kinase (49Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Google Scholar, 60Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qui R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Google Scholar). Activated Rac has been shown to direct the formation of membrane ruffles and the assembly of focal adhesions (55Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of a linear signal transduction pathway in the action of PDGF involving PI3′-kinase and Rac that leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Our results also demonstrate that the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas induced by bombesin, vasopressin, endothelin, LPA, and SPC is not prevented by either wortmannin or LY294002 at concentrations that profoundly inhibited p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF. We conclude that there is a PI3′ kinase-dependent and a PI3′-kinase-independent signal transduction pathway stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in the same cells. Similar to the data reported here, bombesin-induced p125fak and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation also occurs through a PKC, Ca2+, and PI3′ kinase-independent pathway, which is critically dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton (14Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Google Scholar, 15Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Google Scholar, 27Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7829-7834Google Scholar, 53Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of PI3′-kinase has been recently identified as an important step in the signal transduction pathway that links the PDGF receptor with the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin (27Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7829-7834Google Scholar). In addition, bombesin and PDGF stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation at concentrations that parallel those required to induce p125fak and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation (14Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Google Scholar, 15Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Google Scholar). We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, p125fak, and paxillin are coordinately regulated. In agreement with this conclusion, it has been demonstrated that p130cas associates directly with p125fak (61Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Google Scholar, 62Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Google Scholar) and that the major site of p125fak autophosphorylation (Tyr-397) binds the SH2 domain of Src (63Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Google Scholar), a kinase implicated in the phosphorylation of p130cas (33Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Google Scholar, 58Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2607-2613Google Scholar) that is rapidly and transiently activated by bombesin, vasopressin, and bradykinin in Swiss 3T3 cells (64Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Google Scholar). The molecular cloning and sequencing of p130cas revealed a novel SH3-containing signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding sites for Crk and Src. This suggests that tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas may serve to promote the assembly of multiple SH2-containing molecules (33Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Google Scholar). Indeed, recent reports have shown that integrin-dependent cell adhesion can induce a SH2-mediated association of c-Crk with p130cas (58Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2607-2613Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that mitogenic neuropeptides, bioactive lipids, and PDGF induce the formation of a p130cas·Crk complex in intact Swiss 3T3 cells that is dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. The interaction between p130cas and c-Crk may be important in regulating the subcellular distribution of Crk or the activity of new downstream effectors in neuropeptide signal transduction pathways. Crk binds to a number of signaling proteins through its SH3 domain including C3G (65Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Google Scholar, 66Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Google Scholar), a small GTP-binding protein that induces mitogenesis in Swiss 3T3 cells (68Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Google Scholar). Interestingly, constitutive activation of Rap-1 has been suggested to lead to tumors in patients with tuberous sclerosis (69Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Google Scholar). The possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas plays a role in mitogenic signaling is attractive and warrants further experimental work. We thank Dr. T. Seufferlein and J. Sinnet-Smith for valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2045479963,"We show that unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) bind reversibly and with high affinity to a heterocomplex of 34 kDa (FA-p34) formed by the non-covalent association of two calcium-binding proteins of the S100 family: MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9). Fatty acid-competition studies on the [3H]oleic acid·FA-p34-complex show that oleic, α-linoleic, γ-linolenic, and arachidonic acids have IC50 values of about 1 μM, whereas palmitic and stearic acids are poor competitors. The binding of arachidonic acid is saturable with a single class of binding site per FA-p34, and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.13 μM is calculated. The individual subunits MRP8 and MRP14 show no binding properties for fatty acids, whereas a p34 complex reconstituted in vitro by the recombinant molecules exhibits binding properties, suggesting that the fatty acid-binding site of FA-p34 is created through heterocomplex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lowering free Ca2+ levels to 16 nM results in a loss of the fatty acid-binding capacity of purified FA-p34. In calcium-induced differentiating keratinocytes, the amounts of FA-p34 are increased in the particulate (2.0 ± 0.5 pmol of [3H]oleic acid/mg protein) and in the cytosolic (4.5 ± 0.6 pmol of [3H]oleic acid/mg protein) fractions, whereas no FA-p34 can be detected in non-differentiated cultured keratinocytes.In abnormally differentiated keratinocytes (psoriasis) and in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, FA-p34 is highly expressed (31.35 ± 1.6 and 349.8 ± 17.9 pmol of [3H]oleic acid/mg protein, respectively), pointing toward a role for this heteromer in mediating effects of unsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent way during cell differentiation and/or inflammation.

Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar). FAs are hydrophobic, labile molecules forming poor-soluble complexes with intracellular calcium ions, which are required for keratinocyte differentiation. Therefore, FAs need to be solubilized, stabilized, and translocated by specific carrier proteins (4Veerkamp J.H. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1995; 54: 23-37Google Scholar). Three distinct families of lipid-binding proteins, i.e. extracellular albumin, the cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (2Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Google Scholar, 3Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar) are thought to mediate the biological activities of FAs. Skin represents a very active lipid-synthesizing tissue in mammals. Two recent reports describe that human keratinocytes express the epidermal FABP, which is highly up-regulated in the hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin disease psoriasis (5Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honoré B. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 299-305Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 6Siegenthaler G. Hotz R. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Didierjean L. Hellman U.

The epidermis lacks the Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases (8Chapkin R.S. Ziboh V.A. Marcelo C.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1986; 27: 945-954Google Scholar), and, therefore, essential FAs like linoleic and arachidonic acid must be acquired from circulation. E-FABP binds stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid but has no affinity for arachidonic acid and a very low affinity for the nearby precursor, linolenic acid (6Siegenthaler G. Hotz R. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Didierjean L. Hellman U. Saurat J.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 363-371Google Scholar). Since no other FABPs have been detected in keratinocytes so far, we investigated whether a carrier protein, capable to bind unsaturated fatty acids like linolenic and arachidonic acid, might exist in psoriatic skin and cultured human keratinocytes.We characterized a fatty acid-binding heteromer of 34 kDa (FA-p34) isolated from human keratinocytes, which is composed of MRP8 (also referred to as cystic fibrosis antigen, the L1 light chain, p8, calgranulin A, S100A8) and MRP14 (L1 heavy chain, p14, calgranulin B, S100A9) (for a review, see 9Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Google Scholar). These proteins belong to the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins (reviewed in 10Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-447Google Scholar), and both molecules are highly up-regulated in psoriatic skin (5Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honoré B. Celis J.E. J. Invest.

Furthermore, for both molecules several post-translational modifications and the formation of high molecular weight complexes in vivo have been reported (15Edgeworth J. Gorman M. Bennett R.

Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar). FAs are hydrophobic, labile molecules forming poor-soluble complexes with intracellular calcium ions, which are required for keratinocyte differentiation. Therefore, FAs need to be solubilized, stabilized, and translocated by specific carrier proteins (4Veerkamp J.H. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1995; 54: 23-37Google Scholar). Three distinct families of lipid-binding proteins, i.e. extracellular albumin, the cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (2Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Google Scholar, 3Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar) are thought to mediate the biological activities of FAs. Skin represents a very active lipid-synthesizing tissue in mammals. Two recent reports describe that human keratinocytes express the epidermal FABP, which is highly up-regulated in the hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin disease psoriasis (5Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honoré B. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 299-305Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 6Siegenthaler G. Hotz R. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Didierjean L. Hellman U. Saurat J.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 363-371Google Scholar, 7Masouyé I. Saurat J.-H. Siegenthaler G. Dermatology. 1996; 192: 208-213Google Scholar). The epidermis lacks the Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases (8Chapkin R.S. Ziboh V.A. Marcelo C.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1986; 27: 945-954Google Scholar), and, therefore, essential FAs like linoleic and arachidonic acid must be acquired from circulation. E-FABP binds stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid but has no affinity for arachidonic acid and a very low affinity for the nearby precursor, linolenic acid (6Siegenthaler G. Hotz R. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Didierjean L. Hellman U. Saurat J.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 363-371Google Scholar). Since no other FABPs have been detected in keratinocytes so far, we investigated whether a carrier protein, capable to bind unsaturated fatty acids like linolenic and arachidonic acid, might exist in psoriatic skin and cultured human keratinocytes.We characterized a fatty acid-binding heteromer of 34 kDa (FA-p34) isolated from human keratinocytes, which is composed of MRP8 (also referred to as cystic fibrosis antigen, the L1 light chain, p8, calgranulin A, S100A8) and MRP14 (L1 heavy chain, p14, calgranulin B, S100A9) (for a review, see 9Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Google Scholar). These proteins belong to the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins (reviewed in 10Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-447Google Scholar), and both molecules are highly up-regulated in psoriatic skin (5Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honoré B. Celis J.E. J. Invest.

Furthermore, for both molecules several post-translational modifications and the formation of high molecular weight complexes in vivo have been reported (15Edgeworth J. Gorman M. Bennett R. Freemont P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7706-7713Google Scholar, 16Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 285-293Google Scholar, 17Guignard F. Mauel J.

In this report we show that FA-p34 represents a novel class of FA-binding proteins and discuss its possible role in mediating the biological activities of unsaturated fatty acids."

Q-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fall into eight complementation groups (coq1-coq8). Yeast mutants from the coq5 complementation group lack Q and as a result are respiration-defective and fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. A nuclear gene, designated COQ5 was isolated from a yeast genomic library based on its ability to restore growth of a representative coq5 mutant on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. The DNA segment responsible for the complementation contained an open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number Z49210) with 44% sequence identity over 262 amino acids to UbiE, which is required for a C-methyltransferase step in the Q and menaquinone biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli Both the ubiE and COQ5 coding sequences contain sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases.

The primary function of Q is to transport electrons from Complex I or II to the cytochrome bc1 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes (1Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Google Scholar). This cycle is carried out by a series of reductions and oxidations of the head group of Q. This same redox chemistry also allows reduced Q (QH2) to scavenge electrons and function as a lipid-soluble antioxidant. In this latter capacity, QH2 may scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals directly in an analogous manner to vitamin E (2Forsmark P. Aberg F. Norling B. Nordenbrand K. Dallner G. Ernster L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 39-43Google Scholar, 3Matsura T. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 277-283Google Scholar, 4Ernster L. Forsmark-Andree P. Clin. Invest. 1993; 71: S60-S65Google Scholar), or it may help regenerate α-tocopherol (5Kagan V. Serbinova E. Packer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 851-857Google Scholar, 6Stoyanovsky D.A. Osipov A.N. Quinn P.J. Kagan V.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 343-351Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that QH2 plays an important role in vivo in protecting cells from autoxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (7Do T.Q. Schultz J.R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Google Scholar). Higher levels of QH2 in low density lipoproteins usually correspond to an increased resistance to lipid peroxidation (8Mohr D. Bowry V.W. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 247-254Google Scholar, 9Stocker R. Bowry V.W. Frei B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1646-1650Google Scholar, 10Tribble D.L. van den Berg J.J.M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 687-696Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the level of antioxidants, such as QH2, in low density lipoproteins may slow the development of atherosclerosis, since oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins are thought to play a role in the initiation of the disease (12Hanaki Y. Sugiyama S. Ozawa T. Ohno M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 814-815Google Scholar, 13Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Berlinder J.A. Territo M.C. Demer L.L. Frank J.S. Watson A.D. Edwards P.A. Lusis A.J. Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 76: 18C-23CGoogle Scholar). This action of QH2 as an antioxidant may also impact other age-related degenerative diseases and the aging process itself (14Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Google Scholar, 15Holliday R. Barlow P.W. Understanding Aging.

Rudney H. Vitam. Horm. 1983; 40: 1-43Google Scholar). The proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of Q was elucidated from the characterization of Q intermediates that accumulated in Q-deficient strains of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli (16Olson R.E. Rudney H. Vitam. Horm. 1983; 40: 1-43Google Scholar, 17Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Google Scholar). It was shown that the pathways in these organisms diverge after formation of 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. After three additional steps, the Q biosynthetic pathways in E. coli and S. cerevisiae are thought to converge. The ubi mutants of E. coli are grouped into eight complementation groups (ubiA-ubiH) and fail to grow on media containing succinate as the sole carbon source (17Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Google Scholar, 18Meganathan R. Niedhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 642-656Google Scholar). The Q-deficient strains of S. cerevisiae have also been grouped into eight complementation groups (coq1-coq8) and are nonrespiring and therefore fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (19Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). The Q deficiency in the coq complementation groups was based on the observation that in vitro assays of cytochrome c reductase activity could be returned to almost wild-type levels by the addition of Q (20Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). Yeast coq mutant strains (representative mutants from coq3-coq8 groups) when grown in the presence of p-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid, a biosynthetic precursor of Q, fail to produce Q and accumulate an early intermediate that corresponds to 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (21Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The presence of this intermediate is not necessarily diagnostic of the affected biosynthetic step, since it also accumulates in wild-type yeast (21Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 22Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Google Scholar). This phenomenon is not observed in the E. coli Q-deficient ubi mutants, which tend to accumulate large amounts of each distinct Q intermediate (17Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Google Scholar). The current study employs the strategy of comparing both sequence and function of the yeast COQ and E. coli ubi gene products to study the C-methylation step in yeast Q biosynthesis (depicted in Fig. 1). This C-methyltransferase step was identified as being potentially defective in E. coli ubiE mutants, which accumulate the intermediate DDMQ (Fig. 1; 23Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Google Scholar). Searches of the literature have shown very few examples of C-methyltransferases, with most of the examples being in DNA/RNA and in steroid, corrin, and porphyrin biosynthesis (24Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Google Scholar). Recently, the E. coli ubiE gene has been identified and shown to harbor three sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase enzymes (25Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Google Scholar). The presence of an intact ubiE gene was required for production of Q in vivo, and disruption of the ubiE gene in a wild-type parental strain produced a mutant with growth defects on succinate and in both Q and menaquinone synthesis (25Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Google Scholar). The present study reports the isolation of a ubiE homolog from yeast, the COQ5 gene, and provides evidence that it encodes a C-methyltransferase. To study the C-methylation step shown in Fig. 1, farnesylated analogs of the natural substrate and product were synthesized and used to develop an in vitro assay. The data presented indicate that the yeast Coq5 polypeptide is located in yeast mitochondria and is required for C-methylation in the synthesis of Q. The genotypes and sources of the mutant and wild-type yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Media for growth of yeast were prepared as described (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 209Google Scholar) and included YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose), and YEPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol). The SD medium (0.18% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, 0.14% NaH2PO4, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4) was modified from the literature as described. Amounts of adenine, uracil, tryptophan, histidine HCl, and methionine were increased by a factor of 4; amounts of arginine HCl, isoleucine, and lysine HCl were doubled; phenylalanine and leucine were increased by 120%; tyrosine was increased by 130%; 80 mg/liter cysteine was added. SD-Leu and SD-Ura were SD media without leucine or uracil, respectively. 2% agar was added for solid media. Yeast were grown at 30°C. The E. coli strain AN70 (ubiE401) harboring a mutation in the ubiE gene (23Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Google Scholar) was grown as described previously (25Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J.

Open table in a new tab C83/LH1 was transformed by the procedure of Beggs (30Beggs J.D. Nature. 1978; 275: 104-109Google Scholar) with 5 μg of a yeast genomic library. The library was constructed by ligation to the BamHI site of YEp13 of partial Sau3AI fragments (7-10 kb) of nuclear DNA isolated from the respiration-competent S. cerevisiae strain D273-10B. Two respiration-competent and leucine prototrophic clones were obtained from the transformation. Both phenotypes co-segregated, indicating their dependence on the presence of the autonomously replicating plasmid. The plasmid pG17/T1, isolated from one of the transformants, was used to characterize the complementing gene. In a similar manner, CH83-B3 was transformed with the multiple-copy expression library prepared from yeast DNA in the vector YEp24 (31Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Google Scholar) containing the URA3 gene as a selectable marker. Transformants were selected by plating onto SD-Ura medium and replica-plated after 2 days onto YPG medium to test for respiratory growth. One respiration-competent and uracil-prototrophic colony was obtained from the transformation, and the co-segregation of these phenotypes indicated the presence of a plasmid gene. Yeast plasmid DNA was recovered from the transformant and amplified in E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern hybridization analysis of the recovered plasmid, pRB01, showed it to contain a segment of DNA that overlapped with the insert present in pG17/T1. pG17/ST1 was obtained by religation of pG17/T1 after removal of the 2-kb SphI fragment. The 2-kb SphI fragment containing one-half of the pG17/T1 insert and 200 base pairs of YEp13 sequence were subcloned into the vector YEp351 (32Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar) to create pG17/ST2. Partial DNA sequence analysis of the 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment derived from pG17/ST1 showed the insert DNA to contain a segment of the chromosome XIII sequence reported by Skelton et al. 2J. Skelton, C. M. Churcher, B. Barrell, M. A. Rajandream, and S. V. Walsh, GenBank™ accession number Z49210. Based on the sequence of YEp13 and the reported open reading frame (accession number Z49210), the removal of the 2-kb SphI fragment leads to the loss of the 28 amino-terminal residues and their substitution by the following sequence: MTQSAAGTCPTSCMIKKTVISAATIVMPRAHRKELTGLKALKGIGRRSPLCDSCIRKQPSSRLRPLSTAAARNG. The disrupted coq5 allele was constructed in pG17/T1 by substituting the 100-base pair BamHI fragment internal to the gene with HIS3 on a 1.7-kb BamHI fragment (34Rothstein R.J. Methods. Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, pG17/ST3, was used to obtain a linear 3.5-kb HincII fragment with the disrupted gene. W303-1A and W303-1B were each transformed with 2 μg of DNA by the procedure of Schiestl et al. (35Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). Most of the histidine-independent clones issued from the transformations were respiration-defective and were complemented by ρ0 but not by the coq5 testers. Nuclear DNAs from two independent transformants, one with an “a” and the other with an α mating type were digested with EcoRI and separated on 1% agarose. Southern analysis of these independent transformants confirmed the presence of the coq5::HIS3 allele in their chromosomal DNAs. The probe, an 800-base pair EcoRI fragment (Fig. 2) recognizes a 800-base pair fragment in the genomic DNA of the parental strain. The genomic DNA of the mutant strain, aW303ΔCOQ5, has a larger hybridizing species at approximately 2.5 kb, as expected for the disrupted allele. The gene for biotinylated Coq5p was constructed by in-frame fusion of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment containing the 5′-flanking and coding sequence to a bacterial sequence coding for the biotinylation site of transcarboxylase (36Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Google Scholar). The amplification was carried out with pG17/T1 as template, a forward primer (encoding the SacI site) starting at nucleotide position −373, and a reverse primer starting at +907, in which the termination codon of COQ5 was destroyed and replaced with a BglII site. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with a combination of SacI and BglII and ligated to the BamHI and SacI sites in the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector YEp352-Bio6 (33Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar, 58Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Google Scholar). The fusion gene was introduced into W303ΔCOQ5 either on an autonomously replicating plasmid (pG17/ST5) or by integration of a single copy at the URA3 locus (pG17/ST6). The wild-type strain W303-1B and the transformants W303ΔCOQ5/ST5 and aW303ΔCOQ5/ST5 were grown in YPGal (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) to early stationary phase. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by digestion with Zymolyase 20,000. Spheroplasts were lysed in 0.6 M sorbitol and debris, and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondria were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Total mitochondrial and postmitochondrial supernatant proteins (20 μg) were loaded in each lane and separated in a 12% polyacrylamide gel prepared according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and the Western blot was reacted first with avidin coupled to peroxidase. The blot was then stained with 4-chloro-1-naphthol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. This procedure stains only proteins containing biotin. All reagents for organic synthesis were purchased from Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise stated. Dichloromethane, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, and triethylamine were distilled from calcium hydride. Diethylether was distilled from sodium-benzophenone ketyl.

Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid receptor can be activated in RAR/RXR heterodimers, whereas RXR is believed to be a silent co-factor. In this report we show that efficient growth arrest and differentiation of the human monocytic cell line U-937 require activation of both RAR and RXR. Also, we demonstrate that the allosteric inhibition of RXR is not obligatory and that RXR can be activated in the RAR/RXR heterodimer in the presence of RAR ligands. Remarkably, RXR inhibition by RAR can also be relieved by an RAR antagonist. Moreover, the dose response of RXR agonists differ between RXR homodimers and RAR/RXR heterodimers, indicating that these complexes are pharmacologically distinct. Finally, the AF2 activation domain of both subunits contribute to activation even if only one of the receptors is associated with ligand. Our data emphasize the importance of signaling through both subunits of a heterodimer in the physiological response to retinoids and show that the activity of RXR is dependent on both the identity and the ligand binding state of its partner.

Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Google Scholar). At the cellular level retinoids influence processes such as growth and differentiation by specific effects on the regulation of gene expression. Both atRA and 9cRA bind to specific types of nuclear hormone receptors that belong to a large family of conserved proteins, including receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D3 (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

The receptors contain distinct functional domains, including a well conserved DNA binding domain and a somewhat less conserved C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Recent studies have revealed that ligand binding mediates a structural transition, which involves repositioning of a α-helix in the core of the C-terminal activation domain (AF2) (4Danielian P.S.

In several cases receptors have been shown to function as repressors of transcription, an activity that is believed to be mediated by a distinct type of accessory proteins termed co-repressors (14Casanova J.

Two different types of retinoid receptors have been identified. RAR is activated by both atRA and 9cRA, whereas RXR is activated only by 9cRA (1Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Google Scholar). RXR has been shown to regulate gene expression in response to 9cRA both as homodimers and in heterodimeric complexes with orphan receptors such as LXR, NGFI-B, and FXR (18Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Google Scholar). In addition to its function as a 9cRA-inducible receptor, RXR plays a central role as a heterodimerizing co-factor in gene regulatory events mediated by other members of the nuclear receptor super family, i.e. RAR, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar). In these heterodimers RXR has been shown to be allosterically blocked and function as a silent co-receptor (19Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A.

These results either suggest that two distinct pathways synergize in mediating the biological response of retinoids or, alternatively, in contrast to the concept of RXR as a silent heterodimerization partner of RAR, point to the possibility that both subunits of the RAR/RXR heterodimer can be activated by ligand. In this study we have used synthetic RAR- and RXR-selective ligands to demonstrate that the monoblastic cell line U-937 requires activation of both RAR and RXR for efficient induction of the monocytic differentiation program. To analyze the molecular mechanism behind this cooperativity between RAR and RXR, we utilized the GAL4 system, which enabled us to study the retinoid response through RAR/RXR heterodimers independent of endogenous receptor complexes that bind to RA response elements. Although RXR can be shown to be in a repressed state in complex with RAR, we show that this inhibition of RXR is relieved by RAR ligand binding. Even binding of an RAR antagonist allows activation of the RXR moiety in the RAR/RXR heterodimer. Moreover, we demonstrate that the RXR AF2 domain is required for efficient activation of ligands binding to RAR, TR, VDR, and PPAR also in the absence of RXR ligand. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that RXR is subject to both positive and negative allosteric regulation by its heterodimeric partner that results in repression, partial activation, or full activation of RXR depending on the availability of ligands for either or both subunits. U-937-1 cells (25Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Uxbridge, United Kingdom) and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin). Cells at a concentration of 0.2 × 106/ml were exposed to different retinoid compounds for 4 days. Retinoids used were atRA (Sigma), 9cRA (Hoffmann LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland), and TTNPB and SR11237 (19Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Google Scholar). Differentiation antigen expression was analyzed by flow immunocytometry as described (26Botling J. Öberg F. Nilsson K. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 2034-2041Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were LeuM5 (CD11c; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), GoH3 (CD49f; Immunotech, Marseilles, France), and YTH71.3 (CD66a; kindly provided by Prof. H. Waldman, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments (Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were used as a secondary reagent for CD11c-labeled cells and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit-anti-rat F(ab′)2 fragments for CD66a- and CD49f-labeled cells. Cell cycle analysis was performed as described (27Vindelöv L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Google Scholar). The data were processed with the MacCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) to obtain DNA distribution histograms as shown in Fig. 1C The cellular morphology was examined by light microscopy after cytospin centrifugation and staining with May-Grünewald-Giemsa solution. The luciferase reporters used in transfection experiments contain three copies of the hRARβ2 gene promoter RARE (βREx3-tk-luc) or four copies of the GAL4 binding site (MH100×4-tk-luc) cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene minimal promoter (28Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Google Scholar). Receptors and derivatives of receptors were expressed from pCMX expression vectors containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer sequences (29Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar). pCMX-GAL4-RAR and pCMX-GAL4-RXR contain the sequences encoding the ligand binding domains of hRARα (from Glu-185) and hRXRα (from Glu-203), respectively, cloned in frame after the sequence encoding the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 amino acids 1-147) (21Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar, 28Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Google Scholar). pCMX-GAL4-RARmAF2 was cloned by a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy and contains the sequence encoding the complete ligand binding domain (from Glu-185) of the hRARα mutated in the core of the C-terminal AF2 changing Glu-411 and Met-412 into alanines. pCMX-GAL4-RXRmAF2 was also mutated by polymerase chain reaction and contains the sequence encoding the complete ligand binding domain (from Glu-203) of the hRXRα mutated in the C-terminal AF2 changing Met-454 and Leu-455 into alanines. pCMX-RXRmAF2 contains the identical two-amino acid substitution in the context of the complete coding sequence of hRXRα. A similar mutation in RXR has been described previously (11Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar). CMX-VP16-RXR contains the complete coding sequence of the hRXRα cloned in frame after a sequence encoding the 78 amino acids from the transactivation domain encoded in pVP16C1 (Novagen, Madison, WI) (28Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Google Scholar). The entire coding sequences of hRARα, hRXRα, hTRβ, VDR, and mPPARγ were all cloned in pCMX and have been described previously (29Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar, 30Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Google Scholar). Human chorion carcinoma JEG-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed in duplicate in 24-well plates by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (28Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Google Scholar). Each well was transfected with 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of receptor expression vector, and 200 ng of pCMX-βgal reference plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene. Additions to each well were adjusted to contain a constant amount of DNA and of pCMX expression vector. After 6-12 h, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum and the indicated ligands. The cells were harvested after 36-h incubation and lysed, and extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in a microplate luminometer/photometer reader (Lucy-1, Anthos, Salzburg, Austria). Variance between duplicate data points were less than 20% in each experiment. Twenty million U-937 cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in a cuvette in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 20 μg of βREx3-tk-luc plasmid and 20 μg of RSV-βgal vector. The cells were transfected by electroporation at 0.30 kV/960 microfarads (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad), left on ice for 10 min, and then transferred to culture medium. Multiple transfections of cells were pooled and allowed to recover in the incubator for 1-2 h. Then the cells were split and stimulated over night in triplicate with retinoids as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Variance between data points within each experiment were less than 25%. All luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The human U-937 cell line is arrested at a monoblastic stage of hematopoietic development and differentiates along the monocytic lineage upon atRA treatment (31Olsson I.L. Breitman T.R. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3924-3927Google Scholar). During the differentiation process the cells up-regulate surface antigens associated with the terminally differentiated phenotype and acquire a monocyte-like morphology. High concentrations of atRA (in the micromolar range) in cell cultures results in isomerization to 9cRA, which can activate both types of retinoid receptors. Therefore, to analyze the individual contribution of RAR and RXR activation for the differentiation process, we stimulated U-937 cells with TTNPB and SR11237, synthetic retinoids that specifically bind and activate RAR and RXR, respectively (19Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Google Scholar, 32Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Google Scholar). After 4 days of 9cRA stimulation over 90% of the U-937 cells express the surface antigens CD11c, CD49f, and CD66a, which are characteristic markers of the differentiated phenotype (Fig. 1A) (26Botling J. Öberg F. Nilsson K. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 2034-2041Google Scholar). In contrast, TTNPB and SR11237 are by themselves poor inducers of antigen expression. However, when administered together, TTNPB and SR11237 induce differentiation antigens as efficiently as 9cRA (Fig. 1A). RA-differentiated U-937 cells develop a characteristic morphology with lobulated nuclei as shown in Fig. 1B Cells stimulated for 8 days with either TTNPB or SR11237 retained the blast-like phenotype of nondifferentiated cells. However, co-stimulation with TTNPB and SR11237 resulted in the typical morphology of mature atRA-differentiated cells (TT+SR; Fig. 1B). Similarly, TTNPB and SR11237 synergize in the induction of growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, consistent with the tight coupling between cessation of proliferation and terminal differentiation in these cells (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cell nuclei prepared from cells treated with either TTNPB or SR11237 showed a slightly larger fraction of the cells in the G1/G0 peak, compared with unstimulated exponentially growing cells, indicating some inhibition of proliferation. However, a complete cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, similar to that observed for atRA, required co-stimulation with TTNPB and SR11237. Thus, the activation of both RAR and RXR is critical for the efficient induction of the hallmarks of RA induced differentiation, i.e. growth arrest in G1/G0, up-regulation of differentiation antigens, and development of the distinct morphology of mature monocytes. We next wished to examine if the effect of combined RAR and RXR stimulation on U-937 cell differentiation could result from synergism in transactivation of an RARE. Transient transfections of U-937 cells were performed with a reporter construct containing the RARE from the RARβ2 promoter (βRE) (33de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.d. M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Google Scholar, 34Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Google Scholar). 9cRA is a strong inducer of βRE reporter activity through the endogenous receptors of U-937 cells (35Botling J. Öberg F. Törmä H. Tuohimaa P. Bläuer M. Nilsson K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1239-1249Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). TTNPB stimulation resulted in a moderate activation while SR11237 only induced a minor response. Co-stimulation with TTNPB and SR11237 potently activated the reporter. This effect was more than additive, indicating synergism between RAR and RXR activation. Since the βRE is recognized by RAR/RXR heterodimers in U-937 cells (35Botling J. Öberg F. Törmä H. Tuohimaa P. Bläuer M. Nilsson K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1239-1249Google Scholar), the results support the possibility that both subunits in such complexes are activated in the presence of TTNPB and SR11237. To investigate the possibility that both RAR and RXR subunits can be activated in RAR/RXR heterodimers, we wished to assay RXR activation independently of RAR. Therefore we utilized GAL4 receptor hybrids and a luciferase reporter containing GAL4 binding sites in its promoter (Fig. 3A). A two-amino acid substitution was introduced in the RAR activation domain (AF2) that would eliminate activation through the RAR subunit without affecting its ability to bind ligand. This assumption relies on previous mutations introduced in RAR in which activation, but not ligand binding, is abolished (6Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Google Scholar). The GAL4 hybrid receptor containing the ligand binding domain of such an RAR derivative (GAL4-RARmAF2; Fig. 3A) can heterodimerize with a VP16-fused RXR as efficiently as GAL4-RAR as demonstrated in the two-hybrid transfection experiment performed in human JEG-3 cells (Fig. 3B). VP16-fused RXR alone did not activate the reporter (data not shown). Importantly, the data in Fig. 3C demonstrate that heterodimers formed between the GAL4-RARmAF2 and RXR can be activated by SR11237 in the presence but not in the absence of the RAR agonist TTNPB. Similarly, a low dose of atRA also allows such activation through the RXR subunit of the GAL4-RARmAF2/RXR heterodimer. Notably, activation by RXR is weak when heterodimerizing with GAL4-RARmAF2, indicating that the RAR AF2 mutation affects the efficiency by which RXR can be activated (see below). The data corroborate previous observations showing that RXR is allosterically blocked in complex with RAR, but clearly demonstrate that inhibition can be relieved by binding of an RAR agonist to the RAR subunit of the heterodimer. We next wished to test if also an RAR antagonist could lead to a conformational shift that would allow RXR to be activated in an RAR/RXR heterodimer. Therefore, transfected JEG-3 cells were treated with SR11237 and an RAR antagonist, Ro41-5253 (36Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Google Scholar), which binds to RAR but does not lead to its activation (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, heterodimers formed between GAL4-RAR and RXR respond weakly to SR11237 in the presence, but not in the absence, of Ro41-5253, demonstrating that RXR inhibition is partly relieved under these conditions (Fig. 4B). Our results together with previously published data clearly show that RAR can allosterically influence RXR. Therefore we analyzed the pharmacological properties of the RAR-RXR complex in comparison with RXR/RXR homodimers in response to different RXR activators. In these experiments dose-response curves using different RXR activators were determined for activation by GAL-RXR or GAL-RARmAF2/RXR heterodimers (Fig. 5A). Cells expressing either GAL-RXR or the combination of GAL-RARmAF2 and RXR were treated with increasing amounts of the different RXR activators. Moreover, GAL-RARmAF2- and RXR-transfected cells were simultaneously incubated with a constant amount of TTNPB, since a ligand for RAR is a prerequisite for RXR activation as demonstrated above. Activation by three compounds, SR11237, LG153, and atRA, showed similar dose-response curves when comparing GAL4-RXR (homodimer) and GAL4-RARmAF2/RXR (heterodimer) activation (Fig. 5A). Similar results were seen with RXR activators such as 9cRA and methoprene acid (37Harmon M.A. Boehm M.F. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6157-6160Google Scholar) (data not shown). Interestingly, as demonstrated in Fig. 5B, one of the tested ligands, SR11234 (19Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Google Scholar), was a weak activator of the GAL4-RARmAF2/RXR heterodimer, whereas it potently activated GAL4-RXR. These results demonstrate that the two complexes are pharmacologically distinct and also suggest that RXR homodimers and RAR/RXR heterodimers respond differently to RXR ligands. Notably, RXR is only weakly activated in complex with RAR in the experiments displayed in Figs. 3C and 4B In these experiments the AF2 of RAR is inactive, either because the RAR AF2 is mutated (Fig. 3) or an RAR antagonist is used (Fig. 4). Thus, the data indicate that efficient activation is dependent on the functional integrity of both AF2 domains of a heterodimeric complex. To test if the activation of RAR, in the context of an RAR/RXR heterodimer, also depended on two AF2 domains, a two-amino acid substitution was introduced in RXR AF2 (Fig. 6A). This RXR derivative (GAL4-RXRmAF2) is inactive when transfected cells are treated with SR11237 but heterodimerizes efficiently with RAR, as indicated by the two-hybrid interaction between GAL4-RXRmAF2 and a VP16-RAR derivative (data not shown). Indeed, a heterodimer formed between GAL4-RXRmAF2 and RAR is only weakly active in the presence of TTNPB, demonstrating that the AF2 function of RXR is required, although TTNPB only binds to the RAR subunit of the complex. In addition, other heterodimeric partners, including TR, VDR, and PPARγ, also require an intact RXR AF2 domain, since activation is diminished when these receptors are co-expressed with GAL4-RXRmAF2 and treated with triiodothyronine, vitamin D3, and the specific PPARγ ligand BRL49653 (38Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 6B). Consistent with this result, a truncated derivative of RXR (RXR443), which lacks an intact AF2 domain, acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of RAR activation from a reporter containing the βRE (Fig. 6C). Together, these results demonstrate that an intact RXR AF2 is required for efficient ligand activation of several RXR partners. RXR participates in several signaling pathways by forming heterodimers with receptors such as RAR, TR, and VDR. In such heterodimers; however, RXR has been suggested to function as a silent partner, which promotes high affinity DNA binding of the ligand binding subunit to its specific hormone response elements (18Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Google Scholar). To support this notion we show in this report that RXR ligands have little effect on U-937 cells. Still, some reports favor the idea that both subunits in an RXR heterodimer can be activated by ligand, as supported by cooperativity between RAR and RXR ligands in RARE activation and induction of RA-induced genes (6Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Google Scholar, 23Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept our results demonstrate that both subunits in the RAR/RXR heterodimer can indeed be activated when both RAR and RXR ligands are present simultaneously. This also appears to be a prerequisite for the biological response, i.e. differentiation of U-937 cells. The combined use of the GAL4 system and the RAR AF2 mutant demonstrated how RAR and RXR ligands affected RXR activation in a context where the luciferase reporter gene was not affected by ligand dependent trans-activation of RAR. Also, this experimental approach ensured that transcriptional influence from various endogenous receptor complexes was avoided. The results show that RXR is responsive to selective RXR ligands in the presence, but not in the absence, of RAR ligands. Previously published experiments demonstrated that RXR is allosterically inhibited in complex with RAR, which could be mechanistically explained by RXRs inability to bind ligand in RAR/RXR heterodimers (20Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Google Scholar, 21Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar). Our experiments confirm this view but, in addition, suggest that RAR ligand induces a conformational change which not only affects the ligand binding subunit, RAR, but is also translated by RXR to relieve inhibition of ligand binding. Previous biochemical experiments support this view and have suggested that both subunits of RXR/RAR heterodimers can indeed associate with ligand (21Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar, 24Apfel C.M. Kamber M. Klaus M. Mohr P. Keidel S. LeMotte P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30765-30772Google Scholar). Surprisingly, even an RAR antagonist combined with RXR ligands allow RXR activation. It was recently shown that a combination of an RAR antagonist and an RXR agonist can induce differentiation and apoptosis of promyelocytic NB4 cells, which express the PML/RARα fusion oncoprotein (39Chen J.-Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starrett J. Tortolani D. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 1996; 382: 819-822Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that cooperation between RAR antagonists and RXR agonists in these cells may be explained by allosteric receptor interactions within RAR/RXR heterodimer complexes. Using several synthetic RXR ligands we could show that the RAR/RXR heterodimer is pharmacologically distinct from RXR/RXR homodimers. The experiments demonstrated that the synthetic RXR ligand SR11234, as opposed to other tested RXR ligands, is a weak activator of RAR/RXR heterodimers. Since a low level of activation could be observed (Fig. 5; data not shown) we conclude that SR11234 can associate with RAR/RXR heterodimers and that the deficiency resides in an inability to promote efficient activation rather than ligand binding to the RAR/RXR heterodimer. SR11234 and SR11237 are structurally similar benzoic acid derivatives with ketal and thioketal substituent groups, respectively (19Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the ketal as opposed to the thioketal group may interfere with the efficiency by which co-activators and/or co-repressors assemble with RAR/RXR heterodimers but not RXR/RXR homodimers. Such differences in factor assembly have been demonstrated recently comparing the activities of novel synthetic RXR ligands with opposite effects on RAR/RXR heterodimers (40Lala D.S. Mukherjee R. Schulman I.G. Canan Koch S.S. Dardashti L.J. Nadzan A.M. Croston G.E. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Google Scholar). RA has been used in treatment of a number of different cancers, such as promyelocytic leukemia, head and neck carcinoma, and skin cancer (41de Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Google Scholar). Despite these interesting clinical developments, remarkably little is known as to how RA acts to suppress cancer cell growth. Previously published data have established that certain RAR antagonists, termed “dissociated retinoids,” are functional in their ability to inhibit AP1 activity, although they fail to trigger transcriptional activation by RAR (42Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.-P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Google Scholar, 43Chen J.-Y. Penco S. Ostrowski J. Balaguer P. Pons M. Starrett J.E. Reczek P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1187-1197Google Scholar). These retinoids specifically inhibited the growth of lung and breast cancer cells, whereas growth suppression of other cell types required “classical” activation of retinoid receptors by atRA (42Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.-P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Google Scholar). In addition, several naturally occurring retinoids exist, some of which are potent activators of RAR (44Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 45Achkar C.C. Derguini F. Blumberg B. Langston A. Levin A.A. Speck J. Evans R.M. Bolado J. Nakanishi K. Buck J. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4879-4884Google Scholar, 46Blumberg B. Bolado J. Derguini F. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Chakravarti D. Heyman R.A. Buck J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4873-4878Google Scholar). It is plausible that also naturally occurring compounds, similar to SR11234, will eventually turn out to selectively affect distinct RXR complexes. Therefore highly selective cellular responses could be achieved with different combinations of synthetic and natural retinoids. Clinically, it can be anticipated that combinations of pharmacologically distinct retinoids could increase both the specificity and the potency of retinoid action in cancer therapy. The emerging knowledge on co-activators/repressors and the determination of the crystal structure of nuclear receptor ligand binding domains may provide clues as to the mechanism behind the versatile allosteric control of RXR reported in this paper. Although the structure for one and the same receptor has yet to be shown both in a ligand-bound and unbound state, several important conclusions can be made on the nature of the conformational change occurring in liganded receptors (7Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Google Scholar, 8Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar, 9Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Google Scholar). Comparison of the apo-LBD of RXRα with the holo-LBDs of RARγ and TRα suggests that a ligand-induced conformational shift creates a more compact LBD fold (47Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protruding AF2 core α-helix, encompassing helix 12 in the described nuclear receptor LBD structure, folds back against the LBD, where it will be in close contact with the bound ligand. Thus, ligand induces both local and global conformational changes that easily could be envisioned to affect a heterodimerization partner. Also, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the AF2 core for association with co-activators in the presence of ligand (10Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar, 11Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar, 12Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Google Scholar, 13Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, our results demonstrated that the integrity of the AF2 domain of both subunits in RXR heterodimers are important for efficient activation, even when only one subunit of the heterodimer is activated by ligand. Experiments with an RXR AF2 mutant emphasized the importance of two AF2 domains in heterodimers such as RAR/RXR, TR/RXR, VDR/RXR, and PPAR/RXR, in which ligand-induced transcription depended on the AF2 domain of the nonliganded partner RXR. Conceivably, ligand binding to the heterodimerization partner could promote a conformational shift, which also affects the RXR AF2 and induces a conformation that resembles the “activated” state. Alternatively, co-activators may associate weakly with RXR AF2 domains also in the absence of RXR ligands. In a heterodimer with only one liganded receptor, synergistic co-activator binding may result from a combined weak and strong association with the nonliganded and liganded receptor partners, respectively. In conclusion, ligand binding to RAR has two important influences on RAR/RXR heterodimers. First, RAR ligand binding results in a partial transcriptional activation that is dependent on the RXR AF2. Second, an allosteric change is induced that allows RXR to bind ligand. Furthermore, in the presence of both ligands, heterodimers mediate synergistic transcriptional activation. Our data help to explain why synergistic physiological responses to both RAR and RXR are observed in many cell types such as U-937 cells. Also, a common and consistent feature of most, if not all, mammalian cells is the combined expression of RAR and RXR, suggesting a critical and central role for RAR/RXR heterodimers in responses to retinoids. The results emphasize the importance of observing each receptor in a heterodimer as an integrated component in a complex in which the receptors are regulated by mutual interactions involving the transactivation and ligand binding domains of both receptors.

In a previous study (Rebbaa, A., Yamamoto, H., Moskal, J. R., and Bremer, E. G. (1996) J. Neurochem. 67, 2265-2272), we showed that binding of the erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutin lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris to the bisecting structures on the EGF receptor from U373 MG glioma cells blocked EGF binding and receptor autophosphorylation. In this study we examined the consequences of overexpression of the bisecting structure on the EGF receptor by gene transfection of U373 MG cells with the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III). This modification leads to a significant decrease in EGF binding and EGF receptor autophosphorylation. In addition, the cellular response to EGF was found to be altered. Proliferation of U373 MG cells in serum-free medium is inhibited by EGF. In contrast, proliferation of the GnT-III-transfected cells was stimulated by EGF. These data demonstrate that changes in EGF receptor glycosylation by GnT-III transfection reduces the number of the active receptors in U373 MG cells and that this change results in change in the cellular response to EGF.

https://openalex.org/W2162084919,"At sites of vascular injury thrombin is generated via prothrombinase, a stoichiometric (1:1), Ca2+-dependent, and membrane-bound complex consisting of the nonenzymatic cofactor factor Va and the serine protease factor Xa. While the importance of anionic platelet membrane phospholipids in regulating thrombin generation is well recognized, the identification of regulatory protein receptors has eluded investigators. This study reports the first description of a human platelet membrane protein that regulates prothrombinase complex assembly and function. Direct platelet-protein binding studies indicated that, although required, platelet-bound factor Va alone is insufficient to mediate factor Xa binding, and that factor Va and factor Xa bind to discrete sites on activated platelets for which expression is independently regulated as a function of the agonist concentration. When specific monoclonal antibodies against effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1, a 65-kDa membrane receptor for factor Xa) were used in Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and/or flow cytometric analyses, activated platelets and their precursors, megakaryocytes, were shown to express EPR-1. These results were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of mRNA extracted from megakaryocyte-like cell lines. Additional flow cytometric studies demonstrated that a platelet-bound factor Va/factor Xa complex precluded binding of the anti-EPR-1 antibody, B6, to activated platelets by ∼50%. Likewise, the anti-EPR-1 antibody was shown to inhibit prothrombinase-catalyzed thrombin generation on activated platelets in a dose- and platelet donor-dependent manner, indicating that platelet-expressed EPR-1 mediates factor Xa assembly into the prothrombinase complex.

INTRODUCTIONPlatelets, through their adhesive properties in concert with their ability to contribute to and regulate thrombin generation, are central to the (patho)physiological processes of hemostasis, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. In normal hemostasis, subsequent to adherence at a site of vascular injury, platelets play a pivotal role by localizing, regulating, and modulating catalytic activities within the vascular system, which result in thrombin generation and the formation of a platelet-fibrin plug at the injured site. Activated platelets promote the catalysis of two sequential, homologous, and Ca2+-dependent reactions in coagulation: the proteolytic conversion of factor X to factor Xa catalyzed by the intrinsic tenase complex, a membrane-bound complex consisting of the nonenzymatic cofactor factor VIIIa and the serine protease factor IXa; and the proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex, a membrane-bound complex consisting of the nonenzymatic cofactor factor Va and the serine protease factor Xa (1Mann K.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 229-233Google Scholar). The high degree of homology between the intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase complexes is underscored by the observations that the serine proteases factor IXa and factor Xa (2Furie B. Furie B.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 800-806Google Scholar) and the procofactors factor VIII and factor V (3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Google Scholar) are structurally homologous, as well as the observations that both factor VIIIa (4Mertens K. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Google Scholar) and factor Va (5Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 80: 2380-2384Google Scholar) are essential to complex assembly and function by virtue of their membrane-binding capabilities to form at least part of the receptor for their respective serine proteases at the human platelet surface.Binding of the protein components of each enzymatic complex to an appropriate membrane surface is an obligate requirement for physiologically relevant catalysis (1Mann K.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 229-233Google Scholar). It is well known that synthetic phospholipid vesicles support the assembly of both complexes with functional activities equal to those provided by the complexes bound to activated platelets (6Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-12Google Scholar). However, activated platelets appear to express high affinity (≤1 × 10−9M), saturable binding sites that are specific for the various protein components (5Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To date, studies detailing the direct binding of factor VIIIa to platelets have not been performed. Furthermore, since platelets contain a large reserve of factor V, which is released and activated to factor Va subsequent to thrombin-induced platelet activation (16Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.W. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Google Scholar), direct factor Va binding measurements are difficult to interpret. In contrast, extensive studies have been performed detailing the binding of factor IXa (7Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Google Scholar, 8Rawala-Sheikh R.

Chem. 1980; 255: 1170-1174Google Scholar) to the activated platelet surface. Ahmad and colleagues have demonstrated that factor IXa binds to approximately 600 specific binding sites/activated platelet (7Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Google Scholar). Prothrombin and factor X, at a 450-fold molar excess, minimally displaced factor IXa binding (15% and 35%, respectively) (7Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained in analyses of factor Xa binding to platelets. In these studies, factor X, factor IXa, and prothrombin did not compete with factor Xa for platelet binding sites (13Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Google Scholar). These combined studies strongly suggest that factor IXa and factor Xa interact with discrete binding sites on thrombin-activated platelets.Previous studies from our laboratory using analyses of kinetics of prothrombin activation with both normal and factor V-deficient human platelets indicate that both factors Va and Xa bind to ∼3,000 functional sites on the surface of thrombin-activated platelets (17Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2119-2124Google Scholar) through formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, governed by a Kd≅ 10−10M and expressing a kcat/site = 30 s−1. Furthermore, factor Xa binding is absolutely dependent upon prebound factor Va (15Kane W.H. Lindhout M.J. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1170-1174Google Scholar, 17Tracy P.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2969-2972Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that EPR-1 is also expressed by human endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (21Nicholson A.C. Nachman R.L. Altieri D.C. Summers B.D. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28407-28413Google Scholar), as well as cells expressed during Hodgkin's disease (22Adida C. Ambrosini G. Plescia J. Crotty P.L. Costa J. Altieri D.C. Blood. 1996; 88: 1457-1464Google Scholar). Since factor Xa binding to EPR-1 expressed by these cell populations occurs independently of factor Va, this binding interaction appears to be important in initiating the intracellular signaling responses that are important in cell proliferation (20Altieri D.C.

The 97-kDa protein is almost certainly identical to a major integral glycoprotein of this size in the rat adipocyte plasma membrane, since its predicted N-terminal sequence is the same as that recently determined for this glycoprotein by amino acid sequencing. Moreover, the predicted partial sequence (322 amino acids) of the 97-kDa protein is highly homologous to the corresponding region of a human placental amine oxidase, which was cloned simultaneously and proposed to be a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence of the 97-kDa rat/human amine oxidase indicates that the protein consists of a very short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single transmembrane segment and a large extracellular domain containing the catalytic site. Thus this study establishes the 97-kDa rat/human amine oxidase as the first integral membrane amine oxidase to be cloned. The membrane amine oxidase was more abundant in the plasma membranes than the low density microsomes of the adipocyte, and in contrast to some other proteins found in GLUT4 vesicles, it did not redistribute to the plasma membrane in response to treatment of the cells with insulin.

Primary amine oxidases form a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of primary amines by molecular oxygen, to yield the corresponding aldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. Typically these enzymes consist of two identical subunits; each contains an oxidized tyrosine residue, known as topa quinone, and one atom of copper, both of which participate in catalysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Klinman J.P. Mu D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 299-344Google Scholar and 2Hartmann C. McIntire W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Several secreted members of this family, including bovine serum amine oxidase and kidney diamine oxidase, have been cloned and extensively characterized (3Mu D. Medzihradszky K.F. Adams G.W. Mayer P. Hines W.M. Burlingame A.L. Smith A.J. Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9926-9932Google Scholar, 4Novotny W.F. Chassande O. Baker M. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9921-9925Google Scholar). By contrast considerably less is known about one (or possibly more) suspected member of this family. This is the membrane-bound amine oxidase that is highly susceptible to inhibition by semicarbazide, and is often referred to as the “tissue-bound semicarbazide-sensitive” amine oxidase (5Lyles G.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 293-303Google Scholar, 6Callingham B.A. Crosbie A.E. Rous B.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 305-321Google Scholar, 7Buffoni F. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 323-331Google Scholar). This enzyme, as detected by its activity against benzylamine, has been found to be present in a large number of tissues and cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, white and brown adipocytes, and skin fibroblasts (5Lyles G.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 293-303Google Scholar, 6Callingham B.A. Crosbie A.E. Rous B.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 305-321Google Scholar, 7Buffoni F. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 323-331Google Scholar). Its cloning as such (see below) has not been reported, and whether it is also of the topa quinone and copper-containing type has not been established. The present study began as part of our investigation of insulin stimulation of glucose transport. Treatment of fat and muscle cells with insulin causes a rapid elevation in glucose transport due to a rapid increase in the amount of the glucose transporter (GLUT4 isotype) 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4glucose transporter isotype 4HPAOhuman placental amine oxidaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsvp9797-kDa protein in GLUT4 vesiclesPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s) in the plasma membrane. The basis for this increase in amount is largely the enhanced trafficking of GLUT4 from intracellular locations to the plasma membrane (reviewed in 8Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 753-759Google Scholar). We have developed a procedure for isolating the intracellular membranes containing GLUT4 (referred to as GLUT4 vesicles) from adipocytes and are characterizing other proteins present in these vesicles (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). In the course of this work, we partially cloned a 97-kDa vesicle protein. This protein, which we initially referred to as vp97, has proven to be a membrane-bound, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase that is almost certainly identical to a major integral glycoprotein in the adipocyte plasma membrane. As our investigation of this protein was nearing completion, the cloning of its human homolog was reported (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar). However, the human homolog, whose properties as protein were not examined experimentally, was proposed to be another secreted oxidase, rather than a membrane-bound one. Thus, our results identify and characterize the first cloned membrane amine oxidase. glucose transporter isotype 4 human placental amine oxidase rapid amplification of cDNA ends 97-kDa protein in GLUT4 vesicles polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) Rat adipocytes were obtained and then treated with insulin or left in the basal state, as described in (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). GLUT4-containing vesicles were isolated from the adipocytes by immunoadsorption with antibodies against GLUT4, and the vesicle proteins were released from the adsorbent by solubilization with 0.5% octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether, as presented in detail in Mastick et al (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). Plasma membranes and low density microsomes were isolated from basal and insulin-treated adipocytes by differential centrifugation (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). The effectiveness of insulin was checked by quantitative immunoblotting of the fractions for GLUT4. As expected from earlier results (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar), insulin treatment caused at least a 2.5-fold increase in GLUT4 in the plasma membranes and a 30% decrease of GLUT4 in the low density microsomes. Proteins were held at 100°C for 3 min in SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 95 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and separated on a gradient gel of 8-16% acrylamide. The gel was either stained directly for protein with Coomassie Blue, or the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.01% SDS, 20% MeOH for 18 h. The nitrocellulose was stained for protein with either colloidal gold stain (Bio-Rad) or 0.1% (w/v) Amido Black in methanol/acetic acid/water (5/1/4, by volume), or it was stained specifically for quinone-containing proteins with nitroblue tetrazolium in potassium glycinate, as described in Paz et al. (11Paz M.A. Flückiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Google Scholar). The GLUT4 vesicle proteins in 0.5% (w/v) octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether were isolated from the adipocytes of 78 rats, as described above. The proteins (approximately 400 μg) were separated from membrane lipids and the detergent by precipitation from chloroform/methanol according to the procedure in Wessel and Flügge (12Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Google Scholar), and dissolved in 300 μl of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis in two 8-mm lanes, transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained with Amido Black, as described above. vp97 was digested with trypsin, and the peptides were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced essentially as described in Mastick et al. (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar), with the exception that tandem mass spectra were determined for each eluting peptide with a model TSQ 7000 tandem mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT) (13Ducret A. Foyn Bruun C. Bures E.J. Marhaug G. Husby G. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 866-876Google Scholar). The complete sequences of two peptides (designated peptide 1 and 2) were obtained (see “Results”). Total RNA from rat adipocytes was isolated with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception that the triglyceride in the cells necessitated the use of a larger volume of the reagent (24 ml for the packed adipocytes from six rats, which are approximately 3 × 107 cells) (14Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Google Scholar). The yield of RNA from adipocytes of six rats was 0.4 mg. The close homology of peptides 1 and 2 with sequences in bovine serum oxidase (see “Results”) served as the basis of a PCR approach to cloning. First, reverse transcription was carried out with an antisense degenerate oligonucleotide based on the sequence of the more C-terminal peptide (peptide 2) (GNCCYTCHGGRTGRAAYTG where N = A, T, G, C; Y = C, T; R = A, G; H = A, C, T). Total RNA (1 μg) was denatured at 90°C for 5 min, and then reverse transcribed for 10 min at 20°C followed by 45 min at 42°C, with the antisense degenerate oligonucleotide (25 pmol) and Superscript II (200 units) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl volume. Following RNase digestion, the single-stranded cDNA was purified from the mixture using the GlassMax kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). It was then amplified by PCR with the Ultma DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), using the antisense degenerate primer given above (50 pmol) and a sense degenerate primer based on the sequence of the more N-terminal peptide (peptide 1, primer GARTAYCARGAYATHCARGA, 50 pmol) in a 100-μl reaction mixture (30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60 s at 45°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 7 min at 72°C). This yielded a fragment of about 450 bp. A second round of amplification was performed with a nested sense degenerate primer based on peptide 1 (GAYATHCARGARATGATHTTYCA) and the same antisense primer. The resulting fragment of about 450 bp was cloned into pCR-Script (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts in four clones were sequenced on both strands. The 5′ end of the cDNA was cloned by a 5′-RACE procedure using the Life Technologies Inc. 5′-RACE kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription on total RNA was carried out with the antisense oligonucleotide for nucleotides 978-995 (see Fig. 2), and the cDNA was tailed at the 3′ end with Cs. It was then amplified with the abridged anchor primer provided with the kit and a nested antisense primer (for nucleotides 937-957). The product was then used as the template for amplification of a smaller fragment with the abridged universal amplification primer of the kit and another nested antisense primer (for nucleotides 666-687). The resulting 700-bp fragment was cloned into pCR-Script, and the inserts of three clones were sequenced on both strands. DNA sequencing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencing system using Perkin-Elmer DNA sequencing kit FS. Data were analyzed using the software supplied by Applied Biosystems. Searches of the protein sequence data bases were performed by using BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). This enzyme was assayed through its conversion of benzylamine to benzaldehyde, which was monitored by the increase in adsorbance at 250 nm (16Neumann R. Hevey R. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6362-6367Google Scholar). Reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme-containing fraction (50 μg in 80 μl or less) to 950 μl of assay solution, in a cuvette thermostated at 37°C. The assay solution consisted of 1 mM benzylamine in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 0.1% (w/v) octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether. The nonionic detergent was included to solubilize the membranes, so that the substrate would be readily accessible to the oxidase. Vesicles containing GLUT4 were isolated from the low density microsomal fraction of rat adipocytes by immunoadsorption with antibodies against GLUT4. The vesicle proteins were then released by solubilization of the vesicles bound to the adsorbent with a nonionic detergent. Lane 2 of Fig. 1 shows the polypeptides of the GLUT4 vesicles in the 70-250-kDa range. Among the vesicle proteins is a prominent band at 97 kDa (designated vp97). A large preparation of GLUT4 vesicles was carried out, and this preparation yielded vp97 in sufficient amount to obtain the sequences of two tryptic peptides, EYQDIQEMIFHR (peptide 1) and APPLQFHPEGPR (peptide 2). A search of the sequence data bases revealed that bovine serum amine oxidase contained two sequences that were very similar (3Mu D. Medzihradszky K.F. Adams G.W. Mayer P. Hines W.M. Burlingame A.L. Smith A.J. Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9926-9932Google Scholar). Peptide 1 matched residues 174-185 of the serum oxidase in 8 of 12 positions and peptide 2 matched residues 310-321 in 10 of 12 positions. These matches, together with the fact that serum oxidase is a protein of about the same size, strongly suggested that vp97 was a member of the amine oxidase family and indicated that oligonucleotides derived from the two peptide sequences should yield a product of approximately 440 bp upon PCR amplification of reverse transcribed rat adipocyte mRNA. In fact, when this was done, the major product was a 450-bp fragment of DNA. Subsequently, the remaining 5′ sequence of the cDNA was cloned by a 5′-RACE method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 presents the nucleotide sequence for the 5′ portion of the cDNA of vp97 and the corresponding amino acid sequence. An open reading frame initiated by a methionine at nucleotide 86 proceeds to the end of the sequence. This methionine must be the site of initiation of translation, since the 5′-upstream region contains an in-frame stop codon at nucleotide 59, and as described below, the purified protein contains the predicted N-terminal sequence as determined by amino acid sequence analysis. The cDNA sequence surrounding the initiation codon conforms well to the consensus sequence for the initiation of translation in rat (17Dalphin M.E. Brown C.M. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 216-218Google Scholar). The partial amino acid sequence of vp97 from residues 35-320 shows high homology with the corresponding region of bovine serum amine oxidase (residues 34-319) (3Mu D. Medzihradszky K.F. Adams G.W. Mayer P. Hines W.M. Burlingame A.L. Smith A.J. Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9926-9932Google Scholar), with 78% identity (data not shown). This finding thus indicated that vp97 is an amine oxidase, and the data in lane 1 of Fig. 1 provide more direct evidence that this is the case. Amine oxidases of this type contain a topa quinone residue, which is derived from the oxidation of a specific tyrosine (1Klinman J.P. Mu D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 299-344Google Scholar). Application of a staining method for quinone-containing proteins, which has been used to detect the bovine serum oxidase (11Paz M.A. Flückiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Google Scholar), to the GLUT4 vesicle proteins gave specific staining of vp97. One small region of the vp97 sequence differs markedly from the corresponding region of the serum oxidase. This region is the N-terminal 35 amino acids, which show no homology with the N-terminal 34 amino acids of the serum oxidase. In the case of the serum oxidase it has been shown that the N-terminal 16 amino acids constitute a leader sequence that is cleaved upon processing of this secreted protein (3Mu D. Medzihradszky K.F. Adams G.W. Mayer P. Hines W.M. Burlingame A.L. Smith A.J. Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9926-9932Google Scholar). The explanation for the different N terminus of vp97 became apparent when we discovered by data base search that vp97 is almost certainly the same as a major integral membrane glycoprotein in rat adipocyte plasma membranes (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar). This 100-kDa protein, the function of which was not known, had recently been purified and its N-terminal sequence of 19 amino acids determined by Edman degradation (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar). This sequence is identical to that of residues 2-20 of vp97. Thus, vp97 is an integral membrane glycoprotein. Consistent with this expectation, analysis of its sequence for potential membrane-spanning domains (TopPred II program) (19Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686Google Scholar) predicts a single one, which is the stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the N terminus (residues 6-26, underlined in Fig. 2). At this stage of our cloning effort, the complete sequence of a new amine oxidase, whose cDNA was cloned from a human placental library by a PCR approach starting with primers based upon conserved sequences in other oxidases, appeared in the data base (GenBank™ accession no. U39447 and now in Zhang and McIntire (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar)). This human placental amine oxidase (HPAO) is predicted to consist of 763 amino acids and have a mass of 84,621 Da. The partial sequence of vp97 is highly homologous with that of HPAO over its entire length, including the very N terminus, with 83% identity (Fig. 2). Thus, vp97 is the rat homolog of this human amine oxidase. Because of its sequence similarity to the bovine serum amine oxidase, HPAO was proposed to be a secreted protein, with its different N-terminal sequence also being a leader sequence (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar). However, on the basis of the characterization of vp97 as an integral plasma membrane protein described above (also see below), a substantial portion of HPAO is probably membrane-bound with its N terminus uncleaved. These considerations thus lead to the conclusion that vp97/HPAO is a membrane amine oxidase and subsequently it will be referred to as such. Its topology in the membrane can be deduced as follows. Analysis of the complete sequence of HPAO shows that it also has only one segment that is predicted as highly likely to be membrane spanning; that is the one at the N terminus (residues 6-26). Thus, the membrane amine oxidase is expected to be anchored by this single transmembrane segment, with only 5 residues on one side of the membrane and the bulk of the protein (residue 27 and beyond), including the catalytic site, on the other side. Since the membrane amine oxidase is a glycoprotein, as demonstrated by its strong binding to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar), and the sites of glycosylation for plasma membrane proteins are invariably extracellular, the bulk of the protein must be on the extracellular side of the membrane. Residues 1-5, the predicted cytoplasmic domain, contain no potential sites for Asn N-glycosylation, whereas the predicted large extracellular domain contains six such sites (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar), three of which are present in the partial sequence in Fig. 2, at positions 137, 232, and 294. The distribution of the oxidase was examined by staining the proteins in plasma membranes and low density microsomes from basal and insulin-treated adipocytes for quinone-containing proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 3-6). These fractions showed a single major quinoprotein at 97 kDa and a much weaker band at 180 kDa. The latter may be unreduced dimer, since the major glycoprotein of the rat adipocyte plasma membrane, identified here as the amine oxidase, has been reported to occur as a disulfide-linked dimer (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar). On the basis of the relative staining intensities, the membrane amine oxidase appears to be about 3-fold more abundant in the plasma membranes than in the low density microsomes. This distribution between the two fractions agrees with the relative amounts of the protein that were isolated from these two fractions by adsorption with wheat germ agglutinin (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar). Some proteins found in GLUT4 vesicles, including GLUT4 itself, translocate markedly from the low density microsomes to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). However, insulin had no effect on the subcellular distribution of the membrane amine oxidase (Fig. 1, lanes 3-6). Further evidence for the lack of an effect was the fact that the amount of the amine oxidase isolated with the GLUT4 vesicles did not decrease in response to insulin; by contrast, the 165-kDa protein in these vesicles (Fig. 1, lane 2), which we have previously characterized as an aminopeptidase that translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar, 20Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Google Scholar), decreased by about half (data not shown). The membrane amine oxidase, as detected by quinone staining, coincided exactly in its electrophoretic mobility with a major protein in the adipocyte plasma membranes detected by staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). We therefore take this protein to be the amine oxidase, and as expected from the quinone staining, there is less in the low density microsomes. By visual comparison of the intensity of the amine oxidase band with known amounts of standard proteins (data not shown), the plasma membranes contain about 23 μg of oxidase/mg of protein or 2.3% of the total; the oxidase is thus an abundant protein. Since a single adipocyte contains about 90 pg of plasma membrane (14Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Google Scholar), there are approximately 1.4 × 107 copies of the oxidase on the surface of the cell. The plasma membranes and low density membranes from basal and insulin-treated adipocytes were assayed for amine oxidase activity with benzylamine as the substrate. Fig. 3 presents representative data for a set of these subcellular fractions isolated at the same time from one batch of cells, which had been divided in half and treated with insulin or left in the basal state. The amine oxidase activity in the plasma membrane from basal cells was 2.3 times larger than that in the low density microsomes from basal cells. Insulin treatment had no significant effect on the activity in either fraction. Similar results were obtained with a second set of subcellular fractions isolated from another batch of cells. Two observations indicated that the activity in the spectrophotometric assay was due to a quinone-containing oxidase that converted benzylamine to benzaldehyde. First, semicarbazide completely inhibited the reaction (2Hartmann C. McIntire W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). When either the plasma membranes or the low density microsomes were first incubated with 100 μM semicarbazide for 30 min at 37°C and then the assay was initiated with benzylamine, there was no increase in adsorbance over a 30-min period. In the corresponding control experiment, where the membrane fraction was first incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the absence of semicarbazide, the rate was the same as that obtained without this preincubation. The benzylamine substrate protected the enzyme against inactivation by semicarbazide, since in contrast to the inhibition after preincubation in the absence of substrate, no inhibition occurred when the semicarbazide was added 15 s after the initiation of the enzymatic assay. Second, the product of the reaction was identified as benzaldehyde by its ultraviolet spectrum. This spectrum, which was obtained by subtracting the adsorbance of an assay inhibited by semicarbazide from that of the corresponding assay without semicarbazide, showed the expected maximum at 250 nm. The combined results from this study, the partial characterization of a major integral glycoprotein in adipocyte plasma membranes (18Jochen A. Guven S. Hays J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 277-281Google Scholar), and the cloning of HPAO (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar) show that vp97/HPAO is a semicarbazide-sensitive membrane amine oxidase. Moreover, since comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of HPAO with that of other amine oxidases revealed that it is a topa quinone and copper-containing enzyme (10Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Google Scholar), the membrane amine oxidase has this type of catalytic domain. Raimondi et al. (21Raimondi L. Pirsino R. Ignesti G. Capecchi S. Banchelli G. Buffoni F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 467-470Google Scholar) originally reported that white adipocytes contained a membrane-bound, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, for which benzylamine was a good substrate (Km = 12 μM). Our observation that the activity is highest in the plasma membrane agrees with the results of these authors, who found the highest activity in the crude membrane fraction that would be most enriched in plasma membranes (21Raimondi L. Pirsino R. Ignesti G. Capecchi S. Banchelli G. Buffoni F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 467-470Google Scholar). Moreover, localization of the oxidase in pig adipocytes by immunofluorescence with cross-reacting antibodies raised against the bovine serum oxidase showed the protein to be on the cell surface (22Raimondi L. Pirisino R. Banchelli G. Ignesti G. Conforti L. Romanelli E. Buffoni F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 102B: 953-960Google Scholar). We isolated the membrane-amine oxidase as a component of the GLUT4 vesicles. Other components of these vesicles, including GLUT4 itself and the 165-kDa membrane aminopeptidase, translocate to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (9Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6089-6092Google Scholar). However, as assessed both by staining for the protein and by activity, the membrane amine oxidase did not do so. One likely explanation for the difference derives from the nature of the GLUT4 vesicles isolated by immunoadsorption with anti-GLUT4. A recent study has shown that the vesicles are not homogeneous; a portion are fragmented endosomal membranes, and another portion may be specialized small secretory vesicles (23Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Google Scholar). Insulin probably increases the rate at which vesicles traffic from the endosomal system to the plasma membrane (24Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Google Scholar) and also may increase the rate at which the specialized secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane (25Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Google Scholar), but insulin treatment may not significantly reduce the membrane area of the endosomal system. If the latter is the case, the amount of GLUT4 vesicles derived from fragmented endosomes in insulin-treated cells may be about the same as for untreated cells. Thus if the intracellular portion of the membrane amine oxidase is primarily in endosomes rather than specialized secretory vesicles, then the amount of oxidase found in the GLUT4 vesicles, and the low density microsomes from which they are derived, will not decrease in response to insulin. The finding that the oxidase is more abundant in the plasma membranes than the low density microsomes is consistent with the fact that its short cytoplasmic domain contains neither the tyrosine nor the dileucine motif required for selective endocytosis from the plasma membrane (26Sandoval I.V. Baake O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Google Scholar). The physiological role of the membrane amine oxidase is not known. It may function to degrade bioactive amines, such as histamine, or amine products of intermediary metabolism, such as methylamine and aminoacetone (5Lyles G.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 293-303Google Scholar, 6Callingham B.A. Crosbie A.E. Rous B.A. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 305-321Google Scholar, 7Buffoni F. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 323-331Google Scholar).

The enzyme purified from pea seedlings can be activated by highly conserved soybean CaM, SCaM-1, but not by the divergent soybean CaM isoform, SCaM-4 (Lee, S. H., Kim, J. C., Lee, M. S., Heo, W.

To determine which domains were responsible for this differential activation of NAD kinase, a series of chimeric SCaMs were generated by exchanging functional domains between SCaM-4 and SCaM-1. SCaM-4111, a chimeric SCaM-1 that contains the first domain of SCaM-4, was severely impaired (only 40% of maximal) in its ability to activate NAD kinase. SCaM-1444, a chimeric SCaM-4 that contains the first domain of SCaM-1 exhibited nearly full (∼70%) activation of NAD kinase. Only chimeras containing domain I of SCaM-1 produced greater than half-maximal activation of NAD kinase. To define the amino acid residue(s) in domain I that were responsible for this differential activation, seven single residue substitution mutants of SCaM-1 were generated and tested for NAD kinase activation. Among these mutants, only K30E and G40D showed greatly reduced NAD kinase activation. Also a double residue substitution mutant, K30E/G40D, containing these two mutations in combination was severely impaired in its NAD kinase-activating potential, reaching only 20% of maximal activation. Furthermore, a triple mutation, K30E/M36I/G40D, completely abolished NAD kinase activation.

An important question to be answered for these compounds is the metabolic effect of inhibition of squalene synthase. The squalene synthase reaction consists of the reductive dimerization of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 1The abbreviations used are: FPPfarnesyl diphosphateFDDCA(s)farnesol-derived dicarboxylic acid(s)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. to form a molecule of squalene (10Epstein W.W. Rilling H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4597-4605Google Scholar). The primary consequence of inhibition of this reaction would be an accumulation of FPP. Thus, the metabolic fate of FPP in the presence of a squalene synthase inhibitor is of interest. Previous work in cultured cells has shown that in the presence of zaragozic acids, mevalonate metabolism is diverted into the production of farnesol and a 15-carbon dicarboxylic acid derivative of farnesoic acid (4Bergstrom J.D.

It has been reported that Drosophila Kc cell extracts and rat liver extracts metabolize both FPP and farnesol to farnesoic acid and two α,ω-prenyl dicarboxylic acids of 12 and 15 carbon atoms (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1301-1306Google Scholar). It was shown in very early studies that dicarboxylic acids derived from prenyl alcohols or aldehydes fed to rabbits are readily excreted in urine (12Hildebrandt H. Arch. Exp. Pathol.

As part of several studies on the in vivo effects of the zaragozic acids, the urinary production of organic acids was examined. A series of novel FDDCAs was found in the urine of dogs, rats, mice, and monkeys treated with zaragozic acid A, and these same dicarboxylic acids were not found in control animals. Furthermore, these compounds were sometimes found in massive quantities in the treated animals. In this paper, the isolation, the structural elucidation, and a method for the quantitation of some of these compounds are described. A scheme for the metabolic production of these acids is also proposed. [1-14C]Isopentenyl diphosphate (75 μCi, specific activity 60 mCi/mmol, American Radiochemicals, St. Louis, MO) was converted to [1-14C]FPP by incubation with 250 μl of 20 mM geranyl pyrophosphate and 0.175 units of purified prenyl transferase (2Bergstrom, J. D., Hensens, O. D., Huang, L., Liesch, J. M., Onishi, J. C., Vanmiddlesworth, F. L., (1992) U. S. Patent 5,096,923.Google Scholar) in a final volume of 600 μl also containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 6 mM dithiothreitol. [1-14C]FPP precipitated as a magnesium salt, and it was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mM EDTA. A 99% purity of [1-14C]FPP was found by HPLC. The yield of [1-14C]FPP from [1-14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate is typically around 90% with this procedure. [1-14C]FPP was converted to [1-14C]farnesol by further incubation for 2 h at 37°C with intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, 4 mg) at pH 9.5 in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ZnCl2. The final product was extracted by diethyl ether, and the purity was confirmed by HPLC. Animals were housed and cared for in keeping with the standards set forth in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication 86-23, 1985). Beagle dogs, approximately 1 year old, weighing about 10 kg, obtained from Marshal Farm, North Rose, NY, were used in this study. The dogs were fed a certified UAR EC Lab chow (approximately 350 g daily) and were housed individually. The dogs were fasted overnight prior to bleeding for clinical chemistry, necropsy, and during urine collection. Zaragozic acid A (0.5 mg/kg/day) was solubilized in isotonic saline, sterilized by filtration through Millex-GS (0.22-μm) filters, and administered by subcutaneous injections (right and left flank, alternatively) in a volume of 0.5 ml/kg of body weight. Female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Charles River and weighing between 130 and 160 g were used in this study. Animals were maintained on a standard rodent diet (Purina). Rats were dosed subcutaneously with zaragozic acid A dissolved in isotonic saline or were dosed by gavage with farnesol. For urine collection, animals were housed individually in metabolic cages throughout the period of collection. The HPLC system used was a Varian 5020. The effluent was monitored by a Hewlett-Packard diode array detector (1040A) over a range of 190-400 nm, with 225 nm being the primary wavelength and the bandwidth set at 4 nm. A 4.5-μl flow cell with a path length of 6 mm was used. Except when otherwise indicated, the reservoirs contained (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile also made 0.1% in formic acid by the addition of a small volume (1.042 ml/liter) of 96% stock formic acid (Aldrich). The gradients and the columns used will be described below. In the cases where radioactivity of the effluent was also measured, an IN/US β-RAM flow-through monitor with a 1-ml flow cell was used, connected in series after the UV detector. Scintillation fluid (IN/US In-Flow BD) was mixed with the effluent at a ratio of 4:1. The urine samples were diluted with an equal volume of methanol, and 40 μl of this dilution was injected into the column via either a Waters U6K injector or a Waters 712 WISP autosampler. A Zorbax C8-Rx column (250 × 4.6 mm) was used. A 40-min linear gradient (at 2 ml/min) from 5 to 45% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) was started immediately after injection, followed by a 10-min linear gradient from 45 to 100% acetonitrile (both containing 0.1% formic acid). This was followed by an isocratic step at 100% for an additional 5 min. A 5-ml sample of 24-h urine collected from a dog that had been treated with a subcutaneous dose of zaragozic acid A (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 28 days was taken to dryness in a Savant Speed-Vac concentrator, redissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile:water (80:20 v/v), and then injected. A preparative Zorbax ODS column (21.2 × 250 mm) was used with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Elution was performed with a 60-min linear gradient from 10 to 30% acetonitrile containing 0.03% formic acid. Selected fractions containing the peaks of compounds A, B, and C were pooled and taken to dryness in the Savant Speed-Vac concentrator. NMR analysis was performed on the samples, and structures were determined for the major components of the three isolates. Compounds D, E, F, and G were isolated in preparative runs on a Zorbax C8-Rx column (9.4 × 250 mm). Urine samples from rats treated with a subcutaneous dose of zaragozic acid A, 3 mg/kg for 5 days (peak D), rats treated with farnesol (500 μl, peak F), or rats treated with [1-14C]farnesol (400 μmol, peaks E and G) were taken to dryness in a Speed-Vac concentrator and redissolved in 200-500 μl of 50% acetonitrile:water and injected into the column. The elution systems and retention times for each of the peaks were: peak D, a 60-min linear gradient from 5 to 45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, with a retention time of 37.5 min; compound F, a 90-min linear gradient from 10 to 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, with a retention time of 62.2 min; compounds E and G, with retention times of 88 and 106.3 min, respectively, a 90-min linear gradient from 5 to 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid followed by a 10-min linear gradient from 40 to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and a 30-min isocratic step at 100% acetonitrile with a flow rate of 2 ml/min for the first 47 min and 1 ml/min for the rest of the run. The compounds isolated were analyzed by NMR. Twenty-five μCi of the [1-14C]farnesol (0.417 μmol) was evaporated to dryness with a resulting 20.7% loss in radioactivity counts. The dried [1-14C]farnesol (now 0.33 μmol) was dissolved in 500 μl (2.02 mmol) of “cold” farnesol (density 0.897, Aldrich). The final specific activity of the [1-14C]farnesol was 21,585 dpm/μmol. One hundred μl (400 μmol) of this [1-14C]farnesol was given to each of four different rats by oral gavage. The rats were placed in metabolic cages, and 24-h urines were collected. Aliquots of each urine were combined to provide pooled samples for analysis. Two-ml samples of pooled urine from the [1-14C]farnesol-treated rats were evaporated in the Savant Speed-Vac concentrator, and each was redissolved in 400 μl of 50% acetonitrile:water. For each run, 50 μl was injected onto a Zorbax C8-Rx column (9.4 × 250 mm). A flow rate of 2 ml/min was used. Elution was performed with a 60-min linear gradient from 5 to 40% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid), followed by a 10-min linear gradient from 40 to 100% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) and an isocratic step at 100% acetonitrile for the next 20 min. UV absorbance and radioactivity of the effluent were monitored simultaneously, as mentioned above. One-ml samples of urine from the animals were acidified to pH 1 with HCl and extracted with petroleum ether. The acidic aqueous layer was subsequently extracted with ethyl ether. The ethyl ether extract was dried under N2, and methyl esters were prepared with diazomethane (15Schlenk H. Gellerman J.L. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1412-1414Google Scholar). The dimethyl esters of the dicarboxylic acids were analyzed on a C18 column eluted with a gradient from 20 to 100% acetonitrile in water. NMR spectra were obtained in CD3OD on a Varian Unity Plus 400-MHz spectrophotometer at 25°C. Chemical shifts are in ppm relative to the CD2OD line set at 3.30 ppm. Examination of HPLC separations on an analytical C8 reverse phase column (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) of urine samples obtained from a dog treated with zaragozic acid A and from an untreated control dog clearly indicated at least three major peaks in the treated samples which were not present in the controls. One of the peaks had an absorbance maximum at 270 nm (Fig. 1) and the other two at 225 nm (Fig. 2). A comparison of the spectra of the three peaks is shown in Fig. 3. A preparative scale HPLC isolation of those three peaks was undertaken as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and each was examined by NMR. The NMR data are summarized in Table I, and the structures of compounds A, B, and C determined from the NMR data are shown in Fig. 4. Compound A was found to be 3-methyl-2,4-hexadien-1,6-dioic acid, a 7-carbon dienedioic acid. Compound B was found to be 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1,8-dioic acid, a 10-carbon dienedioic acid. Compound C was found to be 3,7-dimethyl-2-octaen-1,8-dioic acid, a 10-carbon monoenedioic acid. All three compounds were found to be α,ω-dicarboxylic acids. The methyl groups, the double bonds, and their positions strongly suggested that these compounds were isoprenoid-derived. The 270-nm maximum of compound A was consistent with the high degree of double bond conjugation. The double bonds found α,β to the carboxyl groups in compounds B and C were the chromophores responsible for the 225-nm maxima found for these two compounds.Fig. 2HPLC analysis of dog urine.

Compounds isolated from the urine of dogs and/or rats treated with zaragozic acid A or farnesol were identified by NMR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The urine of rats treated with zaragozic acid A was examined by analytical HPLC in a number of experiments. The HPLC profile shown in Fig. 5 is typical of the pattern seen in these experiments with rats. Peaks B and C corresponded in retention time to compounds B and C isolated from dog urine. Spiking the rat urine samples with compounds B and C isolated from dog urine confirmed that the peaks comigrated. Dimethyl esters of these acids from rat urine and of compounds B and C isolated from dog urine were prepared and separated by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two peaks having retention times identical to those of the dimethyl esters of compounds B and C from dog urine were found in rat urine. The two peaks from rat urine also had UV spectra identical to those of compounds B and C. Thus it was concluded that peaks B and C in Fig. 5 were the same two 10-carbon isoprenoid-derived dicarboxylic acids, compounds B and C, found in dog urine. The compounds from the two unidentified peaks, D and F in Fig. 5, were isolated by preparative HPLC runs (described under “Experimental Procedures”) in a manner similar to that used for the isolation of compounds A, B, and C. NMR analysis of the isolated free acids (Table I) led to the determination of the structures for compounds D and F shown in Fig. 4. Compound D, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octaen-1,8-dioic acid, is an isomer of compound C, containing the double bond in the 6,7 position rather than the 2,3 position. Compound F, 3,7-dimethyl-2,7,decadien-1,10-dioic acid, is a 12-carbon dienedioic acid. Again, the structures are consistent with an isoprenoid origin for these compounds. Each of these compounds contains a carboxyl with an α,β double bond, consistent with their absorption maxima at 225 nm. Because of the presence of a specific phosphatase (16Bansal V.S. Vaidya S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 393-399Google Scholar), excess FPP could be converted to farnesol, thus making farnesol the likely precursor for these isoprenoid-derived dicarboxylic acids. Dietary farnesol might be expected to have the same metabolic fate as farnesol produced by treatment with a squalene synthase inhibitor. To test this hypothesis, single doses of farnesol were administered orally to rats, and urine was collected for 24-h postdose and analyzed as before. As seen in Fig. 6, at a dose of 500 μl of farnesol/rat, the resulting HPLC profile was almost identical to that of the urine of the rat after 4 days of treatment with zaragozic acid A (3 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous). This demonstrates that the dicarboxylic acids observed upon inhibition of squalene synthase are farnesol-derived. Urine collected from rats dosed with the [1-14C]farnesol was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as before with simultaneous monitoring of UV absorbance and radioactivity (Fig. 7). The peaks corresponding to compounds B, C, D, and F were observed as before, but two new peaks, E and G, were observed which were radiolabeled and thus were derived from farnesol, but were lacking in significant UV absorbance. A preparative HPLC isolation was undertaken as described under “Experimental Procedures” to purify and identify the components of the two peaks. NMR analysis of the isolated peaks (Table I) revealed that the major components of peaks E and G had the structures indicated in Fig. 4. Compound E, 3,7-dimethyl-octan-1,8-dioic acid, was identified as a saturated 10-carbon analog of compounds B, C, and D. Compound G, 3,7-dimethyl-7-decaen-1,10-dioic acid, was a 12-carbon branched chain dicarboxylic acid with one double bond at C7. The saturated and the nonconjugated nature of the two structures, respectively, account for the lack of strong UV absorbance. A major analytical issue is the quantitation of the production of these dicarboxylic acids. We reasoned that if [1-14C]farnesol of known specific activity was fed to rats in quantity, the urinary dicarboxylic acids produced should have the same specific activity as the farnesol that is dosed. Dual monitoring of the HPLC effluent for radioactivity and for absorbance at 225 nm should enable the determination of the mass under each peak (from the dpm and the specific activity) and thus allow the determination of absorption coefficients for each of the UV-absorbing dicarboxylic acids. For the quantitation aspects of the experiment described above, both detectors had integration programs: the diode array detector presented the results for each peak as A225 nm area counts (absorbance at the specified wavelength multiplied by a time factor), whereas the radioactivity flow detector presented the flow-corrected cpm for each peak (computed from the counts recorded, the flow rates of the effluent and scintillation fluid, the size of the cell, and the frequency of reading). The counting efficiency of the flow detector (76.5%) was determined from the peak area flow-corrected cpm of an HPLC run with a known amount of [carboxy-14C]octanedioic acid (Sigma) which was injected under the same HPLC conditions. Using the specific activity of the farnesol, the counting efficiency and the integration results from the flow counter, it was possible to calculate the amount of dicarboxylic acid present in each peak. This, in turn, was related to the absorbance of the same peak to provide the final coefficient, in A225 nm area counts/nmol, which could now be used to calculate the amount of dicarboxylic acid in a sample when only UV data were available. The results of an experiment using two rats treated with radioactive farnesol in which these coefficients were determined are summarized in Table II.TABLE IISpecific absorption of dicarboxylic acid peaks in the urine of rats treated with farnesolRat no.PeakcpmnmolA225 nm area countsA225 nmaUsing determined factors for our HPLC system for the conversion of area counts to absorbance units, we were able to calculate molar absorption coefficients for the four dicarboxylic acids.

In Table III, the amounts of these four farnesol-derived dicarboxylic acids present in the 24-h urine during the 5th day of dosing with zaragozic acid A are shown.TABLE IIIDicarboxylic acids in the urine of rats treated with zaragozic acid APeakA225 nmSpecific Absorbance (from Table II)mmol/kg/daymg/kg/dayArea counts/15 μl urinearea counts/kg/day × 10−6area counts/nmolB10,17471.42470.28957C6,05142.51500.28357D8,46759.41460.40781F7,86655.21340.41293 Open table in a new tab The administration to an animal of a squalene synthase inhibitor, such as zaragozic acid A, will block the major pathway for the utilization of FPP, the synthesis of sterols. In liver, the utilization of FPP by other pathways such as the synthesis of dolichol and the prenylation of proteins is extremely limited when compared with the pathways for both the production of FPP and its utilization for sterol synthesis. In labeling experiments with mevalonic acid, typically greater than 95% of the label incorporated into the nonsaponifiable lipids is found in squalene, oxidosqualene, and the sterol peaks (4Bergstrom J.D.

A. 1993; 90: 80-84Google Scholar). Thus, the metabolic fate of FPP is a major issue in the development of a squalene synthase inhibitor as a cholesterol-lowering agent. FPP can be readily dephosphorylated to farnesol by a specific FPP pyrophosphatase (16Bansal V.S. Vaidya S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 393-399Google Scholar). This enzyme has a high Km of 7-30 μM for FPP compared with the Km of squalene synthase for FPP of 0.8-1.0 μM, and it should become more active as the FPP concentration rises in the presence of a squalene synthase inhibitor (16Bansal V.S. Vaidya S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 393-399Google Scholar). Previous studies (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1950; 37: 321-327Google Scholar) suggested that the urinary production of FDDCAs might be a likely consequence of inhibition of hepatic squalene synthase. Therefore, we collected the urine of animals treated with squalene synthase inhibitors and examined it for the presence of FDDCAs. Seven isoprenoid dicarboxylic acids were found in the urine of dogs or rats treated with a squalene synthase inhibitor or fed farnesol (Fig. 4). Compound B and compound D are apparently identical with Hildebrandt's acid and dihydro-Hildebrandt's acid, respectively, described previously (12Hildebrandt H. Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmakol. 1901; 45: 110Google Scholar, 13Kuhn R. Kohler F. Kohler L. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1936; 242: 171-197Google Scholar, 14Asano M. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1950; 37: 321-327Google Scholar), in the urine of rabbits fed citral, a 10-carbon isoprenoid aldehyde. Two new 10-carbon dicarboxylic acids are described here, compounds C and E. Two 12-carbon dicarboxylic acids (F and G), were also found. These two compounds are distinct from the C-12 dicarboxylic acid described by Gonzalez-Pacanowska et al. (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1301-1306Google Scholar) in that both have a Δ7 double bond, whereas the C-12 dicarboxylic acid described previously (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1301-1306Google Scholar) has a Δ6 double bond. The presence of the Δ7 double bond, rather than the Δ6 double bond found in farnesol, suggests further metabolism of these acids (see below) from that seen in vitro (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1301-1306Google Scholar). The seventh compound that has been found and characterized, compound A, is a C-7 dicarboxylic acid, and so far it has only been detected in dog urine. The profile of dicarboxylic acids produced by the in vivo inhibition of squalene synthase with the zaragozic acids was very similar to the profile produced by feeding farnesol (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that these dicarboxylics are farnesol-derived. Oxidation of farnesol can lead to the formation of farnesoic acid (17Christophe J. Popjak G. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 244-257Google Scholar). The dicarboxylic acid derivative of farnesoic acid can be generated by the process of ω-oxidation (11Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Arison B. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1301-1306Google Scholar). Once the ω-carboxyl is formed, β-oxidation becomes possible from the ω-end. A plausible scheme for the metabolic formation of these compounds starting with the CoA ester of the ω-carboxyl of the dicarboxylic acid of farnesol is illustrated in Fig. 8. In this scheme, the CoA esters of compounds B, C, and F are produced in an unbranched pathway by the action of the normal enzymes of β-oxidation and a dienoyl-CoA reductase 2The idea of these two steps being the most plausible enzymatic reactions to introduce the Δ7 double bond was suggested to us by Dr. Horst Schulze. (18Schulz H. Kunau W.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 403-406Google Scholar). Subsequent metabolism through β-oxidation could produce the CoA ester of compound A found in dog urine (reactions not shown in Fig. 8). Action by an acyl-CoA hydrolase would produce the free dicarboxylic acids, A, B, C, and F. It is apparent that reduction of the Δ2 double bond (reaction 8 in Fig. 8) can occur at some point in the metabolism of these compounds leading to the formation of compounds D, E, and G, but it is not clear to us by what process or enzyme this reduction is accomplished or at what point (possibly variable) in the scheme it takes place. This reduction apparently occurs in rats and mice 3V. Bansal and S. Vaidya, unpublished observations. but not in dogs or rhesus monkeys 4J. D. Bergstrom and R. Bostedor, unpublished results. because only acids with the Δ2 double bond were found in these species. It is suggested by the results that the pathway for the metabolism of these dicarboxylic acids may be very similar in all of the above species and may only differ in how far the β-oxidation proceeds before the removal of the CoA and whether or not there is reduction of the Δ2 double bond. The FDDCAs were not detectable in the urine of control animals. Their presence in the animals treated with a squalene synthase inhibitor is a demonstration of the in vivo efficacy of the zaragozic acids. Should a squalene synthase inhibitor ever reach clinical trials, the urinary production of these or related dicarboxylic acids might be of use in demonstrating and monitoring the in vivo efficacy of potential drugs even in single dose experiments. The presence of the FDDCAs in the urine of animals treated with a squalene synthase inhibitor was expected; however, what was not expected was the level at which they were found. The urine from the first dog examined had levels of compounds A, B, and C in concentrations of about 0.1 mg/ml each. In rats treated with zaragozic acid A for 5 days (Table III) the total of compounds B, C, D, and F produced exceeded 250 mg/kg/day. This underestimates the total production of FDDCAs since compounds E and G were not determined because of their lack of UV absorbance. These results suggest that production of FDDCAs can be a major metabolic consequence of inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by a squalene synthase inhibitor. Further reports from our laboratory will show that there are striking variations in the urinary levels of these dicarboxylic acids found in various species treated with the zaragozic acids and that in some species a mechanism-based toxicity is observed. This toxicity is an acidosis that results from the overproduction of these FDDCAs. 5J. D. Bergstrom, M. Kurtz, R. Bostedor, G. Lankus, V. Bansal, and J. Karkas, manuscript in preparation.

This chimera binds a nonselective opioid ligand but is devoid of affinity for δ-selective ligands.

Using a ligand binding assay, we screened this library to select mutants with high affinity for δ-selective ligands. Sequence analysis of these revertants revealed that a leucine at position 300, a hydrophobic region (amino acids 295-300), and an arginine at position 291 of the human δ-opioid receptor were present in all revertants. Single and double point mutations were then introduced in δ/μ291-300 to evaluate the contribution of the leucine 300 and arginine 291 residues for the binding of δ-selective ligands. An increased affinity for δ-selective ligands was observed when the tryptophan 300 (μ residue) of δ/μ291-300 was reverted to a leucine (δ residue).

Further site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that the presence of a tryptophan at position 300 may block the access of δ-selective ligands to their docking site. The opioid receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and mediate the diverse effects of endogenous opioid peptides and opiate drugs (1Simon E.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 463: 31-45Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies have defined at least three classes of opioid receptors, named δ, μ, and κ, that differ in their affinity for ligands and in their distribution in the nervous system (1Simon E.J.

Martin W.R. Gilman A. Rall J. Nies A. Taylor P. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 485-573Google Scholar), are generally thought to be mediated by the stimulation of μ receptors. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that selective stimulation of the δ receptor may also mediate antinociception (12Frederickson R.C. Smithwick E.L. Shuman R. Bemis K.G.

The strongest indication of an involvement of δ-opioid receptors in supraspinal antinociception follows from studies with selective antagonists (14Portoghese P.S. Larson D.L. Sayre L.M. Fries D.S. Takemori A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 233-234Google Scholar, 15Hahn E.F. Carroll-Buatti M. Pasternak G.W. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 572-576Google Scholar, 16Heyman J.S. Mulvaney S.A. Mosberg H.I.

These studies demonstrated that the antinociception produced by intracerebroventricular injection of morphine and [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (μ agonists) was antagonized by β-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine (μ antagonists) but not by ICI-174864 (δ antagonists). Conversely, the antinociception produced by intracerebroventricular injection of DPDPE 1The abbreviations used are: DPDPEcyclic [D-penicillamine2, D-penicillamine5]enkephalinSNC-121(+)-4-[(αR)-α((2S,5R)-4-propyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamidehDORhuman δ-opioid receptor (δ agonist) was antagonized by ICI-174864 but not by β-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine. Moreover, studies have shown that an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the cloned δ-opioid receptor given intrathecally lowers δ but not μ or κ spinal (20Standifer K.M. Chien C.C. Wahlestedt C.

Life Sci. 1994; 55: 37-43Google Scholar) analgesia. These studies confirm, at the molecular level, traditional pharmacological studies implying distinct receptor mechanisms for δ, μ, and κ analgesia. The development of selective and potent δ-opioid agonists therefore presents the potential for the discovery of novel analgesic agents with reduced accompanying side effects. cyclic [D-penicillamine2, D-penicillamine5]enkephalin (+)-4-[(αR)-α((2S,5R)-4-propyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide human δ-opioid receptor The recent cloning of the genes encoding the opioid receptors showed that they are members of the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family (22Evans C.J.

The highest sequence homology between the three opioid receptor subtypes resides in the transmembrane domains and the intracellular loops. Lower sequence homology is seen in the N and C termini, transmembrane domain 4, and extracellular loops 2 and 3. It is likely that some of these divergent regions contain elements responsible for the discrimination among these receptors by the subtype-selective opioid ligands. The construction of chimeric receptors is a powerful approach to investigate the structural basis for the subtype specificity of G protein-coupled receptor (29Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 311: 285-292Google Scholar) have demonstrated, using chimeras, the importance of the third extracellular loop of the δ-opioid receptor for δ ligand selectivity. Most mutagenesis experiments designed to analyze the structure and function of G protein-coupled receptor involve a strategy based on the loss of function. Thus, even in well controlled studies, the interpretation of these experiments is often difficult since a loss of function may result from various causes. A mutant receptor may lack affinity for a ligand because a critical residue of the binding pocket has been hit but also because the mutated receptor is unable to traffic efficiently to the cell surface or because the mutation induces protein misfolding, allosteric changes, or gross structural defect. Furthermore, the direct determination of G protein-coupled receptor three-dimensional structure is hampered by technical difficulties limiting their overexpression and purification in quantities that would permit crystallographic studies. Today, only relatively low resolution structural information has been obtained for the bacteriorhodopsin and bovine rhodopsin from two-dimensional cryo-electromicroscopic experiments (41Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Google Scholar, 42Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Cesca T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar). For these reasons, we have designed a mutagenesis strategy based on the restoration of a lost function to identify amino acid sequence combinations critical to confer δ-selective ligand binding to an opioid receptor. pcDNA3-hDOR consists of a 1.2-kilobase cDNA EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the δ-opioid receptor (23Kieffer B.L. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12048-12052Google Scholar) sub-cloned at the EcoRI-XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Using unique site elimination (USE) mutagenesis (43Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar), pcDNA3-hDOR was mutated to pcDNA3-δ/μ291-300 by replacing 10 amino acids (positions 291-300) of the third extracellular loop of the δ receptor with the corresponding amino acids from the μ receptor. The selection primer was designed to mutate the unique PvuI site of pcDNA3-hDOR to a EcoRV site (5′-GCT CCT TCG GTC CTC GAT ATC TTG TCA GAA GTA AGT TGG C-3′) and primer δ/μ291-300 (5′-GTC TGG ACG CTG GTG GAC ATC GAC CCA GAA ACT ACG TTC CAG ACT GTT TCT TGG CAC CTG TGC ATC GCG CTG GGT TAC-3′) was used to produce the pcDNA3-δ/μ291-300 chimera. The library of mutants of the δ/μ291-300 chimera was produced by USE mutagenesis (43Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar) using pcDNA3-δ/μ291-300 as the parental vector. A degenerated primer, δ/μ291-300.degenerated (5′-GTC TGG ACG CTG GTG GAC ATC GAC C c/g A g/c a/g A a/g c/a T a/c CG TT c/g c/g a/t G a/g c/t T G t/c T t/g CT T g/t G CAC CTG TGC ATC GCG CTG GGT TAC-3′) was designed to randomly and independently revert amino acids of the μ sequence to the original δ sequence (16,384 possible combinations). Each degenerated position contained an equal ratio of the nucleotide from the μ or the δ sequence. This degenerated primer was used with a selection primer EcoRV to PvuI (5′-GCT CCT TCG GTC CTC CGA TCG TTG TCA GAA GTA AGT TGG C-3′) to perform a mutagenesis reaction on pcDNA3-δ/μ291-300. This synthesis mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and pools of clones were randomly selected. Plasmid DNA from each pool was isolated using QIAprep 8 plasmid kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and used for transfection into HEK 293s cells. Single and double point mutations were introduced into δ/μ291-300 chimera using Clontech site-directed mutagenesis kit which is based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff (43Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). In a first mutant, we introduced a single mutation that converts tryptophan residue 300 to leucine residue (δ/μ291-300 (W300L)). Another mutant of the chimera was constructed into which proline residue 291 was converted to arginine residue (δ/μ291-300 (P291R)). A double mutation was also introduced into the δ/μ291-300 chimera that converts proline 291 to arginine and tryptophan 300 to leucine (δ/μ291-300 (P291R/W300L)). Sequences of the primers were 5′-CTG GTG GAC ATC GAC CGA GAA ACT ACG TTC CAG-3′, 5′-TTC CAG ACT GTT TCT TTG CAC CTG TGC ATC GCG-3′, and 5′-CTG GTG GAC ATC GAC CGA GAA ACT ACG TTC CAG ACT GTT TCT TTG CAC CTG TGC ATC GCG-3′ to obtain P291R, W300L, and P291R/W300L mutations, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293s cells (obtained from Michael Matthew, Cold Spring Harbor) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected according to the procedure of Chen and Okayama (44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using 15 μg of expression vectors and 1 × 106 cells per 25-cm2 flasks. Binding of δ-selective ligands (SNC-121 and DPDPE) to the transfected cells was monitored 48 h after transfection. Pools containing 50 clones each were screened for the presence of revertant mutants with affinity for δ-selective ligands using a radioactive ligand binding assay. Cells transfected with pools of the library were assayed 48 h post-transfection for the binding of δ-selective ligands [3H]DPDPE (peptide agonist) and [3H]SNC-121 (non-peptide agonist) (45Ni Q. Xu H. Partilla J.S. Calderon S.N. Porreca F. Rice K.C. Bertha C.M. McNutt R.W. Ananthan S. Rothman R.B. Analgesia. 1995; 1: 185-193Google Scholar). Glycerol stocks of E. coli transformants corresponding to positive pools were partitioned into smaller pools of 10 clones using a row/column strategy. One hundred colonies from each positive pool were inoculated on a Petri dish using 10 rows × 10 columns pattern. After overnight incubation, the 10 colonies from each row and each column were pooled into 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and incubated overnight at 37°C. DNA from each pool was prepared as described and transfected into 293s cells for ligand binding analysis. Colonies at the intersection of a positive column and a positive row were selected for sequencing and further pharmacological characterization. The sequence of the revertants was determined by dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method using T7-DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and α-35S-dATP (DuPont NEN). For the receptor binding study, HEK 293s cells expressing pools of mutant receptors were harvested 48 h after transfection and resuspended in 1.5 ml of membrane buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose). Cells were then frozen/thawed, and an aliquot was used for the radioligand binding assay. Cells (50 μl) were incubated in a final volume of 150 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with [3H]bremazocine (6.9 nM, specific activity 30 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN) (46Romer D. Buscher H. Hill R.C. Maurer R. Petcher T.J. Welle H.B. Bakel H.C. Akkerman A.M. Life Sci. 1980; 27: 971-978Google Scholar), 3H-labeled [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin ([3H]DPDPE) (6 nM, specific activity 31.4 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN), or [3H]SNC-121 (tritiated version of SNC-80) (6 nM, specific activity 26.3 Ci/mmol) (from John Partilla, NIDA) for 90 min at room temperature. For saturation experiments, duplicates contained 0.3-15 nM [3H]bremazocine, [3H]DPDPE, or [3H]SNC-121. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μM naloxone. For competition experiments, duplicate contained ≈2.5 nM [3H]bremazocine and 1 pM to 10 μM DPDPE or SNC-80. Reactions were terminated by filtration on polyethyleneimine-precoated GF/B Whatman filters. The filters were washed three times with ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2) and dried. Bound radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter. Specific binding was determined as the difference between binding in the absence or presence of an excess of unlabeled naloxone (10 μM). Curve fitting and analysis of the binding data were performed using the GraphPad Prism program version 1.03 (1994). The three-dimensional model of human δ-opioid receptor was constructed following a general procedure to build G protein-coupled receptors. There are three steps in this procedure. First, we identified the transmembrane helical domains from sequence alignments of the opioid receptor subfamily. Using the identified sequences, we built the initial helices bundle and then searched for the maximum interactions among these seven helices using a mixed molecular dynamics and conformational search procedure with the restraints from the projection density maps of rhodopsin (41Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Google Scholar). Finally we added the extracellular loops obtained from the Protein Data base based on the sequence homology analysis. The sequence of human δ-opioid receptor (47Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Fang L. Li X. Babin E. Nguyen M. Santoro G. Varga E.V. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 463-469Google Scholar) (Genbank P41143) was first submitted to the TMAP procedure of EMBL (48Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Google Scholar) to search for the opioid receptor family and to identify the transmembrane helical regions. The assumption that the arginine and lysine residues are most likely at the end of helices (49Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Google Scholar) was further used to adjust the helical regions. The initial helix building, the sequence homology, and the final structure refinement were performed using Quanta/CHARMM (Biosym/MSI). The mixed molecular dynamics and conformational search procedure was developed in-house. Fig. 1 illustrates the mutagenesis strategy we have designed to identify residues critical for the binding of δ-selective ligands. This strategy relied on the restoration of a function rather than the loss of a function. A chimeric receptor unable to bind the δ-selective ligands was used as template in a mutagenesis reaction. The amino acid sequence over the μ region (Fig. 1) was mutated using a degenerated oligonucleotide. The resulting library of mutants was then separated in pools of 50 clones. The plasmid DNA from each pool of clones were isolated and transfected into HEK 293s cells. The presence of a receptor mutant within a pool was detected if the transfected cells expressed a binding site for the selective ligand. The pool was then gradually split to isolate the clone responsible for the δ-selective ligand binding activity. The DNA sequences of revertant clones were determined and compared to identify common structural features. Evidence from different groups has suggested that the third extracellular loop of δ-opioid receptors is involved in the binding of selective ligands (35Valiquette M. Vu H.K. Yue S.Y. Wahlestedt C. Walker P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18789-18796Google Scholar, 36Fukuda K. Kato S. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6702-6709Google Scholar, 37Minami M. Onogi T. Nakagawa T. Katao Y. Aoki Y.

A. 1995; 92: 12436-12440Google Scholar). A chimeric δ-opioid receptor in which 10 amino acids of the third extracellular loop (amino acids 291 to 300) were replaced by the corresponding amino acids from the μ receptor was constructed. HEK 293s cells were transfected with the plasmid DNA coding for the chimera, and radioligand binding assays using the nonselective [3H]bremazocine or δ-selective ligands [3H]SNC-121 and [3H]DPDPE were performed 48 h post-transfection. The radioligand binding properties of δ/μ291-300 chimera are shown in Fig. 2A and summarized in Table I. This chimera binds the nonselective opioid ligand bremazocine with the same affinity as the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2A and Table I). However, it does not bind δ-selective ligands such as [3H]DPDPE or [3H]SNC-121 (Fig. 2A and Table I).TABLE I.Ligand binding characteristics of wild-type, chimeric, and mutated receptors[3H]Bremazocine[3H]DPDPE [3H]SNC-121BmaxKdKdpmol/mgnMnMhDOR1.1 ± 0.193.4 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.36.8 ± 2Δ/μ291-3000.81 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.2NBaNB, no detectable binding.NB2.400.43 ± 0.041.5 ± 0.26 ± 25.6 ± 1.529.40.19 ± 0.0022.2 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.77 ± 337.50.29 ± 0.103.6 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.34.4 ± 1.332.450.50 ± 0.151.3 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.56.7 ± 0.932.550.30 ± 0.045.6 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.35.2 ± 1.516.9.90.17 ± 0.043.8 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.43.3 ± 0.816.9.180.67 ± 0.363.9 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.34 ± 0.318.6.30.78 ± 0.173.1 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.29.7 ± 1.5a NB, no detectable binding. Open table in a new tab We then randomly and independently substituted μ residues of this chimera with the corresponding δ residues. To this end, we used a degenerated primer (δ/μ291-300.deg) to mutate this 10-amino acid region. The primer was designed to allow each residue of this stretch to be either of the μ or the δ sequence. Owing to the design of the primer, some positions could also code for non-μ and non-δ residues (see Fig. 2B). Using the pcDNA3-δ/μ291-300 plasmid as a template and δ/μ291-300.degenerated as the mutagenic primer, we performed a mutagenic synthesis theoretically generating all the possible combinations of μ, δ, or non-μ, non-δ residues over the 10 amino acids of the third extracellular loop of δ/μ291-300 (Fig. 2B). This represents 16,384 possible combinations. To evaluate the frequency of amino acid substitution over the targeted 10-amino acid stretch, 50 clones of the mutant receptor library were randomly selected and subjected to DNA sequencing. Sequence analysis of the clones showed that 90% of these clones were mutated and contained 48.3% amino acid substitution at a position where a combination of two residues was possible and a percentage of substitution increased to 76% at a position where a combination of four different residues was possible (Fig. 3). These results indicate that amino acid substitution occurred randomly and without any preference for one or the other sequence. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the size of the pools where a single revertant would be detected using radioligand binding assays. We transfected HEK 293s cells with different dilutions of the wild-type hDOR expression vector corresponding to pools of 1-10,000 clones that would contain a single colony encoding a wild-type hDOR receptor. In this experiment, we observed that statistically significant specific binding can be detected using pools of 500 clones (one of which being hDOR) using [3H]SNC-121 (6 nM) or [3H]DPDPE (6 nM) as radioligands (data not shown). After performing a series of preliminary experiments to determine the ideal pool size, we decided to screen pools of 50 clones. DNA from pools of 50 clones each were then transfected into HEK 293s cells according to the procedure of Chen and Okayama (44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Radioligand binding assays using δ-selective ligands were performed 48 h after transfection. Forty pools of 50 clones were transfected into HEK 293s cells and screened independently with [3H]DPDPE or [3H]SNC-121 in the presence or absence of 10 μM naloxone. From this first screen, 6 positive pools (pool 2, 16, 18, 29, 32, and 37) were selected since they displayed significant affinity for [3H]DPDPE and [3H]SNC-121. These δ-selective binding pools were subdivided into smaller pools using the row/column strategy described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each pool contained one revertant except pools 16 and 32 from which two positive clones were obtained, yielding a total of eight revertants (Table I). The plasmid DNAs encoding the eight revertant receptors were transfected into HEK 293s cells, and the transfected cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. Saturation binding experiments using [3H]SNC-121, [3H]DPDPE, and [3H]bremazocine were performed to determine the respective Kd values for each of the revertants. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]bremazocine were used to evaluate binding site levels. The examination of Bmax values (Table I) indicates that mutations under study do not drastically modify receptor expression in HEK 293s cells. Expression levels of most of the mutants are not significantly modified. Bmax values of 29.4, 37.5, 32.55, 16.9.9 and hDOR(R291P) mutants are slightly decreased, but radioligand binding remains nevertheless easily detectable. All the identified revertants display affinity for the δ-selective ligand ([3H]SNC-121 and [3H]DPDPE) and nonselective ligand ([3H]bremazocine) similar to the wild-type δ-opioid receptor. Interestingly, all the revertants regained the ability to bind both [3H]SNC-121 and [3H]DPDPE. No statistical differences were noted between the Kd values measured for the different revertants. The sequences of the revertant mutants were determined and are shown in Fig. 4. Analysis of the sequence of these revertants revealed that an arginine at position 291 and a leucine at position 300 (from the δ sequence) were present in all the revertants (Fig. 4). Amino acids from either the δ, μ, or non-μ/non-δ sequence were found at positions 292-294 suggesting that these residues are not critical for the binding of δ-selective ligand (Fig. 4). Moreover, all revertants had acquired a stretch of hydrophobic residues at positions 295-300 (valine, alanine, and leucine), a characteristic of the δ receptor in this region (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The hydrophobic residues found at positions 295-300 were either from the δ sequence, the μ sequence, or from non-δ or non-μ sequence.Fig. 5Hydrophilicity analysis of the revertant mutants. Hydrophilicity analyses of the amino acid sequence of the revertants were performed using MacVector program (version 4.1.4) from Kodak International Biotechnologies Inc. Values above the axis denote hydrophilic regions that may be exposed on the outside of the molecule; values below the axis indicate the hydrophobic regions that tend to be buried inside the molecule or inside other hydrophobic environments such as membranes. We have used the Kyte and Doolittle scale with a window size of seven residues and an amphiphilicity window size of 11. Underlined amino acids are from δ sequence.

We examine the mechanisms by which the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of nonaberrant mRNAs acts to modulate both these processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Two classes of functional relationship between ribosome-5′-UTR interactions and mRNA decay are identifiable. In the first of these, elements in the main open reading frame (ORF) dictate how the decay process reacts to inhibitory structures in the 5′-UTR. The same types of stability modulation can be elicited by trans-regulation of translation via inducible binding of the iron-regulatory protein to an iron-responsive element located 9 nucleotides from the 5′ cap. A eukaryotic translational repressor can therefore modulate mRNA decay via the 5′-UTR. In contrast, translational regulation mediated via changes in the activity of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4E bypasses translation-dependent pathways of mRNA degradation. Thus modulation of mRNA stability via the 5′-UTR depends on disruption of the scanning process, rather than changes in translational initiation efficiency per se In the second class of pathway, an upstream ORF (uORF) functions as a powerful destabilizing element, inducing termination-dependent degradation that is apparently independent of any main ORF determinants but influenced by the efficiencies of ribosomal recognition of the uORF start and stop codons. This latter mechanism provides a regulatable means to modulate the stability of nonaberrant mRNAs via a UPF-dependent pathway.

To examine aggrecan cleavage by MMP-8 at this aggrecanase site, we evaluated the release of fragments with the N terminus ARGSVIL from freeze-thawed bovine nasal cartilage using the monoclonal antibody BC-3. Recombinant human MMP-8 catalytic domain cleaved native aggrecan in a concentration-related manner between 0.2 and 2 μg/ml, with complete release of glycosaminoglycan at 2 μg/ml or greater. Cleavage at the aggrecanase site was observed only at MMP-8 concentrations resulting in complete release of glycosaminoglycan from the cartilage, suggesting that preferential cleavage occurs at a different site. Time course studies indicated that only following depletion of substrate containing the preferred clip site did MMP-8 rapidly cleave at the aggrecanase site.

https://openalex.org/W1979878704,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a facultative anaerobe capable of meeting its energy requirements by fermentation and is thus an ideal system for studying the biogenesis of respiring mitochondria. We have isolated a respiration-deficient mutant exhibiting a pleiotropic loss of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The corresponding wild-type gene, COQ5, was cloned, sequenced, and able to restore respiratory growth. Deletion of the chromosomal COQ5 gene results in a respiration deficiency and reduced levels of respiratory protein components. Exogenously added decylubiquinone can partially restore electron transport chain function to mitochondrial membranes from the deletion mutant. The COQ5 nucleotide sequence predicts a polypeptide of 307 amino acids containing a mitochondrial targeting signal. COQ5p is 43% identical to the polypeptide predicted by the Escherichia coli open reading frame, o251 (1). The COQ5 gene, when introduced into E. coli, complements the respiratory deficiency of an ubiE mutant that maps near o251, suggesting that it is the yeast homolog of the ubiE gene product.

The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the ideal organism for investigating the processes necessary for the production and maintenance of a functional electron transport chain in the mitochondria because it is able to make sufficient ATP for growth by fermentation. Respiration-deficient mutants form smaller colonies than wild-type cells when grown on glucose-containing media, and are therefore called petite Such mutants can arise in two ways, by mutation of the nuclear genome giving rise to nuclear petites or by mutation of the mitochondrial genome giving rise to cytoplasmic petites Thus, the biogenesis of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is a complex process involving the coordinate expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Ubiquinone is a lipid component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that serves to transport electrons from the NADH or succinate dehydrogenase complexes to the cytochrome bc1 complex, where it functions in a Q 1The abbreviations used are: Qubiquinonekbkilobase pair(s)TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine cycle to generate a proton motive force across the inner membrane (2Trumpower B.L.

In addition to its mitochondrial location, ubiquinone is found in a variety of intracellular membranes and in lipoproteins, where it may serve as an antioxidant (3Ernster L. Forsmark-Andree P. Clin.

Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). The proposed pathway for ubiquinone biosynthesis is derived from the accumulation of intermediates in mutant strains of Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5; Refs. 5Gibson F. Young I.G.

We have been interested in the biogenesis of the succinate dehydrogenase complex of the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid. This enzyme is composed of four nuclear encoded protein products, a covalent FAD cofactor, iron-sulfur clusters, and heme and donates the electrons derived from succinate to ubiquinone (12Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar). To better understand the biogenesis of this enzyme, we have isolated nuclear petite mutants that are defective in succinate dehydrogenase. Mutations affecting the biogenesis of more than one enzyme will have pleiotropic effects on mitochondrial function. A large number of pleiotropic mutants have been isolated, but few have been studied (4Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). We have studied one such mutant, TCM7, that has lost several respiratory chain activities including succinate oxidase activity. The TCM7 mutant was complemented to respiration proficiency by transformation with a genomic yeast DNA library. The complementing gene, identified as COQ5, has been cloned, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. It corresponds to a hypothetical protein encoded on chromosome XIII, YM8339.09c, whose sequence is retrievable under the GenBank™ accession number P49017. COQ5 encodes a protein of 34.7 kDa (307 amino acids), which has an amino terminus that resembles a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The COQ5 gene probably encodes a methyltransferase in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway, since its expression in E. coli can complement a ubiE mutant, which lacks the 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase. Furthermore, the succinate oxidase activities of cytoplasmic membranes from an E. coli ubiE mutant or of yeast mitochondrial membranes from a coq5 mutant can be partially restored in vitro by the addition of quinone analogs. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast media have been described (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Muller J.L.M. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 441-450Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes were isolated and assayed for the NADH- and the succinate-dependent reduction of cytochrome c as described (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar), and strains, such as TCM7, displaying an apparently selective loss of the succinate-dependent activity were further analyzed. The mutant, TCM7, was transformed with a yeast genomic DNA library (17Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Google Scholar) and transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy on SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose plates. Approximately 6,000 transformants were replica-plated to SG (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 3% glycerol) plates to test for complementation to respiration proficiency. The plasmids were recovered and analyzed by restriction mapping; this resulted in the isolation of two complementing plasmids with overlapping inserts. A 3.0-kb restriction fragment from a partial Sau3AI digest was cloned into the vector, YCplac33 (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Google Scholar), to give the complementing plasmid, p7S6. Exonuclease digestions and the production of nested deletions were performed as described by the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All deletions affecting the COQ5 open reading frame resulted in the loss of complementation. The COQ5 gene sequence was obtained for both strands using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. The plasmid, pSK7-TRP (described in the legend to Fig. 1), was linearized and used to transform MH125 and MH123 to tryptophan prototrophy by selection on SD medium supplemented with histidine, uracil, and leucine. At least 30 stably transformed, MH125-derived tryptophan prototrophs had also lost the ability to grow on YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), and 4 were further examined. Polymerase chain reactions (19Jesnowski R. Naehring J. Wolf K. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 318-319Google Scholar) with the oligonucleotides 5′-TGGAAACTAGCTTCCGCATT-3′ and 5′-CTAACAGTAATCTCGCAGTT-3′ were used to amplify the COQ5 region and verify the presence of the disruption allele, coq5Δ-1::TRP1, in the transformants. A polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides 5′-CATAGATTGTGGAAGGACCA-3′ and 5′-CTTCGTCGACTTACAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCACCTCCAACTTTAATGCCCCAATGG-3′ was performed to add the 10-residue c-myc protooncogene sequence recognized by the monoclonal antibody, 9E10, to the carboxyl terminus of COQ5p (20Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Google Scholar). The latter oligonucleotide also incorporates two glycine residues between the COQ5 and the c-myc sequences, a stop codon, and a SalI restriction site for cloning. The carboxyl-terminal 280 base pairs of COQ5, now tagged with the myc sequence were amplified, digested with XbaI and SalI, and cloned into likewise digested p7S6 to generate p7S6myc encoding the tagged protein. The amplified region was sequenced to confirm the construction. For overexpression of the tagged COQ5p, the 1.0-kb MunI to SalI fragment encoding the entire gene was cloned into the vector, pUCu, under control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter (20Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Google Scholar) to generate pUCu-7myc. This plasmid was introduced into MH125, the transformants were grown on lactate medium (21Yaffe M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Google Scholar) and inoculated into lactate medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml histidine, leucine, and tryptophan containing 0.5 mM CuSO4. Samples for Western blot analysis were prepared and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar) and detected with the monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hercules, CA), and the ECL detection system (Amersham Canada Ltd., Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The 1.0-kb MunI to SalI fragment from p7S6myc was cloned into pBluescript II KS− under the control of the T7 promoter. Template mRNA was produced by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described by the supplier (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using Tran35S-Label (ICN Biomedicals, St. Laurent, Quebec). Import reactions were performed as described (22Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10101-10107Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for plasmid isolation from E. coli (23Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondrial membranes and enzymatic activities were measured as described (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar). Everted bacterial vesicles were prepared (24Dibrov P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 530-534Google Scholar), and respiratory activities were measured in a Clark-type electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK). The ubiquinone analogs, decylubiquinone (Q0), and 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q2) (Sigma) were added as ethanolic solutions. Immunofluorescence localization of COQ5p was performed as described (25Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Google Scholar) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse as secondary antibody (Chemicon). Ubiquinone and its intermediates were isolated from E. coli by extraction with ethanol/ethyl ether (3:1) as described (26Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 137-165Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanisms by which complex membrane proteins are assembled into the mitochondrial inner membrane, we have screened for mutants that are defective in the activity of our model protein, succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenase mutants are unable to grow on glycerol as a sole carbon source but still possess a functional electron transport chain linking NADH or glycerol-1-phosphate oxidation to the reduction of oxygen (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar, 27Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Google Scholar). In our screen, we took advantage of the observation that strains unable to grow on glycerol form small or petite colonies on YPDG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1% dextrose, 3% glycerol) plates (28Mattoon J.R. Beck J.C. Carvajal E. Malamud D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 117-131Google Scholar). ρ0 or ρ− strains that are completely lacking an electron transport chain due to defects in their mitochondrial genomes were identified by their inability to reduce tetrazolium dye and eliminated. The secretion of acid, as monitored by the indicator dye, bromcresol purple, is taken as an indication of tricarboxylic acid cycle mutants (14de Kok J. Muller J.L.M. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 441-450Google Scholar). Tetrazolium staining, acid-secreting petites were grown on liquid YPD-0.6% (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 0.6% glucose, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.12% (NH4)2SO4, pH 6.2), harvested, and lysed in a French pressure cell to isolate submitochondrial membranes (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar). Succinate- and NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities were measured; loss of the former and retention of the latter activity was taken as a preliminary indication of a succinate dehydrogenase mutant. In MH125, a substantial amount of antimycin A-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was induced, a phenomenon that has been reported previously (29Beattie D.S. Japa S. Howton M. Zhu Q.-S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 499-505Google Scholar, 30de Santis A. Melandri B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 354-365Google Scholar). This resulted in the isolation of putative succinate dehydrogenase mutants, which upon closer examination were revealed to have pleiotropic losses of mitochondrial respiratory functions. The mutant, TCM7, is thus a nuclear petite with a pleiotropic loss of most respiratory chain proteins, including the cytochrome bc1 complex and succinate dehydrogenase. It defines one of four complementation groups isolated. When the mutant is mated and the resulting diploid is sporulated, the respiration deficiency in TCM7 segregates 2:2 in over 20 tetrads as expected of a single-gene, nuclear mutation. To more fully characterize the function of the TCM7 gene in a nonmutagenized background, we decided to clone the wild-type gene (see “Experimental Procedures”) and to create a null allele by a one-step gene disruption (Fig. 1). The plasmid, pSK7-TRP, was transformed into the haploid, MH125, and the diploid, MH123, and tryptophan prototrophs were selected. Verification of the presence of the tcm7Δ-1::TRP1 allele in both haploid and diploid transformants was shown by polymerase chain reactions using genomic DNA as template (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). The successful isolation of disruption mutants in the haploid, MH125, indicates that TCM7 is not essential for viability (lane 4). The disruption mutant, ED7, like TCM7, is respiration-deficient; it does not grow on YPG and has a low growth yield on a medium containing low levels of glucose (not shown). When mated to the tcm7-1 mutant, TCM7-2A5A, ED7 was not complemented, indicating the tcm7Δ-1::TRP1 allele belongs to the same complementation group as the tcm7-1 mutation in TCM7-2A5A and TCM7. ED7 is also rescued to respiration proficiency by the plasmid, p7S6. When a diploid carrying a single copy of the tcm7Δ-1::TRP1 disruption is sporulated, respiration deficiency and tryptophan prototrophy cosegregated in six dissected tetrads. As discussed below, we discovered that the cloned TCM7 gene could complement an E. coli ubiquinone biosynthetic mutant. This raised the possibility that the TCM7 gene encodes an enzyme of the yeast ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. When TCM7 or ED7 are mated to the known coq5 mutant, CH83-B3, the diploids remain respiration-deficient, demonstrating that the mutations are allelic. As a control, we ensured that all haploids were ρ+ by mating them to the ρ0 tester strains and verifying the respiration competency of these diploids. Furthermore, we could complement the coq5 mutants, CH83-B1 and CH83-B3, with the plasmid p7S6. From these data, we conclude that TCM7 and ED7 are coq5 mutants, and we refer to the TCM7 gene as COQ5 We could not restore respiratory growth to TCM7 or ED7 by supplementing the medium with coenzyme Q2, but this property is not universal to ubiquinone biosynthetic mutants (31Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 826-831Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the COQ5 gene was determined and is identical to part of the sequence found in GenBank™ (accession number Z49210). The predicted protein sequence suggests that COQ5p is synthesized as a precursor protein that is imported into and cleaved by mitochondria, since the amino-terminal 31 amino acids are rich in basic and hydroxylated residues and devoid of acidic ones. To investigate the localization of COQ5p, we constructed a fusion protein containing the entire COQ5p, two glycine residues as a spacer domain, and the 10-residue c-myc sequence that serves as an antibody recognition site. The myc-tagged COQ5 produced a functional protein, since it could complement the mutants, TCM7 and ED7. When the fusion protein was expressed under the control of the inducible CUP1 promoter and the cells were fractionated, it was primarily detected in the mitochondrial fraction by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Ready detection of the tagged COQ5p could be seen when expression was under the control of the uninduced CUP1 promoter but not when expression was mediated by the COQ5 promoter (not shown). This suggests that COQ5p is not normally a highly expressed protein. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells overexpressing the myc-tagged COQ5p produced a punctate staining pattern characteristic of mitochondrial proteins (not shown). When mitochondria were further fractionated, COQ5p was predominantly found in the matrix fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 2 of c-myc panel). Small amounts were also found associated with the membrane fractions (lane 1) or the intermembrane space (lane 3), but these levels reflect cross-contamination of fractions as judged by the membrane (porin), matrix (hsp60), and intermembrane space (cytochrome b2) marker proteins. Our mitochondrial fractions contain contaminating organelles that co-purify, and hence we cannot exclude the possibility that COQ5p is located in other organelles beside mitochondria. To independently confirm that COQ5p is a mitochondrial protein, in vitro synthesized precursor protein was imported into isolated yeast mitochondria (Fig. 4). COQ5p bound to mitochondria (lanes 2 and 4) and could be imported in an energy-dependent manner (lanes 4 and 5) to a protease-protected location (lane 3) that is made accessible by the addition of detergent (lane 6). Import is accompanied by a proteolytic cleavage event to a faster migrating species (lanes 2 and 3). The COQ5p presequence contains the sequence RC↓FTQAHRAC↓ which resembles the consensus sequence for twice cleaved precursor proteins, RX↓(F/L/I)XX(T/S/G)XXXX↓ (32Branda S.S. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27366-27373Google Scholar). This motif is found in many proteins required for respiratory function (32Branda S.S. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27366-27373Google Scholar) and would predict that lysine 31 is the mature amino terminus. We have not detected the presence of an intermediate species in the maturation of COQ5p in our experiments. The sequence of COQ5p is 42.8% identical to the polypeptide encoded by o251, an open reading frame located at 86 min on the E. coli chromosome (1Daniels D.L. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Google Scholar). Interestingly, three mutations that lead to respiration deficiency in E. coli had also been mapped to this region but not assigned to any open reading frame; these are ubiB, ubiD, and ubiE (33Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 106-117Google Scholar). These mutations lead to defects in ubiquinone biosynthesis that are manifested as an inability to grow on the nonfermentable carbon source, succinate. The ubiB and ubiD gene products are part of a prokaryotic specific ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway and are believed to catalyze the conversion of intermediates II to III and I to II, respectively (Fig. 5). The ubiE gene product was proposed to catalyze a reaction common to the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic pathways, the methylation of intermediate VII to intermediate VIII, because an ubiE mutant accumulates 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (intermediate VII; 5Gibson F. Young I.G. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 600-609Google Scholar). To determine whether the COQ5p could be the yeast homolog of the ubiE gene product, we transformed a ubiE mutant, AN70, with the plasmid p7S6. COQ5 is able to complement AN70 and restore growth on succinate. Furthermore, when the quinone pools are extracted from AN70, quinones are not detectable by thin layer chromatography in either chloroform/benzene (1:1) or in chloroform/methanol (95:5) solvent systems (not shown). In contrast, the quinone pool from AN70 expressing COQ5 contained compounds that comigrate with a Q0 standard in both solvent systems used (RF (relative mobilities) = 0.2 and 0.85, respectively). This result suggests strongly that COQ5 complements AN70 by restoring ubiquinone biosynthesis. Membrane vesicles prepared from AN70 have no detectable succinate oxidase activity (Fig. 6). The addition of increasing concentrations of Q0 restored succinate oxidase activity. Membrane vesicles from AN70 transformed with p7S6 displayed a high level of succinate oxidase activity in the absence of added quinone; this level of oxidase activity is similar to that found in a related wild-type strain of E. coli (34Wu G. Williams H.D. Gibson F. Poole R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1795-1805Google Scholar). The addition of 200 μM coenzyme Q0 to COQ5-complemented bacterial membranes only slightly increased respiratory activity, indicating that the yeast COQ5p had restored adequate quinone levels. Submitochondrial membranes were prepared from the yeast disruption mutant, ED7, and its wild-type parent, MH125, and analyzed for respiratory chain activities (Table II). ED7 membranes showed a dramatic loss of NADH oxidase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities. Even more dramatically, succinate oxidase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities were undetectable, although a small amount of succinate-dependent phenazine methosulfate-mediated reduction of the artificial electron acceptor, dichlorophenol indophenol, a ubiquinone-independent activity, remained. The addition of 200 μM decylubiquinone, Q2, led to the severalfold stimulation of some of the respiratory activities, with NADH oxidase activity being most affected. Higher concentrations of quinone could not further increase activity levels. The ED7 culture used in this experiment had remained at least 75%ρ+; the less than full recovery of respiratory chain activities with added quinone cannot be accounted for by mitochondrial DNA mutations.TABLE II.Respiratory chain activities of mitochondrial membranesActivityMH125ED7ED7 with 200 μM Q2Succinate oxidaseaActivities are expressed as nanoatoms of oxygen min−1 mg−1.59NDbND, not detectable.NDNADH oxidaseaActivities are expressed as nanoatoms of oxygen min−1 mg−1.241514Succinate-cytochrome c reductasecActivities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min−1 mg−1.29ND1NADH-cytochrome c reductasecActivities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min−1 mg−1.3151327Succinate-dichlorophenol indophenol reductasedActivities are expressed as nmol of dichlorophenol indophenol reduced min−1 mg−1.1724—eNot done.a Activities are expressed as nanoatoms of oxygen min−1 mg−1.b ND, not detectable.c Activities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min−1 mg−1.d Activities are expressed as nmol of dichlorophenol indophenol reduced min−1 mg−1.e Not done. Open table in a new tab The failure of added quinone to fully restore respiratory function to ED7 mitochondrial membranes might be due to lower levels of assembled respiratory chain components. We examined mitochondrial membranes for the presence of respiratory chain components by Western blot analysis and normalized mutant and wild-type samples by loading equivalent amounts of the outer membrane protein, porin (Fig. 7A). We reasoned that respiratory deficiency should not affect the import of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, since their insertion is energy-independent (35Lill R. Neupert W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 5661Google Scholar). We detected low levels (less than 10%) of succinate dehydrogenase with an antibody against the iron-sulfur subunit (panel B), low levels of ATP synthase with antibodies against the β-subunit (panel C), and low levels of cytochrome c oxidase with antibodies against subunit IV (panel D), consistent with the reduced enzymatic activities reported in Table II. Therefore, a ubiquinone deficiency as present in the COQ5 null mutant leads to lowered steady state levels of electron transport chain components. In this study, we characterize a coq5 mutant, isolate the corresponding wild-type COQ5 gene, and provide evidence that COQ5p is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae Loss of COQ5 function and the resultant loss of ubiquinone synthesis should result in a respiration-deficient phenotype that is manifested as an inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. The original mutant, TCM7, however, is at least partially respiration-proficient in that it is able to reduce the tetrazolium dye used in our mutant screen, suggesting that the coq5-1 allele is leaky. Mutations that completely block ubiquinone biosynthesis might not have been detected by our screening procedure. The secretion of acid by TCM7 and the low succinate dehydrogenase activity in the COQ5 disruption mutant (Table II) suggest that the tricarboxylic acid cycle is also impaired. We have not measured the levels of other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. The E. coli ubiE mutant, AN70, is characterized by an inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as succinate and by low oxidase activities (33Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 106-117Google Scholar). Expression of the yeast COQ5 gene restores the bacterium's ability to grow with succinate as the carbon source and the succinate oxidase activity of isolated bacterial membranes. The COQ5 gene also rescues the ubiquinone synthesis deficiency of the ubiE mutation; although we did not characterize the exact nature of the products, the COQ5 gene results in the production of quinone compounds with a mobility by thin layer chromatography similar to Q0 in a chloroform/methanol solvent system. The ubiE mutant accumulates intermediate VII or 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. 5; 16Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Google Scholar). Restoration of ubiquinone biosynthesis in AN70 by the yeast COQ5 strongly suggests that COQ5p is the methyltransferase that modifies position 3 of the benzoquinone ring. We have not attempted to show methyltransferase activity in vitro nor have we attempted to isolate the intermediates that accumulate in ED7. There are two other methyltransferases, both O-methyltransferases, in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. The yeast COQ3 gene encodes the 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate methyltransferase, which converts intermediate IV to V. It has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized and is distinct from the COQ5 gene (7Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Google Scholar). The second O-methyltransferase catalyzes the final step in the pathway, converting intermediate IX to ubiquinone (X) and has not been characterized in yeast (9Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Google Scholar). In E. coli, the second O-methyltransferase is encoded by the E. coli ubiG gene. The ubiG gene has recently been shown to complement a yeast coq3 mutant, strongly suggesting that the ubiG protein catalyzes both O-methyltransferase reactions in E. coli and leading to speculation that a bifunctional O-methyltransferase may also exist in yeast (9Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Google Scholar). The ubiG gene has been sequenced and is not related in sequence to the yeast COQ5 gene except in the proposed S-adenosylmethionine binding domains (Fig. 8; 6Wu G. Williams H.D. Zamanian M. Gibson F. Poole R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2101-2112Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for our results is that COQ5 encodes the yeast 2-hexaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase, which can functionally complement a mutation in the E. coli homolog encoded by the ubiE gene. The COQ5p sequence is weakly related to other methyltransferases; it does contain a closely related version of a consensus amino acid sequence common to methyltransferase enzymes that use S-adenosylmethionine as a donor (Fig. 8; Refs. 6Wu G. Williams H.D. Zamanian M. Gibson F. Poole R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2101-2112Google Scholar and 36Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20131-20139Google Scholar). As in the human glycine methyltransferase sequence, the first of the conserved glycines in the motif is replaced by an alanine in COQ5p, but the remainder of the adjacent COQ5p sequence conforms to the consensus motif (Fig. 8A). There is a second region of sequence similarity found in a smaller number of methyltransferases that is also found in COQ5p (Fig. 8B; 36Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20131-20139Google Scholar). These sequence similarities are consistent with the use of S-adenosylmethionine as the donor for all the methyl groups in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway (37Bentley R. Meganathan R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. I. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 512-520Google Scholar). We localized COQ5p to the mitochondrial matrix by Western blot analysis of a tagged, overexpressed protein (Fig. 3) and by in vitro import into isolated mitochondria (Fig. 4). This localization is consistent with the proposed role for Coq5p in ubiquinone biosynthesis, which is generally believed to be compartmentalized within mitochondria (7Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Google Scholar). Complementation of a yeast coq3 mutant by the E. coli ubiG gene required the addition of a mitochondrial targeting signal to the ubiG gene, indicating a need for organellar targeting of some proteins in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway (9Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Google Scholar). The predicted protein sequence does not contain any putative membrane-spanning domains, so COQ5p was expected to be soluble. In E. coli, the enzymes of the ubiquinol biosynthetic pathway that can convert 2-octaprenylphenol (intermediate II) to ubiquinone-8 can be released from membranes as a complex without detergent despite the hydrophobic nature of their substrates (37Bentley R. Meganathan R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. I. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 512-520Google Scholar). Ubiquinone's primary role is in electron transfer to the cytochrome c reductase complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, consistent with a mitochondrial site of synthesis, but it is also found in other eukaryotic organelles where its function is less well defined. The addition of an ubiquinone analog to ED7 ubiquinone-deficient membranes only partially restores respiratory activities, particularly succinate oxidase activity. In contrast, the ubiE mutant, AN70, which is similarly blocked in ubiquinone synthesis, shows a more marked recovery of succinate oxidase activity with added Q0 (Fig. 6). We have shown that the partial recovery of respiratory activities is likely attributable to the substantially lower levels of respiratory chain components in ED7 membranes (Fig. 7 and Table II). Why does the absence of COQ5p lead to low levels of respiratory chain components in yeast, whereas some other nuclear petite mutations do not? For example, sdh1 or sdh4 mutants have normal levels of NADH oxidase activities in their mitochondrial membranes, despite their respiration deficiencies due to losses of succinate dehydrogenase subunits (13Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Google Scholar, 27Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Google Scholar). A yeast coq3 mutant also has normal levels of succinate or NADH oxidase activities if a quinone analog is added to the assays (30de Santis A. Melandri B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 354-365Google Scholar). We do not believe ubiquinone deficiency is affecting the translocation of proteins into the organelle. Even cytoplasmic petite mutants that are devoid of respiratory activity are still able to import and assemble normal F1-ATP synthase (38Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Google Scholar). One possibility is that a lack of ubiquinone destabilizes the respiratory chain complexes and leads to their rapid degradation and low steady state levels. Destabilization could be manifested by a change in the structural properties of the bilayer or of the proteins themselves. Alternatively, the low levels of respiratory components may arise from the failure of the cells to adapt to respiratory conditions and activate the expression of mitochondrial proteins upon the depletion of available glucose. The production of respiratory chain components is normally accelerated in stationary phase cells that we used for our studies (39Kim I.-C. Beattie D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 509-518Google Scholar). 2K. M. Robinson and B. D. Lemire, unpublished observations. We have not been able to test whether the failure to recover from catabolite repression is responsible for the low levels of respiratory components because our coq5 mutants do not grow under nonrepressing conditions with galactose as a carbon source. An explanation for this phenomenon awaits further investigations. We thank Dr. Catherine Clarke (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) for yeast strains, Dr. I. G. Young (Canberra, Australia) for the E. coli strain, and Dr. Gottfried Schatz (Basel, Switzerland) for antibodies."

The recent cloning of a gene mutated in this syndrome provides additional evidence for a defect in intracellular signaling in A-T. We have investigated the possibility that signaling through the B cell antigen receptor is one manifestation of the A-T defect. In response to cross-linking of the B cell receptor, several A-T cell lines were defective in their mitogenic response; in addition Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores was either absent or considerably reduced in these cell lines in response to cross-linking.

This enzyme, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (p110) and a regulatory subunit (p85), plays a central role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (12Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar). The ATM protein is related to TOR1 and TOR2 proteins of yeast (13Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

The latter group includes Mei-41 of Drosophila melanogaster, rad3p, Mec1p and Tel1p of yeast, and DNA-dependent protein kinase from human cells (17Hari K.L. Santers A. Sekelsky J.J. McKim K.S.

It is evident that the ATM gene is involved not only in the response to DNA damage but also in regulating a number of cellular processes important in differentiation and development (3Shiloh Y. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 3: 116-138Google Scholar). Evidence for a defect in signal transduction in A-T has been provided in several reports. O'Connor and Scott-Linthicum (21O'Connor R.D. Scott-Linthicum D. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1980; 15: 66-75Google Scholar) demonstrated that A-T lymphocytes were defective in the transmission of a mitogen-mediated signal from cytoplasm to nucleus; defective intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ in T cells from A-T patients in response to phytohemagglutinin and anti-CD3 antibody has been reported by Kondo et al. (22Kondo N. Inoue R. Nishimura S. Kasahara K. Kameyama Y. Miwa Y. Lorenzo P.R. Orii T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 38: 45-48Google Scholar), and A-T fibroblasts in culture show a greater demand for growth factors (23Elmore E. Swift M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 429-432Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the hyporesponsiveness of the transmembrane signaling, seen primarily in T lymphocytes, may also occur in B cells from A-T patients and account, at least in part, for the immune dysfunction which is also a characteristic of the humoral arm of the response in this syndrome (10Waldmann T.A. Bridges B.A. Harnden D.G. Ataxia-telangiectasia: A Cellular and Molecular Link Between Cancer, Neuropathology, and Immunodeficiency. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1982: 37-51Google Scholar). To investigate this, we have used antibodies to cross-link the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) which triggers the activation of protein tyrosine kinases, resulting in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates including phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) (24Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2745-2749Google Scholar). Activation of PLCγ1 leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (25Partain K. Jensen K. Aldo-Bensen M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 1079-1085Google Scholar, 26Fahey K.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3935-3942Google Scholar, 27Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate acts as a second messenger to release ionized Ca2+ from intracellular stores and diacylglycerol mediates the activation of protein kinase C. We report here that signaling through the BCR is defective in A-T which is detectable at the level of Ca2+ mobilization, PLCγ1 activation, and PI-3 kinase activation. These results provide evidence for a role for the ATM protein in intracellular signaling. All lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Nomenclature for control and A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines is the same as that described previously (28Houldsworth J. Lavin M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3709-3720Google Scholar), where ATABR represents an A-T cell line established in Australia, Brisbane. AT3LA represents an A-T cell line established in Los Angeles by Dr R. Gatti. Purified rabbit antibodies against PLCγ1, PI 3-kinase (p85), and Lyn were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Control and A-T cells were washed twice with staining solution (phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% fetal calf serum) and then incubated with rabbit anti-human Ig (detecting IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgG fractions; Silenus, Melbourne, Australia), or anti-human CD45 and CD19 (Becton Dickinson). After the first incubation (30 min, 4°C), cells were washed twice with staining solution and then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Cells were then washed twice, resuspended in 0.5 ml of staining solution, and examined by flow cytometry. B cells from A-T patients and controls were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml in RPM1 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and cultured in 0.2-ml aliquots in flat-bottomed microtiter plates in the presence or absence of anti-Ig (at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/well) 4 h before termination of the incubation; [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using an automated beta liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The maximal stimulation index was calculated as counts/min of [3H]thymidine incorporation in anti-Ig-treated cells divided by counts/min of [3H]thymidine incorporation in untreated cells. The levels of intracellular calcium was measured by flow cytometry using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester. Cells were loaded with 1 μM indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester in loading buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.41 mM MgCl2, 0.20 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose (pH 7.2)) containing 0.1% fetal calf serum with gentle shaking in the dark at 37°C for 1 h. The relative intracellular calcium concentration was determined using a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS Vantage). Intracellular Ca2+ was measured, using indo-1, as the ratio of 405 nm/530 nm fluorescence (29Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961Google Scholar). The mean intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated as described by Rabinovitch et al. (29Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961Google Scholar) using spectrofluorimetry (Perkin Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS50). LMP2A expression was determined by immunoblotting. LMP2A antiserum was a kind gift from Professor Muller-Lantzsch (Hamburg, Germany). This antibody recognizes LMP2A expression in cell lines transformed with the B95-8 strain of EBV. Equal amounts of cell extracts of control and A-T cell lines were loaded on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel. Blots were incubated with 1:200 dilution of anti-LMP2A antiserum and then stained indirectly using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. B cells were washed and suspended in 200 μl of cold serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The suspension was preincubated at 37°C for 1 min and then incubated in the presence of 50 μg of anti-Ig antibody at 37°C for various periods. The cells were lysed using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium o-vanadate, 20 mM NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates were prepared by preclearing with normal rabbit serum and precipitating with specific antisera (PLCγ1, Lyn, p85 of PI 3-kinase; 1 μg each) and protein A-agarose. An aliquot of equal volume from each immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with antibody to phosphotyrosine, PLCγ1, Lyn, and p85. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (same as described above for immunoprecipitation). Equal amounts of cell extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. The unreacted sites on nitrocellulose blots were blocked by incubation in 1% bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated overnight with 1 μg/ml of monoclonal 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Silenus) to detect changes in the phosphorylation status of several proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). PI 3-kinase was measured as described previously (30Coughlin S.R. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1191-1194Google Scholar). Briefly, Lyn immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with Hepes buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl) and suspended in 25 μl of reaction buffer (20 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 0.45 mM EGTA) containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol. After incubation at 25°C for 10 min, the reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi; final concentration, 10 μM) and MnCl2 (final concentration, 5 mM) and allowed to proceed at 25°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 M HCl. The lipid product was extracted, spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 plate (Merck), and developed. With the cloning and identification of the A-T gene, it seems apparent that the defect is one of cell signaling involving a number of signal transduction pathways. Since immunodeficiency is one of the important characteristics of A-T, we have examined signaling through the BCR. Initially, control and A-T-EBV-transformed B cells were compared for proliferative response after BCR cross-linking. When thymidine incorporation was used as a measure of cell proliferation, it was evident that the control cell lines showed an increase over a 4-day period (Fig. 1), comparable with that observed by Simon et al (31Simon H.U. Mills G.B. Hashimoto S. Siminovitch K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1396-1405Google Scholar), also using EBV cell lines. In contrast, in four A-T cell lines there was little or no evidence of a proliferative response after cross-linking of the receptor, providing evidence for a defect in signaling in A-T cells. In view of the apparent defect in mitogenesis through the BCR, B cell lines derived from A-T patients and controls were initially compared for expression of sIg by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 2, levels of sIg detected on A-T cell lines were comparable with those on control cell lines. In addition, no difference in the levels of CD45 and CD19 surface expression or staining intensity was apparent between A-T and control cell lines, indicating that EBV transformation did not select out different B cell populations in the two cell types. BCR cross-linking induces inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in normal B cells manifested as a rapid transient increase in Ca2+ concentrations within the cell (25Partain K. Jensen K. Aldo-Bensen M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 1079-1085Google Scholar). Preliminary titration studies showed that anti-Ig concentration in the range of 9-36 μg/ml induced a maximal Ca2+ mobilization response in normal lymphoblastoid cells within 1 min of cross-linking of the receptor (results not shown). Cross-linking of BCR on lymphoblastoid cells from three different control cell lines resulted in a rapid increase in Ca2+, returning almost immediately to basal levels (Fig. 3). Increased Ca2+ mobilization after anti-Ig stimulation reflects release from intracellular stores since Ca2+ changes were studied in calcium depleted medium, which minimizes any effect of extracellular Ca2+ influx. However, as is evident in the case of C2ABR, delayed influx of Ca2+ is apparent and is seen for the other two controls (C3ABR and C30ABR) 10 min after stimulation (results not shown on the profile). In addition, the presence of EGTA (50 μM) in the medium did not alter the initial response. The peak concentration changes in Ca2+ in control cells ranged between 260 and 300 nM Ca2+, as determined by spectrofluorimetry. In contrast, cross-linking of BCR on three A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines from different A-T complementation groups resulted in no response or a very much diminished Ca2+ mobilization ranging from 0 to 10 nM (Fig. 3). In all, we screened five A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines and demonstrated that they showed a defect in Ca2+ mobilization in response to BCR cross-linking. Previous studies have shown that cross-linking of BCR, in cells transfected with the EBV latent membrane receptor gene LMP2A, failed to lead to changes in intracellular free Ca2+ (32Miller C.L. Longnecker R. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3087-3094Google Scholar, 33Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Longnecker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 772-776Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that defective Ca2+ mobilization in A-T was due to selective overexpression of LMP2A in these cells, we determined expression levels by Western blotting. The results in Fig. 4 show that LMP2A expression in three A-T lines (AT1ABR, AT5ABR, AT3ABR) is comparable with that in controls (C3ABR, C2ABR). It was not possible to detect expression of LMP2A in a fourth A-T cell line, AT3LA. EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line DG75 was used as a negative control, and no LMP2A expression was detected in these cells. In view of the reduced or absent Ca2+ mobilization in A-T cells, it seemed likely that one arm of the cascade activated by BCR cross-linking, namely activation of PLCγ1 (24Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2745-2749Google Scholar), would be defective in A-T cells. Phosphorylation of PLCγ1 isozyme was assessed in A-T and control B cells by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-PLCγ1 antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As is evident from the results in Fig. 5 (top), the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was reduced in AT1ABR cells incubated with anti-Ig and negligible in two other A-T cell lines, AT5ABR and AT3LA, compared with a control cell line, C3ABR. The difference in response between the A-T cell lines may be explained by the nature of the mutations in the ATM gene. AT1ABR, which showed only a reduced response, has an in-frame deletion of 3 amino acids (11Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. Ashkenazi M. Pecker I. Harnik R. Patanjali S.R. Simmons A. Frydman M. Sartiel A. Gatti R.A. Chessa L. Sanal O. Lavin M.F. Jaspers M.F. Malcolm A. Taylor R. Arlett C.F. Miki T. Weissman S.M. Lovett M. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Google Scholar) and is capable of producing a near complete-sized protein. 2Watters, D., Khanna, K. K., Beamish, H., Birrell, G., Spring, K., Gatei, M., Hobson, K., Stenzel, D., Ramsay, J., Gatti, R., and Lavin, M. F. (1997) Oncogene, in press. On the other hand, AT5ABR and AT3LA have mutations that are predicted to give rise to a truncated protein. The reduced response is not a consequence of differences in PLCγ1 expression in A-T and control cells, since immunoblot analysis revealed that levels of PLCγ1 protein were similar in A-T and control cell lines (Fig. 5, bottom). Furthermore, when levels of IP3 were measured after anti-Ig stimulation by the specific D-myo-[3H]Ins-1,4,5 P3 assay system using an Amersham kit, an increase was observed in two control cell lines (C2ABR, C3ABR), but two A-T cell lines (AT1ABR, AT3ABR) failed to show an increase (data not shown). These results demonstrate that induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1, a key event in the activation of this enzyme, after BCR ligation, is impaired in B cells from A-T patients and is consistent with the finding that anti-Ig-induced increases in Ca2+ mobilization are markedly reduced or negligible in these cells compared with B cells from controls (Fig. 3). The results described above would predict that the initial event after cross-linking of the receptor, activation of protein tyrosine kinases, would also be abnormal in A-T cells. Ligation of the receptor in control cells was shown to be associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, predominantly with molecular masses of 55 and 85 kDa; as determined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 6), a comparable pattern of phosphorylations was evident in AT1ABR cells. In contrast, two of the A-T cell lines, AT3LA and AT5ABR, were defective in tyrosine phosphorylation of these protein species. Overall, there was either no phosphorylation evident or a marked reduction in protein phosphorylation for AT5ABR (Fig. 6), and AT3LA was defective for 85-kDa phosphorylation but appeared to have a normal response for the 55-kDa species. Both cell lines are characterized by mutations that give rise to protein truncations (11Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. Ashkenazi M. Pecker I. Harnik R. Patanjali S.R. Simmons A. Frydman M. Sartiel A. Gatti R.A. Chessa L. Sanal O. Lavin M.F. Jaspers M.F. Malcolm A. Taylor R. Arlett C.F. Miki T. Weissman S.M. Lovett M. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Google Scholar).2 To investigate this defect in tyrosine phosphorylation, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src-related kinase (35Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.B. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Google Scholar, 36Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y. Wongsasant B. Kinoshita Y. Ichimori Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1118-1122Google Scholar), Lyn, which is expressed in B cells. Lyn was immunoprecipitated at 0, 2, and 5 min after cross-linking and Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates from control cells with antibody to phosphotyrosine revealed a 2-3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn (upper doublet) on BCR cross-linking (Fig. 7A). The lower band of this triplet set represents Ig. However, little or no increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn was observed in AT3LA and AT5ABR (Fig. 7A). The amount of Lyn as determined by immunoblotting with anti-Lyn antibody did not change in any of the cell lines in response to receptor cross-linking as reported previously (Fig. 7B). However, the basal level of Lyn in AT5ABR was reduced compared with the control and other A-T cell lines. Cross-linking of the BCR also activates the enzyme PI 3-kinase through association with Src kinases (37Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Google Scholar, 38Scheurman R.H. Uhr J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 903-906Google Scholar). This enzyme has dual specificity, phosphorylating both the 3-position of inositol phospholipids (12Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar) and its own regulatory subunit, p85 (39Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that receptor ligation leads to an increase in PI 3-kinase associated with Lyn (36Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y. Wongsasant B. Kinoshita Y. Ichimori Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1118-1122Google Scholar). The p85 subunit binds to kinases through the interaction between the SH3 (Src homology 3) domains of the kinases and proline-rich sequences in p85 (40Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Google Scholar). In parallel with the BCR-mediated activation of Lyn kinase, a phosphoprotein of 85 kDa was increased 6-fold after BCR cross-linking of control cells, but no increase was evident in two of the A-T lines, AT3LA and AT5ABR (Fig. 7A, upper band), and the increase was minimal in two other lines, AT1ABR and AT3ABR, compared with control (results not shown). The increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 was attributed, at least in part, to an increased amount of p85 associating with Lyn after receptor cross-linking. Using p85 antibody on blots from Lyn immunoprecipitates, we observed a 3-fold and a 2-fold increase in Lyn-associated p85 at 2 and 5 min, respectively, after cross-linking, and this increase was absent in two of the A-T lines, AT3LA and AT5ABR (Fig. 7C). This also suggests that a proportion of phosphotyrosine-containing PI 3-kinase is associated with Lyn in control cells. This was verified when p85 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 7D). We observed a 2-3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in control cells that was absent in two A-T lines, AT3LA and AT5ABR. Resting levels of p85 in control and A-T cell lines were comparable (data not shown). A 150-kDa phosphoprotein was also observed in the PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates and showed a 6-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in control cells, but not in A-T cells, after BCR cross-linking (Fig. 7D). Prior studies have shown that anti-Ig-mediated phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is accompanied by increased enzymatic activity (37Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Google Scholar). We examined Lyn-associated PI 3-kinase activity at 0, 2, and 5 min after BCR cross-linking of control and A-T cells. The PI 3-kinase activity in anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates was increased by ∼5-fold, as determined by densitometry, at 5 min post-cross-linking in control cell extracts (Fig. 8). However, no increase in Lyn-associated PI3-kinase activity was observed in two A-T lines, AT3LA and AT5ABR (Fig. 8), while a reduced response was demonstrated in two other lines, AT1ABR and AT3ABR (results not shown). When the pleiotropic nature of the A-T phenotype is considered, it is evident that the gene involved, ATM, must be a regulator of a variety of cellular events related to differentiation, development, and DNA damage response. The recent cloning and description of this gene (11Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. Ashkenazi M. Pecker I. Harnik R. Patanjali S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2017575606,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mediate activities such as survival, differentiation, and proliferation in various subsets of neurons. In this report, we define precisely the residues in human NGF responsible for NGF biological activity and binding specificity to the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In earlier studies we defined five amino acid residues of NGF which confer NGF-like activity to NT-3 when replacing corresponding residues in the 120-amino acid long NT-3 molecule. Using this gain-of-function strategy we report the further dissection of this functional epitope. We also define another motif separated topographically in the NGF dimer and determined to be independently responsible for NGF specificity. The first of the two motifs determined to elicit NGF specificity is defined by the residues Val-48, Pro-49, and Gln-96, which are situated in the two top beta-loops of NGF. The second motif is represented by residues Pro-5 and Phe-7 situated in the proximal part of the NH2 terminus. Both motifs contain structurally important residues revealing a novel principle, where specificity for neurotrophin ligand-receptor interactions could be determined by variable residues modifying the conformation of the neurotrophin backbone. These findings will enhance further the possibility of mimicking NGF with low molecular weight compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2019144255,"We investigated the occurrence of alternatively spliced forms (V0, V1, V2, and V3) of PG-M/versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in developing chicken retinas, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We characterized the PLUS domain, which is apparently unique to the chicken molecule and is regulated by alternative splicing. PG-M in chicken retinas consisted of four forms with (V0, V1, V2, and V3) and two forms without (V1 and V3) the PLUS domain (PG-M<sup>+</sup> and PG-M<sup>−</sup>, respectively). The four forms of PG-M<sup>+</sup> were found in all samples examined, but the occurrence of the two PG-M<sup>−</sup> forms was regulated developmentally. Genomic analysis has revealed that the PLUS and CS-α domains are encoded by a single exon, and this exon has an internal alternative 5′-splice donor site, allowing alternative spliced forms that do not include the 3′-end of the exon. Sequences corresponding to the chicken PLUS domain (<i>plus</i>) were not found in mouse and human and may have disappeared during evolution. Sequence similarity suggests that the PLUS domain corresponds to the keratan sulfate attachment domain of aggrecan and that it has a distinct function in the chicken eye."

Brain Res. 1981; 212: 51-57Google Scholar, 5Beinfeld M.C. Palkovits M. Neuropeptides. 1981; 2: 123-129Google Scholar, 6Geola F.L. Hershman J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 270-275Google Scholar). Its role in the nervous system is less clear but appears to serve as a neurotransmitter (7Innis R.B. Correa F.M.A. Uhl G.R. Schneider B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 521-525Google Scholar, 8Verhage M. Ghijsen W.E.J.M. Nicholls D.G. Wiegant V.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1394-1400Google Scholar) or a neuromodulator (9Brog J.S. Beinfeld M.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 343-348Google Scholar, 10Arneric S.P. Meeley M.P. Reis D.J. Peptides. 1986; 7: 97-103Google Scholar, 11Cosi C. Altar A. Wood P.L. Eur. J.

The predominant form of CCK in the brain is the eight-amino acid CCK 8, whereas the larger forms, such as CCK 58, CCK 33, and CCK 22, predominate in the gut. Various forms of CCK found either in the brain or the gut appear to be the result of differential processing of the same pro-CCK precursor. The processing of pro-CCK in the gut is complex and species-dependent. cholecystokinin prohormone convertase pro-opiomelanocortin isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside Rous sarcoma virus radioimmunoassay Tris-buffered saline kilobase(s) cytomegalovirus 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid Modifications on pro-CCK during processing include sulfation of three carboxyl-terminal tyrosines, cleavage at dibasic or monobasic sites, the possible action of amino- or carboxypeptidases, and amidation of the carboxyl-terminal to release bioactive forms of CCK. Among these modifications, cleavages produced by endoproteases are the keys to differential processing. The identity of these endoproteases in pro-CCK processing are, for the most part, unknown. Recently, the isolation of CCK 8-generating enzyme from rat brain synaptosomes and its ability to cleave CCK 33 to to form CCK 8 have identified at least one endoprotease that may be involved in CCK 8 biosynthesis (13Viereck J.C. Beinfeld M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19475-19481Google Scholar). The cloning of prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) (14Smeekens S.P. Avruch A.S. LaMendola J. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 340-344Google Scholar, 15Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. gaspar I. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Google Scholar), also known as PC3, a member of the subtilisin family of enzymes, has identified another candidate. PC1 is a Ca2+-dependent serine endoprotease known to cleave propeptides at dibasic residues (16Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Google Scholar, 17Rouille Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Frontiers Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Google Scholar), and there is increasing evidence that it can also cleave at mono-arginyl sites as well (18Nakayama K. Watanabe T. Nakagawa R. Kim W.S. Nagahama M. Hosaka M. Hatsuzawa K. Kondoh-Hashiba K. Murakami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16335-16340Google Scholar, 19Friedman T.C. Gordon V.M. Leppela S.H. Klimpel K.R. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 5-13Google Scholar). Evidence to support its role in pro-CCK processing includes the following. 1) PC1 and CCK are both found in neuroendocrine cells (20Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Chretien M. Enzyme (Basel). 1991; 45: 271-284Google Scholar) and share a similar tissue distribution, and both PC1 and CCK are found within the regulated secretory pathway. 2) PC1 is expressed in a number of endocrine cell lines that express CCK mRNA and correctly process it to carboxyamidated products. These include Rin5F cells derived from a rat insulinoma (21Hakes D.J. Birch N.P. Mezey A. Dixon J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3053-3063Google Scholar), STC-1 cells derived from a murine intestinal tumor, WE cells derived from a mouse medullary thyroid tumor, and AtT20 cells derived from mouse pituitary cells (22Yoon J.Y. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 973-977Google Scholar). PC2 is also expressed by all of these lines, except At-T20 cells (22Yoon J.Y. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 973-977Google Scholar). 3) Pro-CCK contains several dibasic and mono-arginyl residues that are potential sites of cleavage for PC1. 4) PC1 has recently been shown to cleave a number of propeptides including pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) (23Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Google Scholar, 24Thomas L. Leduc R. Thorne B.A. Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5297-5301Google Scholar), proinsulin (25Smeekens S.P. Montag A.G. Thomas G. Albiges-Rizo C. Carroll R. Benig M. Phillips L.A. Martin S. Ohagi S. Gardner P. Swift H.H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8822-8826Google Scholar), proenkephalin (26Breslin M.B. Lindberg I. Benjannet S. Mathis S. Lazure C. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27084-27093Google Scholar), and prosomatostatin (27Galanopoulou A.S. Kent G. Rabbani S.N. Seidah N.G. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6041-6049Google Scholar). The development of specific inhibitors of PC1 that are not toxic to cells in culture has lagged behind the discovery of PC1. To evaluate the importance of PC1 in the processing of pro-CCK in specific cells, an antisense strategy was adopted. The use of stable expression of PC1 antisense message to inhibit an PC1 expression was first used by Bloomquist et al. (28Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 2014-2024Google Scholar) to support a role for PC1 in POMC processing in AtT20 cells. Subsequently, it has been used to demonstrate the role of PC2 in proenkephalin (29Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Google Scholar), POMC (30Friedman T.C. Cool D.R. Vachareeporn J. Louie D. Loh P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 89-96Google Scholar), and proglucagon processing (31Rouille Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Google Scholar). In this study, we have inhibited endogenous PC1 expression by stable expression of PC1 antisense mRNA in Rin5F (32Beinfeld M.C. Neuropeptides. 1992; 22: 213-217Google Scholar) and STC-1 cells (22Yoon J.Y. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 973-977Google Scholar), which express CCK mRNA and process pro-CCK to CCK 8 and CCK 22. Here we present evidence that the expression of PC1 antisense mRNA inhibits CCK 8 formation within these cells. Constitutively expressing antisense PC1 plasmid pCMV5/anti-PC1 was constructed using the first 491 bases of the PC1 cDNA insert from prPC1.491EX, kindly provided by Dr. Richard Mains at Johns Hopkins University. This PC1 fragment was ligated into the pCMV5 mammalian expression vector (33Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Google Scholar) using a ratio of 8:1 insert to vector (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in the antisense orientation in the HindIII and XbaI sites so that its expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The orientation of the PC1 cDNA insert was verified by restriction digestion and polymerase chain reaction. Constitutively expressing antisense PC2 plasmid pCMV5/anti-PC2 was constructed using the first 480 bases of the PC2 cDNA contained within the prPC2.480EK plasmid also provided by Dr. Richard Mains. This PC2 fragment was inserted into pCMV5 at the KpnI and XbaI sites in the antisense orientation. The orientation of the insert was confirmed by endonuclease digestion. The Lac Switch inducible expression system (Stratagene) was employed for expressing antisense PC1 sequences in STC-1 cells. This system employs two plasmids: the first plasmid, p3′SS, expresses the Lac repressor protein that blocks expression from a second expression plasmid, containing the sequence of interest. The expression plasmid can be de-repressed by the addition of 1-10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). IPTG binds to the Lac repressor protein and causes a conformational change to decrease its affinity to Lac operator sequences located between the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV-long terminal repeat) promoter and the sequence of interest within the expression plasmid. The first 491 bases of the PC1 cDNA was cloned into the expression plasmid, pOPRSVICAT, in the antisense orientation. Orientation of the PC1 insert was verified by restriction digestion analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing. Rin5F cells and STC-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 20% newborn calf serum, 10% horse serum, and 1 × penicillin and streptomycin or 1 × gentamycin in a humidified 37°C incubator at 5% CO2. Cells transfected with expression plasmids were maintained in 300 μg/ml G418, 300 μg/ml hygromycin, or both. Cells were passaged twice weekly as they reached confluency by trypsinization. STC-1 cells were a gift of Dr. Douglas Hanahan at the Hormone Research Institute of the University of California, San Francisco. Expression plasmids were transferred to Rin5F and STC-1 cells by electroporation at 200V/500 microfarads using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser exponential decay type electroporator. Cells were grown to 80% confluency, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/0.8 ml of growth medium, along with 5-50 μg of plasmid DNA, in a Bio-Rad 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette. The cuvette was placed on ice for 10 min prior to electroporation and again for 10 min after electroporation. The cells were allowed to recover for 48 h in normal growth medium and then diluted into 96-well plates containing the appropriate antibiotic for selection. Single colonies were isolated and established as stable cell lines. Constitutively expressing plasmids pCMV5/anti-PC1 and pCMV5/anti-PC2 were co-transfected with pMtNeo, which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418, in a molar ratio of 3:1 and 5:1, respectively. The two plasmids of the inducible expression system were transfected sequentially. Plasmid p3′SS was initially transfected into STC-1 cells and selected with hygromycin for successful plasmid incorporation. Production of Lac repressor protein was verified by histochemistry using an antiserum purchased from Stratagene. A positive subclone was then selected for subsequent transfection of the second plasmid, expressing antisense PC1 sequences, and screened with a combination of hygromycin and G418. Total RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells using guanidine isothiocyanate (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), and 20-40 μg were used for analysis. Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated using the Ribosep RNA isolation kit from Collaborative Biomedical Products, and 5 μg were used for analysis. Northern analysis was performed as described elsewhere (37Ausubel F.M. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley/Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 2.2 M formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel in 1 × MOPS buffer, transferred overnight to Magna nylon filter (Micron Separations Inc.) in 10 × sodium chloride/sodium citrate transfer buffer (SSC), cross-linked to the filter by UV illumination, and placed with 10 ml of hybridization solution in a glass bottle set in a hybridization oven at 42°C. A small amount of ethidium bromide was included in the sample buffer so that the uniformity of RNA loading and transfer could be verified by ethidium bromide staining and photography of agarose gel and the blot after transfer. Prehybridization solution and hybridization solution consisted of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 100 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. The hybridization probe was produced using the same portions of the PC1 or PC2 cDNA described in the antisense experiments as templates for random primed labeling using the RPL kit from New England Biolabs. These double-stranded probes allowed detection of both the sense and antisense RNA. The labeled cDNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides through a G-50 column, denatured along with 300 μg of salmon sperm DNA by heating in a boiling water bath, and placed into the hybridization cylinder at a specific activity of 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Filters were washed within the hybridization cylinders twice at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min; twice at room temperature with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min; and twice at 42°C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −80°C for several hours to days as appropriate. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing PC1 and PC2 proteins were generously provided by Iris Lindberg at the Louisiana State Medical Center (38Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Google Scholar, 39Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Google Scholar). Western analysis was performed with slight modifications following the protocol sent by her laboratory. Tissue culture cells were grown to near confluency and harvested for protein analysis by scraping from dishes with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, after which an aliquot was taken for total protein measurement by the Lowry assay (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). After centrifugation, cells were extracted by resuspending in 1 × SDS protein loading buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue), sonication, and boiling for 5 min. Protein samples were fractionated by electrophoresis at 100 V for 2 h through a 10% polyacrylamide gel in protein electrophoresis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.025 M Tris, 192 mM glycine) using a protein minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad). The fractionated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) at 4°C overnight at 30 V using the minigel Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose blot was blocked using 5% Carnation nonfat dried milk in TBS (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.02% sodium azide, and then incubated with an 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibody in 10 ml of 5% Carnation nonfat dried milk within a sealed bag at 4°C overnight with constant shaking. The membrane was then washed three times with 50 ml of TBS with 0.05% Tween for 10 min each and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to either alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase in 10 ml of 5% Carnation nonfat dried milk in TBS with 0.02% sodium azide within a sealed bag at room temperature for 2 h. Antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) and horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) were diluted 1:2000 and 1:5000, respectively. Visualization by alkaline phosphatase was performed using substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a ratio of 1:1 in visualization buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 mM MgCl2, pH 10.0) for 30 min. Visualization by enzyme chemiluminescence using the horseradish peroxidase enzyme was performed according to manufacturer's protocol from the ECL Western detection kit from Amersham Life Science. Quantitation of Western protein levels were performed by densitometry using the Image Quant software analysis program. The radioimmunoassays (RIA) to measure CCK 8 from cell extracts were performed as described previously (4Beinfeld M.C. Meyer D.K. Eskay R.L. Jensen R.T. Brownstein M.J. Brain Res. 1981; 212: 51-57Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal CCK antibody (R5) is specific for the amidated forms of CCK. As tracer, the RIA utilized gastrin 17 produced by iodination using the chloramine-T method (41Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Google Scholar). Cells from several plates were extracted with 0.1 N HCl, pooled, and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. Cell extracts were separated by Sephadex G50 chromatography in a 35 × 1-cm column run at 4°C in 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected and aliquots removed for the CCK RIA. Rin5F cells were engineered to express the first 491 bases of the rat PC1 cDNA in the antisense orientation from the cytomegalovirus promoter, or the pCMV5 vector with no insert, to serve as a control. Positive transfectants were screened after dilution and replating using Geneticin (G418) and established as stable cell lines. When CCK levels of anti-PC1-transfected subclones were measured by radioimmunoassay, they displayed a wide range of CCK content. Some were similar to both the parental Rin5F and Rin5F cells transfected with pCMV5 while the most severely affected clones R1E8 and R1E9 showed about an 80% reduction as compared with control (Fig. 1). Northern analysis revealed that the dramatic decrease in CCK 8 was not a result of lower levels of CCK mRNA expression in these cells because they expressed similar amounts of CCK relative to both parental Rin5F cells and Rin5F cells transfected with pCMV5 plasmid (data not shown). To examine the effect of expression of antisense PC1 message on PC1 sense message in one of these cells lines (R1E8), the expression of both sense and antisense PC1 messages were measured by Northern analysis. Because the endogenous PC1 messages and the antisense PC1 message are of different sizes, they could both be visualized after hybridization (Fig. 2). Rin5F cells, RCC9 cells, transfected with the pCMV5 vector alone, and R1E8 cells all expressed endogenous alternatively spliced sense PC1 transcripts of approximately 2.6, 4.0, and 5.0 kb. In R1E8 cells, in addition to larger amounts of these three transcripts, we also observed a large amount, at least in equal concentration to the endogenous messages, of antisense PC1 message of approximately 0.6 kb. Furthermore, we observed several other previously unreported alternatively spliced forms of endogenous PC1 message, the formation of which are presumably due to the interference of antisense in the processing of the primary mRNA transcript. Others have reported the inhibition of primary transcript processing (42Feng B. Denhardt D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 660: 280-282Google Scholar) and the accumulation of target message (43Kim S.K. Wold B.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 129-138Google Scholar) during successful antisense inhibition. The observations on the effect of PC1 message in R1E8 cells support these as possible mechanisms of antisense action. In Fig. 3, the PC1 and PC2 protein levels in anti-PC1 Rin5F subclones are compared with control cell lines. Because these blots were stripped and reprobed, it is possible to directly compare the ratio of PC1 to PC2. Two major forms of PC1 protein identified by Western analysis in Rin5F cells were 87 and 66 kDa in size. The antisense PC1 cells (R1E8, R1E9, and R1E11) that had reduced amounts of CCK 8, also had decreased levels of PC1 protein both absolutely and relative to PC2. Both the 87- and 66-kDa proteins were reduced equally and confirmed that the expression of PC1 antisense resulted in a dramatic inhibition of PC1 protein as compared with Rin5F and RCC9 cells. In these cells, although the PC1 level was reduced, it was not completely eliminated. After as long as 1 year in culture, PC1 levels were still very low in the R1E8 and R1E9 cells (data not shown). Sephadex G50 chromatography of extracts of Rin5F, R1E8, and R1E9 shows that expression of PC1 antisense message, which causes a decrease in PC1 protein, produces a substantial depletion of CCK 8 relative to CCK 22. (Fig. 4). If the areas under the peak of CCK 8 is compared with CCK 22, the wild type is 0.9, while the antisense lines are from 0.1 to 0.2. After as long as 1 year in culture, the ability of R1E8 and R1E9 to produce CCK 8 did not recover (data not shown). The levels of total CCK did increase with time, suggesting a possible up-regulation of CCK expression or processing to CCK 22. To further rule out the possibility that constitutively expressing antisense PC1 Rin5F subclones were selected that were already low in CCK 8 content, we attempted to further correlate the expression of antisense with inhibition of CCK 8 formation in a single subclone using the Lac Switch mammalian expression system. This expression system displayed tight basal control of antisense PC1 message before induction (Fig. 5). Three major transcripts of PC1 of 2.6, 4.0, and 5.0 kb were observed as seen previously. After induction with 10 mM IPTG, a 0.6-kb antisense message was also observed, which was driven by the RSV-long terminal repeat promoter. However, it was apparent that induction of the expression of antisense PC1 from the RSV promoter in these cells was not comparable to the amount of expression observed from the constitutive CMV promoter in R1E8 or the other antisense cell lines (Fig. 2) but did result in a 20% reduction of CCK 8 levels (Fig. 6). Northern analysis also revealed that CCK message did not decrease after the introduction of IPTG and verified that the 20% reduction of CCK 8 in RLSE9 cell content was not due to the decrease in CCK expression (data not shown).Fig. 6CCK 8 content in RLSE9 cells before and after antisense PC1 induction. Cells were assayed before and after the addition of 10 mM IPTG to the culture medium. Cells were extracted using 90% methanol, CCK levels determined by RIA, and data expressed as percent of control. *, p < 0.05. n = 17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nevertheless, this observation that the expression of antisense PC1 message correlates with the inhibition of CCK 8 content further supports the connection between antisense PC1 expression and levels of immunoreactive CCK 8. Using a similar strategy as described for Rin5F cells, STC-1 cells expressing anti-PC1 and anti-PC2 mRNA were generated. Like the Rin5F cells, they also had greatly reduced levels of CCK by RIA. The most severely affected (S1F2) having about 26% of parental levels of CCK was selected for further analysis in comparison with parental STC-1 cells and cells expressing anti-PC2 mRNA (S2H4) and control STC-1 cells (SCC9) transfected with pCMV5 without any insert. Measurement of sense and antisense PC1 messages by Northern analysis revealed that the two predominant endogenous PC1 transcripts in STC-1 cells are the 2.6- and 4.0-kb messages (Fig. 7A). These transcripts were observed in STC-1 cells, control SCD9 cells, and anti-PC2 S2H4 cells. In S1F2 cells, however, antisense PC1 message was not observed and only very low levels of sense PC1 messages were present. This was assumed to be due to the degradation of the sense and antisense RNA duplex. Northern analysis on the same cell lines using PC2 as a probe revealed that all four cell lines expressed similar levels of a single endogenous PC2 transcript of 2.2 kb (Fig. 7B). In addition to the endogenous PC2 message, S2H4 cells expressed a large amount of antisense PC2 message, which was measured by densitometry to be about 15-fold greater than the sense message. Although the expression of antisense PC1 message resulted in almost complete disappearance of the endogenous PC1 message in S1F2 cells, it appeared to have little effect on the expression of PC2 message. Similarly, the expression of a large amount of antisense PC2 message in S2H4 cells appeared to have little effect on the expression of PC1 message. This suggests that the effect of antisense is largely specific on the nucleic acid level to its targets in STC-1 cells. Protein measurements on these cell lines by Western blot analysis confirmed the inhibition of PC1 protein expression (Fig. 8A). The two predominant forms of PC1 in STC-1 cells were 87 and 66 kDa, similar to the forms seen in Rin5F cells. Both forms were found to be greatly reduced in S1F2 cells. Quantitation by densitometry showed approximately an 80% inhibition as compared with STC-1, SCD9, and S2H4. The observation that neither the 75-kDa nor the 66-kDa PC2 protein levels in S1F2 cells were decreased demonstrates that the antisense inhibition in these cells is specific (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, although the endogenous PC2 message was not altered after the expression of antisense PC2 in S2H4 cells, we also observed a reduction in PC2 protein level of approximately 50% in S2H4 cells. STC-1 cells produce a CCK 8 immunoreactive peptide, which co-elutes with CCK 8 on high performance liquid chromatography in STC-1 cells (22Yoon J.Y. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 973-977Google Scholar). Further analysis using Sephadex G-50 chromatography revealed that there are also significant amounts of a larger amidated form that co-elutes with a porcine CCK 22 standard produced by endoproteolysis of porcine CCK 33 with endo-Lys C (Fig. 9A). Further chemical characterization of this peptide has not been possible as a synthetic standard corresponding to rat CCK 22 is not available for high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Chromatography of extracts of anti-PC1 S1F2 cells demonstrated a specific ablation of CCK 8 relative to CCK 22 (Fig. 9B). Similar analysis of extracts of control SCD9 cells did not reveal depletion of either CCK 22 or CCK 8 (data not shown). The complexity of the differential processing of pro-CCK to various bioactive products is reflected by the large number of amidated forms that have been isolated from different tissues and species including CCK 8 (44Dockray G.J. Gregory R.A. Hutchinson J.B. Nature. 1978; 274: 711-713Google Scholar, 45Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4022-4030Google Scholar), CCK 22 (46Cantor P. Rehfeld J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G53-G61Google Scholar), CCK 33 (47Mutt V. Jorpes J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 156-162Google Scholar), CCK 58 (48Eberlein G.A. Eysselein V.E. Goebell H. Peptides. 1988; 9: 993-998Google Scholar), and CCK 83 (48Eberlein G.A. Eysselein V.E. Goebell H. Peptides. 1988; 9: 993-998Google Scholar). Several different processing pathways have been proposed based on these CCK intermediates (49Rehfeld J.F. Hansen H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5832-5840Google Scholar, 50Eberlein G.A. Eysseling V.E. Davis M.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. Grandt D. Niebel W. Bayliss W.M. Moessner J. Zech J. Meyer H.E. Goebell H. Reeve Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1517-1521Google Scholar), which suggests a regulatory mechanism for the fate of pro-CCK during processing. The most likely mechanism underlying differential processing is by the control of the activity of different endoproteases. In an attempt to identify endoproteases that are involved in pro-CCK processing, we have correlated the inhibition of PC1 expression in both STC-1 and Rin5F cells with specific alteration of CCK 8 content using antisense inhibition. The stable expression of anti-PC1 mRNA results in a long lasting inhibition of PC1 protein expression with no alteration of CCK mRNA or PC2 mRNA or protein levels. This is accompanied by a long lasting inhibition of CCK 8 production. A small but significant decrease in CCK levels was also observed as a result of transient expression of anti-PC1 mRNA using the Lac Switch system. In these experiments, the decrease in CCK content was roughly proportion to expression of anti-PC1 mRNA. The observation from these studies that the inhibition of PC1 correlates with the inhibition of CCK 8 cell content suggests that PC1 is necessary for CCK 8 biosynthesis. In support of this proposal is the observation that stable expression of the rat CCK cDNA in At-T20 cells, which express PC1 but not PC2, results in the synthesis and regulated secretion of large amounts of amidated CCK 8. 2M. C. Beinfeld, unpublished observation. The comparative sparing of CCK 22 suggests that PC1 is necessary for the formation of CCK 8 but not for CCK 22. Furthermore, the depletion of CCK 8 selectively demonstrates that the effect of antisense is specific for CCK 8 and is not the result of decreased production of pro-CCK. Recent studies 3J. Yoon and M. C. Beinfeld, manuscript in preparation. have shown that inhibition of expression of PC2 in STC-1 and Rin5F cell lines results in the opposite phenotype (depletion of CCK 22 relative to CCK 8). These results, taken together with the observation that both CCK 22 and CCK 8 are secreted by wild type STC-1 and Rin5F, 4J. Yoon and M. C. Beinfeld, unpublished observation. suggest that CCK 8 and CCK 22 are both end products of pro-CCK processing which do not readily interconvert and that they are produced by independent processing pathways of pro-CCK. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the differences in processing of pro-CCK observed in brain and gut are related to tissue differences in expression or activity of PC1 and PC2. The site where PC1 is acting on the pro-CCK sequence is still under investigation. PC1 is probably cleaving at an Arg-Asp site to release carboxyl-terminal extended CCK 8 from pro-CCK (Fig. 10), although it may also be cleaving further upstream in pro-CCK. It is also possible that PC1 may be acting indirectly to regulate the activity of another enzyme that acts directly on pro-CCK. Purified CCK 8-generating enzyme and purified recombinant YAP3 and PC 2 are also able to cleave amidated, sulfated porcine CCK 33 at this same site to generate amidated CCK 8 (13Viereck J.C. Beinfeld M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19475-19481Google Scholar, 55Cawley N.X. Chen H.-C. Beinfeld M.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4168-4176Google Scholar, 56Wang W. Beinfeld M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 149-152Google Scholar), so that there are a number of possible endoproteases which could potentially process pro-CCK in different tissues. Because specific, non-cytotoxic inhibitors of PC1 are not available, we inhibited PC 1 expression by an antisense strategy. Studies using antisense inhibition have been criticized because of possible nonspecific cellular effects complicating interpretation of the results. In light of these concerns, we performed several controls to ensure that the effects of antisense expression on the processing of pro-CCK were specific. The two most important controls performed were to measure the effects of antisense expression on target mRNA and target protein in both Rin5F and STC-1 cells. We observed at least three different effects on target mRNA by Northern analysis in transfected cell lines: (a) the accumulation of both endogenous PC1 message along with alternatively spliced transcripts in antisense PC1-transfected Rin5F cells, (b) the disappearance of endogenous PC1 message in antisense PC1-transfected STC-1 cells, and (c) no alteration of transcript size or quantity of the endogenous PC1 message in antisense PC2-transfected STC-1 cells. In all three cases, the target protein level was dramatically reduced when measured by Western blot analysis. These observations suggest that the effect of antisense on the RNA level is complex and may be affected at multiple levels to produce inhibition of the protein product. In fact, many mechanisms of action have been proposed previously for antisense including inhibition of primary transcript processing (42Feng B. Denhardt D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 660: 280-282Google Scholar, 51Goodchild J. Agarwal S. Civeria M.P. Sarin P.S. Sun D. Zamecnik P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another control that was performed was to measure the effect of PC2 message and protein level in antisense PC1-transfected cells and vice versa Although PC1 and PC2 are homologous genes within the same family of endoproteases, the effect of antisense was specific for each. These observations suggest that inhibition by antisense in these cells was highly specific. Further detailed analysis of pro-CCK processing intermediates produced by these transfected cells should yield more information about the nature of pro-CCK processing and possibly identify the site at which PC1 is acting. The successful antisense inhibition of PC1 or PC2 in Rin5F and STC-1 cells identifies a possible method to study pro-CCK processing in other systems as well, including in living animals. Furthermore, since PC1 and PC2 are known to cleave a large number of other biologically active peptides, this approach may be helpful in studies of processing pathways of those peptides as well. We greatly appreciate the PC1 and PC2 polyclonal antibodies from Dr. Iris Lindberg (Louisiana State Medical Center), portions of the PC1 and PC2 rat cDNA from Dr. Richard Mains (Johns Hopkins University), and the STC-1 cell line from Dr. Douglas Hanahan (University of California, San Francisco)."

The collection of TAFs associated with TBP appear to dictate the polymerase specificity of a given TBP-TAF complex. Thus, the present day nomenclature of TAFIs, TAFIIs, and TAFIIIs has arisen to allow demarcation of the RNA polymerase specificity of a given TAF. The exact number of TBP-TAF complexes that exist within the cell and the complement of TAFs that make up each specific complex are currently unclear and are actively being investigated by a number of laboratories. TATA-binding protein TBP-associated factor yeast TAF RNA polymerase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin epitope anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin whole cell extract open reading frame monoclonal antibody TFIID is the TBP-TAF complex dedicated to RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription. RNAP II is the polymerase responsible for the transcription of mRNA encoding genes. In the three major model systems studied to date (human, Drosophila, and yeast), the TFIID complex has been found to consist of TBP and 9-12 tightly associated TAFII polypeptides ranging in size from Mr = 250,000 to 15,000 (11Chiang C.M.

Although all studies of TAFII function report an obligatory role for TBP in RNA polymerase II transcription, the exact role that the TBP-TAFII complex TFIID plays in transcription and transcriptional regulation remains to be elucidated (28Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Google Scholar, 29Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Google Scholar, 30Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A.

Studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBP-TAF complexes by our lab and others have suggested the presence of a TFIID complex that consists minimally of TBP and TAFIIs of 150, 130, 90, 60, 40, 30, and 25 kDa (14Reese J.C.

Here we extend these findings by reporting the cloning and characterization of TAF40, the gene encoding the ∼40,000-Da moiety of the yeast TFIID complex. We find that the gene encoding yTAF40 is both single copy and essential for viability. The polypeptide sequence deduced for yTAF40 exhibits sequence similarity to two known metazoan TAFIIs: hTAFII28 (human) and dTAFII30β (Drosophila). In the studies reported here we demonstrate that yTAF40 is in fact a bone fide TBP-associated factor that is part of the yeast TFIID complex. Further, by utilizing various in vitro transcription assays we show that the function of the yTAF40-containing TBP-TAF complex is RNA polymerase II-specific, thus the protein encoded by TAF40 has been termed yTAFII40. Protein extracts used for preparative yTAF protein purification via immunoaffinity chromatography were prepared from BJ5457 cells (32Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Google Scholar). The yeast strains expressing either HA3-tagged TBP or the variously HA3-tagged yTAFs that were used for WCE preparation and coimmunoprecipitation studies have been described previously (25Klebanow E.R.

Yeast strains yEK8, yEK31, and yEK200 (see below) have the following genotypes: yEK8, MATa/α leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 his3/his3 trp1/trp1 suc2/suc2 ADE2/ade2 lys2/LYS2 TAF40/taf40Δ1::TRP1; yEK31, MAT α leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 suc2 ade2 lys2 taf40Δ1::TRP1 pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA; and yEK200, MAT α leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 suc2 ade2 lys2 taf40Δ1::TRP1 pRS415-HA3TAF40. All DNA subcloning manipulations were performed in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Yeast TAF proteins were preparatively purified by immunochromatography on columns containing anti-TBP IgG covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Purified yTAFs (13Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol.

The resulting tryptic peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced. The sequences of four of the resulting peptides were determined. These peptides had the following sequences: peptide 1, K/RLLVTNLDKDQTNRFEVFHR; peptide 2, K/RQMIDQVISEDQDYVTXK; peptide 3, K/RETTLGNSLLQS; and peptide 4, K/RLQSDTLPNAYWR. BLAST searches (36Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. States D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) were used to scan data bases for protein sequence homologies, whereas Geneworks software (Intelligenetics Inc.) was used to generate and format sequence alignments. The gene encoding yTAF40 was cloned via a PCR strategy based upon the amino acid sequence of yTAF40 tryptic peptide 2. Two degenerate primers with HindIII (upstream) and XbaI (downstream) restriction endonuclease recognition sites (upstream, GAGACA(A/G)ATGAT(T/A/C)GA(T/C)CA, HindIII site underlined; downstream, GAGAAC(A/G)TA(A/G)TC(T/C)TG(A/G)TC, XbaI site underlined) were synthesized. In a first round of PCR, the downstream oligo was used together with an oligo (GCAAAAACTGCATAACCACTTTAACTAATAC) complementary to GAL1 promoter sequence downstream of the insertion site of cDNAs into vector pRS316-Gal1-cDNA (37Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Google Scholar), using total cDNA library DNA as the template. The products of this first PCR reaction were used as the template along with both degenerate oligonucleotides as primers in a second PCR reaction. The products of this second PCR reaction were subsequently digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the correct length (47 base pairs) product was cloned into HindIII/XbaI-digested pBSIIKS+ (Stratagene) for DNA sequence determination. From the determined nondegenerate sequence an oligonucleotide was designed (CAAGTCATCAGTGAGGA) that was then used to screen a yeast cDNA library. The cDNA clone with the longest insert resulting from this library screening was sequenced. A 1.3-kilobase pair fragment of this cDNA clone was then 32P-labeled and used to screen a yeast genomic DNA library (ATCC 77164) to obtain a full-length plasmid clone of the gene encoding yTAF40. The insert of the resulting plasmid was sequenced in entirety using standard dideoxy sequencing methods. Diploid strain SEY6210.5 was used as the parental strain for the disruption of TAF40 PCR was used to generate a knockout DNA fragment containing 50 base pairs of TAF40 upstream sequences and 50 base pairs of TAF40 downstream sequences bracketing an intact TRP1 gene. This DNA fragment was gel-purified and used to generate, via homologous recombination (38Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Google Scholar), a TAF40 null allele by transforming strain SEY6210.5 to tryptophan prototrophy; the resulting Trp+ strain was called yEK8. Proper integration of the taf40Δ1::TRP1 disrupting fragment at the TAF40 locus was verified by genomic Southern blotting. One of the cDNA plasmids found to contain the full-length TAF40 cDNA termed pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA (see above) was then used to transform yEK8 to uracil prototrophy to produce yeast strain yEK8/pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA. This strain was then sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were dissected onto galactose containing plates. The resulting spores were germinated and subjected to phenotypic testing. One of the resulting spore clones derived from this dissection was termed yEK31. yEK31 has the relevant genotype of taf40Δ1::TRP1 ura3 leu2 pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA. A plasmid expressing HA3-tagged yTAF40 was constructed as follows. The genomic 2646-base pair EcoRV/XbaI TAF40 gene fragment was cloned into pBSIIKS− (Stratagene). The EcoRI site in the TAF40 promoter region was eliminated by digesting with EcoRI and filling in these ends with E. coli Klenow DNA polymerase I and then religating the ends. Subsequently an EcoRI site was introduced just 5′ to the TAF40 ORF ATG using site-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) to generate a plasmid termed pBSIIKS−-EcoRI-TAF40. A PCR fragment encoding three copies of the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA) tag (40Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Google Scholar) with EcoRI ends was inserted into the EcoRI site of pBSIIKS−-EcoRI-TAF40 to generate pBSIIKS−-HA3-TAF40. An XbaI/HindIII fragment from this plasmid was then cloned into similarly digested pRS415 (Stratagene) to generate pRS415-HA3-TAF40. This plasmid was introduced into haploid strain yEK31 via transformation, and this LEU2-marked CEN/ARS plasmid was exchanged for the URA3-marked pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA plasmid by overnight growth in appropriate selective medium. The resulting strain, termed yEK200, had the taf40Δ1::TRP1 null allele covered by the plasmid pRS415-HA3-TAF40. The TAF40 ORF (codons 32-347) was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in PCR reactions using the following two oligonucleotides as primers: upstream GAGAATTGACCAAGTCATCAGTG (EcoRI site underlined) and downstream GAGATATCTGAACATGGATCCC (KpnI site underlined). PCR reactions with these primers were templated with cloned genomic TAF40 sequences. The PCR product obtained was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and then cloned into similarly digested baculovirus transfer vector plasmid pAcHLT-A (Pharmingen). The resulting plasmid was cotransfected, along with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold-Pharmingen) into SF-9 insect cells grown in TMN-FH medium (JRH Scientific). Three rounds of virus amplification were then carried out in SF-9 cells to generate high titer virus stocks. For large scale yTAF40 protein production, virus at an multiplicity of infection of 5 was used to infect High-Five insect cells (Invitrogen) grown in spinner flasks using Ex-Cell 400 medium (JRH Scientific). Infected cells were harvested 64 h postinfection and then washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) prior to making a lysate using a denaturing buffer (Buffer A, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M NaH2P04, 0.01 M Tris, pH 8.0). His6yTAF40 fusion protein was purified under denaturing conditions using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) resin (1 ml of resin/500 ml of infected cells). After batchwise washing (Buffer B, 8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2P04, 0.01 M Tris, pH 6.3), the resin was loaded into a syringe column, and bound His6TAF40 was eluted utilizing a pH jump (Buffer D, 8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2P04, 0.01 M Tris, pH 5.0). The approximate yield of purified protein was ≥1 mg of His6yTAF40 from 500 ml of infected High-Five insect cell culture. Protein purity (∼85%) was estimated by Coomassie staining of an SDS gel. Polyclonal antibodies directed against yTAF40 were raised in rabbits by Bethyl Labs, Inc. (Montgomery, TX) using purified baculoviral expressed His6yTAF40 as antigen. Total rabbit IgG was purified from the resulting rabbit serum using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) chromatography (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 309-310Google Scholar). Anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin (anti-HA) monoclonal antibody, 12CA5, which reacts with the HA epitope (YPYDVPDA), was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose was used to deplete HA3-yTAF40, and associated proteins from 100-μl aliquots of transcriptionally competent WCE were prepared from yeast strain yEK200 by the method of Woontner et al. (42Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Google Scholar). The procedures followed for the preparation of resins, and the immunodepletion reactions were as previously described (25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar). The supernatants from these immunodepletion reactions were frozen in 50-μl aliquots at −70°C until assayed for both yTAF40 content and residual RNAP I-, II-, and III-specific transcriptional activity. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar). Where indicated, blots were subjected to quantitation by exposing the developed blot to a Bio-Rad high intensity imaging screen, which was then analyzed using the Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager and Molecular Analyst Software. RNA polymerase I-, II-, and III-specific transcription assays were carried out as described previously (Refs. 25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar, 43Klekamp M.S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2819-2827Google Scholar, and 44Poon D. Knittle R.A. Sabelko K.A. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5005-5013Google Scholar, respectively). Specific transcript production was quantitated using a Bio-Rad Imager as described above. Using conventional and anti-TBP immunoaffinity chromatography we have been able to purify TAFs from yeast whole cell extracts (13Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Google Scholar, 25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar, 26Henry N. Campbell A. Feaver W. Poon D. Weil P. Kornberg R.

A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Google Scholar, 33Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Google Scholar). A yTAF of Mr 40,000 is readily visualized on silver-stained SDS gels from these preparations (e.g. see Fig. 1 in 25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar). Peptide sequence was obtained from this 40-kDa TAF as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” At the time when this sequence was obtained GenBank™ and Saccharomyces Genome data base searches using the BLAST search algorithms (36Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. States D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) revealed that these sequences were novel. In order to clone the gene encoding yTAF40, the amino acid sequence of one of the tryptic peptides derived from yTAF40 (peptide 2, (K/R)QMIDQVISEDQDYVTXK) was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primer pairs for use in the polymerase chain reaction for amplification of the DNA encoding this peptide. Total yeast cDNA library DNA (37Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Google Scholar) was used as the template for this PCR reaction. As detailed under “Materials and Methods,” two separate rounds of PCR amplification had to be performed to obtain significant quantities of the correct length product. This requirement for two separate rounds of PCR was probably due to the high degree of degeneracy of the oligonucleotides used as primers. The correct length PCR product was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined. An oligonucleotide derived from this sequence was then synthesized, labeled, and used as a probe to screen a yeast cDNA library (37Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Google Scholar) to obtain a full-length cDNA encoding yTAF40. Sequence information derived from positive clones from this screen allowed the preparation of a longer labeled probe, which was then used to screen a yeast genomic library. Sequencing of a positive genomic plasmid clone revealed an ORF of 1038 nucleotides (GenBank™ accession number ). As shown in Fig. 1 this sequence contained all four of the peptides obtained from the microsequencing of the band corresponding to the Mr 40,000 TAF polypeptide, suggesting that in fact we had cloned the gene encoding yTAF40. To further substantiate this fact, polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits immunized with purified recombinant baculovirally expressed yTAF40 protein was able to specifically recognize the 40-kDa protein in our TAF fraction (data not shown and see Fig. 3 below). This cloned gene has been termed TAF40 for TBP-associated factor 40,000. The predicted molecular weight of yTAF40 is 40620, which is similar to its apparent Mr observed in our SDS-PAGE analyses. The protein is mildly acidic with an estimated pI of 5.35. Upon searching more recent editions of sequence data bases with the yTAF40-deduced protein sequence several matches to yeast and other metazoan proteins were noted. The yTAF40 sequence matched (p = 8.1e−200) to Protein Information Resource entry S55104, a previously uncharacterized yeast ORF. Interestingly yTAF40 also matched to PIR entries S54780 (hTAFII28; p = 8.4e−13, 27% identity 67% similarity over yTAF40 residues 122-181) and B49453 (dTAFII30β; p = 9.3e−11, 30% identity and 68% similarity over yTAF40 residues 122-181). Several other weaker matches were also noted, the most notable being a match of yTAF40 residues 236-305 to human TFIIA α chain polypeptide sequences 280-349. Presented in Fig. 2 is an alignment of yTAF40 to both Drosophila TAFII30β (23Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Admon A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2587-2597Google Scholar) and human TAFII28 (19Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Google Scholar). Although overall identity between all three of these TAFs is relatively low (only 9% of yTAF40 sequence is identical to these other TAFs), in an 81-amino acid region between yTAF40 residues 111-192 there is 23% identity and 57% similarity among all three TAFs. It is important to note though that yTAF40 is significantly longer than either metazoan TAFII, thus overall identity must be somewhat low. The finding of similarity between yet another yTAF and metazoan TFIID subunits at the amino acid sequence level is not surprising. In fact all of the yTAFs identified thus far display significant sequence similarity to metazoan TAFs. However, it remains to be determined if these similarities reflect true functional homology. Regardless, the finding that yTAF40 has sequence similarity to TAFIIs of other species is strong preliminary evidence that yTAF40 is in fact an RNA polymerase II-specific TAF. Prior to performing gene disruption experiments, we examined TAF40 genomic DNA and RNA species to rule out the potential for multiple TAF40 encoding genes. Genomic DNA blots (not shown) indicated that TAF40 is present at a single copy per haploid genome, whereas RNA blots showed that only a single 1.1-kilobase RNA species anneals with TAF40-derived probes (not shown). The size of this mRNA is consistent with the size of the TAF40 ORF. When yeast strain yEK8 was sporulated and the resulting tetrads were dissected, viability segregated 2+:2−, all viable spores were Trp−, suggesting that TAF40 is a single copy essential gene. When yEK8 was subsequently transformed to uracil prototrophy with the URA3-marked plasmid pRS316-Gal1-TAF40 cDNA and then sporulated upon tetrad dissection, all four spores were viable on galactose containing medium, all Trp+ spores were Ura+, and the Trp+ phenotype segregated 2+:2− as expected. These Trp+Ura+ spore clones were also unable to grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid containing medium (45Boeke J. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Google Scholar) indicating a requirement for the TAF40 covering plasmid in the spore clones carrying the taf40Δ::TRP1 null allele. These genetic and biochemical analyses prove that TAF40 is an essential gene. With the exception of yeast TAF30 (ANC1/TFG3) (26Henry N. Campbell A. Feaver W. Poon D. Weil P. Kornberg R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Google Scholar), all of the other characterized yeast TAF-encoding genes (TAF170, TAF150, TAF130, TAF90, TAF60, and TAF25) are essential (25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar, 27Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Google Scholar, 33Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Google Scholar). That all of these TAFs are essential underscores the vital role that they must serve in yeast cell function. To show that yTAF40 is a bona fide TAF, we utilized the technique of coimmunoprecipitation. If yTAF40 is truly TBP-associated, then it should be detectable in an immunoprecipitate of a WCE treated with antibodies directed against TBP. The converse should also be true in that TBP should be detectable in an anti-yTAF40 immunoprecipitate. For these coimmunoprecipitation studies we utilized our collection of yeast strains expressing HA3-tagged TAFs and/or HA3-tagged TBP as well as polyclonal rabbit anti-yTAF40 antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”). In the experiment depicted in Fig. 3 (upper panel) immunoprecipitates were formed using the anti-epitope antibody (anti-HA) and WCEs prepared from each of our immunotagged yeast strains along with an untagged control. An immunoblot of these immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA mAb shows that only the appropriate epitope-tagged TAF or epitope-tagged TBP are readily and specifically detected. Thus for each strain tested the only reacting species detected in the anti-HA immunoblot is the corresponding single, correct sized epitope-tagged polypeptide that the strain expresses. The background resulting from immunoblotting the immunoprecipitate from the same yeast strain, which lacks any HA3-tagged species, is shown in lane 1 of Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 (lower panel) are presented the results of the portion of this immunoprecipitation experiment designed to examine whether yTAF40 is indeed both TBP- and yTAFII-associated. In this experiment immunoprecipitates were again formed using anti-HA mAb, but in this case, the SDS-PAGE fractionated and blotted immunoprecipitates were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-yTAF40 IgG. As can be seen from the results presented in Fig. 3 (lower panel, lane 7), yTAF40 is indeed associated with TBP because yTAF40 is readily identified in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate from the strain that expresses HA3-TBP as its only form of TBP. The converse experiment utilizing anti-TAF40 IgG for the immunoprecipitation step and anti-HA mAb for the immunodetection step (data not shown) revealed that HA3-TBP is readily detected in the yTAF40 immunoprecipitate, indicating once again that TBP and yTAF40 are associated. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that TBP and yTAF40 are complexed, thus confirming that TAF40 encodes a bona fide yeast TAF. Again the control where the immunoprecipitate is derived from a strain lacking any HA3-tagged species demonstrates the specificity of the precipitation and detection (Fig. 3, lower panel, compare lane 1 with lane 7). To determine which of the other TAFs are associated with yTAF40, we extended the above analysis. Our previous biochemical studies suggested that yTAF40 is a subunit of a complex consisting minimally of yTAFs 150, 130, 90, 60, 30, and 25 and TBP (25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar, 27Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3 (lower panel, lanes 2-8 versus lane 1), yTAF40 is specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates formed using anti-HA mAb and WCEs derived from yeast strains expressing HA3-tagged TAFs 150, 130, 90, 60, 40, and 25 and TBP. Notably though, yTAF40 is not detected in immunoprecipitates formed from yeast strains expressing HA3-tagged Brf1p (yTAFIII70) (lane 9) or Mot1p (yTAF170) (lane 10). Both of these TAFs are components of distinct non-TFIID, TBP-TAF containing complexes (33Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Google Scholar, 46Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Google Scholar, 47Huet J. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6451-6454Google Scholar, 48Auble D. Hansen K. Mueller C. Lane W. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Google Scholar). If the converse experiment is performed, that is immunoprecipitating yTAF40 (and associated polypeptides) from WCEs with polyclonal anti-yTAF40 antibodies and using anti-HA mAb for HA3-TAF and/or HA3-TBP immunodetection, the predicted and complementary result is obtained. In this case yTAF40 is found associated with yTAFs 150, 130, 90, 60, and 25 and TBP but not with either Mot1p or Brf1p (data not shown). That yTAF40 coprecipitates with each of the other known TAFIIs individually confirms our previous supposition that yTAF40 is in fact part of the yeast TFIID complex that contains all of these TAFIIs (13Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Google Scholar, 25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar, 27Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that yTAF40 is a bona fide yTAF that is associated with previously characterized yTAFIIs, our next goal was to test if yTAF40 truly is a TFIID subunit. If this is true then yTAF40 functional activity should be RNA polymerase II-specific. The strategy that we took to test this idea again utilized coimmunoprecipitation. We immunodepleted a yeast WCE of yTAF40 and associated proteins and then used the depleted extracts for in vitro transcription assays to measure the ability of control, mock-depleted, and depleted extracts to support specifically initiated transcription by each of the three distinct nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase systems. We reasoned that if yTAF40 was uniquely a subunit of TFIID, then only RNAP II-specific transcription should be altered in yTAF40-depleted WCEs. Treatment of yeast WCE with the anti-HA mAb 12CA5 removed ∼75% of the HA-tagged yTAF40 from the extract (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1, 2, and 5). This depletion was specific because when the anti-HA mAb was preincubated with the HA peptide prior to mixing with WCE, this peptide-blocked mAb preparation failed to remove yTAF40 from the WCE (Fig. 4A, compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2 compared with lanes 1 and 5). The ability to block the depletion was specific to the peptide because preincubation of the mAb with peptide buffer alone generated mAb that was fully able to deplete as effectively as untreated mAb alone (compare lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 4A). As a further control there was as much yTAF40 in WCE that underwent overnight incubation as there was in freshly thawed WCE (compare lanes 1 and 5 in Fig. 4A). When the depleted extracts were tested for their ability to support transcription by RNA polymerase I (Fig. 4B) or RNA polymerase III (Fig. 4D), only minimal effects of yTAF40 depletion were observed. The depleted extract was as competent for specific RNAP I and RNAP III transcription as was the mock-depleted extract (i.e. HA-peptide blocked extract; Fig. 4B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 4D compare lanes 1-3 with lanes 4-6). In marked contrast, dramatic effects of depletion were observed when the depleted extract was tested for RNA polymerase II transcription. Basal transcription resulting from transcription from the G-minus cassette transcription template for the depleted extract was reduced to ∼25% of that observed for the mock-depleted extract. These data clearly demonstrate that whether we deplete a yeast WCE of its TFIID-like TAF-TBP complex by removing yTAF40 (this report) or, as we previously demonstrated for yTAFII25 (25Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Google Scholar), the result as expected is the same, only RNA polymerase II function is abrogated. Furthermore, because yTAF40 is associated with yTAF25 (see Fig. 3, lane 8), these data further corroborate the idea that the yTAFII25/yTAFII40-containing TBP-TAF complex represents the major (if not the only) form of TFIID in yeasts. If this were not the case, then one would not expect such a large proportional decrease in basal RNA polymerase II-specific transcription upon removal of the complex by either yTAFII25 or yTAFII40 depletion. In this report we have described the identification, cloning, and characterization of a gene termed TAF40 that encodes a novel yeast TBP-associated factor, yTAFII40. The deduced amino acid sequence of yTAFII40 bears significant similarity to that of both human and Drosophila TAFIIs. The single copy TAF40 gene is essential for vegetative growth, a property this gene shares with other yeast TAF-encoding genes. We show that yTAF40 protein is TBP-associated and thus a bone fide TAF and that it is a subunit of a yeast TFIID multiprotein TBP-TAFII complex. Through this work we have added to the body of evidence supporting the existence of a discrete yeast TFIID complex by directly demonstrating that the yTAF40 containing TBP-TAF complex is specific to RNA polymerase II function. Further studies are needed to determine the exact composition and function of the TFIID complex. We are extremely grateful to Robert Tjian (University of California at Berkeley) for help in the amino acid sequencing of yTAFII40. We also thank members of our lab for freely sharing reagents, strains, and most of all, constructive criticism and suggestions during the course of this work."

Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar) with promoter mutations at −55 or −57 bp (16Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Ankelsaria P. Erickson R.W. Dese J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Google Scholar, 17Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.E. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Google Scholar). Either of these mutations disrupted in vitro binding of a specific protein complex, referred to as HAF1 (ematopoiesis-ssociated actor) (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar). 450 bp of proximal promoter sequence directed IFN-γ-inducible reporter gene expression in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line PLB985 (18Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 327-328Google Scholar), and this inducible expression was abolished by introduction of the −55 bp chronic granulomatous disease promoter mutation (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar). HAF1 binding was necessary, but not sufficient, for IFN-γ-stimulated gp91phox transcription since PLB985 transfectants with constructs containing 100 bp of proximal promoter sequence did not respond to IFN-γ. These results suggested that elements between −100 and −450 bp must be involved in IFN-γ-induced transcription. Further evaluation of the −100 to −450 bp promoter region revealed the presence of three IFN-γ response elements (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Successive promoter truncations located the IFN-γ response elements between −100 and −210 bp, −210 and −310 bp, and −310 and −450 bp (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated sequence-specific binding of protein complexes to probes representing −114 to −184 bp, −213 to −262 bp, and −331 to −381 bp (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Binding of the complexes was increased by IFN-γ, retinoic acid, or PMA treatment of PLB985 cells; therefore, the complexes were referred to as BID1, BID2, and BID3, respectively, because inding ncreased during ifferentiation (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Treatment of the epithelial cell line HeLa with IFN-γ did not increase BID1, BID2, or BID3 binding (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). The BID2 complex bound to −224 to −236 bp of the CYBB promoter (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Although this sequence was homologous to both the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (20Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8521-8525Google Scholar) and the common binding site consensus sequence for the interferon response factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 (21Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Google Scholar), the BID2 complex was not recognized by antibodies to Stat1α, IRF-1, IRF-2, ICSBP, or interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 γ (ISGF3γ) (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). IRF-2 bound to this region of the promoter in EMSA using nuclear proteins from undifferentiated PLB985 cells and was distinct from BID2 binding (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). However, IRF-2 binding was obscured by BID2 complex binding in nuclear proteins of differentiated PLB985 cells (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Immediately 3′ to the BID2-binding site was a homeodomain-binding consensus sequence (ATTA). This suggested the presence of a second CDP-binding site adjacent to the BID2 site since CDP preferentially bound ATTA-containing sequences in binding site selection assays (22Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Google Scholar, 23Andres V. Chiara M.D. Manhdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Google Scholar). Introduction of a mutation into the 450-bp proximal promoter sequence that disrupted in vitro binding of the BID2 complex attenuated IFN-γ-induced expression of a linked reporter gene in PLB985 transfectants (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar). Therefore, the BID2 complex might represent a previously unidentified protein(s) that bound to a positive regulatory element, interacted with IRF-2 and/or CDP, and contributed to lineage-specific gp91phox expression. The identity of BID2 component proteins was sought by molecular cloning techniques. We previously reported cloning a cDNA by screening a human leukocyte library for proteins that bound a DNA probe representing the −214 to −262 bp sequence of the CYBB promoter (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 231-235Google Scholar). Although this promoter sequence included the BID2-binding site, the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned cDNA was not homologous to previously described interferon response factors. However, the cloned cDNA contained a sequence homologous to the S1-RM domain of ribosomal protein S1 (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 231-235Google Scholar). The S1-RM domain has been postulated to bind single-stranded RNA (25Gribskov M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 107-111Google Scholar). The cloned S1-like protein had high affinity for binding double- and single-stranded DNAs, but low affinity for binding single-stranded RNA (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 231-235Google Scholar). Since the S1-like protein was of low abundance and immunoreactive S1-like protein was not found in ribosomal preparations, we concluded that the cloned cDNA was unlikely to represent human ribosomal S1 protein (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 231-235Google Scholar). The S1-like protein was referred to as TF1phox and is further characterized in this study. The 1.5-kb sequence clone (includes the entire coding sequence) was excised from λgt11 by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the plasmid vector pUC19 as described (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 231-235Google Scholar). A 5′-clone sequence (+1 to +1866 bp of the cDNA) was similarly isolated from λ DNA and subcloned into pUC19. The 2.69-kb sequence (+1 to +2690 bp, the entire cDNA) was constructed by ligation of the 5′-clone and the original 1.5-kb clone sequences at a unique HpaI site found in the sequences common to both clones. For in vitro translation, the TF1phox sequences were subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For expression in Escherichia coli, the 1.5-kb clone sequence was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the plasmid pGEX1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) in the sense and antisense orientations (TF1phox/pGEX1 and TF1phox(R)/pGEX1, respectively). For expression in mammalian cells, the 1.5-kb clone sequence was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the plasmid pSRα (obtained from T. Gabig, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN) (27Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 8: 466-472Google Scholar) or pRc(CMV) (Invitrogen, Sorrento, CA). TF1phox cDNA sequences were epitope-tagged at the C terminus of the coding sequence with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HAI; amino acid sequence IDYPYDVPDYAE (28Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Google Scholar)). Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the epitope tag were annealed, phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim), and ligated in frame into an EcoRV site found 20 amino acids from the end of the TF1phox coding sequence. Correct orientation of the cDNA was confirmed for all constructs by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase system, Amersham Corp.). Concatenated CYBB promoter sequences were subcloned into the minimal promoter/reporter vector p-TATA/CAT (obtained from Dr. A. Kraft, University of Alabama at Birmingham) (29Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2557Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides with the sense and antisense −194 to −244 bp gp91phox promoter sequences were annealed, phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim). The concatenated oligonucleotides were subcloned into the p-TATA/CAT vector. Clones that were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing to contain four correct copies of the −194 to −244 bp promoter sequence in the sense or antisense orientation were selected. Duplex synthetic oligonucleotides with the −194 to −244 bp, −213 to −262 bp, or −76 to −138 bp promoter sequence were subcloned into the plasmid vector pUC19, and correct sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Human gp91phox cDNA sequence was obtained from Dr. Peter Newburger (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Human p47phox (30Lomax K.J. Leto T.L. Nunoi H. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L.

Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Google Scholar), the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 (35Lozzio B.B. Lossil C.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Google Scholar), the epithelial carcinoma line HeLa (36Gey G.O. Coffman W.D. Kubicek M.T Cancer Res. 1952; 12: 264Google Scholar), and the T-cell leukemia line MoLT-4 (37Minowada J. Onuma T. Moore G.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1972; 49: 891-895Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The B-cell line CESS (38Bradley T.R. Pilkington G. Garson M. Hodgson G.S. Kraft N. Br. J. Haematol. 1982; 51: 595-604Google Scholar) was provided by Yu Chung Yang (Indiana University). The myelomonoblastic line PLB985 (18Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 327-328Google Scholar) was provided by Thomas Rado (University of Alabama at Birmingham). The promyelocytic leukemia cell line U937 (39Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-12Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. A. Kraft (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Cell lines were maintained and differentiated as described previously (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar). HeLa cells were treated for various times with human recombinant interferon-γ at 50 units/ml. Stably transfected PLB985 cell lines carrying the neomycin resistance gene were supplemented with 1.0 mg of Geneticin/ml (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). PLB985, U937, or HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation in phosphate-buffered saline at 960 microfarads and 0.24 V using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Stable transfection of vector or insert sequences was demonstrated by Southern blotting as described previously (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar). A human leukocyte λgt11 library (CLONTECH) was screened with the 1.5-kb TF1phox clone sequence by DNA-DNA hybridization as described (40Denhart D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-646Google Scholar). The TF1phox sequence was labeled with 32P by the random primer method (41Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/μg. Positive plaques were purified through six iterations as described (24Eklund E.A. Lee S.Y. Skalnik D.G.

Western blotting and detection were performed using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro transcription and translation of TF1phox sequences cloned into pBluescript were performed using the in vitro transcription and rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation systems (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extract proteins were prepared from tissue culture cells growing at log phase by the method of Dignam et al. (43Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors as described (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Google Scholar). Protein assays were performed by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides probes were prepared from plasmid constructs by restriction digestion with EcoRI and XbaI and filled in by Klenow fragment with a nucleotide mixture containing unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.). The specific activity of the probes was ∼2 × 106 cpm/pmol DNA. EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed as described (15Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Anti-ICSBP serum was obtained from Dr. Keiko Ozato (National Institutes of Health) (46Weisz A. Marx P. Sharf R. Appella E. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Levi B.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25589-25596Google Scholar). Anti-HAI tag antibody was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Total cellular RNA was isolated from log-phase cells by the single step method as described (47Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The polyadenylated RNA fraction was isolated by two rounds of affinity chromatography with oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described (48Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Google Scholar). RNA was electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde gels and transferred to Magnagraph membranes (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were hybridized with random primer-labeled DNA probes and stripped for reprobing according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction-5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed as described (49Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNA isolated from PLB985 cells stimulated for 3 h with PMA (2 μg) was used as a template. Two nested primers complementary to sequences within the first 100 bp of the coding sequence of TF1phox were used. Products were analyzed by Southern blotting and hybridization to TF1phox sequences. PLB985 cells were transfected by electroporation as described above. PLB985 stable transfectants with either control pSRα vector or TF1phox/pSRα were transfected with 100 μg of p-TATA/CAT or p-cybbTATA/CAT and 30 μg of pCMV/β-galactosidase (as an internal control for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were incubated for 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Cell extracts were made by hypotonic lysis as described (50Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Google Scholar) in the presence of 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays (CAT) were performed by the extraction method using [3H]chloramphenicol (Amersham Corp.) as described (50Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Google Scholar). U937 cells were transfected with 70 μg of p-TATA/CAT or p-cybbTATA/CAT, 30 μg of pRc or TF1phox/pRc, and 30 μg of pCMV/β-galactosidase as described above. Cell extracts were analyzed as described above after 24 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To identify DNA-binding proteins that might be involved in gp91phox transcription, EMSA were performed with a DNA probe representing the −194 to −244 bp sequence of the promoter (Fig. 1). This sequence contained the BID2 complex-binding site (19Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429Google Scholar), a sequence similar to the ISRE sequence (20Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8521-8525Google Scholar) and the IRF-1/IRF-2 protein recognition site (−224 to −236 bp) (21Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Google Scholar). This sequence also contained a homeodomain protein recognition core, a potential CDP-binding site (−212 to −215 bp) (Table I) (10Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar). To identify DNA-binding proteins that might be myeloid lineage-specific, EMSA with nuclear proteins from the myeloid cell line PLB985 before and after treatment with IFN-γ were compared with EMSA with nuclear proteins from the IFN-γ-responsive epithelial cell line HeLa. EMSA with the −194 to −244 bp probe and nuclear proteins from PLB985 cells or HeLa cells demonstrated binding of a dominant low mobility complex, similar to the mobility previously described for CDP (10Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar, 11Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar). However, the PLB985 complex was a doublet, and the HeLa complex migrated as a single band. These findings were consistently observed with three sets of protein extracts from each of the two cell lines. Homologous double-stranded oligonucleotide efficiently competed for binding of the low mobility complex to the −194 to −244 bp probe, as did competitor oligonucleotides containing the −76 to −137 bp and −93 to −165 bp CYBB promoter sequences (Fig. 1). The latter two sequences included a previously described CDP-binding site (10Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar, 11Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar). There was no competition for the low mobility complex with several unrelated oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In EMSA with nuclear proteins from HeLa cells, the low mobility complex was disrupted by incubation with anti-CDP serum. However, incubation of PLB985 nuclear proteins with anti-CDP serum did not result in disruption of the low mobility complex doublet (Fig. 2B). For comparison, control EMSA were performed using the −76 to −137 bp promoter region. As described, in EMSA using nuclear proteins from both HeLa and PLB985 cells, low mobility protein complexes bound to this probe (10Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar, 11Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar). However, the complex generated with PLB985 nuclear extract was slightly faster in mobility than the HeLa complex. These protein complexes were demonstrated to represent specific protein binding (data not shown; consistent with previous studies (10Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar, 11Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar)).

The gene, designated B318L, is located within the EcoRI B fragment in the central region of the virus genome, and encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 35,904. The protein is characterized by the presence of a putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain at the amino end. The gene is expressed at the late stage of virus infection, and transcription is initiated at positions −118, −119, −120, and −122 relative to the first nucleotide of the translation start codon. Protein B318L presents a colinear arrangement of the four highly conserved regions and the two aspartate-rich motifs characteristic of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases, farnesyl diphosphate synthases, and other prenyltransferases. Throughout these regions, the percentages of identity between protein B318L and various prenyltransferases range from 28.6 to 48.7%. The gene was cloned in vector pTrxFus without the amino-terminal hydrophobic region and expressed in Escherichia coli The recombinant protein, purified essentially to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with different allylic diphosphates, farnesyl diphosphate being the best allylic substrate of the reaction. All-trans-polyprenyl diphosphates containing 3-13 isoprene units are synthesized, which identifies the B318L protein as a trans-prenyltransferase.

Prenyltransferase is the generic name for a family of enzymes catalyzing the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations used are: IPPisopentenyl diphosphateASFVAfrican swine fever virusDMAPPdimethylallyl diphosphateFPPfarnesyl diphosphateGPPgeranyl diphosphateGGPPgeranylgeranyl diphosphateORFopen reading framekbkilobase(s) with allylic diphosphates to form prenyl diphosphates of different chain length in the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenoid compounds (1Poulter C.D.

Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase, the best characterized members of the prenyltransferase family, catalyze reactions at central positions in the isoprenoid pathway, giving rise to the formation of FPP and GGPP, respectively. These compounds are, in turn, precursors for the synthesis of a variety of products including cholesterol, carotenoids, and prenyl proteins, which are involved in basic cellular functions, such as membrane structure, synthesis of steroid hormones, and intracellular trafficking (3Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 139-142Google Scholar, 4Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Google Scholar). On the other hand, cis- and trans-prenyltransferases catalyze the cis or trans additions of IPP to trans,trans-FPP producing polyprenyl diphosphates, which are precursors of dolychols and ubiquinones, involved, respectively, in synthesis of glycoproteins and electron transport (5Chojnacki T.

Thus, it has been recently shown that prenylation of hepatitis δ virus large antigen is required for the formation and release of virus particles (7Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Google Scholar, 8Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Google Scholar). In addition, other studies with murine leukemia virus have indicated the existence of a relationship between isoprenoid biosynthesis and intracellular transport and processing of the viral envelope protein (9Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22686-22692Google Scholar). These authors have suggested that prenylation of cellular Rab proteins is required for the incorporation of viral envelope precursors into the virions. Despite this role of isoprenoids in the multiplication of certain viruses, no virus-encoded prenyltransferase has been described so far. We report here the characterization of an African swine fever virus (ASFV) gene, designated B318L (10Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Google Scholar), encoding a protein with homology to prenyltransferases. ASFV is a large, enveloped DNA virus, that causes a severe disease in domestic pigs (11Viñuela E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 116: 151-170Google Scholar, 12Costa J.V. Darai G. Molecular Biology of Iridoviruses. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, Holland1990: 247-270Google Scholar). Its genome is formed by a double-stranded, linear DNA molecule of 170-190 kilobase pairs with hairpin loops and terminal inverted repeats (13Sogo J.M. Almendral J.M. Talavera A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1984; 133: 271-275Google Scholar, 14González A. Talavera A. Almendral J.M. Viñuela E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6835-6844Google Scholar), this structure being remarkably similar to that of the poxvirus DNA (15Baroudy B.M. Venkatesan S. Moss B. Cell. 1982; 28: 315-324Google Scholar, 16Wittek R. Moss B. Cell. 1980; 21: 277-284Google Scholar). Also in common with the poxviruses (17Moss B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 163: 41-69Google Scholar), ASFV particles contain all of the enzymatic machinery required for early RNA synthesis (18Kuznar J. Salas M.L. Viñuela E. Virology. 1980; 101: 169-175Google Scholar, 19Salas M.L. Kuznar J. Viñuela E. Virology. 1981; 113: 484-491Google Scholar, 20Salas M.L. Rey-Campos J. Almendral J.M. Talavera A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1986; 152: 228-240Google Scholar). The virion has about 50 structural proteins (21Esteves A. Marques M.I. Costa J.V. Virology. 1986; 152: 192-206Google Scholar) and consists of a nucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope, the capsid, and an outer membrane where the virus attachment protein p12 is located (22Carrascosa J.L. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa A.L. García N. Santisteban A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1984; 132: 160-172Google Scholar, 23Carrascosa A.L. Sastre I. González P. Viñuela E. Virology. 1993; 193: 460-465Google Scholar). The assembly of virions is known to occur in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, but the steps involved in the virus morphogenesis are still poorly understood. We present a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the ASFV and cellular prenyltransferases, along with experiments describing the transcriptional expression of the viral gene during infection of cultured cells. We also show that the protein expressed in Escherichia coli and purified catalyzes the synthesis of all-trans-polyprenyl diphosphates, which identifies it as a trans-prenyltransferase. [1-14C]IPP (specific activity 56 Ci/mol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Nonlabeled IPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), all-trans-FPP, all-trans-GGPP, geraniol, farnesol (mixed isomers), all-trans-geranylgeraniol, solanesol, ficaprenols C45-C65, and prenols C40-C60 were purchased from Sigma. 1-3H-Labeled trans,trans,cis-geranylgeraniol was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., and acid phosphatase was from Boehringer. Silica gel 60 and RP-18 thin layer plates were obtained from Merck. Prenols C35-C125 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Chojnacki (Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw). Vero cells (CCL81) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. The Vero-adapted ASFV strain BA71V was propagated and titrated as described previously (24Enjuanes L. Carrascosa A.L. Moreno M.A. Viñuela E. J. Gen. Virol. 1976; 32: 471-477Google Scholar). General analyses of DNA and protein sequences were performed with the software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (25Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). Data base searches were done with programs FASTA and TFASTA (26Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar). Computation was also performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) network service. Protein patterns were searched using the MacPattern program (28Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 105-106Google Scholar) and the PROSITE (29Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Google Scholar) and BLOCKS (30Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6565-6572Google Scholar) data bases. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ASFV (BA71V strain) at a multiplicity of 20 plaque-forming units/cell. To obtain early RNA, the cells were infected in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide or 40 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside for 7 h. Late RNA was isolated from cells infected for 18 h in the absence of inhibitors. Whole cell RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride extraction procedure (31Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. McDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was carried out as reported elsewhere (32Yáñez R.J. Boursnell M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Viñuela E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2423-2427Google Scholar), using as probe the 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides 5′-GTATTCCATGAAAAAGCGCGACACTACGCG-3′ (RB-8), 5′-CTGTGATTCTAAAATACTTAGGTTTGCGCG-3′ (RB-3), or 5′-ATAATTCGGTATAGGGCTTGAGTAGTTGGC-3′ (RB-10), complementary to nucleotides +124 to +95, +91 to +62, and −200 to −229, respectively, of the B318L gene noncoding strand. Oligonucleotides RB-8 and RB-3 were used for primer extension analysis, performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 5′-end labeling with 32P, the primer was annealed, at 43°C, to the different classes of RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 15 min at 42°C. The primer extension products were then electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The B318L gene lacking the first 62 nucleotides was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCTCTAGAGCGCAAACCTAAGTATTTTA-3′ and 5′-CGCGCTGCAGTTAGGTCCCCAATGCAACAT-3′, and cloned in the expression vector pTrxFus (34LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology. 1992; 11: 187-193Google Scholar). The first primer was designed with a GCGC tail and a XbaI restriction site, and the second primer contains a CGCG tail and a PstI restriction site. Both restriction sites are absent in the viral sequence. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI and PstI and cloned into XbaI/PstI-cut pTrxFus vector under the control of the PL promoter from bacteriophage λ. The viral gene was thus expressed as a fusion to the E. coli protein thioredoxin. Sequencing of the cloned product revealed a silent mutation in Ala-117 (an A to T change in nucleotide 351 of the B318L open reading frame (ORF); third base on codon 117). E. coli strain GI724 cells (34LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology. 1992; 11: 187-193Google Scholar) were transformed with either the wild-type pTrxFus vector or the recombinant plasmid pTrxFus-B318L, and protein expression was analyzed as indicated by the supplier (Invitrogen, Thiofusion™ Expression System Instruction Manual). Briefly, the transformed cells were grown overnight at 30°C in RM medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were then diluted 1:20 in induction medium and grown at 30°C to an A550 of 0.5. The cells were induced with 100 μg/ml tryptophan at 34°C for 2 h. Samples were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the polypeptides were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. A 250-ml culture of E. coli cells harboring the pTrxFus-B318L plasmid was induced with tryptophan at 34°C for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 5 ml of running buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol), and sonicated with five 15-s bursts. After centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was collected and incubated with 2 ml of ThioBond™ resin (Invitrogen), activated as indicated by the supplier, for 60 min at 4°C with rotation. The resin was allowed to settle, and, after collecting the flow-through, the column was washed with 30 bed volumes of running buffer containing 20 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and eluted with 3 bed volumes of running buffer containing increasing concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol. The B318L protein eluted over a range of concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol (50, 100, 200, and 500 mM). The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. This pool was then incubated with 1 ml of activated ThioBond™ resin for 1 h at 4°C with rotation, the resin was allowed to settle, and the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of running buffer containing 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. The protein was “knocked” off the column with 3 volumes of a high β-mercaptoethanol concentration (1 M). The eluate was dialyzed as described before and concentrated using a Centricon-10 device. The concentrated sample was analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining. The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.1 ml, 50 μM [1-14C]IPP (specific activity 24 cpm/pmol), 100 μM all-trans-FPP or GPP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and enzyme protein as indicated. After 15 min at 37°C, the reactions were stopped by chilling in ice, and the products were extracted as follows: 0.15 ml of H2O saturated with n-butyl alcohol were added to the reaction mixtures, and the products were extracted with 0.5 ml of n-butyl alcohol saturated with H2O. The aqueous phase was reextracted with 0.5 ml of n-butyl alcohol, and the pooled butanol extracts were back-washed with H2O. The radioactivity in the butanol phase was determined by scintillation counting. The butanol extracts were treated with acid phosphatase by the method of Fujii et al. (35Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were extracted with hexane, and the hexane-soluble products were analyzed by reversed-phase RP-18 thin layer chromatography in acetone:H2O (195:5) or by normal silica gel thin layer chromatography in benzene:ethyl acetate (9:1). The position of authentic standards was visualized with iodine vapor. For autoradiography, the thin layer plates were exposed on a Fujifilm BAS-MP 20405 imaging plate at room temperature. The exposed imaging plate was analyzed with a Fuji BAS 1500 analyzer. ASFV ORF B318L, located within the EcoRI B fragment of the virus genome (Fig. 1A), encodes a protein of 318 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 35,904, homologous to prenyltransferases (10Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Google Scholar). The hydropathy profile shown in Fig. 1B predicts that the B318L protein contains a transmembrane region of 21 amino acids at the amino end of the protein. This region is followed by four positively charged amino acids (Arg or Lys residues at positions 22, 23, 25, and 28), thus classifying the B318L protein as a putative class III membrane protein, with the carboxyl terminus facing the cytoplasm (36Von Heijne G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 307-333Google Scholar). To study the expression of the B318L gene during the viral infection and to determine the transcription initiation site, Northern blot and primer extension analyses were carried out, using as a hybridization probe or as a primer the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide RB-3 (see “Experimental Procedures”) specific for ORF B318L Hybridization of this oligonucleotide to Northern blots containing RNA from mock-infected cells and early (cycloheximide and cytosine arabinoside) and late RNA from cells infected with ASFV revealed eight RNA species with sizes of 1.1, 1.7, 2.4, 3, 4.4, 6.6, 8, and 9.4 kb in the sample of late RNA (Fig. 2). Hybridization with another oligonucleotide (RB-8), also specific for ORF B318L, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” detected the same RNA bands (data not shown). To map the 5′-ends of the transcription products of ORF B318L, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide RB-3 was annealed to the classes of RNA described before and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In agreement with the Northern blot results, the oligonucleotide primer hybridized exclusively with late RNA. After extension with reverse transcriptase, four specific bands of 209, 210, 211, and 213 nucleotides were detected (Fig. 2), corresponding to initiation of transcription at positions −118, −119, −120, and −122, relative to the first nucleotide of the translation start codon, respectively, as indicated by circles in the sequence shown in Fig. 2. These transcription initiation sites were confirmed using oligonucleotide RB-8 as primer (data not shown). A motif composed of seven consecutive thymidylate residues (the 7T motif), recently identified as a signal for 3′-end formation of ASFV RNAs (37Almazán F. Rodríguez J.M. Andrés G. Pérez R. Viñuela E. Rodriguez J.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6655-6667Google Scholar, 38Almazán F. Rodríguez J.M. Angulo A. Viñuela E. Rodriguez J.F. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 553-556Google Scholar), is found 32 nucleotides downstream of the translation stop codon of ORF B318L Transcription termination at this site would produce an RNA of approximately 1.1 kb, which is the size of the smaller RNA band detected by Northern hybridization. Termination of transcription at alternative 7T motifs located further downstream might account for the 6.6-, 8-, and 9.4-kb RNAs, while the remaining species might correspond to transcripts of upstream ORFs, running through the B318L gene (10Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Google Scholar). In agreement with this possibility, it has been found that oligonucleotide RB-10, corresponding to a region upstream of the transcription initiation sites determined above, hybridizes in Northern blots to the 1.7-, 2.4-, 3-, and 4.4-kb species but not to the 1.1-, 6.6-, 8-, and 9.4-kb RNAs (not shown). Searches in the data bases with the derived amino acid sequence of ORF B318L showed significant similarity to proteins of the prenyltransferase family. The highest optimized FASTA scores, with values ranging from 142 to 170, were obtained with the sequences of GGPP synthases from Capsicum annuum, Erwinia uredovora, and Erwinia herbicola and with the FPP synthase sequence from Bacillus stearothermophilus To compare the amino acid sequence of protein B318L with the sequences of prenyltransferases, the ASFV protein was first aligned with 16 demonstrated or putative prenyltransferases by using the PILEUP program, and a dendrogram displaying clustering relationships was constructed. Representative members of the different clusters obtained were then selected for the comparison of conserved regions, as shown in Fig. 3. All of these regions, designated I to IV according to Kuntz et al. (39Kuntz M. Römer S. Suire C. Hugueney P. Weil J.H. Schantz R. Camara B. Plant J. 1992; 2: 25-34Google Scholar), are also present in the B318L protein and have nearly the same spatial arrangement in the ASFV polypeptide and other prenyltransferases. Regions II and IV contain the PROSITE library signatures 1 and 2, used to identify proteins belonging to the prenyltransferase family. The consensus sequences of signatures 1 and 2 are L(L/I/V/M)XDDX2,4DX4RRG and (L/I/V/M/F/Y)GX2FQ(L/I/V/M)XDD(L/I/V/M/F/Y)X(D/N), respectively, in which the amino acids enclosed in parentheses signify alternatives for that position found in different prenyltransferases, each X represents a nonconserved amino acid, and each subscript indicates the number of intervening residues. As can be seen in Fig. 3, these sequences are also conserved in the ASFV B318L protein, with only a substitution of the Gly residue for an Asn in signature 1. It has been suggested that the motif DDX2,4D in signatures 1 and 2 serves as binding site for the substrates and that this binding is facilitated by the formation of salt bridges between the aspartic residues and magnesium (39Kuntz M. Römer S. Suire C. Hugueney P. Weil J.H. Schantz R. Camara B. Plant J. 1992; 2: 25-34Google Scholar, 40Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Google Scholar). In keeping with this notion, mutational studies of the aspartate and arginine residues within signature 1 and of the two first aspartates within signature 2 of FPP synthase indicate that these amino acids are involved in enzyme catalysis (41Marrero P.F. Poulter C.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21873-21878Google Scholar, 42Joly A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26983-26989Google Scholar, 43Song L. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3044-3048Google Scholar). The proposed roles of these domains have been confirmed following crystallization of FPP synthase (44Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Google Scholar). On the other hand, sequence analysis of the FPP synthase gene of a yeast mutant defective in FPP synthase shows that the conserved lysine in region III is critical for catalytic activity (45Blanchard L. Karst F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 185-189Google Scholar). Conservation of these motifs and residues in the ASFV B318L protein strongly supports the proposal that the B318L gene encodes a prenyltransferase. The percentages of identity and similarity between protein B318L and prenyltransferases throughout the regions aligned in Fig. 3 show that the ASFV protein is more similar to the GGPP synthases from C. annuum, R. capsulatus, and E. herbicola and to the FPP synthase and octaprenyl diphosphate synthase from E. coli than to the hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase and FPP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GGPP synthase from Neurospora crassa and the heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from B. stearothermophilus (Table I).TABLE IPercentage of identity and similarity (in parentheses) between prenyltransferases according to the multiple alignmentProteinFPPS-ECOLIGGPPS-RHOCAGGPPS-ERWHEHXPPS-SCHCEB318L-ASFVGGPPS-NEUCRFPPS-SCHCEHPPPS-BSTEAOPPS-ECOLIGPPS-CAPAN71.8 (80.8)61.5 (76.9)59.0 (78.2)57.9 (75.0)44.9 (60.3)39.5 (64.5)35.1 (54.6)52.6 (75.0)51.3 (68.4)FPPS-ECOLI56.4 (71.8)57.7 (71.8)51.3 (65.8)47.4 (64.1)38.2 (59.2)35.1 (53.3)54.0 (71.1)51.3 (69.7)GGPPS-RHOCA56.4 (75.6)50.0 (72.4)46.2 (61.5)38.2 (60.5)33.8 (49.4)52.6 (75.0)50.0 (65.8)GGPPS-ERWHE46.1 (68.4)48.7 (64.1)42.1 (55.3)36.4 (50.7)46.1 (69.7)47.4 (65.8)HXPPS-SCHCE36.8 (54.0)35.5 (59.2)36.8 (55.3)55.3 (76.3)60.5 (76.3)B318L-ASFV30.3 (48.7)28.6 (46.8)39.5 (63.2)43.4 (59.2)GGPPS-NEUCR30.3 (50.0)35.5 (60.5)39.5 (57.9)FPPS-SCHCE34.2 (50.0)36.8 (54.0)HPPPS-BSTEA50.0 (75.0) Open table in a new tab To confirm that the B318L ORF encodes a prenyltransferase, the gene was cloned in the expression vector pTrxFus without the amino-terminal 21-amino acid hydrophobic region, to facilitate the expression of the protein in a soluble form. The resulting construction encodes a hybrid protein containing the E. coli thioredoxin followed in frame by 297 amino acids of the B318L protein. As shown in Fig. 4A, the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total cell lysates of E. coli GI724 cells carrying the expression vector pTrxFus-B318L, harvested after induction with tryptophan, showed a band of 47 kDa, which was not detected in uninduced cells or in cells harboring the control pTrxFus plasmid. The size of the induced protein is consistent with that calculated for the fusion protein (46.9 kDa). To determine whether the protein encoded by ORF B318L has prenyltransferase activity, extracts from E. coli cells transformed with plasmid pTrxFus-B318L and induced with tryptophan were prepared, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on ThioBond™ columns, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Relative to cells transformed with the control pTrxFus plasmid, the pTrxFus-B318L-transformed cells have a 24-fold higher specific prenyltransferase activity (Table II). After affinity chromatography, the purified B318L protein was essentially homogeneous as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4B) and had an specific activity of 167 nmol of IPP incorporated into prenyl diphosphates per 15 min per mg of protein (Table II).TABLE II.Phenyltransferase activity expressed in E. coli cellsSampleSpecific activityaActivity was assayed under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) with FPP as allylic substrate.Relative specific activitynmol/15 min/mgpTrxFusbThe supernatant cell-free extract obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” was assayed.0.311pTrxFus-B318LbThe supernatant cell-free extract obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” was assayed.7.524Affinity-purifiedpTrxFus-B318LcThe B318L protein purified by affinity chromatography on ThioBond™ columns was assayed.167539a Activity was assayed under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) with FPP as allylic substrate.b The supernatant cell-free extract obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” was assayed.c The B318L protein purified by affinity chromatography on ThioBond™ columns was assayed. Open table in a new tab The B318L protein required a divalent metal for activity. Using FPP as substrate, the optimal Mg2+ concentration was 1-2 mM, while with GPP maximal stimulation was obtained between 2 and 5 mM Mg2+. The activity at the optimal concentrations of Mn2+ of 1-2 mM was only about 10% of that observed with Mg2+, using either FPP or GPP as substrate. The purified B318L protein can use DMAPP, GPP, all-trans-FPP, or all-trans-GGPP as its allylic substrate (Table III), the ratio of activities being DMAPP:GPP:FPP:GGPP = 1:2.2:4.1:1.9, under the standard assay conditions. Thus, the best substrate of the enzyme was FPP.TABLE III.Substrate specificitySubstrateEnzyme activityaEnzyme activity was determined under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) with the allylic substrates indicated at a concentration of 100 μM.cpmNonebOnly [1-14C]IPP was present as substrate.59DMAPP811GPP1782All-trans-FPP3296All-trans-GGPP1510a Enzyme activity was determined under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) with the allylic substrates indicated at a concentration of 100 μM.b Only [1-14C]IPP was present as substrate. Open table in a new tab The reaction products derived from [1-14C]IPP and the various allylic substrates were analyzed by reversed-phase thin layer chromatography after butanol extraction and hydrolysis with acid phosphatase to the corresponding alcohols, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, when the allylic substrate was DMAPP, a mixture of C15-C35 prenyl diphosphates was produced, while GPP yielded FPP and GGPP, as well as longer chain polyprenyl diphosphates containing 5-9 isoprene units. In the case of the reaction with FPP, GGPP, and polyprenyl diphosphates with chain lengths of C25-C65 were formed, and when GGPP was used as substrate, polyprenyl diphosphates of 5-12 isoprene residues were synthesized. The product distribution obtained was very similar under a variety of reaction conditions, including different concentrations of Mg2+ or enzyme, and various reaction times. Although bovine serum albumin stimulates the prenyltransferase activity about 2-fold and is therefore present in the standard reaction mixture, it has no effect on the chain length of the products formed. However, the proportion of long chain polyprenyl diphosphates tended to increase when the concentration of FPP in the reaction mixture was lowered (data not shown). The dephosphorylated products of the reaction using [1-14C]IPP and FPP as substrates were also analyzed on silica gel thin layer chromatography to determine the trans/cis configuration of the GGPP synthesized. The main spot observed on the autoradiogram comigrated with all-trans-geranylgeraniol (Fig. 6, lane 2), indicating that the GGPP synthesized contains the trans double bond at the α-isoprene unit. Other spots detected comigrate with the products of the reaction when GGPP is used as substrate (Fig. 6, lane 1). Since one of these additional spots also comigrates with the trans,trans,cis-geranylgeraniol, the radioactivity comigrating with the geranylgeraniol standard in a reversed-phase chromatogram was eluted and analyzed on silica gel thin layer chromatography, to confirm that all of the GGPP synthesized in the reaction with FPP had a trans configuration. The resulting autoradiogram revealed a main spot comigrating with all-trans-geranylgeraniol, while no product comigrating with trans,trans,cis-geranylgeraniol was detected (Fig. 6, lane 3). It is shown here that the ASFV protein encoded by ORF B318L is homologous to prenyltransferases, containing the four highly conserved amino acid regions characteristic of these enzymes, and, within these regions, several amino acids that are critical for catalytic activity. To determine whether the B318L protein indeed had prenyltransferase activity, we undertook its expression in E. coli Since attempts to express the complete protein in a soluble form failed, we cloned the gene without the amino-terminal hydrophobic region in the pTrxFus vector. The viral gene was thus expressed as a fusion to the E. coli protein thioredoxin, producing a soluble protein that could be purified essentially to homogeneity employing an affinity column. The purified protein has been shown to catalyze the sequential condensation of IPP with allylic diphosphates to yield prenyl diphosphates containing 3-13 isoprene units. A study of the stereochemistry of the reaction showed that IPP is added to FPP in a trans configuration, suggesting that all-trans-polyprenyl diphosphates are synthesized. Under the in vitro reaction conditions, the enzyme does not synthesize a single product of specific chain length. It is possible that in the in vivo environment the chain length distribution of the products might vary. Since the B318L protein contains a putative transmembrane domain, the chain length of the products might depend on its interaction with membranes, as appears to be the case for some prenyltransferases synthesizing long chain polyprenyl diphosphates (46Matsuoka S. Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3464-3468Google Scholar). It will therefore be of interest in the future to investigate the possible association of the B318L protein with membranes and to study its activity in a membrane-bound form. It has also been shown that some of these prenyltransferases require protein factors for the synthesis of the natural products (47Dennis M.S. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18608-18617Google Scholar, 48Ericsson J. Scallen T.J. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10602-10607Google Scholar, 49Ohnuma S. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23706-23713Google Scholar). Purification of the B318L protein from ASFV-infected cells might reveal the existence of a similar factor for the viral enzyme. To date, the ASFV B318L gene is the only prenyltransferase gene of viral origin identified. Its presence in ASFV raises a number of interesting questions about the significance of this enzyme in the virus life cycle. Since FPP and GGPP are formed in the reaction catalyzed by the viral enzyme, it could be argued that these products might be used as prenyl donors for the farnesylation or geranylgeranylation of cellular or viral proteins. These modifications might, in turn, be required for the assembly and release of virus particles, as has been described for other viruses (7Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Google Scholar, 8Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Google Scholar, 9Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22686-22692Google Scholar). The existence of an ASFV ORF (L83L) encoding a protein with a consensus prenylation sequence (10Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Google Scholar) as well as the expression of the B318L gene at the late stage of infection, when virus morphogenesis occurs, would be consistent with such a role for the ASFV prenyltransferase. However, it should be noted that the properties of the ASFV prenyltransferase clearly differ from those described for the FPP synthase or GGPP synthase involved in the synthesis of the prenyl donors for protein prenylation. Thus, these enzymes produce FPP (C15) or GGPP (C20) as the ultimate products and are unable to utilize GGPP as substrate (50Hugueney P. Camara B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 235-238Google Scholar, 51Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Google Scholar), while the viral enzyme can form longer products and uses GGPP efficiently. Furthermore, the cellular enzymes synthesizing the precursors for protein prenylation are cytosolic proteins (52Reed B.C. Rilling H.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 50-54Google Scholar, 54Barnard G.F. Popjak G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 87-99Google Scholar, 55Ericsson J. Runquist M. Thelin A. Andersson M. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 832-838Google Scholar), whereas the ASFV B318L protein is predicted to be membrane-bound. On the other hand, all-trans-prenyltransferases, such as octaprenyl diphosphate synthase (56Fujisaki S. Nishino T. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1327-1337Google Scholar) and solanesyl diphosphate synthase (49Ohnuma S. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23706-23713Google Scholar), catalyze the sequential condensation of IPP to FPP to give long chain polyprenyl diphosphates, which are the precursors of quinone side chains. The ASFV B318L protein may have a similar role. If that is the case, the acquisition by ASFV of a prenyltransferase gene for the synthesis of the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) prenyl chain could be related to an increase in mitochondrial function that might be required to provide extra energy for viral processes, such as macromolecular synthesis and morphogenesis. In this connection, it should be mentioned that mitochondrial DNA synthesis has been found to increase in herpes simplex type 1 virus-infected Vero cells (57Lund K. Ziola B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 1303-1309Google Scholar) and that adenovirus infection of human cells stimulates mitochondrial activity (58Tollefson A.E. Ryerse J.S. Scaria A. Hermiston T.W. Wold W.S.M. Virology. 1996; 220: 152-162Google Scholar). On the other hand, as has been previously discussed (10Yáñez R.J. Rodríguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enríquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Google Scholar), macrophages and monocytes, the target cells in natural ASFV infection, generate reactive oxygen species for their microbicidal functions, which may cause oxidative damage to the virus DNA and membranes. The reactive oxygen species can also trigger and/or mediate apoptotic cell death (59Edgington S.M. Biotechnology. 1994; 12: 37-40Google Scholar), whose control is important to develop a productive viral infection. In addition to its role as electron carrier in mitochondria, it has been suggested that coenzyme Q, which is also present in the nucleus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi, and lysosomes (60Kalén A. Norling B. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 70-78Google Scholar, 61Kalén A. Appelkvist E.-L. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1158-1164Google Scholar), can function outside the mitochondria in antioxidation (62Stocker R. Bowry V.W. Frei B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1646-1650Google Scholar, 63Ernster L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 195-204Google Scholar, 64Do T.Q. Schultz J.R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Google Scholar). Thus, it can be speculated that the ASFV prenyltransferase might be involved in the synthesis of the prenyl chain of ubiquinone for the production of extra amounts of this compound and that this could be important to protect the virus membranes and/or DNA against oxidation and to prevent cell death by apoptosis of the infected cell. Studies on the localization of protein B318L and on its prenyltransferase activity in ASFV-infected cells, as well as an examination of protein prenylation induction during the virus life cycle, may help to elucidate the role of the virus-encoded prenyltransferase in the biology of ASFV.

Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggests that the protein consists of an active phosphatase domain, an inactive phosphatase-like domain, and an NH2-terminal extension. Mutation of the catalytic cysteinyl residue in the active phosphatase domain reduced the in vitro activity of the mutant protein to less than 0.5% of wild type activity, while mutation of the corresponding cysteinyl residue of the inactive phosphatase-like domain had no effect on in vitro activity. The PPS1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl, and phosphothreonyl residues in synthetic diphosphorylated peptides and to inactivate the human ERK1 protein. PPS1 transcript abundance is coregulated with that of the divergently transcribed DPB3 gene, which codes for a subunit of DNA polymerase II, with both transcripts showing peak abundance in S phase. pps1Δ mutant strains did not differ from PPS1 strains under any of the conditions tested, but overexpression of the PPS1 protein in S. cerevisiae led to synchronous growth arrest and to aberrant DNA synthesis. A screen for suppressors of this growth arrest identified the RAS2 gene as a multicopy suppressor of the PPS1p overexpression arrest. The arrest was not suppressed by the presence of multicopy RAS1, TPK2, or TPK3 genes or by the presence of 5 mM cAMP in the growth medium, suggesting that PPS1 functions in a pathway involving RAS2, but not TPK kinases or adenylate cyclase.

https://openalex.org/W2000641194,"Expression of the asialoglycoprotein receptor by the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HuH-7 in response to intracellular cGMP concentrations was previously shown to be regulated at the translational level. In a cell-free system, initiation of asialoglycoprotein receptor mRNA translation was dependent on the presence of the 7-methylguanylate cap site and was independent of 8-bromo-cGMP levels in which the cells were grown prior to RNA isolation. Stable transfection of COS-7 cells with deletion constructs of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H2b subunit localized the cGMP-responsive cis-acting element to the mRNA 5′-untranslated region (UTR). Addition of biotin (an activator of guanylate cyclase) induced the expression of β-galactosidase present as a chimeric plasmid containing the H2b 187-nucleotide 5′-UTR. An RNA gel retardation assay identified a 37-nucleotide cognate sequence within this 187-nucleotide region. Titration of the 5′-UTR with a cytosolic fraction isolated from HuH-7 grown in the presence or absence of 8-bromo-cGMP or biotin provided direct evidence for an RNA-binding protein responsive to intracellular levels of cGMP. Based on these findings, it seems reasonable to propose that reduction of intracellular levels of cGMP by biotin deprivation results in a negative trans-acting factor associating with the 5′-UTR of asialoglycoprotein receptor mRNAs, thereby inhibiting translation.

Regulated expression of cell-surface lectins has been implicated in such diverse processes as endocytosis, bacterial and viral infection, regulation of cell proliferation, homing of lymphocytes, and metastasis of cancer cells (1Drickamer K.

Biochem. 1982; 51: 531-554Google Scholar), the presence of ASGR on hepatocytes provides a membrane-bound active site for cell-to-cell interactions (4Paietta E. Stockert R.J. McManus M. Thompson D.

Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3021-3029Google Scholar). asialoglycoprotein receptor untranslated region dialyzed fetal bovine serum atrial natriuretic factor sodium nitroprusside human hepatic lectin subunit phosphodiesterase 8-bromo-cGMP Eagle's minimal essential medium fetal bovine serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis A human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) has provided a convenient model to investigate ASGR biosynthesis. When HepG2 cells were grown to confluence in a minimal essential medium or in a chemically defined medium containing a variety of hormones and growth factors supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum, expression of ASGR was reduced by 60-70% (9Collins J.C. Wolkoff A.W. Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 108-115Google Scholar). The low molecular weight factor required for the restoration of ASGR expression was isolated, purified, and identified as biotin (10Collins J.C. Paietta E. Green R. Morell A.G. Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11280-11283Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a second hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7 (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar), indicating that the effect was not cell line-specific. Though usually not considered as part of an induction pathway, the effects of biotin upon the steady state expression of ASGR could be mimicked by the addition of the second messenger 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP), and these additions were not additive (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar). This suggested that the effect of biotin may have been mediated through changes in the cGMP level via biotin activation of the membrane-associated guanylate cyclase (13Spence J.T. Merrill M.J. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1598-1603Google Scholar). Estimates of the steady state level of ASGR mRNA suggested that cGMP-regulated expression of ASGR was at the posttranscriptional level (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar). Polysome analysis of ASGR subunits H1 and H2 mRNAs indicated that the addition of 8-Br-cGMP caused a shift of ASGR mRNA from the ribonucleoprotein fraction into a translationally active membrane-associated polysomal pool. Although the biochemical mechanisms have not been determined, cGMP has been suggested to regulate the expression of other proteins at a translational level (13Spence J.T. Merrill M.J. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1598-1603Google Scholar, 14Spence J.T. Koudelka A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6393-6396Google Scholar) and has been shown to increase total protein synthesis in isolated hepatocytes (15Rashed H.M. Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 640-645Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, translation of most mRNA species appears to occur by the association of the preinitiation complex at or near the 7-methylguanylate cap structure at the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA and scanning downstream to the site of protein synthesis initiation (16Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar). The 60 S ribosomal subunit is subsequently recruited to the complex, and translation begins. Recovery of the ASGR mRNA in the ribonucleoprotein fraction during biotin deprivation suggested that intracellular levels of cGMP may play a significant role in modulating the initiation phase of ASGR mRNA translation. The bimodal polysomal distribution of ASGR mRNA was characteristic of a class of mRNAs that were inefficiently translated (17Walden W.E. Thach R.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2033-2041Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that mRNAs in these functionally distinct fractions differ structurally or through the proteins they interact with (18Meyuhas O. Thompson E.A. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Google Scholar). Within this group of mRNAs, most interactions between RNA and cytosolic proteins were defined by motifs localized to the 5′-UTR (19Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Google Scholar). In the present study, the potential role of the 5′-UTR as the cis-acting element governing the cGMP-modulated expression of ASGR was established. In vitro transcription coupled with an RNA gel retardation assay defined the cis-acting element within a 37-nucleotide region. In addition, the effective concentration of a cytoplasmic protein trans-acting fraction was shown to be responsive to cGMP and biotin deprivation. The 5′ and 3′-UTR regions of the H2b cDNA of ASGR were deleted using polymerase chain reaction to introduce unique restriction sites (XbaI, 6 nucleotides upstream of ATG translation start site or BamHI, 9 nucleotides downstream of the translation stop site). The resulting constructs were subcloned into either pcDNA3 for selection of stable transfectants in COS-7 or pGEM-4Z for in vitro transcription. The 5′-UTR of the ASGR H2b was prepared by polymerase chain reaction with the addition of HindIII ends and cloned into a β-galactosidase reporter vector (pSV-β-galactosidase, Promega) 296 nucleotides upstream of the lacZ coding region start site. The nucleotide sequences of the polymerase chain reaction-generated 5′ and 3′ inserts were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase (DNA Sequence Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine). COS-7 and HuH-7 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or dialyzed FBS with or without 8-Br-cGMP or biotin. Stable transfectants of COS-7 cells (20Sussman D.J. Milman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1641-1643Google Scholar) resistant to 400 μg/ml G418 were subcloned, and those with the highest level of ASGR expression in MEM + 10% FBS as determined by Western blot (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) were utilized. Transient transfection of HuH-7 with the chimeric plasmid was mediated by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. 5 hrs after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and replated at a 1:3 ratio in MEM supplemented with 10% dFBS. 24 hrs later, the medium was changed to MEM + 10% dFBS with or without 10−7 M biotin. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase activity was measured following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Near-confluent HuH-7 cultures (1 × 106 cells) were labeled with 200 μg/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Pro-mix, Amersham Corp.) for 1 h, followed by a 2-h chase. ASGR was immunoprecipitated, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was processed for fluorography. Western blot and immunoprecipitation protocols as well as antibodies used in this study have been previously described (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated by extraction with guanidine thiocycanate (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) from approximately 5 × 107 cells (HuH-7 or transfected COS-7). For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples were resolved on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Nytran membrane. The blots were hybridized at high stringency with random prime-labeled ([α−32P]dCTP) H1- and H2-specific probes (12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar, 23Paietta E. Gallagher R. Wiernik P.H. Stockert R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 280-287Google Scholar). Equal loading and transfer of RNA was verified by staining the membrane with methylene blue. Total RNA was isolated from HuH-7 cells grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% dFBS, or 10% dFBS plus 1.0 mM 8-Br-cGMP. The translation reaction was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described by the manufacturer (Promega) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/assay of m7GpppG, an inhibitor of cap site recognition. Following a 90-min incubation at 30°C, the [35S]-labeled (Pro-mix, Amersham Corp.) ASGR translation products were recovered by immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antibody to affinity-purified human receptor (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and gels were prepared for fluorography. A nested set of RNA probes were prepared by linearization of the full-length H2b cDNA using restriction sites localized in the 5′-UTR as templates for in vitro transcription from the Sp6 promoter of pGEM-4Z. The full-length (187-nucleotide) fragment was labeled by the incorporation of [α−32P]UTP during transcription. The gel retardation assay was adapted from that described by Leibold and Munro (24Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar). HuH-7 cells were homogenized, the cytosol (S-100) was prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the aliquots were stored at −135°C. S-100 was preincubated at 0°C for 10 min in assay buffer with a 100-fold molar excess or without unlabeled transcripts prior to the addition of the labeled 187-nucleotide transcript, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min. Inclusion of proteinase K (100 μg/ml) in the assay mixture completely abolished this protein-dependent assay. The mixture was resolved on a 4% low cross-linked PAGE and prepared for autoradiography. Based on our previous findings that biotin was required for expression of ASGR by HepG2 and HuH-7 cell lines, we proposed that the mechanism of biotin regulation was mediated by maintaining the intracellular level of cGMP via the activation of guanylate cyclase (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar). Our original experimental protocol was modified from the steady state determination of receptor concentrations via Western blot (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar) to the measurement of biosynthesis rate by pulse labeling with [35S]Met/Cys. This change in protocol allowed the reduction of 8-Br-cGMP and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentrations used in the present experiments to the level previously employed by others in short term protocols in cultured or isolated hepatocytes (25Curran R.D.

HuH-7 cells were grown to near-confluence in MEM supplemented with either 10% FBS or 10% dFBS to which 10 to 1000 μM 8-Br-cGMP, 10 nM ANF, or 100 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (shown to produce nitric oxide (25Curran R.D.

Kispert P.H. et al.FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2085-2092Google Scholar)) were added (Fig. 1A). Within 1 h of the addition of 500 μM 8-Br-cGMP and activators of both the particulate (ANF) and soluble (SNP) guanylate cyclases (25Curran R.D. Ferrari F.K. Kispert P.H. Stadler J. Stuehr D.J.

Kispert P.H. et al.FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2085-2092Google Scholar), the biosynthetic rate of ASGR was increased by 6.7-, 8.3-, and 4.2-fold, respectively, when compared with untreated cells in dFBS alone. No difference in the abundance of specific mRNAs was detected by Northern blot analysis, regardless of whether cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with FBS or dFBS with or without 8-Br-cGMP or its inducers (Fig. 1B). These results strongly support our hypothesis that intracellular levels of cGMP regulate the expression of the ASGR at a posttranscriptional level. When taken together with our earlier studies (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar), these results clearly demonstrated that the molecular level of control was translational. In mammalian cells, translation of most mRNAs appears to occur by association of a preinitiation complex at a 7-methylguanylate cap site and subsequent scanning to the translation initiation site (16Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar). To establish the cap site status of ASGR mRNA in cells grown in FBS as compared with dFBS and dFBS supplemented with 500 μM cGMP, the extent of cap-dependent in vitro translation was determined. Total mRNA was isolated from HuH-7 cells (5 × 107) and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of m7GpppG, an inhibitor of cap-dependent initiation (30Hentze M.W. Caugman S.W. Rouault T.A. Barriocanal J.G. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1570-1573Google Scholar). The labeled ASGR translation product was recovered by immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antibody to affinity-purified human receptor. Resolution on 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequent fluorography indicated that inclusion of m7GpppG reduced translation of ASGR mRNA isolated from both control and biotin-deprived cells with or without 8-Br-cGMP to an equal extent (>90%) (Fig. 2). These results indicated that initiation of ASGR mRNA translation was cap-dependent and that addition of a 7-methylguanylated cap to ASGR mRNA was independent of biotin deprivation. To localize the cis-acting element, mutated H2 cDNAs from which the entire 5′ or 3′-UTR was deleted were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. These constructs, along with the full-length H2 cDNA, were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 carrying a neomycin resistance gene. Stable transfectants of COS-7 cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. As shown in Fig. 3, deletion of the 5′-UTR resulted in loss of the cGMP requirement for H2 expression. In contrast, deletion of the 3′-UTR was without effect. These results indicated that the cGMP-responsive element was located in the 5′-UTR of the H2 mRNA. Northern blot analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in mRNA levels to account for this differential response to biotin deprivation or supplementation with 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 3), supporting translational regulation in the transfected COS-7 cell lines. Transient transfection of HuH-7 with the chimeric plasmid confirmed that the putative cis-acting element was localized within the 5′-UTR (Table I). Addition of biotin to the culture medium resulted in a two-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, the presence of the 5′-UTR in the plasmid reduced β-galactosidase expression when compared with the original or a chimeric plasmid in which the 5′-UTR was inserted in the antisense orientation by almost 35%, even when biotin was added. This finding was consistent with the reduced level of H2b translation when compared with the H1 ASGR subunit under normal physiologic conditions (2Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Google Scholar).TABLE I.5′-Untranslated region mediates biotin-dependent expression of β-galactosidase activity in chimeric plasmidPlasmidBiotin+−%pSV-β-gal10092 ± 12+ 5′-UTR sense orientation68 ± 1132 ± 4+ 5′-UTR antisense orientation83 ± 14102 ± 17aValues shown are means ± S.D. of three independent transfections normalized to lysate protein and are expressed as a percent of the β-galactosidase activity present in HuH-7 cells transfected with the pSV-β-gal plasmid and grown in the presence of biotin.

The 5′-UTR (187-base pair) cDNA fragment of the H2b of ASGR was directionally cloned into pGEM-4Z vector for the generation of a nested set of 5′-UTR mRNA fragments by in vitro transcription for an RNA-protein binding assay (Fig. 4). RNA fragments of the 5′-UTR were added in 100-fold molar excess prior to the addition of the full-length 187-nucleotide-labeled RNA probe and resolution on 4% PAGE. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the failure of the Sp6-FokI transcript to inhibit the band shift assay indicated that a cognate sequence lies between 70 and 110 nucleotides relative to the Sp6 promoter. Since translational regulation due to protein-protein interactions between two regions of a transcript has been reported (33McCarthy J.E.G. Koolmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 233: 191-197Google Scholar), a potential and equally critical role for the upstream 1-70-nucleotide (Sp6-FokI) region cannot be eliminated by the present study. Failure of the 208-nucleotide 3′-UTR fragment of the H2 mRNA and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase open reading frame mRNA to inhibit the gel retardation assay further supported the specificity of this assay (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Localization of the putative cognate sequence of the RNA transcript by an inhibition gel shift assay. A, unlabeled RNA fragments as indicated by restriction cut sites (Fig. 4) were added in 100-fold molar excess to the S-100 incubation mixture 10 min prior to the addition of the Sp6-SmaI 32P-labeled probe (0.5 ng). The failure of the Sp6-FokI fragment to inhibit the probe retardation indicates that a cognate sequence lies between the FokI and HinfI fragment. B, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of full-length 5′-UTR was compared with a 100-fold molar excess of the 208-nucleotide 3′-UTR and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase open reading frame mRNAs. The failure to inhibit the gel retardation by the 3′-UTR and GAPD mRNA fragments confirmed the specificity of the assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of the 187-nucleotide 5′-UTR probe with increasing amounts of the S-100 fraction isolated from HuH-7 cells grown to confluence in MEM supplemented with FBS, dFBS + 1.0 mM 8-Br-cGMP (conditions required for normal ASGR expression), or dFBS alone showed a concentration-dependent gel retardation. As the concentration of S-100 protein was increased to 1 μg/assay, it became evident that the S-100 fraction isolated from HuH-7 cells grown in dFBS had a higher effective concentration of RNA-binding protein than cells grown in FBS and that inclusion of 8-Br-cGMP to the cell culture reduced the concentration to the control level. This quantitative (as opposed to a qualitative difference) was consistent with the bimodal distribution of ASGR mRNA between the translationally active polysomes isolated from cells grown in FBS and the shift to the repressed state when cells were grown in dFBS (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, translation of most mRNA species appears to occur by the association of a preinitiation complex at a 7-methylguanylate cap site and subsequent scanning downstream to the site of protein synthesis initiation (16Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar, 31Jansen M. DeMoor C.H. Sussenbach J.S. Van Den Brande J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 681-685Google Scholar). Our studies showed that cap site addition to ASGR mRNA was independent of biotin deprivation (Fig. 2). However, the recovery of the ASGR message in the ribonucleoprotein fraction during biotin deprivation (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar) suggested that intracellular levels of cGMP play a significant role in modulating the initiation phase of translation (31Jansen M. DeMoor C.H. Sussenbach J.S. Van Den Brande J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 681-685Google Scholar). Perhaps the best-defined example of translational regulation is that of ferritin synthesis in iron-deficient cells (16Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar, 30Hentze M.W. Caugman S.W. Rouault T.A. Barriocanal J.G. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1570-1573Google Scholar). Analysis of the cis-acting mRNA sequences led to the definition of the iron-responsive element with a putative stem-loop structure in the 5′-UTR (30Hentze M.W. Caugman S.W. Rouault T.A. Barriocanal J.G. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1570-1573Google Scholar). Modeling of the ASGR H2b 5′-UTR indicated the presence of two potential regions of secondary structure. The free energy levels (−7.4 and −8.5 kcal/mol) of these two stem-looped regions was far below that usually considered necessary to prevent recognition of a cap site (−50 kcal/mol). However, they might provide the loop structure necessary for specific recognition by exposing the RNA backbone and bases to interaction with protein groups (32Rogers J. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Google Scholar, 33McCarthy J.E.G. Koolmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 233: 191-197Google Scholar). In the absence of a highly ordered 5′-UTR stem-loop structure, translation may be regulated by a short linear sequence (16Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar). A highly conserved CCAUCNN sequence localized within the 5′-UTR of both ASGR subunit mRNAs isolated from either human or rat has been identified as a conserved RNA-binding protein cognate sequence within the 5′-UTR of ornithine decarboxylase (34Kean D.J. Query C.C. Keene J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Google Scholar). The presence of this conserved sequence within the putative cis-acting element as indicated by gel retardation assay (Fig. 5) supports the possibility that it may serve as a recognition motif for the cGMP responsive trans-acting factor. One plausible explanation for cGMP-regulated expression of ASGR would be modulation of a trans-acting factor phosphorylation status. Although the modulation of ASGR by cGMP was not liver-specific (Fig. 6), it should be viewed in the context of the original finding in HepG2 cells (11Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Google Scholar, 12Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Google Scholar). Since there was little, if any, cGMP-dependent protein kinase detected in hepatocytes (35Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7077-7082Google Scholar, 36Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar), the classic cGMP signal transduction pathways mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase was presumed to be absent in liver cells (36Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar). Therefore, if a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signal transduction pathway was involved in translational regulation of ASGR expression, one of the cGMP-binding phosphodiesterases (PDEs) would be the most likely effector target. As opposed to cGMP-dependent protein kinase, the various cGMP PDEs are regulated allosterically by the binding of cGMP to noncatalytic binding sites (37Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1983; 15: 139-192Google Scholar). Modulation of cGMP levels can either inhibit or stimulate PDE hydrolytic activity, increasing or decreasing intracellular cGMP itself or cAMP (38Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Beebe S.J. Gettys T.W. Corbin J.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 45-53Google Scholar). Indeed, a number of recent studies have suggested that cGMP-stimulated PDE may play a central role in regulating the intracellular concentrations of cAMP (39Stroop S.D. Beavo J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 55-71Google Scholar, 40Whalin M.E. Scammell J.G. Strada S.J. Thompson W.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 711-717Google Scholar). Based on our previous findings that increased levels of cAMP resulted in the down-regulation of ASGR (41Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19540-19544Google Scholar), induction of a cGMP-stimulated PDE resulting in a protein dephosphorylation via reduction of cAMP is a reasonable mechanism for cGMP-regulated expression of ASGR. Presently, it may be premature to speculate that changes in the phosphorylation state of any protein via PDE mediates the effects of cGMP on translation of ASGR, especially in the light of the recent discovery of new types of cyclic nucleotide receptors that include other non-catalytic sites (37Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1983; 15: 139-192Google Scholar). Our understanding of the potential cGMP cascade in liver is still in its infancy, and there may yet be other schemes to account for cGMP action, such as Ca+2 ion flux or induction of inositol triphosphate (42Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Beebe S.J. Gettys T.W. Corbin J.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 45-53Google Scholar, 43Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Google Scholar). Whatever the biochemical mechanism of the cGMP action may be, it is reasonable to speculate that in the absence of cGMP, a negative trans-acting factor associates with the 5′-UTR of the ASGR mRNA, thereby inhibiting translation. Purification of the ASGR mRNA-binding protein should provide new insight into the physiologic affect and molecular target of cGMP in the hepatocyte."
