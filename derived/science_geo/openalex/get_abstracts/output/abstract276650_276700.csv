https://openalex.org/W2022431223,"The gaseous nitrate (NO3) radical, which has recently been measured in nighttime ambient atmospheres over the United States and Europe at concentrations up to âˆ¼350 parts per trillion, has now been shown to react rapidly with the biogenically emitted organic compounds dimethyl sulfide (DMS), isoprene, and several monoterpenes. Computer simulations demonstrate that these reactions can dominate the atmospheric behavior of these organic compounds at night. Thus reaction with NO3 radicals may be the unknown, nonphotochemical removal process for DMS recently invoked by Andreae and Raemdonck to explain the absence of a diurnal profile for DMS in maritime air influenced by continental air masses. Similarly, the nighttime reaction of NO3 radicals with monoterpenes can be a dominant removal process, leading to very low monoterpene concentrations in ambient atmospheres during the early morning."

Movement occurred, on transform faults, offsetting the rise and other centers of crustal growth within the gulf, and translated the end of the peninsula about 200 kilometers to the northwest. Thick pelagic sediments on the east flank of the rise indicate that there was a lapse of spreading by crustal growth between 4 and 10 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2024742501,"Many species of birds in the humid forests of the Andes show a pattern of geographic variation in color that is virtually unknown in other regions of the world. This pattern, here termed ""leapfrog,"" is one in which two populations very similar in appearance are geographically separated from each other by very different, intervening populations of the same species. Approximately 21 percent of all Andean bird species and superspecies with three or more differentiated populations show the leapfrog pattern, and several of these show multiple cases of leapfrogging color patterns. Lack of concordance in the geographic distribution of taxa showing the leapfrog pattern suggests that there is a strongly random component in phenotypic differentiation with respect to direction, geography, and timing."
https://openalex.org/W2080864123,"The helium-3/helium-4 ratio in bubbling gases from ten hot springs located around Mount Ontake, an active volcano in central Japan, ranges from 1.71 R/sub atm/ (1.71 times the atmospheric ratio of 1.40 x 10/sup -6/) to 6.15 R/sub atm/. The value of the ratio decreases with distance from the central cone of the volcano. Such a tendency may be a characteristic of helium-3 emission in volcanic areas and suggests more primitive helium-3 is carried with fluid flowing through a conduit during volcanic activity. 6 references, 1 figure, 1 table."

https://openalex.org/W2001238386,"A mathematical theory and a corresponding numerical procedure have been developed to produce digital topography from radar images as digital photometric arrays. Thus, as radargrammetry is to photogrammetry, so radarclinometry is to photoclinometry. Photoclinometry encompasses a fundamental indeterminacy principle even for terrain that is homogeneous in normal albedo, because the surface normal consistent with a given reflected specific intensity is not unique. A geometric locus of such normal directions is implied, which generates a surface. For microwave backscatter, in specific application to radarclinometry, this surface is a cone whose half-angle is the incidence angle, whose axis contains the radar, and whose apex coincides with the terrain point. Although the indeterminacy can be removed if a properly directed profile of ground truth is available as a constraint, such is seldom the case. In its absence, an auxiliary assumption, such as that the strike line runs perpendicular to the illumination line, is needed. If metric integrity is a goal, then this is an absurd assumption. Herein, ""the hypothesis of local cylindricity"" has been assumed, a premise regarding the nature of topographic curvature that seems more realistic and that makes possible the production of topography as a set of parallel line integrals."

Of several possible bleaching reactions, the one considered most important is the photoreduction of Fe+3 to Fe+2."

https://openalex.org/W2056528944,"Newly discovered fossils support a Wasatchian (early Eocene) age for the Punta Prieta vertebrate fauna of Baja California and reveal the utility of land mammal ages on a continental scale. Dispersal scenarios for late Paleocene and early Eocene vertebrates usually invoke heterochrony for similar, but geographically separated, faunas or taxa. Such heterochrony is not supported by independent geochronologies or adequate geographic samples."
https://openalex.org/W1978257834,"Direct observations of the calcium-45 distribution around the roots of plants growing in soil showed a pattern in direct contrast to that predicted from calculations based on the calcium concentration of the soil solution, transpiration rates, and plant calcium content. Whereas calcium-45 accumulation at the root surface was predicted, depletion was observed. It is suggested that preferential water movement in larger pores may decrease the expected solution calcium accumulation at the root surface. However, autoradiographs may give no indication of soil solution concentration depletion or accumulation because of the relatively high level on the colloid surface. The nature and extent of the depletion indicates how profoundly the plant root alters its immediate environment in the soil."

Four families of new devices-semiconductor diod laser arrays, free electron lasers, rare gas halide excimer sources, and several new tunable solid-state lasers-show particular promise."

To be effectively heard, they should establish personal contact with their congressmen and senators and their staff. Communication should be frequent, personal, and carefully focused. In the last 2(1/2) years, federal funding of scientific research has been severely cut back, while military research funding has been increased. The selection process for funding research is being politicized. Scientists should concern themselves with what is happening politically because the quality of American scientific research is being threatened."
