https://openalex.org/W2062620257,"Newborn mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are not immunologically tolerant to the agent but, rather, appear to make antibody to the virus. This antibody was detectable only in the kidneys, where presumably it had been deposited in the glomeruli in the form of complexes of antibody, virus, and complement."
https://openalex.org/W1527200958,"Cytidine triphosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP: ammonia ligase (ADP)) of Escherichia coli B has been purified about 300-fold. Kinetics of the reactions with both glutamine (plus GTP) and ammonia as nitrogen donors have been studied. Dependence of the rate on the concentration of each substrate approximately follows the Michaelis equation when all other substrates are at near saturation. But when other substrates are at low concentrations, the kinetics are strongly sinusoidal. Hill plots produce straight lines under all conditions, the slopes of which (n) vary from 1 to 4 depending on concentrations of other substrates. The product CTP has been found to inhibit competitively with UTP and to activate the enzyme, probably by replacing GTP. A simple model consistent with these results assumes that the enzyme is a dimer in which all sites must be filled to permit catalytic activity. The activity of the enzyme appears to be regulated both by its substrates and by its product."

Since the zone of neuropil adjacent to neurons is richest in terminal axons and synaptic endings, these findings indicate a specific concentration of these sialoglycolipids in synaptic membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1517745775,"Abstract Initiation and growth of RNA chains in the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase reaction have been studied by measuring the incorporation of γ-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates and 14C- (or α-32P) nucleoside triphosphates into RNA. The ratio of total nucleotide of RNA synthesized to total initiation is a measure of the average chain length of the RNA produced in the polymerase reaction. The length of RNA chains synthesized is independent of nucleoside triphosphate concentration and of enzyme concentration after extensive RNA synthesis, since both initiation and synthesis increase proportionally. However, the average RNA chain length is dependent on DNA template concentration. The rate of RNA synthesis increases more rapidly than RNA chain initiation as the DNA concentration is elevated. The specificity of initiation of chains with either ATP or GTP is independent of the above three parameters. The nucleotide penultimate to the nucleoside triphosphate end has been determined with Escherichia coli and T4 DNA as templates. All four nucleotides are found in this position in a nonrandom distribution, although there is a preponderance of pyrimidine over purine nucleotides in this second position of a growing RNA chain. Of a number of inhibitors that have been examined for their differential effects on initiation and chain growth, actinomycin D hardly affects initiation of RNA chains but markedly inhibits the synthesis of RNA, thus leading to a marked decrease in the average chain length of the RNA products. With denatured DNA as template the average chain length is markedly decreased, since the number of initiations increases as much as 10-fold and synthesis is slower. With either denatured DNA or tobacco mosaic virus RNA as primer, initiation with GTP predominates over that with ATP. From the known molecular weight of RNA polymerase, it can be calculated that approximately 1 RNA chain is formed by 1 molecule of enzyme. With denatured DNA, reinitiation can occur such that several chains are formed per molecule of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1565430124,"Abstract A succinyl coenzyme A synthetase preparation from Escherichia coli has the following characteristics: apparent chromatographic, sedimentation, and electrophoretic homogeneity; molecular weight of about 141,000; A280 (1 mg per ml) = 0.511; higher specific activity than previous preparations; and identity by several criteria with a phosphorylated protein (E-P) obtained upon exposure to Mg++, inorganic orthophosphate, and succinyl-CoA or to Mg++ and ATP. ATP will phosphorylate up to 1 histidine residue per mole of enzyme, with an apparent -ΔF of 2000 cal, but more than one phosphoryl group per mole is obtained from exposure to Pi and succinyl-CoA. Capacity of different preparations for E-P formation, as compared to catalytic activity, varies in an unexplained manner. Increases in CoA or succinyl-CoA concentration will cause net Pi formation from E-P. CoA is required for an exchange of Pi with E-P, and slightly stimulates exchange between E-P and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1557690614,"β-Hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase of Escherichia coli has been purified 1200-fold. Its molecular weight is estimated at 28,000 by gel filtration and by zone sedimentation analysis. At all stages of purification, the enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoate to a mixture of β,γ- and α,β-decenoates, α,β predominating; the β,γ:α,β product ratio does not change with purification. Several additional lines of evidence are presented which argue that a single enzyme is responsible for the formation of both isomeric decenoates. Attempts to alter the activity and β,γ:α,β specificity of the enzyme have proved unsuccessful. The enzyme is active over a wide pH range and is insensitive to sulfhydryl poisons. The presence of a thioesterase activity in E. coli is noted."

https://openalex.org/W1584772089,"The β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase of Escherichia coli has a high degree of chain length specificity, catalyzing the dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine at more than 10 times the rate of the corresponding C8 and C12 compounds. The enzyme acts on different thioesters of β-hydroxydecanoic acid at the following relative rates: acyl carrier protein, 6; N-acetylcysteamine, 1; and pantetheine, 0.6. In each case, both α,β- and β,γ-unsaturated products are formed. The dehydrase also catalyzes the interconversion and hydration of the isomeric decenoyl thioesters. The same equilibrium mixture is obtained when either β-hydroxydecanoyl-, trans-α,β-decenoyl-, or cis-β,γ-decenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine is used as substrate. Experiments are described which attempt to delineate the pathway of interconversion of the different substrates, and which argue for a single, multifunctional enzyme catalyzing the transformations. In accord with the proposed pathway for the synthesis of long chain acids in E. coli, the bacterial fatty acid synthetase catalyzes the chain elongation of α,β-decenoyl acyl carrier protein to mainly saturated acids, and of β-hydroxydecanoyl and β,γ-decenoyl acyl carrier protein, to mixtures of long chain saturated and unsaturated acids. Explanations are offered for the apparent paradox that the isolated dehydrase converts β-hydroxydecanoyl thioesters primarily to α,β-decenoate, whereas the fatty acid synthetase, of which the dehydrase is a component, catalyzes the formation of predominantly unsaturated acids, the elongation products of β,γ-decenoate."
https://openalex.org/W1994308561,"Exogenously supplied radioactive uracil (or guanine) enters the intracellular pools of RNA precursors in Escherichia coli only as nucleotides are removed from these pools by net synthesis of RNA. Consequently uptake of uracil over a short period does not measure the sum of the synthesis of all forms of RNA, unstable and stable, as is often supposed. Uptake of uracil during changing conditions of growth may be influenced by changes in types of RNA's being made; under such conditions that no stable RNA is being made, the synthesis of unstable forms may be greatly underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W1577349101,"Abstract A purified species of tyrosine transfer RNA has been isolated by countercurrent techniques and shown to contain 2 4-thiouridylate residues per molecule. These thionucleotides may be titrated quantitatively with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Denaturation studies with heat or urea indicate that they are probably hydrogen-bonded in the tRNA. Iodine oxidation of the purified tRNA leads to the formation of a disulfide bond between the thionucleotides without, in this case, changing the amino acid acceptor activity of the molecule. Disulfide formation is accompanied by a slight loss in secondary structure, as shown by a decrease in the Tm and an increase in the E(p). Studies in the ultracentrifuge indicate that the sedimentation of the disulfide form is not greatly changed from that of the native form and that therefore the disulfide bond must be intra- rather than intermolecular."
https://openalex.org/W1955855614,"Abstract 1. In order to examine the involvement of acyl carrier protein in the acylation of glycerophosphate by bacterial extracts, a series of experiments with radioactive glycerol 3-phosphate, potential acyl donors, and enzyme preparations from Clostridium butyricum were carried out. 2. The conversion of 14C-glycerophosphate to lipid, mainly lysophosphatidic acid, in the presence of a particulate fraction from C. butyricum was found to be dependent on the addition of acyl carrier protein (ACP) isolated from either C. butyricum or Escherichia coli. The apparent Km was 1.2 x 10-6 m for C. butyricum ACP and 3.4 x 10-6 m for E. coli ACP. Since no source of acyl groups was added in this series of experiments, it is postulated that the acyl groups transferred to glycerophosphate were derived from the particles. 3. With this particulate fraction, chemically synthesized 3H-palmityl-ACP also markedly stimulated the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate and was an efficient donor of palmitate in the synthesis of lysophosphatidic acid. Palmityl coenzyme A had little effect on glycerophosphate acylation with the particulate fraction as the sole enzyme source. 4. A two-fold stimulation of glycerophosphate acylation by palmityl-CoA was observed when a soluble protein fraction from C. butyricum was added to the particulate fraction. Under these conditions some transfer of labeled fatty acids from 3H-acyl-CoA to 14C-glycerophosphate was observed. The lysophosphatidic acid isolated had 0.3 3H-acyl group per 14C-glycerophosphate. Presumably, the remainder of the acyl groups was derived from the enzyme sources. When ACP was added, the labeled fatty acids derived from acyl-CoA were further diluted by endogenous fatty acids. 5. Sodium lauryl sulfate also stimulated glycerophosphate acylation in the presence of particles from C. butyricum plus the soluble protein fraction. Both palmityl-CoA and sodium lauryl sulfate stimulated glycerophosphate acylation more at 25° than at 30°. These results suggest that some of the effects of palmityl-CoA in this system are the result of its surfactant properties."

https://openalex.org/W1508604251,"Abstract Cultures of Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophages T2, T4, T5, or T6 have previously been shown to synthesize relatively large quantities of a dihydrofolate reductase which can be distinguished from the corresponding enzyme found in uninfected cells. Two lines of evidence support the idea that this new enzyme is the specific product of a viral gene. (a) The enzyme has been partially purified from cultures of E. coli B infected with phages T2, T4, T5, and T6 and the properties of the four preparations have been compared. Although the preparations are virtually identical with respect to pH optimum, pyridine nucleotide specificity, sedimentation coefficient, and sensitivity to the inhibitor trimethoprim, significant differences are observed in catalytic efficiency, stability to heat and to urea, and inhibition by aminopterin. (b) A mutant of T4 has been isolated which is unable to direct the formation of dihydrofolate reductase in infected cells. The phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase system presents several advantages, which are discussed in this paper, for comparative studies of enzyme structure and function within a closely related series of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1554839361,"Abstract The cell wall lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli 0111-B4 was degraded by (a) acid hydrolysis and (b) by treatment with periodate, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride and mild acid hydrolysis. The various oligosaccharides produced by these procedures were isolated and characterized by chemical and enzymatic methods. Procedure a released all of the colitose (3,6-dideoxy-l-xylohexose) as the free sugar along with several oligosaccharides in very low yield, three of which were identified as Glc → GlcNAc, Glc (α)/→ Gal, and GlcNAc (β)/→ Glc (α)/→ Gal. The application of Procedure b resulted in the liberation of approximately one-half of the colitose as the free sugar along with a mixture of two colitose-containing oligosaccharides [see PDF for equation] Analysis of the partially degraded polymer prior to the acid hydrolysis step indicated that galactose had been totally destroyed by periodate oxidation and that there was a concomitant formation of an equivalent amount of threitol in the product. The origin of threitol from galactose was confirmed by degradation of the lipopolysaccharide isolated from a mutant without UDP-d-galactose 4-epimerase (Escherichia coli J-5) which incorporated 1-14C-galactose or uniformly labeled 14C-galactose directly into the galactose residues of the polymer. Colitose-containing oligosaccharides isolated in the experiment with 1-14C-galactose yielded unlabeled threitol, while the oligosaccharides isolated in the uniformly labeled 14C-galactose experiment yielded radioactive threitol with approximately two-thirds the specific activity of the galactose used."

https://openalex.org/W1491506848,"Abstract The subunit size of thiogalactoside transacetylase from Escherichia coli ML 308 in 6 m guanidinium chloride measured by sedimentation equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge was found to be 29,700 ± 2,000, about half the molecular weight of the native protein. The two chains were identical by estimation of the number of peptides obtained after treatment with trypsin, BrCN, and with both reagents in succession. Analysis of NH2-terminal amino acids of the peptides produced by BrCN cleavage gave results which agreed with this conclusion, after suitable correction for considerable random cleavage in the solvent, 70% formic acid. The relative molar quantities of two protein products of the lac operon, β-galactosidase and thiogalactoside transacetylase, when calculated in terms of the minimum molecular weights, 135,000 and 32,000, respectively, are normally in the range of 5 to 7:1 for E. coli ML and slightly less for E. coli K-12."

https://openalex.org/W1520395247,"Abstract Phenylalanyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) bound to 70 S ribosomes in response to a template is protected from alkaline hydrolysis. Neither the 30 nor the 50 S subunit alone provides this protection. Although aminoacyl-tRNA is bound to the 30 S subunit-template complex through the anticodon, the addition of 50 S subunits is necessary for the protection from deacylation. The aminoacyl end of tRNA is thus probably intimately associated with the 50 S subunit. These results suggest that there are at least two areas on a single tRNA molecule interacting with ribosomes and the binding of tRNA to 70 S ribosomes occurs in at least two distinct steps: first, the binding of the tRNA anticodon to the 30 S-template complex; and second, the association of the aminoacyl end of the tRNA with the 50 S subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1986872491,"Evidence is presented that the coat protein of bacteriophage f2 causes the lysis of infected Escherichia coli. To lyse bacteria, the coat protein produced must be of the quality to produce phage particles, although it need not be produced in amounts sufficient to give a large yield of particles. Mutants that are blocked in coat-protein synthesis, or that direct the synthesis of an imperfect coat protein, do not lyse their host bacteria. In addition to its obvious structural role and its postulated regulatory role, another, perhaps enzymatic, role has been found for the coat protein of the phage f2."
https://openalex.org/W1517002953,"Abstract Enzyme preparations from Escherichia coli catalyze the conversion of various species of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(polyhydroxyalkyl)dihydropteridines to dihydropteroic acid. Of these compounds, the one utilized most efficiently by the enzyme system is 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(d-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)dihydropteridine. Evidence is presented to show that the latter compound is converted by a heat-stable enzyme or enzymes to 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine, a compound which is used directly as substrate for the formation of dihydropteroate and thus represents an intermediate in the conversion of the polyhydroxyalkyldihydropteridines to dihydropteroate. Evidence is presented which indicates that the enzyme system that catalyzes the synthesis of dihydropteroate from p-aminobenzoate and guanosine triphosphate will convert GTP to pteridine intermediates when p-aminobenzoate and ATP are left out of the reaction mixture. The pteridines that have been identified as products of this transformation are 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine and 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)dihydropteridine. Smaller quantities of the corresponding threo isomer of the latter compound are also made enzymatically from GTP, but the significance of the formation of this compound is not clear."
https://openalex.org/W1531232978,"Abstract Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase from Escherichia coli, upon exposure to succinyl-CoA or to ATP and CoA, is converted to a form capable of reacting with orthophosphate to give a phosphorylated enzyme (E-P) or with Pi and ADP to give ATP. The high energy form has been obtained by several independent routes in milligram quantities with highly purified enzyme and shown to be demonstrably free from any succinyl, phosphoryl, or adenosine diphosphoryl derivatives formed from substrates. The high energy form contains bound CoA and is designated as ∼E·CoA. The over-all reaction can be demonstrated in independent steps involving E-P and ∼E·CoA starting with either ATP or succinyl-CoA as energy donors. The free enzyme, the phosphorylated form, and the high energy form all have equivalent catalytic activity. A succinate independent Pi ⇄ ATP exchange and the Pi-independent succinate ⇄ succinyl-CoA exchange, as well as other partial reactions, are in harmony with the participation of ∼E·CoA as a catalytic intermediate. The ∼E·CoA is not sensitive to hydroxylamine. 18O, derived from Pi-18O when ∼E·CoA forms E-P, does not remain with the isolated enzyme. Similarly, oxygens of CoA of the reaction medium do not readily interchange with Pi and succinate oxygens."

https://openalex.org/W1587348581,Abstract Potentiometric titrations of pepsinogen as functions of ionic strength and temperature were studied. It was found that the ionic strength has a minor effect on the titration behavior of the protein. The maximum values of the buffering capacity in the pH range of 6.0 to 9.0 were found at pH values corresponding to those at which a conformational change of the protein occurs as determined by optical rotatory dispersion measurements. The change of the pH transition with temperature gave a transitional enthalpy of 50 kcal per mole of hydrogen ions liberated in the conformational change. It was shown that the transition occurs in the range of ionization of the three histidines of pepsinogen.

https://openalex.org/W1552595366,"Abstract Carboxypeptidase digestion of denatured thiogalactosidase transacetylase showed that the COOH-terminal sequence is Ser-Val and that 2 moles of valine are released per mole of protein. Although this is consistent with the previous finding that the protein is composed of two identical chains, studies of the NH2 terminus show heterogeneity and lack of stoichiometry. Instead of 2 moles of a single amino acid per mole of protein, 0.5 mole of aspartic acid (or asparagine) and 0.4 mole of methionine were found by both the Sanger and the Stark and Smyth procedures. The same result was obtained after treatment of the protein under conditions expected to cleave α-N-formyl groups. Various explanations to account for these findings are discussed, including blocked NH2-terminal end groups, proteolytic hydrolysis, and random cleavage as a consequence of a step in protein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1541745417,"Abstract The diisopropylphosphoryl derivative of subtilisin BPN' was digested with pepsin, and the resulting peptide fractions were separated by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 50-X2. After additional purification a total of 58 pure peptides were isolated. Many of these peptides provided confirmation of the known structure which had been established from peptides obtained from the tryptic and chymotryptic digests. Additional peptides were isolated which provided sequences in the previously unknown regions of the protein, and several other peptides were obtained which gave crucial overlaps for the known tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. The known structure of subtilisin BPN' has given a clear picture of the sites of action of pepsin on this large protein."

About half of the phenylalanine incorporated into polypeptide from the complex was located in the N-terminus. The formation of this ribosomal complex with phenylalanyl-soluble ribonucleic acid is rate-limiting in the synthesis of polyphenylalanine.

https://openalex.org/W2026663854,"The nucleic acids of bacteriophages are characterized by a surprising multiformity. RNA and DNA may occur, the latter in single- or double-stranded form, circular or linear, with or without breaks or single-strand ends. Terminal redundancy may exist and the populations of linear phages may be uniform or randomly permuted. A double-stranded circular DNA does not occur in extracellular bacteriophage, but is often if not always formed after infection of the bacterial host. Phage DNA may be glucosylated or methylated to a certain extent, and the glucose and methyl residues may influence the stability of the DNA inside the host."
https://openalex.org/W2108977653,"Abstract Peptides containing the 4 histidine residues of porcine trypsin have been isolated and their sequences determined. Two of these peptides, isolated from the enzyme which had been oxidized with performic acid, were found to be connected by a disulfide bond in the unmodified enzyme. The sequence [see PDF for sequence] is identical with that found in the region of the active center of bovine trypsin, which includes histidine-29 and histidine-46, except that a serine residue (asterisk) replaces a tyrosine residue in the bovine enzyme. The sequence of one of the two other histidine-containing peptides bears some similarity to the sequence surrounding histidine-79 of bovine trypsin. The lack of structural homology in this region of the molecule between bovine trypsin and bovine chymotrypsin would suggest, however, that this histidine residue is of little functional importance. The 4th histidine residue of porcine trypsin (for which there is no equivalent in the bovine enzyme) appears to fill in a deletion which had been postulated as being necessary in order to demonstrate the structural homology between bovine trypsin and bovine chymotrypsin."

https://openalex.org/W2127208984,"Abstract Methylation of DNA in vivo during prophage induction was studied in different mutants of Escherichia coli B3, lysogenic for phage P1b, by measuring the transfer of the methyl group from methionine to DNA bases. All the incorporated label was found in 6-methylaminopurine and in thymine. In the induced cells the specific activity of 6-methylaminopurine, expressed per unit of newly synthesized adenine, is decreased in one strain and increased in others in comparison with the noninduced cells. Evidence is presented that the DNA made before induction becomes supermethylated in thymine-deprived cultures, but without correlation with the extent of induction. Further, the rate of methylation in the induced cultures is not correlated with the rate of induction. Although specific alterations in the methylation pattern involving a small number of specific bases cannot be excluded by the analytical techniques available, it is concluded that gross supermethylation of newly synthesized DNA is not necessary for induction to occur. It seems, however, that in thymineless phage induction some excess methylation of the preformed DNA can be regarded as a common event in induced cultures, although such supermethylation is shown not to be sufficient for the induction of the prophage."
