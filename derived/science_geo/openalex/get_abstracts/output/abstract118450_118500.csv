CD4+ T cells from some HIV-1-exposed uninfected individuals cannot fuse with NSI HIV-1 strains and secrete high levels of β-chemokines. Expression of the β-chemokine receptor CC-CKR-5 in CD4+ , non-permissive human and non-human cells renders them susceptible to infection by NSI strains, and allows env-mediated membrane fusion. CC-CKR-5 is a second receptor for NSI primary viruses."

To test this hypothesis, a heart-specific promoter was used to drive the expression of murine catalase cDNA in transgenic mice. Fifteen healthy transgenic mouse lines were produced. Cardiac catalase activity was constitutively overexpressed in both atrium and ventricle, ranging from 2- to 630-fold higher than normal. This enzyme activity was not altered in liver, kidneys, lungs, and skeletal muscles. Other antioxidant components, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, metallothionein, and superoxide dismutase, were not altered in the catalase-overexpressing heart. Mice (7 weeks old) from several transgenic lines and from nontransgenic controls were treated intraperitoneally with doxorubicin at a single dose of 20 mg/kg and sacrificed on the 4th day after treatment. As compared to normal controls, transgenic lines expressing catalase activity 60- or 100-fold higher than normal exhibited a significant resistance to doxorubicin-induced cardiac lipid peroxidation, elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase, and functional changes in the isolated atrium. Interestingly, 200-fold or greater elevation of catalase activity did not provide protection. The results provide direct evidence for the role of catalase in doxorubicin cardiotoxic responses.

https://openalex.org/W2084089752,"In this study, we have examined the cellular and biochemical activities of the ceramide analog (1S,2R)-D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (D-erythro-MAPP). Addition of 5 microM D-e-MAPP to HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent growth suppression accompanied by an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; thus mimicking the action of exogenous ceramides. Its enantiomer L-e-MAPP was without effect. Two lines of evidence suggested that D-e-MAPP may not function as a direct analog of ceramide. First, D-e-MAPP possesses a stereochemical configuration opposite to that of D-erythro-ceramide. Second, D-e-MAPP failed to activate ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in vitro. Therefore, we examined if D-e-MAPP functioned indirectly by modulating endogenous ceramide levels. The addition of D-e-MAPP to cells, but not L-e-MAPP, caused a time- and concentration-dependent elevation in endogenous ceramide levels reaching greater than 3-fold over baseline following 24 h of treatment. Both D-e-MAPP and L-e-MAPP underwent similar uptake by HL-60 cells. D-e-MAPP was poorly metabolized, and remained intact in cells, whereas L-e-MAPP underwent a time- and concentration-dependent metabolism; primarily through N-deacylation. In vitro, L-e-MAPP was metabolized by alkaline ceremidase to an extent similar to that seen with C16-ceramide. D-e-MAPP was not metabolized. Instead, D-e-MAPP inhibited alkaline ceramidase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 1-5 microM. D-e-MAPP did not modulate the activity of other ceramide metabolizing enzymes in vitro or in cells, and it was a poor inhibitor of acid ceramidase (IC50>500 microM). Finally, D-e-MAPP inhibited the metabolism of L-e-MAPP in cells. These studies demonstrate that D-e-MAPP functions as an inhibitor of alkaline ceramidase in vitro and in cells resulting in elevation in endogenous levels of ceramide with the consequent biologic effects of growth suppression and cell cycle arrest. These studies point to an important role for ceramidases in the regulation of endogenous levels of ceramide."

The approximate intramolecular distance between the oxygen at position C-3 in 3CTC and the chlorine atom of the 3-chloroacetyl group is 3 Å. Using decylagarose chromatography, we purified β-tubulin that had reacted with 3-(chloromethyl-[14C]carbonyl)-3-demethylthiocolchicine ([14C]3CTC). This β-tubulin was digested with formic acid, cyanogen bromide, endoproteinase Glu-C, or endoproteinase Lys-C, and the radiolabeled peptide(s) were isolated. The sequences of these peptides indicated that as much as 90% of the covalent reaction between the [14C]3CTC and β-tubulin occurred at cysteine 354. This finding indicates that the C-3 oxygen atom of colchicinoids is within 3 Å of the sulfur atom of the Cys-354 residue, suggests that the colchicine A ring lies between Cys-354 and Cys-239, based on the known 9 Å distance between these residues, and may indicate that the tropolone C ring lies between the peptide region containing Cys-239 and the amino-terminal β-tubulin sequence, based on the labeling pattern observed following direct photoactivation of tubulin-bound colchicine.

Tubulin interacts with a wide variety of small ligands, including divalent cations, guanine nucleotides, and antimitotic drugs. Perhaps because of its instability, its tendency to polymerize into pleomorphic structures, and/or its microheterogeneity, tubulin or tubulin-ligand complexes have not been crystallized.

Efforts to define ligand binding sites have generally involved induction of covalent interactions between tubulin and specific ligands.

In most cases the target amino acids in the covalent interaction between protein and ligand were not identified, with localization of the reactive site limited to the tubulin subunit or a peptide fragment. No ligand has attracted more attention than colchicine(9.Hastie S.B. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 377-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), whose interaction with tubulin permitted the initial isolation of the protein (10.Weisenberg R.C. Borisy G.G. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4466-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity (4.Williams R.F. Mumford C.L. Williams G.A. Floyd L.J. Aivaliotis M.J. Martinez R.A.

A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was label localized to specific peptide fragments of tubulin, and the region of colchicine that reacted with the protein was uncertain. We have taken a different approach from concern that use of bulky photoaffinity groups introduces a paradox into the technique. Adequate affinity of such compounds for tubulin implies that the reactive group has been introduced at a position in the ligand of secondary importance for the binding reaction. Thus, covalent reaction(s) may occur at some distance from the binding site itself. While this problem does not arise with the direct photoaffinity method, the precise ligand-peptide reaction has only been established with GTP(6.Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We decided to explore the use of small, chemically reactive substituents introduced at defined positions in colchicinoids and allocolchicinoids(15.Boyé O. Hamel E. Brossi A. Med. Chem. Res. 1991; 1: 142-150Google Scholar, 16.Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Hamel E. Brossi A. J. Labelled Compounds Radiopharm. 1992; 33: 293-299Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Schmitt and Atlas (17.Schmitt H. Atlas D. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 743-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) had used an analog derivatized with the bromoacetyl group in the B ring side chain, but they found extensive nonspecific covalent reactions between their analog and tubulin. We used the isothiocyanate and chloroacetyl groups(16.Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Hamel E. Brossi A. J. Labelled Compounds Radiopharm. 1992; 33: 293-299Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and introduced them into the side chain, at position C-9 of the C ring in allocolchicinoids or at position C-2 or C-3 of the A ring in thiocolchicine. While the side chain and C ring derivatives retained high affinity for tubulin, extensive nonspecific (i.e. not inhibited by colchicine site agents) covalent reactions occurred with these compounds, and we abandoned them as unsuitable for further study. The A ring derivatives, 2CTC ( (1)The abbreviations used are: 2CTC2-chloroacetyl-2-demethylthiocolchicine3CTC3-chloroacetyl-3-demethylthiocolchicine[14C]3CTC3-(chloromethyl-[14C]carbonyl)-3-demethylthiocolchicinePVP40polyvinylpyrrolidone (average molecular mass, 40 kDa)NEMN-ethylmaleimideHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideDCBT2,4-dichlorobenzyl thiocyanateEBIN,N‘-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide)TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.) and 3CTC (structure in Fig. 1), were much more promising(18.Grover S. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Brossi A. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both agents were similar to colchicine in their interactions with tubulin and were competitive inhibitors of the binding of [3H]colchicine to tubulin. Stoichiometry of binding of both derivatives was comparable with that of colchicine, and with both analogs 80% of the covalent reaction was with β-tubulin. The 3CTC reacted rapidly once bound, with 60% of the bound 3CTC forming a covalent bond, while the 2CTC covalent reaction lagged kinetically behind the binding reaction, with only one-fourth of bound agent reacting with tubulin. The binding and covalent reactions occurred minimally at 0°C and were strongly inhibited by podophyllotoxin. Here we demonstrate that the covalent reaction of 3CTC with β-tubulin occurs primarily at Cys-354. 2-chloroacetyl-2-demethylthiocolchicine 3-chloroacetyl-3-demethylthiocolchicine 3-(chloromethyl-[14C]carbonyl)-3-demethylthiocolchicine polyvinylpyrrolidone (average molecular mass, 40 kDa) N-ethylmaleimide high-performance liquid chromatography polyvinylidene difluoride 2,4-dichlorobenzyl thiocyanate N,N‘-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) N-[2-hydroxy-1,1bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Preparation of bovine brain tubulin (19.Hamel E. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4173-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and of 3CTC and [14C]3CTC (16.Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Hamel E. Brossi A. J. Labelled Compounds Radiopharm. 1992; 33: 293-299Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) were described previously. Specific activity of the [14C]3CTC was 31 cpm/pmol, and background in the liquid scintillation system used corresponded to about 2 pmol. Decylagarose was from ICN Immunobiologicals; colchicine, cyanogen bromide, PVP40, and NEM from Sigma; “sequencing grade” endoproteinase Lys-C (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) from Promega; “sequencing grade” endoproteinase Glu-C (Staphylococcus aureus V8) from Boehringer Mannheim; and precast polyacrylamide gels (16% acrylamide), nitrocellulose membranes, and PVDF membranes from Novex. Reaction mixtures contained 20 μM (2.0 mg/ml) tubulin, 20 μM [14C]3CTC, 1.0 M monosodium glutamate (2.0 M stock solution adjusted to pH 6.6 with HCl), 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM GDP, and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Incubation was for 30 min at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of NEM (2.5 mM). The mixture was left overnight at 4°C to precipitate the tubulin, which was harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min). The pellet was dissolved in Solution A (4 M guanidine HCl and 2 M NaCl at pH 5.0) and applied to a 1.5 × 30-cm column of decylagarose equilibrated with Solution A(20.Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The column was washed with Solution A until protein elution ceased, then with 4 M guanidine HCl (pH 5.0). Fractions containing the unbound radiolabeled β-tubulin (20.Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were pooled and dialyzed against water, as were the fractions containing the bound α-tubulin. Only β-tubulin of at least 90% purity was used in further studies. The [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin at 2.0 mg/ml was digested at 37°C in the dark with either 75% formic acid for 96 h (21.Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or 20 mg/ml cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid for 24 h(22.Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510-1511Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The samples were frozen, and the formic acid and cyanogen bromide removed under vacuum. For enzyme digestions(23.Wilkinson J.M. Darbre A. Practical Protein Chemistry: A Handbook. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 122-148Google Scholar), 3CTC-peptide complexes were dissolved in 1% SDS for 1 h at 37°C or by boiling for 5 min. These solutions were diluted 10-fold into the proteinase solutions at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 and incubated for 24-48 h at 37°C. With endoproteinase Lys-C the buffer was 0.1 M boric acid-borax (pH 7.6), with endoproteinase Glu-C, 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0). If digestion was judged to be incomplete, additional enzyme at 1:100 was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Preparative HPLC, using an LKB system and Brownlee Laboratories columns, was performed on cyanogen bromide digests of the [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin complex. The peptide mixture was dissolved in 4 M guanidine HCl (pH 5.0) and injected onto a C18 Aquapore RP-300 reverse phase column (4.6 × 100 mm). Column output was monitored for absorbance (206 nm) and for radioactivity (Ramona 5-LS flow detector). The column was developed with a 0-60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Radioactive peaks were collected and lyophilized. Further HPLC purification was with C8 Aquapore RP-300 CO3-GU and C4 Aquapore BU-300 BO3-GU columns, using, respectively, gradients of 0-30% 2-propanol and 0-60% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated on Novex precast Tricine-16% acrylamide polyacrylamide mini-gels (thickness, 1 mm). Peptides were transferred to a PVDF membrane (pore size, 0.2 μm) with an Enprotech transblot system (1.5-2 h, 120 volts). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and autoradiographed (Kodak BIOMAX MR film; 24-48-h exposure). Radiolabeled peptides were cut from the membrane and eluted with 4 M guanidine HCl (pH 5.0). Following electrophoresis on the Tricine-16% acrylamide gel, peptides were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. This was stained with Ponceau S and autoradiographed. Equivalent radiolabeled peptide bands were cut from several membranes, destained, pooled in a single vessel, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 3 ml of 0.5% PVP40 in 0.1 M acetic acid, which prevents adsorption of cyanogen bromide or protease to the membrane. Excess PVP40 was removed with water. The radioactive strips were cut into 1-mm squares and digested with cyanogen bromide, endoproteinase Lys-C, or endoproteinase Glu-C as described above. Peptides released from the membrane squares were again electrophoresed on Tricine-16% acrylamide gels, electroblotted to PVDF membranes, autoradiographed, and eluted with 4 M guanidine HCl. Automated Edman degradation for determination of amino acid sequence was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer(24.Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dryck W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives was carried out with an Applied Biosystems model 120 PTH Analyzer(25.Zimmerman C.L. Appella E. Pisano J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We initially prepared a reaction mixture containing equimolar concentrations of tubulin and [14C]3CTC. NEM was used to irreversibly alkylate cysteine residues and precipitate the tubulin, permitting separation of unreacted drug and drug-protein complex by centrifugation. Denatured tubulin subunits can be resolved by hydrophobic chromatography on decylagarose(20.Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes a separation following reaction with [14C]3CTC. In the presence of 2 M NaCl, 4 M guanidine HCl the column only binds α-tubulin, which is eluted by 4 M guanidine HCl without NaCl. Fig. 1 also shows SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the unbound (on the left) and bound (on the right) protein. As before(18.Grover S. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Brossi A. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), most of the radiolabel that had reacted covalently with tubulin was associated with the unbound β-tubulin. In the preparation shown in Fig. 1, there was over five times as much radiolabel associated with β-tubulin as with α-tubulin, with drug/monomer stoichiometries of 0.32 and 0.06, respectively. Fig. 2 presents a diagram of the chemical and protease cleavage sites used to define the covalent interaction of 3CTC with β-tubulin (complete amino acid sequence in (26.Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)). With formic acid, cleavage occurs preferentially between aspartate and proline residues(21.Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and two such sites are present in β-tubulin. We found minor incorporation of radiolabel into the peptide spanning residues 32-304 and major incorporation into the carboxyl-terminal peptide (residues 305-445). Cyanogen bromide cleaves polypeptides on the carboxyl-terminal side of methionine residues(22.Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510-1511Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The cyanogen bromide studies were consistent with incorporation of radiolabel both at Cys-239 and in a peptide spanning residues 331-363. Radiolabel was found predominantly in a peptide whose sequence was consistent with residues 344-376 following digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C and with residues 351-362 following digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C. These proteases cleave at the carboxyl end of the indicated amino acids (23.Wilkinson J.M. Darbre A. Practical Protein Chemistry: A Handbook. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 122-148Google Scholar). Insufficient quantities of these peptides were available for identification of the radiolabeled amino acid. Sequential Edman degradation was performed on the entire β-tubulin digest following digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, and evaluation of radiolabel as opposed to sequence analysis was performed following each cycle. Maximum recovery of radiolabel occurred after the fourth cycle, confirming the conclusion that Cys-354 was the amino acid residue that preferentially reacted with [14C]3CTC. Our initial approach was to digest the purified [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin complex with cyanogen bromide and isolate radiolabeled peptide(s) by preparative HPLC on a reverse phase C18 column (Fig. 3). With digestion times of 24-72 h we obtained two radiolabeled peaks, with the first peak two to three times larger than the second. With shorter digestion times the second peak was significantly larger, suggesting it was a precursor of the first. Repurification of the first peak on a reverse phase C8 column produced a sharp radiolabeled peak, but upon repurification the second peak was broad (data not presented). Further purification on a reverse phase C4 column was not successful. The C8-repurified peptides underwent sequential Edman degradation. Material derived from the larger radiolabeled peak of Fig. 3 was subjected to 25 successive cycles, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The analysis indicated that two peptides were present, and the amino acid recoveries suggest a ratio of about 2 to 1. The sequence of the predominant peptide, through 17 cycles, was that expected from cyanogen bromide digestion for the peptide spanning residues 331-363; and the sequence of the minor peptide, through 10 cycles, for the peptide spanning residues 234-257. Aliquots from each cycle were analyzed for radiolabel, but recovery of radioactivity was very low. Increase over background occurred only at the 6th and 24th cycles (about 11 and 1 pmol, respectively, of [14C] derived from 3CTC), which could correspond to cysteine residues in the minor and major peptides, respectively (i.e. Cys-239 and Cys-354; see Fig. 2). Material corresponding to the smaller radiolabeled peak of Fig. 3 also yielded sequence data for peptides 234-257 and 331-363, but in approximately equal amounts. Radiolabel over background, representing about 3 pmol of [14C] derived from 3CTC, was recovered in the 6th cycle only. Several attempts to obtain pure peptides and resolve the apparently paradoxical co-migration of both peptides in two radiolabeled peaks were unsuccessful.Tabled 1 We next turned to formic acid digestion(21.Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this and subsequent studies radiolabeled peptides were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with electrophoretic transfer of the separated peptides to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes, and the peptides were located by autoradiography. As noted by Rao et al.(2.Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-tubulin has only two major formic acid cleavage sites (between aspartate and proline residues), at positions 31/32 and 304/305. This results in three peptides of highly divergent molecular mass: the amino-terminal A1, spanning residues 1-31, and the much larger A2(32-304) and A3(305-445). In our hands formic acid digests of the [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin complex yielded major peptide bands with molecular weights consistent with the expected products (Fig. 4A) and multiple minor bands. With shorter incubations these minor bands were less prominent, but residual β-tubulin persisted, and there were other higher molecular weight bands. Autoradiography of the digested β-tubulin (Fig. 4B) showed significant radiolabel in six peptides, A2, A3, and four smaller species. Densitometry of the autoradiogram (Fig. 4C) demonstrated that less than 10% of the radiolabel was in the A2 band, consistent with a weak covalent interaction of [14C]3CTC with Cys-239, but this peptide was not evaluated further. Following transfer and elution, the radiolabeled A3 band was sequenced, and through 22 cycles the expected amino acids were found (Table 1). In addition, the four most prominent smaller radiolabeled peptides were all found to contain the amino-terminal sequence of the A3 peptide (five cycles of degradation), indicating the secondary hydrolytic sites for formic acid occur primarily in the acidic carboxyl-terminal portion of the A3 peptide. Insufficient radiolabel was obtained from peptide purification by the gel electrophoresis, membrane transfer, and elution methodology to identify the target amino acid residue in A3 (note, too, that the suspected Cys-354 is 50 residues in from the amino terminus). We therefore decided to explore in situ digestion of A3 (pooled with the A3 fragments) by various agents to further localize the reactive amino acid residue(s). We began with cyanogen bromide digestion, to determine whether the results would agree with those obtained from the partially purified peptide obtained by HPLC. Digestion of A3 yielded a single radiolabeled peptide (Fig. 5A), and its partial amino acid sequence (Table 1) identified it as the peptide containing residues 331-363. ( (2)The radiolabeled peptides generated by cyanogen bromide and endoproteinase digestion of either [14C]3CTC-A3 or [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin did not correspond to well defined Coomassie Blue-stained bands, suggesting that the modified and unmodified peptides have significantly different electrophoretic mobilities (maximum stoichiometry of the total covalent reaction, about 0.3).) In situ digestion of radiolabeled peptide A3 with endoproteinase Glu-C, which cleaves at the carboxyl side of glutamate residues, yielded a single radiolabeled band (data not presented), but we were not successful in isolating enough material to obtain a definitive amino acid sequence of the peptide. We therefore treated the [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin complex with the enzyme, but digestion did not appear to be complete, in that radiolabel was rather diffuse (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, there was only one distinct radiolabeled peptide band. Extraction and sequence analysis (Table 1) demonstrated that it was the peptide containing residues 344-376, narrowing potential reactive residue(s) to a somewhat shorter sequence (344-363). Experiments with endoproteinase Lys-C, which cleaves at the carboxyl side of lysine residues, were much more successful, yielding, as had cyanogen bromide digestion of peptide A3, a single prominent radiolabeled peptide band. As with endoproteinase Glu-C, we were unable to obtain sufficient peptide for sequencing with in situ digestion of radiolabeled peptide A3, but the β-tubulin digest (Fig. 5C) yielded material with the sequence (through seven cycles) of the peptide containing residues 351-362 (Table 1), further narrowing the possibilities for the reactive amino acid(s). Although sufficient amounts of radiolabeled peptide could be extracted from the gels for sequencing, the amount of radiolabel was insufficient for defining the reactive amino acid(s). We had also obtained only suggestive information from the partially purified HPLC cyanogen bromide peptides when sequencing and radiolabel data were obtained from the same Edman digestion. As an alternate approach, the endoproteinase Lys-C digest of the [14C]3CTC-β-tubulin was subjected to automated sequential Edman degradation for twelve cycles (the size of peptide 351-362), but the entire product stream was collected for scintillation counting rather than for amino acid analysis (Fig. 6). Some radiolabel was recovered with each cycle, but only with the fourth cycle was there a dramatic increase in the amount of radiolabel obtained. Combining this result with the strongly preferential labeling of peptide 351-362 (Fig. 5C; Table 1), we conclude that the fourth amino acid of this peptide, Cys-354, is the major target for the specific covalent interaction of 3CTC with β-tubulin. (There are 15 lysine residues in β-tubulin, and Cys-354 is the only cysteine four residues carboxyl to a lysine. The other peptides resulting from Lys-C digestion would have the following amino acids as their fourth residue: Val-23, Arg-62, Thr-106, Ser-126, Glu-156, Thr-178, Pro-220, Asn-256, Ala-301, Glu-328, Tyr-340, Thr-366, Glu-383, and His-396.)

In the direct approaches, when the reactive group was in the B ring side chain, the α-subunit was always labeled(5.Floyd L.J. Barnes L.D. Williams R.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8515-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7.Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1976; 102: 743-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although in one study (5.Floyd L.J. Barnes L.D. Williams R.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8515-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) there was also labeling of β-tubulin. In contrast, when the tubulin-[3H]colchicine complex was directly photoactivated at 350 nm, the absorbance maximum attributable to the tropolone C ring, there was strongly preferential labeling of β-tubulin(7.Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our own work(18.Grover S. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Brossi A. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we showed that the chemically reactive thiocolchicine analogs 2CTC and 3CTC, derivatized in the A ring, reacted preferentially with β-tubulin in a reaction that was temperature-dependent and inhibited by colchicine site drugs. Uppuluri et al.(11.Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that photoactivated colchicine reacted with amino acid(s) in peptide sequence 1-36 or in peptide sequence 214-241, but not with both peptides. As shown here, 3CTC reacts strongly with Cys-354 of β-tubulin. Since the chloroacetyl group is relatively small, this indicates that the C-3 oxygen atom of colchicine is about 3 Å from the sulfur atom of Cys-354. We also found minor reactivity at a second site. This was most clearly demonstrated in the large formic acid-derived peptide A2 (residues 32-304). Cyanogen bromide digestion indicated the second site was in peptide 234-257, and tenuous evidence indicates the second, weakly reactive amino acid is Cys-239 (within the sequence found by Uppuluri et al.(11.Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). ( (3)Cys-354 is present in all β-tubulin isotypes found in brain, while position 239 is 75% cysteine (three isotypes) and 25% serine (one isotype)(27.Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).) The work of Ludueña and Roach (27.Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) implicates Cys-354 and Cys-239 in the binding of colchicine to tubulin. The sulfhydryl cross-linking agent EBI efficiently promoted formation of a cross-link between these two cysteine residues. EBI, with an ethylene bridge between two reactive iodoacetamide groups, was the most efficient in a series of analogs that differed in the size of the spacer, implying the two sulfur atoms were about 9 Å apart. Formation of the Cys-239/Cys-354 cross-link is inhibited by every colchicine site agent examined, except tropolone and tropolone methyl ether, which may bind weakly to the portion of the tubulin molecule occupied by the C ring. Following reaction of EBI with tubulin, the protein will no longer polymerize. ( (4)Ludueña and Roach (27.Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have also shown that EBI will cross-link Cys-12 with either Cys-201 or Cys-211 of β-tubulin, indicating a 9-Å distance between the two sulfur atoms involved.) Studies with DCBT (28.Abraham I. Dion R.L. Duanmu C. Gottesman M.M. Hamel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6839-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are also relevant to the present work. This antimitotic compound alkylates multiple cysteine residues of tubulin (29.Bai R. Duanmu C. Hamel E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but the most reactive, closely associated with DCBT's inhibition of assembly, was Cys-239(20.Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alkylation of Cys-239 by DCBT did not inhibit colchicine binding to tubulin, but colchicine site drugs inhibited alkylation of tubulin by DCBT(20.Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), analogous to their inhibitory effect on Cys-239/Cys-354 cross-link formation by EBI. We also examined β-tubulin that had reacted with 2-(chloromethyl-[14C]carbonyl)-2CTC. Following formic acid digestion radiolabel was distributed in approximately equal amounts between the A2 and A3 peptides. Further localization of the radiolabel has been hampered by the 2-4-fold lower covalent reactivity of 2CTC with β-tubulin. Assuming preferential reactivity of the chloroacetyl group with cysteine residues (cf. (30.Schmitt H. Kram R. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31.Biellmann J.F. Branlant G. Nicolas J.-C. Pons M. Descomps B. Crastes de Paulet A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32.McCarthy A.D. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)), this suggests that the C-2 oxygen atom of colchicine is closer to Cys-239 than is the C-3 oxygen, and that the C-2 oxygen may be equidistant from the Cys-239 and Cys-354 sulfur atoms. The lower reactivity of 2CTC with these cysteines than of 3CTC with Cys-354 indicates that the colchicine C-3 oxygen atom is closer to Cys-354 than the C-2 oxygen atom is to either cysteine residue. Our findings with 3CTC, and to a lesser extent with 2CTC, suggest that the colchicine A ring lies in the 9 Å pocket between Cys-354 and Cys-239. Such a model (Fig. 7) is consistent with the molecular distances obtained from the crystal structure of colchicine (33.Lessinger L. Margulis T.N. Acta Crystallogr. 1978; B34: 578-584Crossref Google Scholar) and with the 3 Å length of the chloroacetyl group. Correlating our findings with those of Uppuluri et al.(11.Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggests that, following photoactivation of colchicine, the reactivity observed with the β-subunit sequence 214-241 results from either a direct reaction with the C ring or energy transfer from the C ring to the A ring, while the reactivity with the amino-terminal peptide results only from a direct reaction with the C ring. This would agree with the failure of tropolonic compounds to inhibit formation of the Cys-239/Cys-354 cross-link(27.Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Since the maximum separation of hydrogens of the C-3 and C-10 methoxy groups is 13.5 Å, this requires the amino-terminal peptide of tubulin to be relatively close to Cys-239 or Cys-354. This may well be the case, because one photoaffinity analog of paclitaxel, modified in its C-13 side chain, reacts covalently with peptide A1 (residues 1-31) (2.Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while another, modified in the C-2 benzoate moiety of paclitaxel, reacts with the β-tubulin peptide containing residues 217-231(3.Rao S.

The C-13 side chain and the C-2 benzoate moiety of taxoids are believed to be closer to each other in hydrophilic environments (34.Williams H.J. Scott I. Dieden R.A. Swindell C.S. Chirlian L.E.

These findings also imply that the binding sites for the C ring of colchicine and for the interacting C-13/C-2 substituents of paclitaxel may be in close proximity if not overlapping (cf. (3.Rao S.

INTRODUCTIONMutations underlying an increasing number of inherited diseases are being discovered. The task now is to define the individual steps through which the mutated protein causes a specific disease, in some cases by becoming a pathogen, often after a symptom-free interval of several decades (Hamilton et al., 1992).The prion protein (designated PrPC) has been implicated in a variety of human and animal diseases referred to as prion diseases, spongiform encephalopathies, or transmissible amyloidoses (Prusiner and DeArmond, 1994). Prion diseases can occur either sporadically or by infectious transmission in both humans and animals. In addition, 18 mutations in the PrPC gene, identified as PRNP, have been reported to be associated with inherited forms of prion diseases in humans (Parchi and Gambetti, 1995).The inherited prion diseases associated with PRNP mutations fall into three major groups: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: CJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseFFIfatal familial insomniaPI-PLCphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBFAbrefeldin AGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolERendoplasmic reticulum.) Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and the recently discovered fatal familial insomnia (FFI) (Parchi and Gambetti, 1995). Despite their phenotypic differences, FFI and one familial type of CJD (CJD178) are both linked to a single mutation of PRNP at codon 178 resulting in the substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid (D178N) (Goldfarb et al., 1992). They differ, however, at the PRNP codon 129, a natural polymorphic site encoding either methionine or valine (Goldfarb, Petersen et al., 1992). Codon 129 of the mutant allele specifies the disease phenotype associated with the D178N mutation: the 129M,D178N haplotype is linked to FFI, the 129V,D178N haplotype to CJD178 (Goldfarb, Petersen et al., 1992).A variety of data clearly demonstrate the importance of the mutant PrP (PrPM) in the pathogenesis of FFI and CJD178 and other inherited prion diseases. They provide no information, however, on the precise metabolic events that lead to the disease. In this study we used transfected human neuroblastoma cells to examine the effect of the PRNP D178N mutation associated with either the 129M or 129V codon on the synthesis and metabolism of the PrPM.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Production of Cell LinesM-17 human neuroblastoma cells (Ross et al., 1983; provided by Dr. June Biedler) were transfected with the episomal vector CEP4β (Hambor et al., 1988) containing prion protein coding sequence (27 μg/10-cm plate) using the cationic lipid DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim, 46 μg/10-cm plate) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The inserted prion protein coding sequence, under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was either normal (178D) or mutant (D178N) with either a Met or Val at codon 129 (129M or 129V), a natural polymorphic site in the PRNP (Fig. 1). The prion protein coding sequence was obtained by amplifying human genomic DNA with primers that flank the entire coding sequence: DG2, 5′-GTACTGAGAATTCGCAGTCATTATGGCGAACCTTGG-3′; and DG1, 5′-GTACTGAGGATCCTCCTCATCCCACTATCAGGAAGA-3′, the underlined sequences correspond to the prion gene sequences, nucleotides 41 to 70 and 792 to 814, respectively, according to the sequence of Kretschmar(1986). Using the EcoRI and BamHI sites (bold face) in the primers, the coding sequence was cloned into the bacterial plasmid pVZ1 (Henikoff and Eghtedarzadeh, 1987). We created the codon 129V alleles corresponding to normal or D178N coding sequence using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to convert the codon 129M alleles (Bio-Rad Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit). Transfected cells were grown as bulk selected hygromycin- resistant cultures in Opti-MEM with 5% calf serum supplemented, iron-enriched (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 500 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). For each experiment, cells were removed from the flask with trypsin, counted, and identical numbers of cells seeded onto plates and grown overnight to ~95% confluence. All experiments were repeated with cells from independent transfections and at different times post-transfection to avoid selection bias.Source of TissueSamples of gray matter were obtained from the occipital cortex of an FFI subject with the D178N mutation and one octapeptide repeat deletion in the mutant allele and from an age matched control.Western Blot AnalysisCells were washed once with serum-free Opti-MEM and then incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM with PI-PLC (59 ng/ml, provided by T. Rosenberry, Case Western Reserve University) for 30 min at 37°C. The media was removed and centrifuged at 290 × g (4°C) for 10 min to remove any cells. Cells were washed once with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and lysed off the plates in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). Nuclei and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 200 × g (4°C) for 10 min. The supernatants were then precipitated with 4 volumes of MeOH (−20°C for 2 h). The resultant protein pellets were resuspended in H20 (400 μl for cell lysates, 200 μl for PI-PLC media), and an aliquot (5 or 10 μl) was boiled in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol) for separation by SDS-PAGE (14% acrylamide, 37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore), blocked for 1 h (37°C) in 10% milk/TBS (Tris-buffered saline), and probed with the monoclonal antibody 3F4 to residues 109-112 provided by Dr. R. Kascsak (Kascsak et al., 1987). Blots were developed with ECL (Amersham) and exposed to film.Cells were tested for the presence of proteinase K-resistant PrP in the following manner. Whole cell homogenates were prepared from 107 cells, after washing the plates with cold PBS, by lysing with 9 volumes of 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4. The postnuclear supernatant was digested with proteinase K in either of 2 ways: 2 × 105 cell equivalents were digested in a 20-μl reaction for 1 h with 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) or 2 × 105 cell equivalents were digested with 5 μg/ml for 5, 10, 15, or 20 min. The proteinase K reaction was terminated by addition of PMSF to 3 mM. The samples were precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol, resuspended in sample buffer, resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon P, and detected with the 3F4 antibody.Brain tissue was homogenized in 9 volumes of 0.32 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 2 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a membrane fraction. The total homogenate and the membrane fraction, before and after deglycosylation, were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon P, and probed with an anti-amino-terminal antibody (a polyclonal rabbit serum to a synthetic peptide, human PrP 23-40; Chen et al.(1995)) provided by B. Ghetti, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN. Quantitative analyses of the immunoblots was performed with a computer-assisted laser scanner (LKB Ultrascan XL).Biotinylation of Cell Surface PrPCells were plated at 5 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate or 1.8 × 106 cells per 35-mm well. After incubation overnight at 37°C the cells were held on ice for 5 min with or without pretreatment with PI-PLC at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2. The cells were biotinylated by adding cell impermeable NHS-Biotin (Pierce) at 250 μg/ml for 10 min at 4°C. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 mM glycine in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4°C followed by 2 washes with the same. Cells were lysed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mM PMSF. The lysates were precleared with 20 μl of Protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at room temperature, centrifuged at 2,100 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 3F4 or the polyclonal antibody anti-C described by Chen(1995). The samples were run on 14% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon P, and detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000) followed by ECL (Amersham).Pulse-Chase PI-PLCCells were grown to 95% confluence on 10-cm plates. Cells were washed once with methionine-deficient MEM (deficient MEM, ICN) and then incubated in deficient MEM for 30 min (37°C). A 30-min pulse with 0.5 mCi of Trans35S-label (ICN) in deficient MEM was followed by a 0, 30-min, or 2-h chase in Opti-MEM. Following the chase, cells were washed once with Opti-MEM and then incubated in Opti-MEM ± PI-PLC (59 ng/ml) for 2 h at 4°C. Media was then collected and cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation.Pulse-Chase PI-PLC in the Presence of TunicamycinCells were grown to 95% confluence on 10-cm plates. Cells were washed once with deficient MEM and then incubated for 1 h in deficient MEM ± 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Boehringer Mannheim). 2 μg/ml was empirically determined to be the lowest concentration that would effectively block glycosylation while not affecting protein synthesis. ( (2)S. L. Richardson and R. B. Petersen, unpublished data.) A 1-h pulse with 0.5 mCi of Trans35S-label in deficient MEM ± tunicamycin (2 μg/ml) was followed by a 0 or 4-h chase in Opti-MEM lacking tunicamycin. Following the chase, cells were washed once with Opti-MEM and then incubated in Opti-MEM ± PI-PLC (59 ng/ml) for 2 h at 4°C. Media was then collected and cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation.Pulse-Chase in the Presence of Brefeldin A (BFA)Cells were grown to 90% confluence on 60-mm plates. Cells were washed once with deficient MEM and then incubated in deficient MEM for 30 min (37°C). A 30-min pulse with 0.175 mCi of Trans35S-label in deficient MEM with 1 μg/ml BFA (Epicentre Tech) was followed by a 0, 30-min, 60-min, 90-min, 1-h, or 2-h chase in Opti-MEM with 1 μg/ml BFA. 1 μg/ml was empirically determined to be the lowest concentration that would inhibit transport beyond the Golgi. ( (3)C. B. Urig and R. B. Petersen, unpublished data.) Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for immunoprecipitation.Cell Lysis and ImmunoprecipitationMedia was removed and centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min (4°C) to eliminate any cells and 1 ml was used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 1 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. After incubating on ice for 10 min, lysates were centrifuged at 2100 × g for 10 min (4°C) to remove nuclei and large debris. 250 μl of the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in a total volume of 1 ml. The prion protein was immunoprecipitated in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine (with 1 μM PMSF added) by rocking at 4°C for 16 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with one of the following antibodies: 3F4, anti-C, an antiserum to the carboxyl-terminal residues 220-231 (Chen et al., 1995), or anti-N, an antiserum to the amino-terminal residues 23-40. Protein-antibody complexes were bound to Protein A-agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim) by rocking at 4°C for 3 h. To wash, beads were pulse spun at 690 × g (4°C), the supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine with 0.1 mM PMSF). Beads were washed this way six times and then resuspended in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled to release the bound proteins.PNGase-F and Endoglycosidase H TreatmentImmunoprecipitated protein was removed from the beads and precipitated in 4 volumes of methanol to remove sample buffer. Protein pellets were resuspended in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min. Samples were deglycosylated with PNGase-F (1000 units, New England Biolabs, in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μM sodium citrate, pH 7.5) or endoglycosidase H (1000 units, New England Biolabs, in 50 μM sodium citrate, pH 5.5) for 60 min at 37°C. Proteins were again precipitated with methanol and the resulting pellet was boiled in sample buffer and separated on 16% SDS acrylamide gels.SDS-PAGE, Fluorography, and PhosphorImage AnalysisProteins were separated on 16% acrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Gels were fixed in methanol:acetic acid:H2O (40:10:50) for 15 min, dehydrated in dimethyl sulfoxide for 1 h and radioactivity was enhanced by rocking the gels in PPO/dimethyl sulfoxide (22%) for 90 min. Gels were then dried and exposed to film (Kodak XAR-5). Densitometric analysis of the fluorograms was performed using a PDI 420oe scanner. Some gels were also analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Microsoft Excel 5.0 was used for statistical analysis.RESULTSExpression and Localization of the PrPHuman PrPC is a 209-amino acid glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety (Prusiner and DeArmond, 1994). As is the case for other membrane glycoproteins, most of the PrPC molecules receive N-linked oligosaccharide chains, a disulfide bond, and the GPI anchor while being translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Vidugiriene and Menon, 1994). During this processing PrPC is also folded. The oligosaccharide chains are trimmed in the ER and additional modifications take place in the Golgi apparatus. Human PrPC has two sites for N-glycosylation corresponding to residues 181 and 197 (Locht et al., 1986; Robakis et al., 1986). Three major forms of mature PrPC are found which differ in their degree of glycosylation and are referred to as glycoforms. They include one unglycosylated form and two glycosylated forms, presumably mono- and diglycosylated (Caughey et al., 1989; Monari et al., 1994).We used human neuroblastoma cells transfected with DNA constructs expressing the human prion protein sequence to determine the effect of the D178N mutation on the metabolism of PrP (Fig. 1). The constructs are based on an episomal vector, so hygromycin-resistant bulk cultures, rather than cloned cell lines, were used. The advantage of this system is that the expression level is not influenced by the site of integration facilitating direct comparison in metabolic studies of the PrP expressed by different constructs. Initially, we compared the cell surface forms of PrPC and PrPM expressed in transfected cells following cleavage of the GPI anchor with the enzyme PI-PLC (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Less modified forms of PrPM, the unglycosylated (U) and intermediate (I) forms are under-represented on the surface of cells. A, transfected cells were treated with PI-PLC and the released protein was concentrated by precipitation. The protein was then resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto Immobilon P, and reacted with the monoclonal antibody 3F4. The amount of mutant protein loaded was three times that of the normal. The antibody reaction was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG followed by a chemiluminescent substrate. M, mature glycosylated PrP; I, an intermediate migrating form of PrP; U, unglycosylated PrP. B, the samples in panel A were treated with the enzyme peptide:N-glycosidase F to remove the sugars and analyzed as above. A single band that comigrates with the unglycosylated form and a small amount of a 20-kDa product are observed in the normal cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PrPC released from transfected control cells shows three distinct glycoforms which are similar to those previously described in non-transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2A; Caughey et al., 1988; Scott et al., 1988). Since our cells overexpress PrPC we compared, in a separate experiment, the ratio of PI-PLC released glycoforms with those of a non-transfected human cell, M17 BE2C a clonal line from the same tumor, to ensure that we were not observing a processing bias toward less glycosylated forms due to an overload of the glycosylation system. The non-transfected control cells express the three PrP glycoforms in a ratio similar to that of our transfected cells expressing normal PrP. This indicates that the processing observed in the transfected cells is an accurate reflection of the normal pathway (data not shown). PrPM released from the cells transfected with the D178N mutant coding sequence and either the 129M codon (129M,D178N; FFI haplotype) or the 129V codon (129V,D178N; CJD haplotype) show two differences when compared with the control cells (Fig. 2A): 1) an overall decrease in the PI-PLC-released PrPM (the loading of the samples from the mutant cells was adjusted by a factor of 3 so that they would be comparable to the control cells) and 2) a selective decrease in the forms that migrate most rapidly in gels. Densitometric analyses demonstrated that only one-third the amount of PrP was released from the surface of the cells expressing PrPM compared to cells expressing PrPC (1:0.34 ± 0.18; n = 5; p < 0.0002) and the most rapidly migrating form, which accounts for 8.3 ± 3.6% (n = 5) of the PI-PLC released PrP in the control cells, is virtually undetectable in the mutant cells. The cells transfected with the vector alone show no immunoreactivity, indicating that the PrP expressed in the transfected cells is coded entirely by the inserted constructs.After treatment of the PI-PLC released PrP with PNGase F, which cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides, the PrP migrates as a single band (Fig. 2B) which has the same mobility as the most rapidly migrating form in the untreated preparations. This finding confirms that the three PrP forms differ in N-glycosylation and that the most under-represented PrPM glycoform at the cell surface is the unglycosylated form.To confirm that the unglycosylated PrPM was missing from the cell surface, and not merely resistant to PI-PLC, we surface labeled cells with biotin that were untreated or previously treated with PI-PLC. As shown in Fig. 3, cells expressing PrPM showed a marked reduction in surface labeling after treatment with PI-PLC indicating that mutant PrPM is not resistant to PI-PLC. Thus, the under-representation of unglycosylated PrPM released from the surface of the cells by PI-PLC (Fig. 2) is not a result of an inability to cleave the GPI anchor of PrPM.Figure 3:Mutant PrP is efficiently cleaved by PI-PLC. Cells that express 129M,D178N (Mutant) PrP, untreated or treated with PI-PLC, were biotinylated and the cell surface protein was recovered from the cell extract by immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody 3F4 after which the biotin-labeled protein was detected on blots using horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin. M, mature; I, intermediate; U, unglycosylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metabolism of the PrPThe under-representation of PrPM on the surface of the mutant cells could be the result of rapid turnover or unsuccessful transport. In addition, the under-representation of the unglycosylated PrPM may result from its selective degradation or increased glycosylation. We investigated synthesis and glycosylation of PrPM using a pulse-chase paradigm. After the chase, the cells were treated with PI-PLC to remove the GPI-anchored protein from the cell surface. The cell lysate (intracellular PrP) and the medium (cell surface PrP) were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.At the end of the labeling period (time 0; Fig. 4A), all cell lysates exhibit the same immunoprecipitable bands in comparable amounts including three distinct bands and a slowly migrating smear. The three discrete bands are a high mobility band corresponding to the unglycosylated PrP and two bands with slightly lower gel mobility. The latter two bands are sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H), indicating that they correspond to the PrP forms glycosylated with the high mannose core and that they are still located in the ER or the Golgi complex (data not shown; Caughey et al.(1989)). After a 30-min chase, as a result of modifications to the sugar chains, these two forms become endo H resistant (data not shown). The slowly migrating smear is the PrP on which the carbohydrates have been highly modified (Caughey et al., 1989). At 2 h, only mature forms of PrP are detected (Fig. 4A). At the 2-h time point PrPM is under-represented in the cells expressing either the 129M,D178N or the 129V,D178N. The average amount of unglycosylated PrPM from both mutant cell types accounts for 1.9 ± 2.3% of the total PrPM while the unglycosylated PrPC accounts for 8.2 ± 2.6% in control cells (n = 6; p < 0.003; Fig. 4C). Although there is also an apparent under-representation of the intermediate form, as noted above, the species migrating at this position change with time making quantitation difficult. Similar results are obtained using antibodies directed against the amino (anti-N) and carboxyl (anti-C) termini, except that anti-N recognizes an additional band at 20 kDa which is an unglycosylated, carboxyl-terminal truncated form of PrP and anti-C detects a truncated form of the unglycosylated PrP, not recognized by 3F4, that migrates at approximately 18 kDa (data not shown; Chen et al.(1995)). Truncated forms lacking the amino terminus have been described (Pan et al., 1992; Harris et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1995).Figure 4:Unglycosylated PrPM is not retained in cells (A) nor does it efficiently reach the cell surface (B). A, cells were labeled for 30 min at 37°C with Trans35S-label, the media was removed, and cells were chased for the times indicated above the lane. PI-PLC was added 30 min before the end of the chase after the chase media was removed. The cell homogenate was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 3F4. The precipitated PrP was resolved on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by fluorography. M, mature; I, intermediate; U, unglycosylated. B, the media from the PI-PLC-treated cells was immunoprecipitated and analyzed in the same manner as the cell homogenate. M, mature; I, intermediate; U, unglycosylated; 20kd, minor proteolytic product. C and D, graphical representation of the glycoforms of PrP present in the cell or on the cell surface as a percent of total PrP (panel C: ∗, p < 0.003; panel D: ∗, p < 0.008, p < 0.0008).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The unglycosylated PrPM is a significant fraction of the total PrPM at the zero time point indicating that this form is normally produced by all cell types (18.0 ± 2.2% versus 23.3 ± 2.2% in control cells; n = 8). At the zero time point, the labeled PrP is still in the ER-Golgi complex region as shown by the barely detectable quantity of PrP that is PI-PLC-released from the cell surface (Fig. 4B). The decrease of the intracellular unglycosylated PrPM occurs at the 30-min and 2-h time points when the glycosylated PrPM forms are still intracellular or are being inserted into the plasma membrane. When analyzed separately, the unglycosylated cell surface PrPM is undetectable after 2 h in the 129M mutant cells (n = 4), but accounts for 0.6 ± 0.4% of total PrP in 129V mutant cells (n = 4; Fig. 4D). In contrast, the unglycosylated form accounts for 3.2 ± 1% and 5.3 ± 0.6% in 129M and 129V control cells (n = 4; p < 0.008 (129 M) and p < 0.0008 (129V) two tailed t test; Fig. 4D). These findings, and the previous finding that PrPM is under-represented at the cell surface in the steady state, indicates that PrPM is inefficiently transported through the secretory pathway. This is especially evident for the less modified glycoforms. The absence of the truncated, unglycosylated 20-kDa form on the surface of the mutant cells also supports this conclusion (Fig. 4B).In addition to the surface and intracellular forms of PrP detailed above, we detected a small amount of PrP (<5% of the total) in the chase medium without addition of PI-PLC (data not shown). Epitope mapping indicates that the secreted PrP corresponds to the previously described PrP form lacking the last four carboxyl-terminal residues and the GPI anchor (Stahl et al., 1993). The secreted PrP is under-represented in the media from the mutant cells relative to the normal cells, indicating that the low amount of PrPM at the surface of the mutant cells is not the result of increased secretion.Transport and Stability of the PrPTo better characterize the effect of glycosylation on the transport of the PrPM, we labeled cells in the presence of the antibiotic tunicamycin which blocks the synthesis of the high mannose core preventing glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (Elbien, 1987). We analyzed the cell lysate and media from PI-PLC-treated cells as in the pulse-chase experiment described above, with or without addition of tunicamycin. In contrast with the untreated controls, the cell lysates from normal and mutant tunicamycin-treated cells show only one readily detectable PrP band at the zero time point (Fig. 5A) which, as expected, migrates with the unglycosylated form of the PrP. After a 4-h chase period, the intracellular PrP, although decreased by over 90% (93 ± 2.3%; n = 6), is still present in the tunicamycin-treated cells expressing PrPC (Fig. 5A). In contrast, after the 4-h chase, the PrPM is barely detectable in the tunicamycin-treated mutant cells although the amount of PrPM in the tunicamycin treated control and mutant cells is comparable immediately after labeling (Fig. 5A). At the cell surface, PrPC is readily detectable in the tunicamycin-treated control cells at the zero time point and increases 3.5-fold during the 4-h chase (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, PrPM is present at one-half the amount of PrPC at the surface of the tunicamycin-treated mutant cells at time 0 and is essentially unchanged over the 4-h chase (Fig. 5C).Figure 5:Tunicamycin impairs transport to the cell surface and alters stability of PrPM. A, cells were preincubated in media lacking methionine and cysteine with or without 2 μg/ml tunicamycin. The media was removed and the cells were labeled for 60 min in media containing Trans35S-label and 2 μg/ml tunicamycin. 30 min into the labeling period PI-PLC was added to one plate. After the labeling period the media was removed, a cell homogenate was immediately prepared from the plate treated with PI-PLC which was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 3F4. Media lacking the 35S label was added to the second plate, after 3.5 h at 37°C, PI-PLC was added and followin"
https://openalex.org/W2004593278,"Human fascin is an actin-bundling protein that is thought to be involved in the assembly of actin filament bundles present in microspikes as well as in membrane ruffles and stress fibers. We have found that human fascin is phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i> upon treatment with 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a tumor promoter. The <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation is gradually increased from 0.13 to 0.30 mol/mol during 2 h of treatment, concomitant with the disappearance of human fascin from stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and microspikes. Human fascin can also be phosphorylated <i>in vitro</i> by protein kinase C at the same sites as observed <i>in vivo</i> as judged by phosphopeptide mapping. The extent of phosphorylation depends on pH: the stoichiometries are 0.05, 0.38, and 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of protein at pH 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0, respectively. Phosphorylation greatly reduces actin binding of human fascin, while lowering the pH to 6.0 alone does not affect fascin-actin binding. With the incorporation of 0.25 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, the actin binding affinity is reduced from 6.7 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>. The actin bundling activity is also decreased. These results suggest that phosphorylation of fascin plays a role in actin reorganization after treatment with 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate."

In order to study the role of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in intracellular signaling, we constructed GH receptors in which combinations of tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines. We identified three tyrosine residues at positions 534, 566, and 627 that were required for activation of GH-stimulated transcription of the serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2.1 promoter. Any of these three tyrosines is able to independently mediate GH-induced transcription, indicating redundancy in this part of the GH receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation was not required for GH stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity or for GH-stimulated Ca+2 channel activation since these pathways were normal in cells expressing a GH receptor in which all eight intracellular tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines. Activation of Stat5 by GH was, however, abolished in cells expressing the GH receptor lacking intracellular tyrosines. This study demonstrates that specific tyrosines in the GH receptor are required for transcriptional signaling possibly by their role in the activation of transcription factor Stat5.

Stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase by GH have been studied both in cultured cells (14.Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Campbell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

In addition to activation of MAP kinase, its translocation to the nucleus has also been demonstrated. The activation of MAP kinase by GH is dependent upon the proline-rich box 1 domain of the GH receptor that presumably is directly involved in the binding of Jak2. When the box 1 domain is deleted or the prolines are mutated to alanines, the GH receptor is no longer able to mediate GH-induced MAP kinase activity. The functional role of MAP kinase activation in GH signaling is not known; however, it has been speculated that this activity is important for protein synthesis and possibly cell proliferation(14.Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GH activates MAP kinase is also largely unknown, but the fact that GH can activate SHC and Grb2 indicates a mechanism similar to that utilized by receptor tyrosine kinases. We have also reported that GH is able to activate voltage-dependent Ca+2 channels. This activity is independent of Jak2 (17.Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and cannot be inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors(18.Ilondo M.M. DeMeyts P. Bouchelouche P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The GH-induced Ca+2 response consists of oscillations in intracellular free Ca+2 concentrations of varying frequency and amplitude and has been demonstrated to be required for GH-induced transcription of the insulin gene(17.Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have also shown that a region in the rat GH receptor located between residues 454 and 506 is required for the Ca+2-signaling ability of the GH receptor. Finally, GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins has also been described, and this response has been found to be dependent on a 40-amino acid domain located between residues 476 and 516 of the porcine GH receptor(19.Wang X. Souza S.C. Kelder B. Cioffi J.A. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6261-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although it has been known for some time that binding of GH to its receptor leads to rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the GH receptor(9.Carter-Su C. Stubbart J.R. Wang X. Stred S.E. Argetsinger L.S. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18654-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional importance of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation remains relatively unknown. In the promyeloid cell line FDC-P1, it has recently been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor is not required for GH-stimulated proliferation(20.Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrosines located close to the transmembrane region of the GH receptor is required for certain metabolic effects of GH(10.VanderKuur J. Wang X. Zhang L. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21738-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21.Lobie P.E. Allevato G. Nielsen J.H. Norstedt G. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21745-21750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily, tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in signaling. In the IL-4 (22.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptors, as well as in the signal transducer gp130(23.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues is required for binding and activation of Stat factors. Furthermore, a single tyrosine located in the C-terminal domain of the prolactin receptor has been found to be crucial for transcriptional signaling(24.Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). While it has been possible to identify specific regions of the GH receptor as being important for various signaling pathways stimulated by GH by using deletion and substitution mutations, we now address the question of the role of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in GH-mediated signal transduction. In this study, we have constructed a series of GH receptor mutants in which we have systematically substituted all intracellular tyrosines with phenylalanines and have analyzed their ability to mediate GH-stimulated transcription, activation of MAP kinase, Ca+2 signaling, as well as activation of Stat5. An XbaI/EcoRI fragment containing the coding region of the pGH-R gene was cloned into the pMet-Ig7 that contains the mouse MT-1 promoter(25.Wang X. Cioffi J.A. Kelder B. Harding P.A. Chen W.Y. Kopchick J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the GH receptor cDNA was performed as described (19.Wang X. Souza S.C. Kelder B. Cioffi J.A. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6261-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All GH-mutated GH receptor cDNAs were cloned into the pMet-Ig7 expression plasmid for use in transfection studies. The plasmid pcDNAneo encoding the neo resistance gene under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was from Invitrogen, San Diego, CA. The plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, pCH110, was from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. The Spi 2.1/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid was constructed by ligation of three copies of the Spi 2.1 GH-responsive sequence, 5′-agctATGTTCTGAGAAAATC-3′ into the plasmid TK-CAT (26.Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) that contains the minimal thymidine kinase promoter in front of the CAT gene. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were grown to 50% confluence in 60-mm dishes. Twenty-four h prior to transfection, the cells were washed once in Ham's F-12 medium without serum and starved for 24 h in serum-free medium (GC-3) containing a 1:1 mixture of minimal essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 μg of transferrin/ml (Sigma), 80 milliunits of insulin/ml (Novo Nordisk, Denmark), 2.5 mM glutamine, and nonessential amino acid. Just prior to transfection, the medium was changed to Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure with 3 μg of the β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, 1.5 μg of the construct containing the bacterial CAT coding sequence linked to three copies of the sequence −147 to −103 of the Spi 2.1 promoter(1.Isaksson O.G.P. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and 1.5 μg of the different mutated GH receptor plasmids. After 4 h, the cells were subjected to a glycerol shock (14% glycerol in Opti-MEM I) for 1 min and then washed twice before fresh GC-3 medium, with or without 20 nM hGH (Novo Nordisk, Gentofte, Denmark), was added. Following 48 h of culture at 37°C, the cells were scraped off the plate, and extracts were prepared by three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. GH receptor expression was analyzed in cells cultured for 48 h, and all GH receptor constructs were found to be expressed at the cell surface. The CHO cells were stably transfected with 5 μg of pGH-R cDNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggestions (75 μg of LipofectAMINE). After 8 h of exposure to the LipofectAMINE-DNA complex, the medium was changed to Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Following 24 h of additional culture, the cells were split (1:4) by trypsin treatment and cultured in the presence of 1 mg of G418/ml. After 6 days, colonies were picked and analyzed for hGH binding. Three different clones expressing the pGH-R1-638 and three clones expressing the pGH-RmC8 were isolated and analyzed. Binding experiments were performed using 125I-hGH (specific activity, 92 μCi/μg) and carried out for 90 min at room temperature in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 124 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 as described previously(27.Billestrup N. Martin J.M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cell extracts were normalized for β-galactosidase activity and assayed for CAT activity. The CAT assays were performed for 45 min using 1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Corp.). The samples were subjected to thin layer chromatography and exposed to PhosphorImager screens. The CAT activity was determined by quantitation of the radioactive spots of [14C]chloramphenicol and its acetylated forms using the IMAGEQUANT program. The cells were cultured as described previously in 6-well dishes. Twenty-four h prior to stimulation with hGH, the cells were washed with Ham's F-12 medium without fetal calf serum. The cells were then starved in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air overnight. The cells were stimulated for 0, 5, and 10 min with 20 nM hGH. The assay was performed as described previously(28.Traverse S. Gomez N. Peterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris acetate, 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin). 100-μl aliquots were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ERK2/protein A-Sepharose suspension. The phosphorylation assay was carried out for 20 min at 30°C in 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was spotted on phosphor cellulose, washed, and counted. The assay was performed three times in duplicate. Cells were cultured for two days on thin (0.7 mm) glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine. Cells were loaded with 10 μM Fura-2/AM at 37°C. After 30 min, an equal volume of culture medium was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min in order to complete de-esterification of Fura-2/AM. The buffer for fluorescence measurement was 0.145 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. For fluorescence measurements, the cells were placed in a stainless steel chamber on an inverted microscope, and cells were illuminated at 340 and 380 nm alternatively using interference filters mounted on a filter wheel and observed through a 510-nm emission filter. Six to eight fields at each wavelength were averaged in real time, and the background (field without cells) was subtracted. The images were captured with a low light level, intensified charge-coupled device video camera system. The ratio images (R340/R380) were calculated from the division of the 340-nm image by the 380-nm image on a pixel by pixel basis and were converted to the Ca+2 concentration using the calibration curve. Cells were grown to 100% confluence. Twenty-four h before the assay, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and starved in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air overnight. The cells were stimulated with 20 nM hGH for 5 min and then scraped off in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mM Na3VO4. After centrifugation, the cells were incubated for 15 min on ice in a hypotonic buffer (20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl and 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer or lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were resuspended in a hypertonic buffer (hypotonic buffer plus 400 mM NaCl) and incubated on a rocking platform for 30 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out for 30 min at 30°C in 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg of (dI•dC) (dI•dC), and 20 fmol of [32P]dCTP-labeled probe. After the addition of loading buffer, the samples were assayed on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. The Spi-GLE1 probe used was 5′-agctATGTTCTGAGAAAATC-3′, and the α-chorionic gonadotropin probe was 5′-agctTTTTACCATGACGTCAATTTGATC-3′. After annealing, the double-stranded DNA was radiolabeled by a fill-in reaction using DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) and α-[32P]dCTP and then purified on NAP-5 columns (Pharmacia). Stat5 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In order to determine the role of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in transcriptional signaling, we constructed a number of mutated porcine GH receptors as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The GH receptor cDNAs were co-transfected into CHO cells together with a CAT reporter construct containing three copies of the GH-responsive element from the Spi 2.1 promoter. After 48 h in culture with or without 20 nM GH, the functional activity of the transfected GH receptor was analyzed by its ability to direct GH-induced expression of CAT activity. In the series of truncated GH receptors shown in Fig. 1A, it was found that the 80 most C-terminal amino acids could be deleted without loss of GH induction, but when 122 amino acids were deleted (GHR 1-516), no GH stimulation of CAT activity was observed. The mutation of individual tyrosines to phenylalanines in the intracellular domain of the GH receptor did not affect the signaling ability of the GH receptor since all eight receptors were able to mediate GH-stimulated CAT activity (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained using the rat GH receptor in which the intracellular tyrosines were individually mutated to phenylalanines. ( (2)L. H. Hansen and N. Billestrup, unpublished data.) In contrast, when tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanines in combination and sequentially from the C terminus, signaling by the GH receptor was lost when the four most C-terminal tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines (Fig. 1C). These results indicate a role for two or more of these tyrosines in signaling. Finally, we constructed mutated GH receptors in which seven out of the eight cytoplasmic tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines. The results from this series of GH receptor mutants revealed that any one of three tyrosines, 534, 566, or 627, when present as the only cytoplasmic tyrosine in the GH receptor, can generate a functional GH receptor (Fig. 1D). Comparison of the amino acid sequences surrounding the three tyrosines shows no obvious sequence homology (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Amino acid sequence of the porcine GH receptor domains containing the three tyrosine residues found to be involved in transcriptional signaling. The number above the tyrosine refers to the position of the tyrosine residue in the porcine GH receptor precursor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in GH-induced MAP kinase activation was evaluated in CHO cells stably transfected with either the wild-type or the GH receptor mC8 mutant lacking all intracellular tyrosines. The number of GH receptors in the two clones shown in Fig. 3 was comparable, expressing approximately 40,000 receptors/cell. GH-induced MAP kinase activity was the same in cells expressing either the wild-type or the mC8 mutant GH receptor, but no MAP kinase activation was seen in untransfected CHO cells (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor is not required for GH-induced activation of MAP kinase activity. The domain of the GH receptor required for GH-induced oscillations in intracellular free Ca+2 concentrations has been found to overlap with the domain required for transcriptional signaling, suggesting a role for Ca+2 in GH-induced transcriptional signaling. We have, therefore, examined the ability of the wild-type and the mC8 mutant GH receptors to mediate GH-induced Ca+2 oscillations by fluorescence image microscopy of Fura-2-loaded CHO cells. Untransfected CHO cells (Fig. 4A), cloned cell lines expressing the wild-type (Fig. 4B), or the mC8 mutant (Fig. 4C) GH receptor exhibited GH-induced Ca+2 oscillations similar to those described previously. Similarly, pools of transfected CHO cells expressing wild-type (Fig. 4D) or mutant (Fig. 4E) GH receptors showed the typical GH-induced Ca+2 oscillations of varying frequency and amplitude. The Ca+2 response was observed in the majority of GH receptor-expressing cells analyzed but was never seen in untransfected CHO cells. Since cytokine receptor phosphorylation has been implicated in Stat factor activation for the IL-4 and LIF receptors, we investigated the role of GH receptor phosphorylation in the activation of Stat5 by gel retardation assay. Nuclear extracts from control and GH-stimulated cells expressing wild-type or mC8 mutant GH receptors were isolated. Using the GH response element from the Spi 2.1 promoter as a probe, a GH-induced band was observed using nuclear extracts from cells expressing the wild-type GH receptor (Fig. 5A, lane 4). In contrast, no specific bands were observed using nuclear extracts from cells expressing the mC8 mutant GH receptor (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). The GH-induced band was specific since it could be inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide (Fig. 5C, lanes 15 and 16). The presence of Stat5 in the observed complexes was tested by using Stat5 antibodies in gel retardation assays. A supershift of the GH-induced bands was observed when the Stat5 antibody was present in the binding reaction, whereas a preimmune serum did not affect the formation of the GH-induced complexes (Fig. 5C, lanes 17 and 18). Antibodies against Stat1 or Stat3 did not cause a supershift of the GH-induced bands. The quality of the nuclear extracts was tested by DNA binding activity to the cyclic AMP response element from the α-chorionic gonadotropin promoter. All extracts were found to contain proteins capable of binding to this promoter element (Fig. 5B). We have demonstrated in this study that three tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the GH receptor are involved in transcriptional signaling. Specific tyrosine phosphorylation of GH receptors in response to GH has been previously observed in several different cell types(9.Carter-Su C. Stubbart J.R. Wang X. Stred S.E. Argetsinger L.S.

However, it was recently shown that the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase was Jak2 (31.Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Wang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and that binding and activation of Jak2 by GH was dependent upon a proline-rich domain in the GH receptor(15.VanderKuur J.A.

The proline-rich domain is required for receptor signaling since deletion of this domain results in a receptor that is unable to activate signal transduction(17.Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P.

We and others have previously identified the C-terminal 184 amino acids of the rat GH receptor as being required for GH-stimulated transcription of the Spi 2.1 (32.Goujon L. Allevato G. Simonin G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17441-17445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes. However, the signaling properties of this domain are not known, although it has been implicated in GH-stimulated Ca+2 channel activation(17.Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By way of co-transfection of truncated porcine GH receptor cDNA with an Spi 2.1 promoter/CAT construct, we found that GH stimulation of CAT activity can be abolished when 122 amino acids were deleted from the C terminus of the porcine GH receptor. In order to examine the possible effect of GH receptor tyrosine phosphorylation on transcriptional signaling, we substituted individual tyrosine residues with phenylalanines. All GH receptors containing single mutations were able to mediate GH-induced CAT activity. The variation in GH induction observed (Fig. 1B) does not reflect a true variation in signaling ability, but it most likely reflects differences in expression levels of the transfected GH receptors caused by differences in plasmid purity. When different preparations of the wild-type GH receptor encoding plasmid were used in the transcription assay, GH induction varied from 4- to 12-fold. Mutation of multiple tyrosines to phenylalanines as shown in Fig. 1, C and D, revealed that three tyrosine residues at positions 534, 566, and 627 are involved in signaling and that each of these tyrosines can function independently. A similar redundancy has been observed in receptors for IL-4(22.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), LIF, and the signal transducer gp130(23.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Three tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the LIF receptor and four tyrosines in gp130 were found to be involved in the activation of Stat3. Furthermore, in the IL-4 receptor, two tyrosines have been implicated in the activation of Stat6. In all cases, it has been implicated that a direct interaction between the SH2 domain of the Stat factor and the phosphorylated tyrosine on the receptor is a prerequisite for Stat activation. The specificity of SH2 domain interaction with phosphorylated tyrosines appears to reside within the three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine (35.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). In the LIF receptor and gp130, all five tyrosines found to be involved in Stat3 activation have conserved amino acids in the +1 to +3 positions. Similarly, in the IL-4 receptor, the identical amino acids are present in the +1 and +3 positions relative to the tyrosines involved in Stat6 activation. In the prolactin receptor that is 35% identical to the GH receptor, a single tyrosine residue has been identified as being responsible for activation of β-casein gene transcription. Interestingly, this tyrosine is conserved in prolactin and GH receptors of all species examined so far. Considering that both prolactin and GH stimulate Stat5 factors and that Stat5 has been shown to bind to hormone-responsive elements in the β-casein (36.Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 37.Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and Spi 2.1 promoters, it seems likely that this C-terminal tyrosine is directly involved in Stat5 activation. In contrast to the LIF and IL-4 receptors and gp130 in which the tyrosines involved in Stat activation have very similar +1 to +3 positions, the three tyrosines identified in this study have varying C-terminal flanking amino acids. Except for the threonine residue at the +3 position relative to tyrosines 627 and 566, no other identities or similarities exist among these positions. However, the C-terminal flanking amino acids are conserved in all species of cloned GH receptors until now. This raises the possibility that the three tyrosines use different signaling pathways for mediating GH-stimulated Spi 2.1 transcription by binding separate signaling molecules having different SH2 domains. Another explanation could be that all three tyrosines are involved in Stat5 activation, but each tyrosine activates only one of the Stat5 isoforms, A or B(38.Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.-M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 39.Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In CHO cells expressing the GH receptor mutant lacking all intracellular tyrosines (mC8), no activation of Stat5 could be observed, whereas in cells expressing the wild-type GH receptor GH was able to induce binding of Stat5 to the Spi 2.1 promoter. In contrast it was previously shown that in FDC-P1 promyeloid cells expressing wild-type or tyrosine-deficient GH receptors intracellular tyrosines are not required for GH activation of Stat1 or −3 binding to the sis-inducible element from the c-fos promoter (20.Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the same study, GH-induced Jak2 activation in FDC-P1 cells was not affected by the lack of intracellular tyrosines in the GH receptor. We also observed that GH can induce Jak2 activation in CHO cells expressing the tyrosine-deficient GH receptor mutant2 as well as GH-stimulated MAP kinase activity. GH-induced oscillations in [Ca+2]i were similarly unaffected by the mutation of all intracellular tyrosines to phenylalanines. This is in agreement with our previous observation that Jak2 kinase activity is not required for GH-stimulated Ca+2 signaling and that tyrosine kinase inhibitors are not able to block the GH-induced rise in [Ca+2]i(17.Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18.Ilondo M.M. DeMeyts P. Bouchelouche P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In conclusion we have shown that three tyrosines in the C-terminal domain of the GH receptor function as mediators of GH-induced transcription of the Spi 2.1 gene. These tyrosines are, however, not required for GH-induced MAP kinase activity nor for GH-induced Ca+2 signaling. The transcriptional signaling pathway presumably involves Stat5 activation by specific binding of Stat5 to the phosphorylated tyrosines followed by phosphorylation of Stat5 that leads to dimerization and DNA binding. Whether Stat5 binds directly to the phosphorylated tyrosines in the GH receptor or via adapter proteins is not known at present. The observation that tyrosine-deficient GH receptors can still mediate GH effects on proliferation and Stat1 and −3 activation in FDC-P1 cells (20.Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggests that GH activates different Stat proteins by distinct signaling pathways. The activation of Stat1 and −3 may be mediated by phosphorylated tyrosines on Jak2 itself, whereas Stat5 activation requires phosphotyrosines in the C-terminal domain of the GH receptor. This would imply that the proliferative effects of GH are mediated at least in part by Stat1 and −3 activation, whereas the effects of GH on cell-specific gene transcription require Stat5.

One of the few thus far documented examples, TlpA from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, is characterized by a remarkably long (250 amino acids) α-helical coiled-coil domain. Herein, we demonstrate that TlpA is a novel, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Several <i>tlpA</i> deletion mutants have been constructed, and their corresponding protein products were purified and tested for DNA binding. Two of the mutant proteins were shown to be deficient in DNA binding. Both mutants were analyzed by circular dichroism and electron microscopy, supporting the notion that mutant proteins were largely intact despite lacking the amino acid residues necessary for DNA binding. <i>In vivo</i> studies with transcriptional <i>tlpA-lacZ</i> fusions demonstrated that TlpA acts as a repressor. Using the repressor phenotype as a readout, the chain exchange previously described <i>in vitro</i> could also be confirmed <i>in vivo</i>. We believe the coiled-coil domain acts not only as a dimerization interface but could also serve a role as a flexible modulator of the protein-DNA interaction."

NH2-terminal sequencing indicates that p18 is distinct from other nuclear envelope components, but has similarity to the mitochondrial isoquinoline-binding protein. In situ analysis by immunoelectron microscopy and examination of digitonin-permeabilized cells by indirect immunofluorescence show that p18, unlike LBR and other lamin-binding proteins, is equally distributed between the inner and outer nuclear membrane. Furthermore, cycloheximide inhibition experiments reveal that the fraction of p18 that resides in the outer nuclear membrane does not represent nascent chains en route to the inner nuclear membrane, but rather material in equilibrium with the p18 that partitions with the inner nuclear membrane. The paradigm of p18 suggests that transmembrane complexes formed by the nuclear lamins and LBR provide potential docking sites for integral membrane proteins of the nuclear envelope that equilibrate between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the inner nuclear membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1990659052,"This paper describes the homeostasis of glycosphingolipid (GSL) on the cell surface as revealed for the first time by an application of endoglycoceramidase (EGCase) capable of hydrolyzing the linkage between the oligosaccharide and the ceramide of various GSLs. When cell-surface GSLs of B16 melanoma cells were hydrolyzed by the action of EGCase, the synthesis of GSLs was found to increase transiently, possibly due to the activation of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase. As a result, the cell-surface GSL content was restored quickly to exactly the same level found without the EGCase treatment, if EGCase was removed from the cell culture. Treatment of erythrocytes with EGCase was found to increase the ceramide content of the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, however, in B16 cells the increase of membrane ceramide by EGCase caused the suppression of de novo ceramide production, resulting in maintenance of the ceramide content of B16 cells at the same level even after EGCase treatment. The signal for homeostatic regulation could be the ceramide released by the action of EGCase, since C2-ceramide was found to mimic in part the action of EGCase; it suppressed de novo production of ceramide and was directly converted to GSL, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1 N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide GM3). Our finding demonstrates a novel form of homeostatic regulation coupled to the GSL-synthesizing system in mammalian cells for maintaining the contents of both cell-surface GSLs and free ceramide. Since many opportunistic pathogens were found to produce EGCase extracellularly, this restoration mechanism could also be present as a defense mechanism against microbial EGCase."

Previous studies showed that amino-terminal disulfide bonds, as well as the disulfide rings that flank the “coiled-coil” region, are necessary for chain assembly and secretion (Zhang, J.

Fibrinogen chains, with deletions at the amino terminus, were co-expressed in COS cells together with normal fibrinogen chains. Elimination of the first 8 amino acids of the Bβ chain did not affect dimer assembly, but deletion of amino acid residues 9-72 had a small inhibitory effect on dimer formation. Deletion of the first 72 amino acids of the Bβ chain further inhibited dimer formation and resulted in nearly equal amounts of half-molecule and dimeric fibrinogen being formed and secreted. Deletion of the first 80 residues, which includes the cysteine residues that form the amino-terminal disulfide ring, completely eliminated dimer formation, and only half-molecules were secreted. By contrast deletion of the first 41 amino acid residues of the Aα chain or the first 15 residues of the γ chain, which correspond to BβΔ1-72, did not affect chain assembly and secretion. However, co-expression of both AαΔ1-41 and γΔ1-15 with normal Bβ, inhibited dimer formation.

Human fibrinogen is a dimer with each half-molecule containing three different polypeptide chains Aα, Bβ, and γ (for reviews, see (1.Blomback B. Blomback M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Each of the fibrinogen chains has an amino-terminal segment followed by an α-helical domain of about 111 amino acids that forms a 3-chain “coiled-coil” region flanked by interchain disulfide rings(4.Doolittle R.F. Goldbaum D.M. Doolittle L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). On the carboxyl-terminal end, the Bβ and γ chains have homologous globular domains, while the Aα chain has a long segment that is not equivalent to that of Bβ and γ. However, in normal plasma there are small amounts of a fibrinogen with an extended Aα chain, which is homologous to the carboxyl termini of the Bβ and γ chains(5.Fu Y. Weissbach L. Plant P.W.

Structural studies indicate that fibrinogen is elongated and trinodal. The central node (E domain) contains the amino termini of the 6 polypeptide chains, and the two terminal nodes (D domains) are formed by globular carboxyl-terminal domains of Bβ and γ chains. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the large Aα chain is thought to fold back and contribute to the structure of the central node(12.Hall C.E. Slayter H.S. J. Biophys. Biochem.

Disruption of the disulfide rings at the amino-terminal end of the coiled-coil region prevents dimer formation, and the elimination of the disulfide rings, at the carboxyl-terminal end of the coiled-coil region, allows dimer formation, but the 6-chain molecule that is assembled is not secreted (19.Zhang J.Z.

The following oligonucleotides were used: CTTTTCTAAGAATTCGGCTGGCTC, GACCTGCAGGAATTCAAGCTTGGC, GAGTGCCCGGAATTCGAAAGCTTA, and CTTTGCAAGGAATTCCATTGTCCA. In order to eliminate an internal EcoRI site in Aα cDNA, an oligonucleotide (GGAAGGGAACTCAGCTATC) was used to change the nucleotide sequences GAA to GAG without changing glutamic acid at position 550. Each of the full-length cDNAs was excised by digestion with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of expression vector pED4-Neo. The correct orientation was selected by restriction mapping. Cysteine codons (TGC) in single strand DNA of M13mp19Aα were changed to serine (AGC) at positions 28 and 36. Two synthetic oligonucleotides, TGAATCTTTGCTGGCAGATTGA for Aα28s and TCATCAGAGCTGAAGGGCCA for Aα36s were used according to the method of Kunkel(25.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All mutant cDNAs were released by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of pED4Neo. The proper orientation of mutant cDNAs and the mutations formed by simple base substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Four deletion mutants M13mp19BβΔ1-8, M13mp19BβΔ9-72, M13mp19BβΔ1-80, and M13mp19BβΔ1-192 were prepared as described previously(17.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol.

All mutant cDNAs from bacteriophage M13mp19 were inserted into EcoRI site of pED4Neo. The right orientation of the expression vectors were determined by restriction mapping. To construct deletion mutant M13mp18γΔ1-15, single strand DNA of bacteriophage M13mp18γ with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end was used as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotide GTTGGACAATAACTACCTGCTACACATGTTGAAG. The deletion of codons encoding the first 15 amino acids was verified by DNA sequencing. The 1.4-kilobase DNA fragment, obtained from M13mp18γΔ1-15, was cloned into the EcoRI site of expression vector pED4Neo. COS-1 cells were maintained in Iscove's media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

Immunoprecipitates were isolated by SDS-PAGE ( (1)The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNeoneomycin phosphotransferase.) under reduced and nonreduced conditions, and radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis neomycin phosphotransferase. All normal and mutant fibrinogen chain cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pED4Neo. The vector was chosen because we anticipate, in future studies, selecting stable cell lines and also because it gives high levels of expression in COS cells. This vector contains TnF neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo), a selectable marker, and dehydrofolate reductase, an amplifiable gene. pED4Neo also has the SV40 origin of replication and enhancer and the adenovirus major late promoter(20.Kaufman R. Davies M. Wasley L. Michnik D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Forty hours after transfection, COS cells were radiolabeled with L-[35S]methionine for 2 h, and the radioactive fibrinogen chains were immunoprecipitated from both the detergent-treated cell lysate and from the culture medium, using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the three fibrinogen chains. The radioactive chains were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. A diagram, depicting the deletion mutants constructed, is shown in Fig. 1. All normal and mutant chains were expressed to approximately the same extent (Fig. 2). Deletion mutant BβΔ1-192 was less radioactive, which could be due to fewer methionine residues (Fig. 2A, lane 9). Lower molecular weight proteins, due to either degradation or to incomplete translation, were noted in normal and mutant Aα and Bβ chains (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Expression of normal and mutant fibrinogen chains. Single fibrinogen chain cDNAs were expressed in COS cells.

A very small amount of normal Aα, Aα28s,36s, and AαΔ1-41 were secreted (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, and 3). Larger amounts of normal γ and γΔ1-15 were secreted (Fig. 2B, lanes 10 and 11). There was no secretion of normal Bβ, BβΔ1-8, BΔβ9-72, BβΔ1-72, BβΔ1-80, and BβΔ1-192 chains. In all cases the secreted chains were only detected on overexposure of the autoradiogram, and we estimate that less than 10% of the γ chain synthesized was secreted into the medium. The large amount of protein radioactivity at the top of the gel is a contaminant due to cross-reaction of the polyclonal antibody with a protein secreted by COS cells. Our previous study showed that deletion of the first 72 amino acids from Bβ chain inhibits assembly of the two half-molecules and results in secretion of both half-molecules and dimeric fibrinogen (17.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21727-21732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To more narrowly define the domains involved in assembly of dimeric fibrinogen, Bβ mutants with different deletions at the amino terminus were constructed and co-expressed with normal Aα and γ chains. The intracellular complexes were analyzed by immuno-precipitation and SDS-PAGE on nonreduced gels. Secretion was measured by immunoprecipitation of fibrinogen from the culture medium and analysis of the secreted fibrinogen chain complexes on nonreduced 5% SDS-PAGE or on reduced 7.5% SDS-PAGE. COS cells co-expressing BβΔ1-8 with normal Aα and γ chains secreted the mutant dimeric fibrinogen and a small amount of Aα•γ complex (Fig. 3A, lane 1). On reduction the component chains of fibrinogen were observed (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Free chains, intermediate complexes, and dimeric fibrinogen occurred intracellularly (data not shown). Expression of a mutant Bβ chain with an internal deletion of amino-terminal residues 9-72, which is the same as the naturally occurring mutant termed Fibrinogen New York 1(29.Liu C.Y. Koehn J.A. Morgan F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4390-4396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowed assembly and secretion of dimeric fibrinogen and small amounts of half-molecules and of Aα•γ complex (Fig. 3A, lane 2). On reduction BβΔ9-72 co-migrates, on SDS-PAGE, together with the γ chain (Fig. 3B, lane 2). However, deletion of the first 72 amino acid residues (BβΔ1-72) resulted in inhibition of dimer formation and secretion of both half-molecules and dimeric fibrinogen (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 3). Further deletion of another 8 amino acids (BβΔ1-80), which includes deletion of a pair of cysteines flanking the amino-terminal side of the coiled-coil region, completely eliminated the formation of dimeric fibrinogen, and only half-molecules were assembled and secreted (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4). In all cases small amounts of Aα•γ complexes were secreted. The radioactive protein at the top of the gels, marked by arrows, is a non-fibrinogen contaminant expressed by COS cells(19.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-molecule, which contains BβΔ1-80, migrated more slowly than expected in comparison with the half-molecule that contains BβΔ1-72. However, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirms that they are both half-molecules and suggests that the differences in mobilities may be due to differences in conformation (Fig. 4). A previous study showed that disruption of the disulfide rings that flank the carboxyl-terminal side of the coiled-coil region, by substituting cysteine with serine residues, allowed dimeric fibrinogen to be formed but prevented secretion. To further examine the role of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide rings in assembly and secretion, a Bβ chain mutant (BβΔ1-192), which contains the carboxyl-terminal pair of cysteines at positions 193 and 196 but does not contain the amino-terminal domain or the coiled-coil region, was expressed. This deletion mutant did not assemble with normal Aα and γ chains, and no half-molecules or dimeric fibrinogen were detected on SDS-PAGE under nonreduced conditions either intracellularly (data not shown) or in the culture medium (Fig. 3A, lane 5). However, a small amount of Aα•γ complex and free γ chains were secreted, and Aα and γ chains were noted on reduction (Fig. 3B, lane 5). The free γ chain is not noted in Fig. 3A, lane 5, because in order to separate the nonreduced fibrinogen complexes, a 5% gel was used, and the free γ chain migrated out of the system. To further characterize the fibrinogen complexes secreted, the radioactive proteins were separated in the first dimension by nonreduced SDS-PAGE and in a second dimension in reducing conditions. Expression of normal Aα, Bβ, and γ resulted in the secretion of dimeric fibrinogen. Detectable, only after overexposure of the film, were small amounts of half-molecule, Aα•γ, and γ•γ complexes. The principal secreted product, dimeric fibrinogen, yielded, as expected, Aα, Bβ, and γ chains on reduction (Fig. 4, top left panel). The area identified as Aα•γ complex contained more radioactivity in the Aα than in the γ chain, and therefore it is possible that this area may also contain a mixture of Aα•Aα dimer and small amounts of a γ homopolymer. Expression of Aα, BβΔ1-72, and γ led to secretion of mutant dimeric fibrinogen, mutant half-molecule, and Aα•γ complex. In both the mutant dimeric fibrinogen and mutant half-molecule, the BβΔ1-72 migrated faster in the second dimension than γ chain (Fig. 4, top right panel). As shown in Fig. 3A, lane 4, expression of Aα, BβΔ1-80, and γ led to inhibition of dimer formation and secretion of half-molecules. The mutant half-molecule was characterized by its appropriate mobility in the first dimension and that it is composed of Aα, mutant Bβ, and γ chains (Fig. 4, bottom left panel). Another fibrinogen complex migrated slightly faster than the half-molecule in the first dimension, and because of its size, chain composition, and variability in different experiments, it was tentatively identified as degraded half-molecule. Small amounts of mutant fibrinogen chains were also noted in the second dimension in a higher molecular weight complex, suggesting that larger complexes composed of Aα and mutant BβΔ1-80 chains may also occur. To determine the effect of amino-terminal amino acid residues of Aα and γ chains in dimer formation, mutants were created, equivalent to BβΔ1-72, which deleted the amino-terminal amino acid residues upstream from the disulfide rings, which flank the amino-terminal side of the coiled-coil region. COS cells were co-transfected with a mutant chain and the two corresponding normal chains, and fibrinogen assembly and secretion were determined. In contrast to BβΔ1-72, (Fig. 5, lane 3) in which both half-molecules and dimeric fibrinogen were secreted, removal of the first 41 amino acids of Aα chain (AαΔ1-41) did not affect the assembly and secretion of dimeric fibrinogen (Fig. 5, lane 2). Dimeric fibrinogen was secreted into the culture medium. Similarly, deletion of the first 15 amino acids of γ chain (γΔ1-15), did not interrupt dimer formation, and dimeric fibrinogen was secreted (Fig. 5, lane 4). However, COS cells co-expressing mutants AαΔ1-41, γΔ1-15, and normal Bβ chains, only assembled and secreted half-molecules and did not form dimeric fibrinogen (Fig. 5, lane 5). The half-molecule assembled in these conditions was further characterized by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4, bottom right panel). It had the appropriate mobility in the first dimension and yielded mutant Aα and γ chains and normal Bβ on the second dimension. This is in agreement with previous studies in which amino-terminal cysteines were changed to serine(19.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). AαΔ1-41 and γΔ1-15 do not contain the cysteine residues (Aα Cys28, Aα Cys36, and γ Cys8 and Cys9), which link, by disulfide bonds, the two half-molecules of fibrinogen. Previous studies indicated that the half-molecules of fibrinogen are linked by three symmetrical disulfide bonds between adjacent Aα and γ chains (Aα Cys28-Aα Cys28, γ Cys8,9-Cys8,9) and probably between Aα Cys36 of one half-molecule and Bβ Cys65 of the other half-molecule. This conclusion was reached because substituting cysteine residues with serine at Aα 28 and γ 8 and 9 did not abolish dimer formation, but if the cysteines at Aα 36 or Bβ 65 were also changed to serine, then half-molecules and not dimers were mostly formed(19.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There was, however, a difference depending on whether the cysteines at Aα 36 or Bβ 65 were substituted. When Aα Cys36 was changed to serine some dimer formation occurred, and when Bβ Cys65 was changed to serine very few dimers were formed(30.Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This could be interpreted as either due to a rearrangement of disulfide interactions or the result of other noncovalent interactions between the half-molecules. To determine if, in addition to disulfide linkages, noncovalent interactions also occur between the amino-terminal domains of the two half-molecules, we compared deletion mutants with substitution mutants, in which the participating cysteine residues were substituted with serine. As described earlier, truncation of the first 41 amino acids of the Aα chain, which eliminates Aα cysteines 28 and 36 (Fig. 6A, lane 2), or truncation of the first 15 amino acids of γ chain, which eliminates cysteines 8 and 9 (Fig. 6A, lane 6), did not prevent dimer formation and secretion if these mutants were co-expressed with the two other normal chains. Similar results were obtained by substituting serine for cysteine residues at Aα Cys28 and Cys36 (Fig. 6, lane 3) and at γ Cys8 and Cys9 (γ8s,9s, Fig. 6A, lane 7). However, co-expressing AαΔ1-41, γΔ1-15, and BβΔ1-72, which removes all of the amino-terminal cysteine residues (Aα Cys28 and Cys36, γ Cys8 and Cys9, and Bβ Cys65) that are thought to hold the half-molecules together, resulted in the formation and secretion of only half-molecules (Fig. 6A, lane 14). It should be noted (Fig. 6B, lanes 7, 11, 13, and 15) that expression of γ8s,9s leads to the addition of an extra N-linked sugar and results in the mutant γ chain migrating close to normal Bβ chains(18.Zhang J.Z. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11278-11282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the first 41 amino acids of the Aα chain and the first 15 amino acids of γ chain interact noncovalently and assist dimeric fibrinogen assembly, a series of co-transfections were performed. COS cells co-expressing Aα 28s,36s, normal Bβ, and γ8s,9s (Fig. 6A, lane 11) secreted a mixture of half-molecules and dimeric fibrinogen, indicating that dimer formation was affected but not completely abolished. Similar results were obtained with AαΔ1-41, normal Bβ, and γ8s,9s (Fig. 6A, lane 16). By contrast COS cells co-expressing AαΔ1-41, normal Bβ, and γΔ1-15 (Fig. 6A, lane 10) predominantly secreted half-molecules and very little dimeric fibrinogen. The chain composition of the mutant half-molecule is shown in two-dimensional gels in Fig. 4. Also, co-expression of Aα28s,36s, normal Bβ, and γΔ1-15 (Fig. 6A, lane 17) led to the formation and secretion of half-molecules, with very little dimeric fibrinogen. These results indicate that noncovalent interactions at the amino-terminal domain of the γ chain, besides covalent interactions of cysteines, may also be involved in the formation of the dimeric complexes. Truncation of the first 72 amino acids of the Bβ chain also inhibited dimer formation, and both half-molecules and dimers were secreted (Fig. 6A, lane 4). This region of the Bβ contains a cysteine at position 65 that is thought to be linked to the cysteine at Aα 36 of the other half-molecule of fibrinogen. However, only substituting Bβ cysteine 65 to serine did not affect dimer formation and secretion (Fig. 6A, lane 5). This again suggests that amino acid residues within Bβ 1-72 other than the cysteine residues are involved in dimer formation by noncovalent interactions. On reduction, the secreted fibrinogen complexes in all cases only contained the expected mutant or normal fibrinogen chains (Fig. 6B). The two half-molecules of fibrinogen are linked by amino-terminal disulfide bonds. Earlier studies indicated that the three symmetrical disulfides, between adjacent cysteines at Aα 28 and γ 8 and 9 were the principal disulfide interactions holding the two half-molecules together. However, substituting these cysteine residues with serine did not abolish dimer formation in transfected COS cells(18.Zhang J.Z. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11278-11282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown that if, in addition, the cysteine residues at Aα 36 or Bβ 65 were also substituted with serine, then dimer formation was inhibited. This led to the suggestion that, in addition to the symmetrical disulfide bonds between adjacent Aα and γ chains, cysteine Aα 36 of one half-molecule is linked to cysteine Bβ 65 of the other half-molecule(19.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these amino-terminal disulfide bonds may not be the only interactions holding the two half-molecules. For example, substitution of Bβ Cys 65 with serine did not affect dimer formation, but deleting the first 72 amino-terminal amino acids inhibited dimer formation, and equal amounts of half-molecule and dimer were secreted. This suggested the involvement of some of the amino-terminal amino acid residues of the Bβ chain, other than cysteine, in dimer formation. In this report we test other Bβ deletion mutants and also amino-terminal Aα and γ deletion mutants and demonstrate that, in addition to the cysteine at position 65, sequences within the first 72 amino acid residues of Bβ participate in dimer formation as do amino-terminal residues in the Aα and γ chains. The results further suggest that a linear amino acid sequence within the Bβ amino-terminal region may not be responsible for linking the two half-molecules, since BβΔ1-8 had little or no effect on dimer formation; BβΔ9-72 slightly inhibited dimer formation, but BβΔ1-72 significantly interrupted dimer formation. BβΔ9-72 is the same as a naturally occurring mutant fibrinogen, termed Fibrinogen New York 1, which was identified as a heterozygous congenital dysfibrinogenemia with thrombotic tendency. In the patient, Fibrinogen New York 1 was present, in plasma, as a dimer. In the recombinant system small amounts of half-molecules are also secreted when BβΔ9-72 was co-expressed with normal Aα and γ chains. If some half-molecules were present in the plasma of Fibrinogen New York, they could remain undetected because plasma fibrinogen was not analyzed in nonreduced SDS-PAGE gels. Alternatively, in vivo, the half-molecule may not be secreted by hepatocytes or may be quickly cleared from the circulation. Clearly the major link between the two half-molecules is the amino-terminal disulfide bonds(19.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, our current results indicate that noncovalent interactions in all three chains also participate. For example, COS cells co-expressing Aα28s,36s, γ8s,9s, and normal Bβ chains are capable of assembling and secreting equal amounts of dimeric fibrinogen and half-molecules. By contrast, cells that co-expressed AαΔ1-41, γΔ1-15, and normal Bβ chains only assembled and secreted half-molecules. This indicates that besides cysteines at Aα 28 and 36 and γ 8 and 9, noncovalent interactions of other residues in the regions of AαΔ1-41 and γΔ1-15 participate in dimer formation. Further analysis showed that COS cells co-expressing AαΔ1-41, γ8s,9s, and normal Bβ chains secreted both dimer and half-molecules, while COS cells co-expressing Aα28s,36s, γΔ1-15, and normal Bβ chains only secreted half-molecules, indicating that noncovalent interactions of γΔ1-15 residues may play a more important role than that of Aα chain in holding the two half-molecules together. A structural feature of the three fibrinogen chains is that each chain contains about 111 hydrophobic amino acids, which intertwine to form an α-helical coiled-coil region. The coiled-coil region is flanked by a pair of cysteine (Cys-X-X-X-Cys) residues, which form interchain disulfide bridges, termed disulfide rings. Theoretical considerations suggested that the coiled-coil domain and the disulfide ring may play a key role in fibrinogen assembly(4.Doolittle R.F. Goldbaum D.M. Doolittle L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our early studies demonstrated that the first 207 amino acids of the Bβ chain, which contains the amino-terminal residues and an intact coiled-coil domain with disulfide rings, can form a dimeric structure when co-expressed with normal Aα and γ chains(17.Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21727-21732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data show that removal of the first 72 amino acids of the Bβ chain results in assembly of the three chains but that dimer formation is inhibited. This indicates that amino acid residues 73-207 of the Bβ chain are sufficient for assembly of half-molecules, while a subset of amino acid residues 1-72 of Bβ chain are necessary for dimer formation. Our data also demonstrate that deletion of an amino-terminal segment that contains the cysteine residues that are part of the disulfide rings completely eliminates dimer formation. This is consistent with our earlier studies, which showed that disruption of the disulfide rings by substituting cysteine residues with serine abolished dimer formation."
