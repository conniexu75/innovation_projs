https://openalex.org/W2022223573,"In some inflammatory diseases, TNF-alpha is thought to stimulate muscle catabolism via an NF-kappaB-dependent process that increases ubiquitin conjugation to muscle proteins. The transcriptional mechanism of this response has not been determined. Here we studied the potential role of UbcH2, a ubiquitin carrier protein and homologue of murine E220k. We find that UbcH2 is constitutively expressed by human skeletal and cardiac muscles, murine limb muscle, and cultured myotubes. TNF-alpha stimulates UbcH2 expression in mouse limb muscles in vivo and in cultured myotubes. The UbcH2 promoter region contains a functional NF-kappaB binding site; NF-kappaB binding to this sequence is increased by TNF-alpha stimulation. A dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation blocks both UbcH2 up-regulation and the increase in ubiquitin-conjugating activity stimulated by TNF-alpha. In extracts from TNF-alpha-treated myotubes, ubiquitin-conjugating activity is limited by UbcH2 availability; activity is inhibited by an antiserum to UbcH2 or a dominant negative mutant of UbcH2 and is enhanced by wild-type UbcH2. Thus, UbcH2 up-regulation is a novel response to TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling in skeletal muscle that appears to be essential for the increased ubiquitin conjugation induced by this cytokine."

We have previously demonstrated that prolonged exposure of isolated islets to elevated levels of palmitate inhibits preproinsulin mRNA levels in the presence of high glucose concentrations. However, whether this occurs via transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms has not been determined. In addition, the nature of the lipid metabolites involved in palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression is unknown. In this study, we show that palmitate decreases glucose-stimulated preproinsulin mRNA levels in isolated rat islets, an effect that is not mediated by changes in preproinsulin mRNA stability, but is associated with inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin promoter activity. Prolonged culture of isolated islets with palmitate is associated with increased levels of intracellular ceramide. Palmitate-induced ceramide generation is prevented by inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis. Further, exogenous ceramide inhibits insulin mRNA levels, whereas blockade of de novo ceramide synthesis prevents palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression. We conclude that prolonged exposure to elevated levels of palmitate affects glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression via transcriptional mechanisms and ceramide synthesis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is often accompanied by abnormalities in lipid metabolism, and excessive circulating lipid levels have been suggested to contribute, in conjunction with chronic hyperglycemia, to the progressive deterioration of beta cell function in this disease (1McGarry J.D.

The adverse effects of chronic fatty acids on beta cell function are dependent upon the presence of elevated glucose levels (reviewed in Ref. 3Poitout V. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2002; 9: 152-159Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis, initially proposed by Prentki and Corkey (8Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), is that in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose, fatty acids are readily oxidized in the mitochondria. In contrast, when glucose and fatty acid levels are simultaneously elevated, glucose inhibits fatty acid oxidation, which results in cytosolic accumulation of long-chain fatty-acyl coenzyme A (LC-CoA) and complex lipid synthesis (5Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Indeed, cytosolic LC-CoA can be esterified into phospholipids and triglycerides (TG), or, in the case of palmitate, serve as precursor for ceramide synthesis. The lipid species responsible for the deleterious effects of fatty acids on beta cell function are unknown. It has been initially proposed that intracellular accumulation of TG might play an important role, because the occurrence of diabetes in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat is associated with a dramatic increase in islet TG content (11Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 12Lee Y.H.H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that forcing TG accumulation in isolated islets by overexpressing the TG synthesizing-enzyme diacylglycerol-acyltransferase-1 impairs insulin secretion, but does not affect preproinsulin mRNA levels (13Kelpe C.L. Johnson L.M. Poitout V. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3326-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that TG accumulation is associated with, but not causally related to, decreased insulin gene expression. On the other hand, intracellular ceramide accumulation has been implicated in fatty acid-induced apoptosis in ZDF rat islets (14Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 15Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Zhou Y.T. Wang M.Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32487-32490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, de novo ceramide formation is increased in islets from ZDF rats (14Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), and fatty acid-induced apoptosis is blocked by inhibitors of ceramide synthesis (15Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Zhou Y.T. Wang M.Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32487-32490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of ceramide synthesis in the effects of palmitate on the insulin gene has not yet been examined. This study was therefore aimed to determine, in primary rat islets, 1) whether palmitate affects preproinsulin mRNA stability and/or insulin promoter activity, and 2) whether ceramide synthesis is implicated in palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression. Reagents—[α-32P]UTP and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. Propidium iodide (PI) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Interleukin-1β (IL-1) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). C18-ceramide was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). C2-ceramide and fumonisin B1 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Collagenase, actinomycin D, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase, palmitic acid (sodium salt), fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), l-cycloserine, myriocin, and all other reagents (analytical grade) were from Sigma. Silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). Animals—Six-week-old male Wistar rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water and standard laboratory chow. All procedures using animals were approved by the Pacific Northwest Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat Islet Isolation and Culture—Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described (5Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After an overnight culture in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 11.1 mm glucose, islets were resuspended in fresh media and incubated in various experimental conditions as described under “Results.” Preparation of culture media containing palmitate was as described (5Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The total palmitate concentration ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mm, and the final fatty acid-free BSA concentration was 0.1 mm. Therefore, the molar ratio of palmitate/BSA ranged from 1:1 to 5:1. All control conditions contained the same amount of BSA and vehicle (EtOH/H2O, 1:1, v/v) as those with palmitate. PI Staining and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis— Batches of 100 islets each were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 300 μl of 0.25% trypsin/1 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C followed by gentle mechanical dispersion through a 1-ml pipette tip. The reaction was stopped by addition 700 μl of cold PBS, and islet cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. PI was added to a final concentration of 6 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min. Single-cell populations, defined based on size on a forward versus size scatter, were analyzed for PI exclusion using a Coulter EpicsXL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)—RPAs were carried out using the Direct Protect Lysate RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, batches of 100 cultured islets were washed twice in Hank's balanced salt solution, resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (provided in the kit), and sonicated 4 × 1 s at low power. [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense probes were transcribed from a T7 promoter to a 360-bp sequence for the rat II preproinsulin gene cloned into a pBLUEscript plasmid (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). Control probes were made to a 316-bp conserved sequence of mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Ambion) and a 245-bp sequence of mouse β-actin (Ambion). Probes were hybridized directly in the lysate overnight at 42 °C. The lysate was then treated as directed by the manufacturer, and protected fragments were resolved by 5% denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. The probes were determined to be in excess for each experiment. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses and Transient Transfections—A 298-bp fragment of the rat I insulin promoter (corresponding to bases –310 to –12 relative to the transcription start site) was used to drive transcription of an RNA carrying the untranslated regions of the rat preproinsulin II mRNA and encoding firefly luciferase. This construct was subcloned into pShuttle (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) and used to construct a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-RIP1-Luc) as described (13Kelpe C.L. Johnson L.M. Poitout V. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3326-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A control adenovirus encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Ad-CMV-Luc) was used as a control (16Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Lingohr M.K. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Duplicate batches of 100 islets each were infected overnight with 107 plaque-forming units per islet of Ad-RIP1-Luc or Ad-CMV-Luc in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 11.1 mm glucose. Islets were then cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.8 mm glucose for 8 h, to lower RIP1 activity to basal values. Islets were then transferred to fresh RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA and various glucose and palmitate concentrations for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured in islet extracts using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with a rabbit anti-firefly luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA) and a guinea pig anti-bovine insulin antibody (Sigma; 1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C in 5% BSA in PBS. After washing in PBS, islets were incubated with a Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin (both from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA; 1:300 dilution) for1hat room temperature in 5% BSA in PBS. After washing, islets were mounted on slides and examined with a Fluoview 500 Olympus confocal microscope. Determination of Ceramide Content—Batches of 100 islets each were washed in ice-cold PBS and lipids were extracted by chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Extracted lipids were dried under N2, and ceramide content was measured by the DAG kinase assay and TLC analysis as originally described by Preiss et al. (17Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and optimized for ceramide determination (18Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Major C.D. Gao Z.Y. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1372-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dried lipids were solubilized in 20 μl of detergent solution (7.5% n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside/5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (DETAPAC)). After adding 50 μl of assay buffer (120 mm HEPES/100 mm LiCl/25 mm MgCl2/2 mm EGTA), 10 μl of 20 mm dithiothreitol and 10 μl of 1:1 diluted DAG kinase/enzyme diluent (1 mm DETAPAC/10 mm imidazole), the reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 10 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity: 80 mCi/mmol) prepared in 100 mm imidazole/1 mm DETAPAC. After mixing, the reaction was continued for 30 min at 30 °C. Lipids were extracted again and dried under N2. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform, spotted onto TLC plates, and developed with chloroform/methanol/acetone (65:15:5, v/v/v). The radioactive spot corresponding to ceramide-1-phosphate was identified using autoradiography, scraped, and quantified by scintillation counting. Ceramide standards were run on each plate. Linear responses were obtained between 0 and 2500 pmol. Expression of Data and Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Intergroup comparisons were performed by Student's paired t test or analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnet t test, where appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effects of Palmitate on Cell Viability—To exclude the potential contribution of cell death to the effects of palmitate on insulin gene expression in our experimental conditions, we first verified cell viability after 3 days of culture in the presence of 0.5 mm palmitate or 10 ng/ml IL-1 as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1, the percentage of PI-positive cells was 17.4 ± 3.1 and 17.8 ± 3.5% after culture in 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose, respectively (n = 6, not significant (NS)). The presence of 0.5 mm palmitate and 16.7 mm glucose did not affect the number of PI-positive cells (19.1 ± 5.2 versus 17.8 ± 3.5%, n = 6, NS). As expected, IL-1 significantly increased the number of PI-positive cells (46.0 ± 8.6 versus 17.8 ± 3.5%, n = 6, p < 0.005). Palmitate Decreases Preproinsulin mRNA Levels—Previously (4Jacqueminet S. Briaud I. Rouault C. Reach G. Poitout V. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 532-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we have shown that a 72-h exposure of isolated rat islets to 0.5 mm palmitate does not affect preproinsulin mRNA levels in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose but significantly decreases it in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose. Batches of 100 isolated islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 with either 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose plus 0, 0.3, or 0.5 mm palmitate (fatty-acid-to-BSA ratio of 0, 3:1, and 5:1, respectively) for 72 h. Steady-state levels of preproinsulin mRNA were measured by RPA (Fig. 2). GAPDH mRNA was measured as a control for loading variations between lanes, and the results are expressed as the ratio of preproinsulin/GAPDH mRNA. As expected, the presence of high glucose led to a significant increase in preproinsulin mRNA levels (3.6 ± 0.6-fold increase, n = 5, p < 0.05). At the concentration of 0.5 mm, palmitate decreased preproinsulin mRNA levels to 29.2 ± 5.8% (n = 5, p < 0.0001) of control values. Palmitate Does Not Affect Preproinsulin mRNA Stability— Because steady-state mRNA levels are the product of the rate of mRNA synthesis versus the rate of mRNA decay, palmitate inhibition of preproinsulin mRNA levels could be due to decreased transcription, decreased mRNA stability, or both. To determine the effects of palmitate on preproinsulin mRNA stability, we measured preproinsulin and GAPDH mRNA levels 0, 6, 12, 24, 30, and 36 h after addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm palmitate. The half-life of preproinsulin and GAPDH mRNA was estimated from the slope of the best-fit curve of mRNA level (expressed in percent of time 0) as a function of time (Fig. 3). As expected, glucose significantly increased the half-life of preproinsulin mRNA from 27.7 ± 1.5 h at 2.8 mm to 40.8 ± 3.0 h at 16.7 mm (n = 3, p < 0.05). In contrast, the presence of 0.5 mm palmitate did not affect preproinsulin mRNA stability, either at 2.8 (27.2 ± 3.1 versus 27.7 ± 1.5 h, n = 3, NS) or 16.7 (39.0 ± 2.0 versus 40.8 ± 3.0 h, n = 3, NS) mm glucose. Neither glucose nor palmitate had an effect on GAPDH mRNA half-life (not shown). These results suggested that fatty acid inhibition of preproinsulin mRNA is not due to changes in mRNA half-life, and prompted us to investigate insulin promoter activity. Palmitate Decreases Glucose-stimulated Rat Insulin Promoter Activity—As shown in Fig. 4, luciferase immunoreactivity was detected in the vast majority of islet cells after infection with Ad-CMV-Luc (panels A–C) or Ad-RIP1-Luc (panels D–F). Glucose increased RIP1-Luc activity in a dose-dependent manner (ANOVA, n = 2–7 replicates for each glucose concentration, p < 0.0005; Fig. 5A). RIP1-Luc activity was 7.8 ± 1.4-fold higher at 16.7 mm glucose than at 2.8 mm glucose (n = 7, p < 0.0001; Fig. 5A). CMV-Luc activity was also slightly augmented by glucose, although this effect was not statistically significant (ANOVA, n = 2–7 replicates for each glucose concentration, NS; Fig. 5A). The ratio of RIP1-Luc over CMV-Luc was 3.8 ± 0.5-fold higher at 16.7 mm glucose than at 2.8 mm glucose (n = 7, p < 0.0001). The stimulation of RIP1-Luc activity by glucose was not due to a nonspecific osmolar effect, because an equivalent concentration of mannitol was ineffective (not shown). The response of the RIP1-Luc reporter to glucose was then tested in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm palmitate (Fig. 5B). The presence of palmitate did not affect basal RIP1-Luc activity at 2.8 mm glucose (94.3 ± 16.7% of the control without palmitate, n = 3, NS), but markedly blunted the response to glucose, which was no longer statistically significant (ANOVA, n = 3, NS). Palmitate decreased RIP1-Luc activity stimulated by 16.7 mm glucose in a dose-dependent manner (ANOVA, n = 4, p < 0.005; Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Glucose stimulation of rat insulin promoter activity is inhibited by palmitate in primary islets. Islets were infected with Ad-CMV-Luc or Ad-RIP1-Luc as described in Fig. 4, and cultured in 2.8 mm glucose for 8 h before being exposed to various culture conditions. A, islets were exposed to increasing glucose concentrations for 24 h, and RIP1-Luc (closed squares) and CMV-Luc (open squares) activities were measured. Results are expressed as relative light units (RLU) normalized to basal expression, set at 100%, and are mean ± S.E. of 2–7 replicate experiments for each glucose concentration. B, islets were exposed to increasing glucose concentrations for 24h in the absence (open squares) or presence (closed squares) of 0.5 mm palmitate. Results are expressed as the ratio of RIP1-Luc/CMV-Luc activity normalized to basal values in the absence of palmitate set at 100%, and are mean ± S.E. of 3 replicate experiments. C, islets were exposed to 2.8 (closed squares) or 16.7 mm glucose and increasing concentrations of palmitate (open squares) for 24 h. Results are expressed as the ratio of RIP1-Luc/CMV-Luc activity, and are mean ± S.E. of 4 replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Palmitate Increases Ceramide Content in Isolated Islets— Palmitate is a substrate for de novo ceramide synthesis, which involves condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with l-serine by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Culture of ZDF rat islets in the presence of fatty acids results in increased ceramide generation via de novo synthesis (14Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 15Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Zhou Y.T. Wang M.Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32487-32490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Whether prolonged exposure of islets from normal animals to palmitate is associated with increased ceramide content has not been directly assessed. Here we show that the presence of 16.7 mm glucose without palmitate did not increase ceramide content (0.89 ± 0.26 versus 0.89 ± 0.30 pmol/islet, n = 6, NS; Fig. 6A), but that palmitate increased ceramide levels (ANOVA, p < 0.05; Fig. 6, A and B). At the fatty-acid concentration of 0.5 mm, ceramide content was increased to 417 ± 117% of control values by palmitate (n = 7, p < 0.005; Fig. 6B). Addition of the inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis fumonisin B1 (which inhibits ceramide synthase; 50 μm) and myriocin (which inhibits serinepalmitoyl transferase; 50 nm) (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) to the culture medium significantly inhibited ceramide generation induced by palmitate (both n = 7, NS from control in the absence of palmitate, Fig. 6, C and D). This suggests that palmitate induces ceramide generation at least in part via de novo synthesis. Inhibition of de Novo Ceramide Synthesis Prevents Palmitate Impairment of Insulin Gene Expression—First, we observed that exposure of islets for 72 h to the cell-permeable analogue C2-ceramide decreased preproinsulin mRNA levels (Fig. 7A). We then sought to ascertain whether inhibition of de novo ceramide formation could prevent the decrease in preproinsulin mRNA levels observed after culture with palmitate. Preproinsulin mRNA levels were measured after culture for 72 h in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose and 0.5 mm palmitate with or without 50 nm myriocin, 50 μm fumonisin B1, or 2 mm lcycloserine (an serine-palmitoyl transferase inhibitor). Fig. 7, B and C, show representative experiments with the three inhibitors. Both fumonisin B1 (Fig. 7B) and l-cycloserine (Fig. 7C) partially prevented palmitate inhibition of preproinsulin mRNA levels. Myriocin was the most potent inhibitor and completely prevented the decrease in preproinsulin mRNA levels induced by palmitate (Fig. 7, B and D). The aims of this study were to assess whether palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression is transcriptional or post-transcriptional, and to evaluate the role of ceramide synthesis as a mechanism of these effects. Our results demonstrate for the first time that palmitate inhibits preproinsulin mRNA levels in isolated rat islets after 72 h of exposure by a mechanism that involves decreased insulin promoter activity without apparent changes in preproinsulin mRNA stability. Inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis prevents both the increase in ceramide content and the decrease in preproinsulin mRNA levels in islets, demonstrating that ceramide synthesis is a mechanism for palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression. Importantly, palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression (Fig. 2) is not merely due to fatty acid-induced cell death, because the number of PI-positive cells after 72 h of exposure was unchanged (Fig. 1). The lack of effect of palmitate on cell viability appears in conflict with previous studies in rat islet cells (21Cnop M. Hannaert J.C. Hoorens A. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) used purified rat beta cells, which might be more susceptible to the effects of palmitate, and Maedler et al. (22Maedler K. Spinas G.A. Dyntar D. Moritz W. Kaiser N. Donath M.Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) investigated the effect of palmitate after 4 days of exposure. In our study, the rationale for assessing the effects of palmitate on PI staining was not to fully investigate palmitate-induced apoptosis, but only to exclude, under our culture conditions, effects on cell viability that could have accounted for the observed decrease in preproinsulin mRNA levels. The effect of palmitate on preproinsulin mRNA is consistent with previous studies by us (4Jacqueminet S. Briaud I. Rouault C. Reach G. Poitout V.

https://openalex.org/W2129537774,"C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins are cytokine-like polypeptides generated during complement (C) system activation and released at the inflammatory site. They exert several biological activities through binding to the G-protein-coupled receptors C3aR and C5aR, respectively. Cloning and Northern blot experiments have indicated that both receptors are expressed by myeloid as well as nonmyeloid cells (e.g., endothelial and epithelial cells). To better understand the roles of C anaphylatoxins during inflammation, we investigated their effects on the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes by cultured human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC constitutively expressed both anaphylatoxin receptors, and addition of physiological concentrations of C3a or C5a (nM range) caused a strong up-regulation of IL-8, IL-1beta, and RANTES mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, a decrease in IL-6 mRNA was observed, but only with C5a stimulation. These variations in mRNA levels were inhibited by pretreatment with anti-C5aR and anti-C3aR antibodies as well as pertussis toxin, indicating that G-proteins are involved in anaphylatoxin-activated signal transduction pathways. Finally, we showed that C3a and C5a both strongly activate downstream MAP kinase signaling pathways (p44 and p42 Erk kinases)."

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are able to activate Gq/G11 and G12/G13 are major upstream regulators of RhoA activity, and G12/G13 have been shown to couple GPCRs to the activation of Rho by regulating the activity of a subfamily of RhoGEF proteins. However, the possible contribution of Gq/G11 to the regulation of RhoA activity via GPCRs is controversial. We have used a genetic approach to study the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the activation of RhoA via endogenous GPCRs. In pertussis toxin-treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient as well as in Gαq/Gα11-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which coupling of receptors is restricted to Gq/G11 and G12/G13, respectively, receptor activation results in Rho activation. Rho activation induced by receptor agonists via Gq/G11 occurs with lower potency than Rho activation via G12/G13. Activation of RhoA via Gq/G11 is not affected by the phospholipase-C blocker U73122 or the Ca2+-chelator BAPTA, but can be blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of the RhoGEF protein LARG. Our data clearly show that G12/G13 as well as Gq/G11 alone can couple GPCRs to the rapid activation of RhoA.

Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation occurs independently of phospholipase C-β and appears to involve LARG. The small GTPase RhoA plays a central role in the organization of the cellular actin cytoskeleton through its ability to stimulate the formation of actomyosin-based structures and to regulate their contractility (1Etienne-Manneville S Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA has also been involved in various other cellular processes like the regulation of microtubule dynamics or transcriptional activity (1Etienne-Manneville S Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Analogous to other regulatory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins Rho functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. In the active state RhoA relays extracellular signals to a number of downstream effectors. These include protein kinases like Rho kinase or citron kinase, lipid kinases like phospholipase D, or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase as well as non-kinase proteins like rhothekin, rhophilin, or diaphanous (3Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RhoA is activated through various receptors including those coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (4Kjøller L.

Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). One of the best described cellular paradigms for GPCR-mediated RhoA activation is the RhoA-dependent actin stress fiber formation in fibroblasts activated by various GPCR agonists like lysophosphatidic acid or thrombin. However, a GPCR/Rho-mediated regulation of actin-based structures has also been shown to occur in many other eukaryotic cells. For instance, in neuronal cells activation of Rho through lysophosphatidic acid or thrombin receptors leads to the formation of contractile actomyosin filaments thereby inducing neurite retraction and cell rounding (7Jalink K. van Corven E.J.

In vascular smooth muscle cells, the Rho-mediated pathway has been shown to contribute to the vasoconstrictor-induced actomyosin-based cell contraction (9Fukata Y. Amano M. Kaibuchi K.

Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is well established that G-proteins of the G12-family, G12 and G13, can couple GPCRs to the activation of RhoA. Constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 have been shown to induce actin stress fiber formation as well as other RhoA-dependent cellular effects (Ref. 12Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N.

Recent studies in reconstituted or co-transfected systems have demonstrated that a group of RhoGEF proteins, consisting of p115 RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, interact with Gα12 and Gα13 through their RGS domains, thereby stimulating RhoA activity (13Hart M.J.

It has been a controversial issue, whether Gq/G11-mediated signaling contributes to the activation of RhoA via GPCRs. While various reports show Rho-dependent effects of constitutively active Gαq mutants (Refs. 8Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol.

The recent development of methods for the precipitation of the activated form of RhoA from cell lysates allowed to directly determine the effects of different G-protein α-subunits on Rho activity. It could be confirmed that constitutively active mutants of Gα12/Gα13 can induce RhoA activation (19Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol.

However, again, conflicting data exist with regard to the potential role of Gq/G11 in GPCR-mediated RhoA activation. In NIH3T3 and HEK293T cells, expression of constitutively active Gαq-family members results in an increased level of active RhoA (21Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

To study the role of different G-proteins under more physiological conditions we used Gαq/Gα11- and Gα12/Gα13-double deficient embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to determine their role in the activation of Rho via endogenous receptors. Our data clearly show that Gq/G11 can couple GPCRs to the rapid activation of RhoA. This process occurs in a phospholipase C-β-independent manner and appears to involve the RhoGEF protein LARG. Reagents—Thrombin (T3399), LPA (L7260), bradykinin (B3259), and U73122 were from Sigma-Aldrich (Dreieich, Germany). Pertussis toxin, BAPTA/AM, and Fura-2/AM were purchased from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). Plasmids—HA-ΔDH/PH-LARG lacking the DH and the PH domain was generated by EcoNI and EcoRI digestion of full-length LARG and in-frame re-ligation using MungBean-nuclease and T4-DNA polymerase. Deletion was confirmed by sequencing (Li-cor 4200, Li-cor, Inc.). The modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany), the ligase was obtained from Takara (Verviers, Belgium). Cell Lines and Transfection—MEF cell lines were generated as described (25Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Serum starvation and pertussis toxin treatment were done for 24 h. Western Blot Analysis—Lysates of MEFs were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by chemiluminescence detection using sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany) coupled to horseradish peroxidase and were visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal antibodies against RhoA (26C4) or c-Myc (9E10) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Gα13 (A-20) and Gαq/11 (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, USA). Anti-Gα12 rabbit polyclonal antibody was described previously (26Kuner R. Swiercz J.M. Zywietz A. Tappe A. Offermanns S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Monoclonal HA antibody was obtained from Covance Research Products. Antibodies raised in rabbit against p115-RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG were described previously (26Kuner R. Swiercz J.M. Zywietz A. Tappe A. Offermanns S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Cytoplasmatic RNA from MEFs was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Midi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cytoplasmatic RNA was reversely transcribed using oligo-dT primers and the SuperScript™ II System from Invitrogen. PCR was performed with specific primers hybridizing to specific regions of cDNAs of various G-protein-coupled receptors, which if possible were encoded by different exons using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The following primers were used: 5′-TCCACCGGCCCATGTACTATTTCA-3′ and 5′-CTGCGACTGGCCTTGGAGATGTT-3′ (S1P1); 5′-GCAGCTGCCTCTACTTCC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGCCGGTTGCTCATTC-3′ (LPA1); 5′-GCTGGAACTGCCTGGAGAACTTT-3′ and 5′-TGACTAGACAGCCGCACACCAA-3′ (S1P2); 5′-GGCGCCCCAAAGATGTG-3′ and 5′-GTAGCAACCCCAGACCCAGTG-3′ (LPA2); 5′-GCCTCGGCCTTCATCATCATCTTG-3′ and 5′-GCGTGGCTGGAGCGGACTACA-3′ (S1P3); 5′-CATGGTGCGGGTGGCTGAGAGT-3′ and 5′-CACGGCTGCGGAAGGAGTAGATGA-3′ (S1P4); 5′-GCAACACAGACACAGCGG-ACGAGT-3′ and 5′-GGCCCACACCAGCAGAATGAGC-3′ (LPA3); 5′-GGGGACCGCTGTTTCTCTTGCTAT-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCCGTCGCTGGCTATTT-3′ (S1P5); 5′-GACGGCAAGCCCAAGTGACCTG-3′ and 5′-AAGAGCCGGCCTGCAAAGACATAA-3′ (B1); 5′-TCTGGGGCTGTACACTGCTTCTGA-3′ and 5′-GTTGAGGCCGCTGTTGCTGTAGG-3′ (B2); 5′-GCCCCGGCGCTTGCTGAT-3′ and 5′-CACGGCCGGCTTCTTGACCTT-3′ (PAR1); 5′-CTTCTGGCGGCCTCGGTCTCCTG-3′ and 5′-GTTT-GCCTTCTTCCTGGGGTGTCC-3′ (PAR2); 5′-ATGGAGCTGAGGGGAATCTACG-3′ and 5′-GTGACCTCGCCAAATACCCAGTT-3′ (PAR3); 5′-GACCCCCAGCATCTACGA-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCAGCAGCAACAC-3′ (PAR4). Measurement of Intracellular [Ca2 + ]—For fluorescence-based imaging of [Ca2+] cells were cultured on glass coverslips. MEFs were loaded for 30 min with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Calbiochem) in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 135 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were analyzed on a monochromator-equipped (Polychrome IV, TILL-Photonics, Germany) inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The fluorescence was recorded with a 12-bit CCD camera (IMAGO, TILL-Photonics) and TILLvision v4.0 software. Fura-2 fluorescence was excited at 340, 358, and 380 nm and filtered through a Fura-2 corresponding long-pass filter, and the 340/380 fluorescence ratio determined. After subtraction of background signals, the 340/380 fluorescence ratio was determined as described (27Schaefer, M., Plant, T. D., Obukhov, A. G., Hofmann, T., Gudermann, T., and Schultz, G. J. Biol. Chem., 275, 17517–17526Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained as described previously (28Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J.,. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions were: monoclonal anti-HA (Covance Reasearch Products) 1:200, BODIPY FL phallacidin (B-607, Molecular Probes; Eugene) 1:150, TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) 1:400. Images were generated using a fluorescence microscope (Leica) and a cooled CCD camera (Leica). Rho Pull-down Assay—Activation of Rho was determined by a modified method described by Ren and Schwartz (29Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). MEF cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes and were either transfected with Myc-tagged RhoA and indicated plasmids or left untransfected for assessment of endogenous GTP-Rho. After serum starvation and pertussis toxin treatment for 24 h, cells were stimulated with different agonists and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated for 45 min with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with GST proteins fused to the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin (29Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Beads were washed four times with 600 μl of ice-cold Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were collected by the addition of Laemmli buffer and subsequently analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Endogenous RhoA and transfected Myc-RhoA was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (26C4) and anti-Myc antibody (9E10), respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were generated from wild-type embryos as well as from embryos double deficient for Gαq/Gα11 and Gα12/Gα13 (30Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I.

Western blot analysis of lysates from these cell lines confirmed the absence of Gαq/Gα11 and Gα12/Gα13 in respective cells (Fig. 1A). We then determined, whether the different MEF cell lines express receptors for various ligands, which have been shown to induce the activation of Gq/G11 as well as G12/G13, like the lysophospholipids lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), bradykinin, or proteases like thrombin (Fig. 1B). By using RT-PCR, we found that wild type as well as Gαq/Gα11- and Gα12/Gα13-deficient MEFs express receptors for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3), LPA (LPA1 and LPA2), bradykinin (B2) as well as for thrombin (PAR-1). No expression was found for S1P4, S1P5, or LPA3 receptors as well as PAR-2, –3 or –4 receptors. S1P2 and S1P3 receptors have been shown to couple to G12/G13, Gq/G11, as well as to Gi-type G-proteins (32Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Similarly, the thrombin receptor PAR-1 has also been shown to couple to all three G-protein families (11Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 34Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

Notably, the pattern of expressed receptors did not differ between all three cell lines indicating that they are well suited for a comparative analysis of receptor-mediated effects. In further experiments we used LPA, bradykinin and thrombin to stimulate cells through their endogenous receptors. To study the role of Gq/G11 and G12/G13 in GPCR-induced Rho activation, we restricted coupling of receptors to these two G-protein families by pretreating cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), which uncouples receptors from Gi-type G-proteins. Fig. 2C shows that PTX treatment completely ADP-ribosylated α-subunits of Gi in Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells under the used experimental conditions. As expected, none of the stimuli was able to induce Ca2+ transients in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells whereas Ca2+ transients were induced in wild-type and Gα12/ Gα13-deficient cells (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In pertussis toxin-treated Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, in which coupling of receptors is restricted to G12/G13, thrombin, and LPA resulted in an activation of RhoA (Fig. 2B). This confirms that G12/G13 are able to mediate receptor-dependent RhoA activation independently of any signaling via Gq/G11. Bradykinin, which induced Rho activation in PTX-treated wild-type cells had no effect on Rho activity in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, suggesting that the bradykinin B2 receptor is not coupled to G12/G13, but may induce Rho activation through Gq/G11 (Fig. 2B). To test the potential ability of Gq/G11 to mediate receptor-dependent Rho activation more directly, we tested the effect of thrombin, LPA, and bradykinin on RhoA activation in PTX-pretreated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells, in which coupling of receptors is restricted to Gq/G11. All three receptor agonists were still able to activate RhoA through Gq/G11 (Fig. 2B). Next we assessed whether Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation requires a functional phospholipase C-β or increases in intracellular free [Ca2+]. Receptor-mediated Rho activation in PTX-treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells was not inhibited by the phospholipase C-β inhibitor U73122 or the Ca2+-chelator BAPTA, although both agents completely blocked receptor-mediated induction of Ca2+ transients in the same cells (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that GPCRs can mediate RhoA activation via Gq/G11 in a phospholipase C-β-independent manner. To further characterize G12/G13- and Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation through GPCRs, we determined concentration-response relationships for thrombin-induced RhoA activation in PTX-treated wild-type, Gαq/Gα11-, and Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Thrombin-induced RhoA activation in PTX-treated wild-type cells and in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells with half-maximal and maximal concentrations of 10–4–10–3 and 10–2 units/ml, respectively. However, when G-protein coupling was restricted to Gq/G11 in PTX-treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells, thrombin was considerably less potent, and maximal RhoA activation was observed only at thrombin concentrations of 1 unit/ml. While both G12/G13 and Gq/G11 can mediate RhoA activation, receptor-dependent activation through Gq/G11 requires agonist concentrations about two orders of magnitude higher than activation through G12/G13. The fact that RhoA activation via Gq/G11 occurred independently of phospholipase C-β prompted us to consider the involvement of RGS domain-containing RhoGEF proteins, which have been suggested to directly link G12/G13 to Rho activation. Of the three members of this subgroup of RhoGEF proteins, p115 RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, we found only LARG to be expressed in MEFs (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the much wider expression pattern of LARG compared with p115RhoGEF and PDZ-RhoGEF, which are mainly found in hematopoietic and neuronal cells, respectively (26Kuner R. Swiercz J.M. Zywietz A. Tappe A. Offermanns S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Aasheim H.C. Pedeutour F. Smeland E.B.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To test the potential role of LARG in Gq/G11-mediated Rho activation, we constructed a mutant of LARG lacking the DH and PH domains required for its RhoGEF activity (Fig. 5B). Expression of (ΔDH/PH)-LARG in PTX-treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells efficiently blocked rapid actin stress fiber formation induced by LPA (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, expression of ΔDH/PH-LARG also dramatically reduced the cellular F-actin content in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (Fig. 5C). Similarly, ΔDH/PH-LARG was found to block activation of Myc-tagged RhoA in response to thrombin and LPA in PTX-treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that LARG is critically involved in the phospholipase C-β-independent RhoA activation via Gq/G11. Many GPCRs have been shown to be able to mediate the activation of the small GTPase RhoA (6Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 15Fukuhara S. Chikum i H. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA via GPCRs is involved in a variety of functions like regulation of cell movement, cell shape, and cell growth. Receptors that stimulate RhoA activity couple to G12/G13, Gq/G11, and Gi-type G-proteins. The fact that Rho activation through GPCRs is not affected by PTX and since receptors coupling only to Gi-type G-proteins are unable to stimulate Rho activity suggests that Gi is unlikely to be directly involved in RhoA activation via GPCRs (5Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has been difficult to evaluate the relative roles of G12/G13 and Gq/G11 in receptor-mediated Rho activation since there are currently no specific inhibitors of these G-protein subtypes available. Multiple evidence has accumulated that G12 and G13 can mediate the activation of RhoA, and the recently described RhoGEF proteins, p115-RhoGEF, LARG, and PDZ-RhoGEF have been shown to link G12/G13 to RhoA activation (13Hart M.J.

However, it is not clear whether Gq/G11 are indeed directly involved in the rapid receptor-mediated RhoA activation by extracellular signals. Studies in platelets lacking Gαq/Gα11 demonstrated that receptor-mediated RhoA activation does not necessarily depend on activation of Gq/G11 (39Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sagi et al. (24Sagi S.A. Seasholtz T.M. Kobiashvili M. Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that a constitutively active mutant of Gαq was unable to induce RhoA activation. In contrast, several recent reports clearly show that transient transfection of constitutively active mutants of Gαq in NIH3T3 cells or in HEK293T cells results in elevated levels of active RhoA (21Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Dutt P. Kjolle L. Giel M. Hall A. Toksoz D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since these studies rely on the effects of transfected constitutively active mutants of Gαq family members, they do not necessarily prove a direct involvement of Gq proteins in RhoA activation exerted by extracellular signals via receptors. We therefore chose a genetic approach to study the activation of RhoA through endogenous receptors in PTX-treated MEFs lacking either Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13. In these cells, receptor coupling is restricted to G12/G13 and Gq/G11, respectively. Our data confirm that RhoA activation is potently induced through G12/G13. More importantly however, they provide genetic evidence that Gq/G11 proteins can also mediate the rapid RhoA activation via endogenously expressed GPCRs. Interestingly, we observed a clear difference in the potencies by which thrombin induced RhoA activation via G12/G13 and Gq/G11. Rho activation through Gq/G11 required agonist concentrations about two orders of magnitude higher than Rho activation via G12/G13. The observed potency difference for ligand-induced Rho activation could be due to different efficiencies by which the activated receptor couples to different G-protein subfamilies. For example, the thromboxane A2 receptor, which couples to G12/G13 and Gq/G11 has been shown to preferentially activate G12/G13 in platelets (35Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this is a general feature of Gq/G11- and G12/G13-coupled receptors. Alternatively it is conceivable that RhoGEF proteins are less sensitive to regulation via Gαq/Gα11 than through Gα12/Gα13. While it is well established that G12/G13-mediated RhoA activation involves RhoGEF proteins like PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115-RhoGEF, the mechanism of Gq/G11-mediated Rho activation is less clear. We could not observe any effects of Ca2+-chelators or of the phospholipase C-β inhibitor U73122 on Gq/G11-mediated Rho activation (see Fig. 3A), indicating that Gq/G11 mediates Rho activation in a manner independent of β-isoforms of PLC. This is consistent with data showing that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is not able to promote RhoA activation and that inhibition of PKC does not interfere with Rho activation by an active mutant of Gαq (23Chikumi H. Vazquez Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). If PLC is not involved in Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation, it is tempting to speculate that Gq/G11 may activate RhoA by a mechanism analogous to G12/G13. Interestingly, recent data suggest that the RGS domain of LARG but not of p115 RhoGEF can interact with Gαq when complexed with AlF4- to mimic the transition state of GTP hydrolysis (21Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, the constitutively active mutant of Gαq (Q229L) did not show a considerable interaction with the RGS domains or the full-length versions of LARG, PDZ-RhoGEF, or p115RhoGEF (23Chikumi H.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, mutants of PDZ-RhoGEF and p115RhoGEF which lack the N-terminal region including the RGS domain were able to interact with Gαq(Q229L) (23Chikumi H. Vazquez Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In functional experiments, it was shown that expression of full-length LARG but not of a LARG mutant, which lacks the PDZ and RGS domain, enhances RhoA activation by constitutively active Gαq (21Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggesting that an interaction of the RGS domain with Gαq is involved in RhoA activation. However, expression of the RGS domains of LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF did not interfere with Gαq(Q229L)-induced serum response element (SRE) activation, an effect, which is mediated by Rho (23Chikumi H. Vazquez Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, while there is some evidence that active Gαq can interact with LARG and other RGS domain containing RhoGEF proteins, the exact mode of this interaction still remains elusive. In our study, we used a LARG mutant that lacks the RhoGEF domain (ΔDH/PH-LARG) to study the potential involvement of LARG in receptor-mediated, Gq/G11-dependent RhoA activation. Expression of ΔDH/PH-LARG blocked receptor-mediated RhoA activation as well as actin stress fiber formation in PTX treated Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells, suggesting that LARG is critically involved in Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation. Whether the mechanism of LARG-mediated Rho activation by Gq/G11 is identical to that by G12/G13 remains to be elucidated. In summary, based on a genetic model our data clearly demonstrate that both, G12/G13 and Gq/G11, can mediate the activation of RhoA via G-protein-coupled receptors. The Gq/G11-mediated Rho activation occurs independently of β-isoforms of phospholipase C and involves the RhoGEF protein LARG. We thank M. A. Caligiuri for providing the LARG cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1988417621,"T cells constitute a large population of cellular infiltrate in atopic/allergic inflammation and a dysregulated, Th2-biased peripheral immune response appears to be an important pathogenetic factor. In atopic dermatitis, circulating cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-bearing (CLA+) CD45RO+ T cells with skin-specific homing property represent an activated memory/effector T cell subset. They express high levels of Fas and Fas ligand and undergo activation-induced apoptosis. The freshly purified CLA+ CD45RO+ T cells of atopic individuals display distinct features of in vivo-triggered apoptosis such as pro-caspase degradation and active caspase-8 formation. In particular, the Th1 compartment of activated memory/effector T cells selectively undergoes activation-induced cell death, skewing the immune response toward surviving Th2 cells in atopic dermatitis patients. The apoptosis of circulating memory/effector T cells was confined to atopic individuals whereas non-atopic patients such as psoriasis, intrinsic-type asthma, contact dermatitis, intrinsic type of atopic dermatitis, bee venom allergic patients, and healthy controls showed no evidence for enhanced T cell apoptosis in vivo. These results define a novel mechanism for peripheral Th2 response in atopic diseases."

The present study was undertaken to determine the role of Src family kinases in STAT activation and SCCHN growth.

TGF-α induces intracellular signaling through stimulation of EGFR, which contains a cytoplasmic domain with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. In response to ligand, EGFRs dimerize and become phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues.

Potential mechanisms of STAT activation include activation of upstream receptor kinases (e.g. EGFR and PDGFR) and/or non-receptor kinases (e.g. Src and JAK). We have previously linked activation of STATs 3 and 5 to stimulation of EGFR in SCCHN cells. Targeting EGFR or STAT3 or STAT5 inhibited the growth of these cells in vitro (24Grandis J.R.

TGF-α stimulated activation of c-Src, Yes, Fyn, and Lyn in all cells tested, thus linking TGF-α/EGFR autocrine signaling to Src kinase activation in SCCHN cells. Either of two Src-selective inhibitors or transfection of a dominant-negative c-Src mutant inhibited growth and activation of STATs 3 and 5 activation in SCCHN cells. These findings implicate Src family kinases in EGFR-mediated STAT activation and suggest that strategies to interfere with Src may demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in these cancers. Cells—Cell lines derived from SCCHN patients were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Washington, D.

To generate recombinant baculoviruses and expression of proteins in Sf-9 insect cells, STAT3, STAT5a, or STAT5b cDNAs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vectors pVL1392 and pVL1393, respectively. The resulting constructs were used to make recombinant baculoviruses by co-transfection with BaculoGold DNA (BD Pharmingen) using the manufacturer's protocol. For protein expression, Sf-9 cells were grown to 50% confluence on 60-mm tissue culture plates and infected with recombinant baculoviruses for 1 h at 27 °C. The virus was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for 48 h prior to preparation of cytosolic extracts as described previously (33Nelson K.L. Rogers J.A. Bowman T.L. Jove R.

The EGFR-specific inhibitor (AG1478) was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). Transfection of SCCHN Cells with Dominant-negative c-Src—1483 cells were transfected with a pUSEamp vector (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) containing mutant Src (K296R/Y528F) cDNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stably transfected clones were selected for resistance to the neomycin analogue, G418 (Invitrogen). Dominant-negative Src was generated by mutation of Lys-296 to Arg, which rendered the kinase domain incapable of binding ATP. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Adherent cells (≥106) were grown in 10-cm plastic tissue culture dishes and harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. Nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSAs were performed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels as described previously (39Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

Briefly, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCI2,10mm KCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. After 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCI2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Nuclear proteins were liberated during a 30-min incubation on ice. The supernatant was clarified by a 10-min centrifuge (10,000 × g), and the extracts were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until used. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Probes were prepared by labeling double-stranded oligonucleotides (β-casein oligonucleotide, high affinity serum-inducible element duplex oligonucleotide, or STAT4 gel shift oligonucleotides) with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding was performed in a 20-ml volume with 200 pg of radiolabeled probe, 10 mg of protein, 5 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 100 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the products were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol and 0.5× TBE (22 mm Tris, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA). A 50-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was used as a cold competitor. For supershift studies, the nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with polyclonal antisera (200 ng) raised against STAT5a and STAT5b (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and STAT3 or STAT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) before addition of the probe (25Leong P.L.

Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to near confluence in 100-mm cultured dishes. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4,1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots from cleared lysates containing 50 mg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA). Phosphorylation of c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, and Lyn was determined by immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories, Inc.), followed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src, -c-Yes, -Fyn, and -Lyn antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylation of c-Src and Lyn was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Src and -Lyn antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine phosphorylation activation loop of these kinases (PY418, BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA). JAK-2 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific JAK2 antibody (Y1007 and Y1008) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and JAK-2 expression was determined using an antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Interaction of STAT5 with EGFR, c-Src, and STAT3 and interaction of STAT3 with EGFR, c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR, c-Src, and STAT3 monoclonal antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT5a, or STAT5b, or STAT3 antisera. Expression and Activation of Src Family Kinases in SCCHN by EGFR Ligand—Parallel activation of c-Src and EGFR and interaction between Src kinases and EGFR has been identified in several human cancers (41Tice D.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Src family kinases have not been previously examined in SCCHN. To determine the potential of EGFR ligand to induce activation of Src kinases in SCCHN cells, a series of SCCHN cell lines were serum-starved for 24 h followed by stimulation with recombinant TGF-α for 8 h and then immunoprecipitation with specific antisera against c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, or Lyn and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). As shown in Fig. 1A, TGF-α stimulated activation of c-Src, Yes, Fyn, and Lyn in all four SCCHN cell lines examined. A time course experiment demonstrated that 8 h of TGF-α was necessary under these conditions (Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, the timing of Src activation by TGF-α correlated with activation of STATs 3 and 5. These results implicate Src family kinases in a TGF-α/EGFR autocrine signaling pathway that characterizes many malignancies, including SCCHN. To determine if engagement of the EGFR is required for activation of Src family kinases, we examined the effects of an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor on Src activation. This EGFR-specific inhibitor has been previously reported not to directly inhibit Src activation (43Kitagawa D. Tanemura S. Ohata S. Shimizu N. Seo J. Nishitai G. Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity was associated with decreased c-Src phosphorylation, suggesting that EGFR activity is required for Src activation in SCCHN cells.Fig. 2EGFR engagement is necessary for Src activation. SCCHN cells (1483) were treated with increasing doses of an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG1478) followed 2 h later by immunoprecipitation with antisera against c-Src or EGFR and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) or c-Src antibody or c-Src antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Src Activation Levels Are Correlated with Constitutive Activation Levels of STATs 3 and 5—We previously reported that constitutive activation levels of STAT3 are correlated with EGFR expression levels in SCCHN cell lines (44Kijima T. Niwa H. Steinman R.A. Drenning S.D. Gooding W.E. Wentzel A.L. Xi S. Grandis J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 355-362PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if Src activation was linked to STAT activation, we determined levels of Src phosphorylation by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine phosphorylation activation loop of these Src family kinases (PY418). In the absence of phospho-specific antisera that can distinguish STAT5 isoforms, STAT5 activation was determined by EMSA and STAT3 activation was measured by immunoblotting with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. In all nine cell lines examined, Src activation levels were highly correlated with constitutive STAT5 activation levels (p < 0.0001, r = 0.989). Similarly, Src activation levels were also correlated with constitutive STAT3 activation levels in the same SCCHN cell lines (p = 0.0196, r = 0.833) (Fig. 3). To determine the specificity of Src and STAT activation correlations, we examined the potential association of STAT4 with Src kinase levels in SCCHN cells. EGFR inhibition does not abrogate STAT4 activation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, Src activation was not correlated with constitutive STAT4 activation levels in the same SCCHN cell lines (p = 0.9349, r = 0.001. These results suggest that Src activation is specifically linked to activation of STATs 3 and 5 in SCCHN cells. Interaction of c-Src with EGFR and STATs in SCCHN Cells—EGFR has been reported to associate with STATS 1, 3, and 5 in both normal and transformed epithelial cells (45Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine if EGFR and/or STATs interact with c-Src in SCCHN cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies and found that c-Src formed a complex with STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT3. Moreover, we found that EGFR also interacted with STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT3 suggesting a transmembrane complex involving EGFR, c-Src, and STATs 3 and 5 in SCCHN cells (Fig. 4). Although EGFR activation induces both STAT3 and STAT5 activation in SCCHN cells, we were unable to detect STAT3-STAT5 heterodimers (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm this observation in a defined expression system, the possibility of STAT3-STAT5 heterodimer formation was also tested in the Sf-9 cell overexpression system. STAT3 and STAT5a were expressed individually and together in the presence or absence of c-Src as an activating tyrosine kinase. STAT5a was then immunoprecipitated and tested for the presence of associated STAT3 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5C, STAT5a-3 heterodimers were not observed in this system, despite high level expression of the STAT proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of c-Src. This finding is consistent with the observation in SCCHN cells and suggests that STAT3 and STAT5 function independently in the EGFR/c-Src signaling pathway.Fig. 5Lack of heterodimerization of STAT3 and STAT5a/b. A, 1483 cells were lysed, and STAT3 and STAT5a proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5a (lanes 1 and 3) or anti-STAT3 (lanes 2 and 4) Abs, respectively. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 (lanes 1 and 2) or anti-STAT5a Abs (lanes 3 and 4). B, the same tumor cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5b (lanes 1 and 3) or anti-STAT3 (lanes 2 and 4) Abs, respectively. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 (lanes 1 and 2) or anti-STAT5b Abs (lanes 3 and 4). C, Sf-9 insect cells were infected with STAT3 (3), STAT5a (5a), and c-Src (Src) baculoviruses either individually or in the combinations shown at the top. Uninfected cells were included as a negative control (Con). STAT5a was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates and analyzed for associated STAT3 by immunoblotting. Panel a, recovery of immunoprecipitated STAT5a. Panel b, associated STAT3; note that low levels of Stat3 cross-react with the precipitating STAT5a antibody, but these are not increased in the presence of STAT5 and Src. Panels c and d, STAT5a and STAT3 immunoprecipitates were probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies to verify tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Src. Panels e–g, cell lysates were probed with STAT5a, STAT3, and Src antibodies to show equivalent protein expression in each culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Blockade of Src Kinases Inhibits Activation of STATs 3 and 5 and SCCHN Cell Growth—We have previously reported that EGFR blockade abrogates both growth and constitutive activation of STATs 3 and 5 in SCCHN cells (25Leong P.L.

https://openalex.org/W2055474071,"We have previously shown that Smac/DIABLO release from mitochondria appears to be the principal pathway by which TRAIL induces apoptosis of human melanoma. We report that TRAIL-induced release of Smac/DIABLO appears to be downregulated by concomitant signaling through the MEK Erk1/2 kinase pathway and that this inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Erk1/2 signaling by either the MEK inhibitor U0126 or a dominant-negative mutant of MKK1 markedly sensitized melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The site in the apoptotic pathway acted on by U0126 appeared to be downstream of caspase-8 and Bid but upstream of caspase-3 in that the levels of proteolytic cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid by TRAIL were similar in cells with or without exposure to U0126. Caspase-3 activation and cleavage of its substrates, PARP, ICAD and XIAP, were however increased by cotreatment with U0126. This was associated with a rapid reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) and increased release of Smac/DIABLO into the cytosol. Exploration of events leading to the changes in MMP revealed an increased translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria in the presence of U0126. There was also a delayed decrease in the levels of expression of Mcl-1. Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). Over expression of Bcl-2 blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the presence of U0126. Cytochrome c appeared not to play a major role in sensitization of melanoma to TRAIL in that caspase-9 activation was not detected in most of the cell lines. These results suggest that Erk1/2 signaling may protect melanoma cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the relocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria and that this may reduce TRAIL-mediated release of Smac/DIABLO and induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019390346,"We have recently reported that osteopontin (OPN) induces nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated promatrix metalloproteinase-2 activation through IκBα/IKK signaling pathways and that curcumin (diferulolylmethane) down-regulates these pathways (Philip, S., and Kundu, G. C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 14487–14497). However, the molecular mechanism by which upstream kinases regulate the OPN-induced NFκB activation and urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion in human breast cancer cells is not well defined. Here we report that OPN induces the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) activity and phosphorylation of Akt in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 and low invasive MCF-7 cells. The OPN-induced Akt phosphorylation was inhibited when cells were transfected with a dominant negative mutant of the p85 domain of PI 3-kinase (Δp85) and enhanced when cells were transfected with an activated form of PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX), indicating that PI 3′-kinase is involved in Akt phosphorylation. OPN enhances the interaction between IκBα kinase (IKK) and phosphorylated Akt. OPN also induces NFκB activation through phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by inducing the IKK activity. However, both pharmacological (wortmannin and LY294002) and genetic (Δp85) inhibitors of PI 3′-kinase inhibited OPN-induced Akt phosphorylation, IKK activity, and NFκB activation through phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. OPN also enhances uPA secretion, cell motility, and extracellular matrix invasion. Furthermore, cells transfected with Δp85 or the super-repressor form of IκBα suppressed the OPN-induced uPA secretion and cell motility, whereas cells transfected with p110CAAX enhanced these effects. Pretreatment of cells with PI 3-kinase inhibitors or NFκB inhibitory peptide (SN-50) reduced the OPN-induced uPA secretion, cell motility, and invasion. To our knowledge, this is first report that OPN induces NFκB activity and uPA secretion by activating PI 3′-kinase/Akt/IKK-mediated signaling pathways and further demonstrates a functional molecular link between OPN-induced PI 3′-kinase-dependent Akt phosphorylation and NFκB-mediated uPA secretion, and all of these ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells.

In the past several investigators have shown that urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; OPN, osteopontin; PI 3′-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; IKK, IκB kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; IκBα, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; Luc, luciferase; ECM, extra-cellular matrix; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PKB, protein kinase B; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ASOPN, OPN-specific phosphorothioate-linked antisense oligonucleotide. plays a major role in the regulation of cancer cell motility, extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion, and metastasis by degrading the ECM proteins (5Dano K.

Current investigations have focused on the understanding of molecular mechanism(s) by which osteopontin (OPN), an ECM protein, regulates uPA secretion and controls motility in human breast cancer cells. OPN is a non-collagenous, sialic acid-rich, and glycosylated phosphoprotein (8Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 9Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). This protein has a functional thrombin cleavage site and is a substrate for tissue transglutaminase (9Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a highly acidic region consisting of nine consecutive aspartic acid residues, and a GRGDS cell adhesion sequence predicted to be flanked by the β-sheet structure (10Prince C.W. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). OPN binds with several integrins and CD44 variants in an RGD sequence-dependent and -independent manner. This protein is involved in normal tissue-remodeling processes such as bone resorption, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue injury as well as certain diseases such as restenosis, atherosclerosis, tumorigenesis, and autoimmune diseases (11Liaw L.

OPN causes cell adhesion and migration, ECM invasion, and cell proliferation by interacting with its receptor αvβ3 integrin in various cell types (12Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 94: 9308-9313Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Integrins are non-covalently associated, heterodimeric, cell-surface glycoproteins with α- and β-subunits. Integrins are a superfamily of transmembrane glycoproteins found predominantly on the surface of leukocytes that mediate cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. Until today, ∼12 α-subunits, 8 β-subunits, and 20 αβ-heterodimers were documented in the literature (17Giancotti F.G. Rhuoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3820) Google Scholar). Cell migration, a major step in cancer metastasis, is often associated with the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (7Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6209-6221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PI 3′-kinase is consisting of a catalytic subunit p110 (α, β, and δ) or p110γ, and a regulatory subunit p85 (α, β, p55γ, and p101) (19Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PI 3′-kinase is activated by a number of growth factors. One of the downstream target molecule of PI 3′-kinase is Akt. Akt is a serine threonine kinase and also known as protein kinase B (PKB) or RAC-PK (related to A and C protein kinase). Akt is a cellular homolog of v-akt oncogene (20Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzales-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). Akt is activated by factors that stimulate PI 3′-kinase activity in cells such as thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin (21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). The activation of Akt is also occurred by stress factor, and that is independent of the PI 3′-kinase-mediated pathway (22Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Van der Kaay J. Beck M. Gray A. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35963-35968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In PI 3′-kinase-dependent pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, a product of PI 3′-kinase directly binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and leads to its activation (24Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar, 25Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, the complete activation of Akt requires its phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues (26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Akt regulates cell cycle progression, growth factor-mediated cell survival, and cell migration. It promotes cell survival by phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad and Caspase-9 (27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1991; 254: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Previous data indicated that the PI 3′-kinase/Akt pathway is critically involved in anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, which is one of the important steps of cancer metastasis (30Nakanishi K. Sakamoto M. Yasuda J. Takamura M. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Toda S. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2971-2975PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which OPN regulates PI 3′-kinase activity and controls cell motility in human breast cancer cells is not well defined. The NFκB family consists of several members, including p65, p50, RelB, and c-Rel molecules (31Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is tightly controlled by its inhibitor, the IκB family of proteins (32Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These inhibitory proteins bind to NFκB dimers, hiding their nuclear localization sequence resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NFκB (33Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded via the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated pathway, permitting activation and nuclear import of NFκB where it binds to cognate sequence in promoter regions of multiple genes. There are other less explored pathways by which NFκB translocates into the nucleus through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα (34Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

IKK (IκB kinase) is a multisubunit protein kinase, the activation of which phosphorylated IκB. Constitutive activation of NFκB has been detected in lymphomas, melanomas, and breast cancers (35Bargou R.C. Emmerich F. Krappmann D. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Arnold W. Royer H.D. Grinstein E.

The signaling pathways by which OPN regulates Akt phosphorylation followed by activations of IKK and NFκB in human breast cancer cells are not clearly understood. uPA is a member of serine protease that interacts with the uPA receptor (uPAR) and facilitates the conversion of inert zymogen plasminogen into widely acting serine protease plasmin and activation of metalloproteinases (40Collen C. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 41Blasi F. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 198-204Google Scholar). These proteases then degrade the surrounding matrix components (collagen, fibronectin, and laminin) and allow cancer cells to migrate to the distant sites. uPA is also involved in cell adhesion and chemotaxis (42Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Mukhina S. Stepanova V. Traktouev D. Poliakov A. Beabealashvilly R. Gursky Y. Minashkin M. Shevelev A. Tkachuk V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16450-16458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is well documented that uPA plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis (6MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 7Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6209-6221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NFκB-responsive element is present in the promoter region of uPA, which plays a key role in cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism by which OPN induces NFκB-mediated uPA secretion and regulates cell migration and ECM invasion in breast cancer cells is not well documented. In this study, we demonstrate that OPN induced the PI 3′-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt in human breast cancer cells. OPN also enhanced nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NFκB, NFκB-DNA binding, and NFκB transactivation through phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by inducing the IKK activity. Moreover, OPN induced uPA secretion, ECM invasion, and cell motility in these cells. The OPN-induced NFκB transactivation, uPA secretion, and cell motility were suppressed when both these cells were transfected with super-repressor form of IκBα or Δp85 and enhanced when cells were transfected with p110CAAX suggesting that PI 3-kinase is involved in these processes. Pretreatment of cells with PI 3′-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), αvβ3 integrin antibody, or NFκB inhibitory peptide (SN-50) reduced the OPN-induced uPA secretion, cell motility, and invasion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that OPN enhances the cell motility and induces NFκB-mediated uPA secretion through PI 3′-kinase/Akt/IKK-mediated signaling pathways. Materials—The rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt1 (Ser-437), anti-p65 subunit of NFκB (anti-p65), anti-NFκB p65 X TransCruz, anti-IκBα, anti-IKKα/β, anti-actin, mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, anti-phospho IκBα, goat polyclonal anti-Akt1/2, and IκBα recombinant protein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody and normal rabbit IgG were obtained from Oncogene. Mouse monoclonal anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody was from Chemicon International. LY294002, SN-50, and SN-50M were obtained from Calbiochem. Wortmannin was from Sigma. LipofectAMINE Plus, GRGDSP, and GRGESP were obtained from Invitrogen. The dual luciferase reporter assay system and NFκB consensus oligonucleotide were from Promega. Boyden-type cell migration chambers were obtained from Corning and BioCoat Matrigel™ invasion chambers were from Collaborative Biomedical. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Hyderabad, India). The human OPN was purified from milk as described previously (44Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Bio. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and used throughout these studies. All other chemicals were analytical grade. Cell Culture—The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. DNA Transfection—HA-Delta.p85 in pCMV (Δp85) and Myc.p110.CAAX in pSG5 (p110CAAX) cDNA constructs were generous gifts from Dr. Alex Toker (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were split 12 h prior to transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were transiently transfected with HA-Delta.p85 (Δp85) or Myc.p110.CAAX cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Δp85 or p110CAAX cDNA (8 μg) was mixed with Plus reagent, and then cDNA reagent Plus was incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus cDNA complex was added to the cells and incubated further at 37 °C for 12 h. The control cells received LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were refed with fresh medium and maintained for an additional 12 h. In another experiments, these cells were individually transfected with super-repressor form of IκBα cDNA fused downstream to a FLAG epitope in an expression vector (pCMV4) (a kind gift from Dr. Dean Ballard, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine) under the same conditions as described above. These transfected cells were used for the NFκB activity by luciferase reporter gene assay, detection of uPA expression by Western blot analysis and cell migration. The Δp85-transfected cells were also used for Akt phosphorylation, IKK activity, and IκBα phosphorylation studies. Western Blot Analysis—To delineate the role of OPN in regulation of Akt phosphorylation, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 0–90 min. In separate experiments, cells were individually pretreated with PI 3′-kinase inhibitor (0–100 nm wortmannin or 0–10 μm LY294002), anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (0–20 μg/ml), or with RGD peptide (0–10 μm GRGDSP or GRGESP) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 30 min in MCF-7 cells and 15 min in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 25 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4. The cleared lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the lysate was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. The lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred from gel to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho Akt antibody and incubated further with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. The membrane was washed and detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was reprobed with goat polyclonal anti-Akt antibody to ensure equal protein loading. In separate experiments, both these cells were individually transfected with a dominant negative mutant of the p85 domain of PI 3-kinase (Δp85) or the activated form of PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then stimulated with OPN. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the levels of both phospho- and non-phospho Akt were detected by Western blot analysis as described previously. To check the effect of OPN in regulation of IκBα serine/threonine phosphorylation and degradation in breast cancer cells, both these cells were either treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–90 min or pretreated with LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 30 min in MCF-7 and 15 min in MDA-MB-231 cells at 37 °C. In other experiments, cells were transfected with Δp85 cDNA and then treated with OPN as described above. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4. The equal amounts of total proteins in the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using mouse anti-phospho-IκBα antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-IκBα antibody. As loading controls, the expression of actin was also analyzed by reprobing the blots with anti-actin antibody and detected by using the ECL detection system. To investigate the role of OPN on uPA secretion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, both these cells were individually treated with various concentrations of OPN (0–5 μm) for 24 h. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (0–20 μg/ml), RGD peptide (0–10 μm GRGDSP or GRGESP), PI 3′-kinase inhibitor (0–100 nm wortmannin and 0–10 μm LY294002), NFκB inhibitory peptide (0–100 μg/ml SN-50 or SN-50M) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN for additional 24 h at 37 °C. These cells were lysed, and cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody. In separate experiments, both these cells were individually transfected with dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase (Δp85), the activated form of PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX), or the super-repressor form of IκBα in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 24 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The level of uPA in these lysates was detected by Western blot analysis. As loading controls, the expression of actin was also detected by reprobing the blot with rabbit anti-actin antibody. Immunoprecipitation—To check whether OPN regulates the interaction between IKK and phosphorylated Akt, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 30 and 15 min, respectively. In another experiments, these cells were pretreated with LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) for 1 h or transfected with Δp85 cDNA and then treated with 5 μm OPN as described above. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 15% v/v glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm benzamidine, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm pNPP, 2 mm Na3VO4) and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Akt antibody. The half of the immunoprecipitated samples was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the level of IKK was detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-IKK antibody. The remaining half of the samples was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the serine-phosphorylated Akt was detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (serine-specific) antibody. The same blots were reprobed with goat anti-Akt antibody. Similarly, in other experiments, the treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-IKK antibody. The half of the immunoprecipitated samples were used to detect the levels of phospho and non-phospho Akt by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Akt and anti-non-phospho-Akt antibody, respectively. The other half of the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and IKK level was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-IKK antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assay—To check the role of OPN in regulation of PI 3′-kinase activity, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–60 min at 37 °C. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (20 μg/ml) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 30 min in MCF-7 and for 15 min in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and the protein concentration in the lysates was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. The PI 3′-kinase assay was performed as described previously (7Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6209-6221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) containing phosphatidylinositol (0.25 mg/ml), 100 mm ATP, and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of acidified chloroformmethanol (2:1). Lipids were extracted according to the procedure as described previously (45Rizzo M.T. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2611-2614PubMed Google Scholar) and separated on oxalate-treated plastic TLC plates using a solvent system consisting of chloroform, methanol, and 20% methylamine (65:35:10, v/v). The spots corresponding to the position of radioactive phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) were visualized by autoradiography. To detect the effect of OPN on IKK activity, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 30 and 15 min, respectively. The IKK assay was performed as described previously (46Philip S. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14487-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer; equal amounts of total proteins in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-IKKα/β antibody as described above. Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with recombinant IκBα (4 μg) in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32p]ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm pNPP, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm DTT) at 30 °C for 1 h. The kinase reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using anti-IKKα/β antibody. In separate experiments, both these cells were either transfected with Δp85 cDNA or pretreated with LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) then treated with OPN (5 μm). These cells were used for detection of IKK activity under the same conditions as des"

The mechanism by which NO regulates apoptosis is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that NO, produced either from the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) or by transfection of neuronal NO synthase, suppressed 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and DNA fragmentation. This protection was significantly reversed by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalon-1-one, indicating that cGMP is a key mediator in NO-mediated anti-apoptosis. Moreover, the membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP inhibited 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis. These anti-apoptotic effects of SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP were suppressed by cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823, indicating that PKG is a downstream signal mediator in the suppression of apoptosis by NO and cGMP. Both SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP induced endogenous Akt activation and Bad phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of Bad translocation to mitochondria; these effects were inhibited by KT5823 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin. Our data suggest that the NO/cGMP pathway suppresses 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cell apoptosis by suppressing the mitochondrial apoptosis signal via PKG/PI3K/Akt-dependent Bad phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2033062154,"Regulation of transcription during the cell-cycle is under the control of E2 factors (E2Fs), often in cooperation with nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), a histone-like CCAAT-binding trimer. NF-Y is paradigmatic of a constitutive, ubiquitous factor that pre-sets the promoter architecture for other regulatory proteins to access it. We analyzed the recruitment of NF-Y, E2F1/4/6, histone acetyltransferases, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1/3/4 to several cell-cycle promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in serum-starved and restimulated NIH3T3 cells. NF-Y binding is not constitutive but timely regulated in all promoters tested, being displaced when promoters are repressed. p300 association correlates with activation, and it is never found in the absence of NF-Y, whereas PCAF/hGCN5 is often found before NF-Y association. E2F4 and E2F6, together with HDACs, are bound to repressed promoters, including the G2/M Cyclin B2. As expected, an inverse relationship between HDACs association and histones H3/H4 acetylation is observed. Blocking cells in G1 with the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor R-roscovitine confirms that NF-Y is bound to G1/S but not to G2/M promoters in G1. These data indicate that following the release of E2Fs/HDACs, a hierarchy of PCAF-NF-Y-p300 interactions and H3-H4 acetylations are required for activation of cell-cycle promoters.

Promoters and enhancers are a combinatorial puzzle of DNA elements recognized by sequence-specific regulators that recruit coactivators and corepressors and act in a complex chromatin context. Genes that are regulated during the cell-cycle are typically active in one phase, whereas they are inactive in all others. This type of tight regulation is under the control of the E2 factors (E2Fs). 1The abbreviations used are: E2F, E2 factor; NF-Y, nuclear factor Y; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HFM, histone fold motif; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; TAF, TBP-associated factor; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TopoIIα, topoisomerase IIα; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PGDFβR, platelet-derived growth factor β receptor; PLK, Plo-like kinase; CDE, cell cycle-dependent element; CHR, cell cycle gene homology region; RNR-R1, ribonucleotide reductase 1; TBP, TATA-binding protein. Originally identified for their role in the G1/S transition, they belong to two classes, the activators (E2F1/2/3) and the repressors (E2F4/5/6) (reviewed in Ref. 1Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Repression is exerted on promoters active in G1/S under serum starvation conditions through the recruitment of negative complexes containing retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma family members, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and histone methyl-transferases (2Takahashi Y.

Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Recently, genome wide approaches using chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) with E2F4 and E2F1 antibodies clearly indicated that E2Fs are more general regulators of cell growth, checkpoints, and DNA repair genes as well (6Ren B.

In addition to E2F sites, most cell-cycle regulated promoters, particularly those of regulators of the cycle, also contain CCAAT boxes. Genes activated in G0 (PDGFβ-R), G1/S (E2F1, CDC25A, and PCNA), S (Cyclin A and CDC25B), S/G2 (topoisomerase IIα and PLK), and G2/M (CDC25C and Cyclin B1/B2) all contain CCAAT boxes, invariably shown to be crucial for the proper regulation of these genes (8Alder H.

A combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transfections with highly diagnostic dominant negative vectors implicated nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) as the common CCAAT activator (20Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). NF-Y is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all necessary for DNA binding. NF-YA and NF-YC possess large Q-rich activation domains. NF-YB and NF-YC dimerization is a prerequisite for NF-YA association and sequence-specific DNA binding. NF-YB and NF-YC contain histone fold motifs (HFM) found in all core histones, which mediate dimerization and DNA binding (Ref. 21Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and references therein). In all systems of inducible transcription tested so far (heat shock, cholesterol biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and CYP genes), ChIP experiments determined that NF-Y is bound in vivo before gene activation (22Bennett M.K.

Mantovani, manuscript in preparation.; indeed, NF-Y is bound to a transcribing Cyclin B1 promoter during mitosis in HeLa cells (24Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In G1/S promoters, NF-Y cooperates with E2Fs (8Alder H. Yoshinouchi M. Prystowsky M.B. Appasamy P. Baserga R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In G2/M promoters, NF-Y-binding CCAAT-boxes are usually found in multiple copies near the CDE-CHR elements (10Bolognese F. Wasner M. Lange-zu Dohna C. Gurtner A. Ronchi A. Muller H. Manni I.

These latter conserved boxes have been identified by genetic experiments as the crucial determinants of proper regulation, that is repression in G0, G1, and early S (19Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, biochemical characterization of the CDE-CHR interacting protein(s) has been elusive. In the case of Cdc2, circumstantial evidence suggests that E2Fs might partake in promoter regulation through the CDE-CHR (25Taylor W.R. Schonthal A.H. Galante J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1998-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A further level of regulation is exerted by coactivators and corepressors containing histones modifying activities, histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and HDACs. The former serves as a bridge for transcription factors and holo-enzyme interactions, having been recruited to promoters through the activation domains of the DNA-binding activators. Not surprisingly, connections between NF-Y and HAT coactivators have emerged. Interactions of the HFM subunits with hGCN5 were reported (26Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) mediates the trichostatin A induction of the MDR1 promoter through NF-Y (27Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with HDAC inhibitors induces the TGFβ-RII promoter by increasing the affinity of PCAF for the NF-Y trimer (28Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B. Sausville E.A.

In this latter study, p300 was able to acetylate NF-YB in vitro, but the function of this modification is currently unknown. Negative regulation through NF-Y, HDAC activity, and histone deacetylation also surfaced (28Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I.

These latter results suggest that NF-Y might be instrumental in the establishment of repressive as well as activating complexes on the regulated promoters. We decided to use the powerful means of chromatin immunoprecipitation to gain a more complete view of the association of NF-Y, HATs, HDACs, and E2Fs to cell-cycle regulated CCAAT-containing promoters. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in RPMI under standard conditions with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were arrested by incubation for 60/72 h in 0.5% fetal calf serum, and restimulation was obtained by addition of fresh medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cell-cycle progression was monitored by DNA content through propidium iodide staining and FACScan analysis. For R-roscovitine treatment, the drug (Cyclacell, Dundee, UK) was used at a 20 μm concentration for 16 h. Under these conditions all cells were blocked in G1, as reported in Ref. 32McClue S.J.

After quenching the reaction with glycine 0.1 m, the cross-linked material was sonicated into chromatin fragments of an average length of 500/800 bp. Chromatin was kept at –80 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with ProtG-Sepharose (KPL) and 3–5 μg of the indicated antibodies: anti-YB purified rabbit polyclonal (23Imbriano C. Bolognese F. Gurtner A. Piaggio G.

The chromatin solution was precleared by adding ProtG-Sepharose for2hat4 °C and was aliquoted and incubated with the antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. ProtG-Sepharose was blocked with 1 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with chromatin and antibody for 2 h.

In Vivo Binding of NF-Y and HATs to CCAAT Cell-cycle Promoters—To assess the in vivo recruitment of NF-Y and HATs on cell-cycle promoters, we used the ChIP assay with anti-YB and anti-HATs (p300, PCAF, and GCN5) antibodies in the NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts system (3Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Chromatin from cells starved by serum withdrawal (G0) and after restimulation with 10% fetal calf serum for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h was prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-Y, p300, PCAF, GCN5, and control anti-leader-binding protein 1/CCAAT protein 2 antibodies. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the cell populations at the different time points was run to verify cell-cycle progression, which was indeed as expected and shown in Fig. 1. Note that the 24 h time point was more heterogeneous with 20/30% of the cells that re-entered G1. We first amplified a control fragment in the nucleolin CCAAT-less intronic enhancer (Fig. 1, upper panel, and Ref. 33Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The anti-NF-Y, p300 antibodies were negative, whereas CCAAT protein 2 was apparently bound between 6–18 h (33Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This factor has been implicated in the activation of the CCAAT-less TS promoter in S phase (34Powell C.M. Rudge T.L. Zhu Q. Johnson L.F. Hansen U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCAF/GCN5 were weakly positive at 18 h, and this correlates with the binding of MYC and TRRAP, although with a slower kinetic (33Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The CCAAT promoters chosen for analysis are active in G0 (PDGFβ-R) shortly after the G0-G1 transition (c-Jun and JunB), late G1/early S (E2F1, RNR-R1, PCNA, and Cyclin A), late S/G2 (TopoIIα, CDC25C, and PLK), and G2/M (Cdc2 and Cyclin B2). Fig. 1 shows a comprehensive analysis of the results obtained with the target promoters in the different time points. It is clear that NF-Y binding to these promoters is not constitutive. In G0 cells, it is present only on PDGFβ-R, c-Jun, and JunB. At 6 h, these promoters are negative, whereas association is weakly positive to E2F1. In Late G1, NF-Y binding is maximal on E2F1, PCNA, and RNR-R1 promoters, and detectable on TopoIIα, Cyclin A, PLK, and CDC25C. Finally, Cdc2 and Cyclin B2 become positive only at 18 h. It should also be noted that promoters that have been transcriptionally switched off, such as PDGFβ-R, cJun, and JunB at 6 h and PCNA at 24 h, are unloaded of NF-Y, whereas the occupancy of others (RNR-R1 and E2F1) is considerably decreased. We conclude that the binding of NF-Y to cell-cycle promoters is highly dynamic. The pattern of p300 binding closely matches promoter activation. In G0, the only promoter that is clearly positive is the transcribing PDGF-βR, but weak association is observed with c-Jun and JunB, whereas all other promoters are negative. These data correlate well with histone H4 acetylation on PDGF-βR (Fig. 3), and the low but detectable levels observed in previous studies on JunB (35Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These promoters are inactive at 6 h (14Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K. Funa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). G1/S promoters are positive at 12 h, later becoming negative, and Cdc2 and Cyclin B2 are bound at 18 h. Binding to Cdc2, but not to Cyclin B2, is substantially reduced at 24 h. S/G2 promoters are somewhat intermediate, being already associated at 12 h. It is important to note that p300 is never found on promoters in the absence of NF-Y. The binding of PCAF to all promoters is, in general, more pronounced than that of hGCN5, with the exception of RNR-R1 at early G1 time points. This most likely reflects the far higher (5/10-fold) amounts of PCAF in NIH3T3 cells. The patterns of binding of these HATs appear to precede promoter activation, often well before NF-Y and p300 binding. In G0 cells, only the transcribing PDGFβ-R is bound, whereas at 6 h all three G1/S promoters, TopoIIα, PLK, and CDC25C, are significantly bound in conditions in which neither NF-Y nor p300 are associated. Cyclin B2 starts to be loaded at 12 h. Interestingly, PCNA, RNR-R1, E2F1, Cyclin A, and Cdc2 become rapidly unloaded of PCAF after the promoter has been switched off. In the case of PDGFβ-R, PCAF is on at 6 h before reloading of NF-Y and p300 at 12 h. As for c-Jun and JunB, which are rapidly (0.5 h) activated following serum addition, PCAF/GCN5 are not bound in G0 nor after 6 h. Most likely, we have missed the early PCAF/hGCN5 loading because of the kinetic used in our assays; however, the two HATs are on at 12 h. Note that maximal NF-Y and p300 reloading on JunB occurs at 18 h. In Vivo Binding of E2Fs and HDACs to CCAAT Cell-cycle Promoters—The experiments shown above prompted us to control the association of the E2F factors to CCAAT promoters. Essentially, the same protocol was used with anti-E2F1/4/6 antibodies on a representative set of promoters. Fig. 2 shows the results of such ChIP analysis. The PDGFβ-R promoter is apparently devoid of E2Fs, at least within the time points considered. The E2F1 promoter is bound by E2F4 and, to a lesser extent, by E2F1 in G0 cells. At 12 h, when the gene is being transcribed, E2F1 clearly becomes prominent, then declines rapidly. Cdc2 and Cyclin A show a similar behavior, except that association of E2F1 in S is not observed and E2F4 is clearly bound at later time points (24 h) when a proportion of the cell population (20/30%) is re-entering G1. Furthermore, the repressive E2F6 is bound to Cyclin A (weakly) and to Cdc2 (more strongly) in G0 cells, rapidly becoming unloaded at 6 h. Because E2F4/1 have been detected on several S/G2 promoters in genome-wide experiments (6Ren B. Cam H. Takahashi Y. Volkert T. Terragni J. Young R.A. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 7Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we also tested Cyclin B2 in these ChIPs. It is clear that E2F4 and, to a lesser degree, E2F1, are associated in G0, decreasing at 6 h and desappearing at 12 h. E2F6, which is not bound in G0, is the prominent E2F bound at 6 h. Overall, this analysis confirms and extends the data previously reported in the NIH3T3 system (3Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in human fibroblasts (2Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rayman J.B.

HDACs are associated with repressive E2Fs in many of the E2F-regulated promoters and that HDAC binding correlates with low levels of histones H3 and H4 acetylation (2Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows ChIP analysis with antibodies against HDAC1/3/4 and acetyl-K of histones H3 and H4. The PDGFβ-R promoter is apparently devoid of HDACs at G0, and indeed acetylation of H4 is observed, as expected for an actively transcribing promoter. At 6 h, histones are deacetylated and HDAC1/4 are bound. At later time points histones (expecially H3) are acetylated, with little binding of HDACs. The E2F1 promoter is bound by HDAC1/3/4 and the histones deacetylated in G0. HDACs association is no longer visible beyond 6 h, whereas H3 and, subsequently, H4 acetylation is observed during activation. Cdc2 and Cyclin A show binding of HDAC1 in G0, which is released during activation at 12/18 h. On Cyclin A, HDAC3/4 become reassociated at the late 24 h time point. The levels of histone acetylation correlate with promoter activation, indeed preceding it and being specular to that of HDAC binding. On Cyclin B2, HDAC1/4 are associated at 6 h, consistent with the binding of E2F6 at this time point, but not with the binding of E2F4 at G0. Acetylation of H3 is maximal at 12 h, following HDACs release and before transcriptional activation. The data presented lead us to conclude that the acetylation of histones H3-H4 tails faithfully reflects the HATs/HDACs dynamic behavior on these promoters, further validating the data on HATs and NF-Y binding. NF-Y Is Differentially Bound in Cells Blocked at the G 1/S Transition—The results obtained above with a protocol of serum starvation-restimulation might be peculiar to a situation of G0-G1 re-entry and not reflect changes of promoter occupancy in normally growing cells. We sought to verify the behavior of NF-Y in a different experimental setting, that is in cells arrested in their normal cycles with the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor R-roscovitine (32McClue S.J. Blake D. Clarke R. Cowan A. Cummings L. Fischer P.M. MacKenzie M. Melville J. Stewart K. Wang S. Zhelev N. Zheleva D. Lane D.P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Treatment of cycling cells with pharmacological doses of the drug indeed leads to a complete block in G1 (not shown). Fig. 4, left panel, shows that the promoters of all genes are bound by NF-Y in cycling cells, a result well expected, given the heterogeneous nature of this cell population. After the R-roscovitine block, NF-Y is found only on G1/S promoters (Fig. 4, right panel). In full support of the data of Fig. 1, however, in none of the G2/M promoters NF-Y is loaded, a clear indication that the late G1 block has prevented its association with promoters active in subsequent phases. Thus, we conclude that the cell-cycle-dependent association of NF-Y to its targets is not a peculiar phenomenon of serum restimulated fibroblasts, but rather a theme common to normally growing cells. Through the use of the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique, we report three important results. (i) Contrary to predictions based upon in vitro binding activity in EMSAs and ChIP data on other promoters, the in vivo binding of NF-Y to cell-cycle genes is strictly regulated during the different phases of the cell-cycle. (ii) We detail for the first time the association of p300 and PCAF/GCN5 to cell-cycle promoters in vivo. The distinct timing of binding of these two HAT families suggests different functions. (iii) Although confirming and extending previous ChIP data on E2Fs, HDACs, and histones H3-H4 acetylation, we further detect E2F4/6 on the G2/M Cyclin B2 promoter, thus establishing that promoters active in all phases of the cycle are regulated by E2Fs. The bulk of the data presented here on E2F1/4/6 in Fig. 2 are in large agreement with previous experiments (2Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D.

https://openalex.org/W2069347152,"β-catenin is a component of stable cell adherent complexes whereas its free form functions as a transcription factor that regulate genes involved in oncogenesis and metastasis. Free β-catenin is eliminated by two adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-dependent proteasomal degradation pathways regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) or p53-inducible Siah-1. Dysregulation of β-catenin turnover consequent to mutations in critical genes of the APC-dependent pathways is implicated in cancers such as colorectal cancer. We have identified a novel retinoid X receptor (RXR)-mediated APC-independent pathway in the regulation of β-catenin. In this proteasomal pathway, RXR agonists induce degradation of β-catenin and RXRα and repress β-catenin-mediated transcription. In vivo, β-catenin interacts with RXRα in the absence of ligand, but RXR agonists enhanced the interaction. RXR agonist action was not impaired by GSK3β inhibitors or deletion of the GSK3β-targeted sequence from β-catenin. In APC- and p53-mutated colorectal cancer cells, RXR agonists still inactivated endogenous β-catenin via RXRα. Interestingly, deletion of the RXRα A/B region abolished ligand-induced β-catenin degradation but not RXRα-mediated transactivation. RXRα-mediated inactivation of oncogenic β-catenin paralleled a reduction in cell proliferation. These results suggest a potential role for RXR and its agonists in the regulation of β-catenin turnover and related biological events. β-catenin is a component of stable cell adherent complexes whereas its free form functions as a transcription factor that regulate genes involved in oncogenesis and metastasis.

These results suggest a potential role for RXR and its agonists in the regulation of β-catenin turnover and related biological events. β-catenin is a key mediator in Wnt regulation of multiple cellular functions in embryogenesis and tumorigenesis (1Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, β-catenin is a component of stable cell adherent complexes whereas its free form functions as a co-activator for a family of transcription factors called T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF). 1The abbreviations used are: TCF/LEF, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; AF-1/2, activation function 1 or 2; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 (cells); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Levels of free β-catenin are tightly regulated by two APC-dependent proteasomal degradation pathways, namely a GSK3β-regulated pathway involving the APC/Axin complex (2Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R499—R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and a p53-inducible pathway involving Siah-1 (3Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C.A. Yost H.J. Hu Y. Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Matsunami N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 4Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In the GSK3β-regulated pathway, β-catenin associates with the APC/Axin complex and undergoes a two-step phosphorylation by casein kinase I (CKI) and GSK3β at serine/threonine residues within the first 50 N-terminal amino acids (2Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R499—R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Schwarz-Romond T. Asbrand C. Bakkers J. Kuhl M. Schaeffer H.J. Huelsken J. Behrens J. Hammerschmidt M. Birchmeier W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2073-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). β-catenin interacts with an ubiquitylation complex through the phosphorylated N terminus and undergoes proteasome-catalyzed degradation (6Polakis P. Cell. 2001; 105: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wnt inactivation of GSK3β leads to translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, where it enables TCF/LEF to activate genes involved in embryogenesis and oncogenesis (1Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 7Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, p53-up-regulated Siah-1 interacts with the N-terminal region of APC, recruits an ubiquitylation complex to the N terminus of β-catenin, and targets it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Thus, both pathways require the intact N terminus of β-catenin. In cancers such as colorectal and hepatocellular cancers and melanoma, mutations in the key components of the two pathways, such as APC, p53, and Axin, or β-catenin itself, lead to dysregulation of β-catenin turnover and, consequently, high levels of nuclear β-catenin and abnormal activation of TCF/LEF-regulated genes that are involved in oncogenesis and metastasis (8Conacci-Sorrell M.E.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Retinoids, which are natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, regulate gene transcription through two families of nuclear receptors, i.e. retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (10Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar) and have significant anti-cancer effects (11Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 12Sun S.Y. Lotan R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 41: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These receptors are ligand-dependent DNA binding transcription factors. Each receptor has an N-terminal A/B region that harbors the ligand-independent activation function-1 (AF-1), a central DNA-binding domain (the C region), and a C-terminal E region containing a ligand binding domain and a ligand-dependent activation function-2 (AF-2). RARs and RXRs bind to target genes as RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR homodimers. In the absence of ligands, retinoid receptors are associated with co-repressors and repress gene transcription (13Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Once associated with agonists, RARs and RXRs undergo conformational changes, recruit co-activators, and activate target gene transcription. Interestingly, instances of crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin- and retinoid-signaling pathways have been reported recently. For example, RAR was found to interact with β-catenin in vitro and inhibits β-catenin-mediated gene transcription in vivo (14Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid, an RAR agonist, was shown to synergize with Wnt signaling in the up-regulation of gene transcription (15Tice D.A. Szeto W. Soloviev I. Rubinfeld B. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Winer J. Williams P.M. Wieand D. Smith V. Schwall R.H. Pennica D. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14329-14335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Liu T. Lee Y.-N. Malbon C.C. Wang H.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30887-30891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike the APC-dependent pathway, RAR signaling does not regulate β-catenin protein levels (14Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, RXR agonists have been shown to cause degradation of RXRα and also its receptor heterodimerization partners, including RARs and TR (17Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de Thé H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Osburn D.L. Shao G. Seidel H.M. Schulman I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the biological consequences of such degradation phenomena have not been well understood. Here, we have investigated the role of RXR and its ligands in the regulation of β-catenin activity and identified a novel RXR-mediated APC-independent pathway. We show that RXR agonists reduce β-catenin-mediated activation of gene transcription and cell proliferation through a protein degradation mechanism. Retinoids—The RAR antagonist AGN194310 and the RXR agonist AGN194204 have been described previously (19Johnson A.T. Wang L. Standeven A.M. Escobar M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Bioorg Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 1321-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Vuligonda V. Thacher S.M. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The RXR-specific agonists AGN195362, AGN195456, AGN195741, AGN196060, and AGN196459 and the RXR-specific antagonist AGN195393 were synthesized at Allergan. Me2SO was used as a solvent for the compounds. Plasmids—TOPFLASH, which contains TCF/LEF binding sites placed in front of the TK-Luc reporter gene, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The β-catenin expression vector, Gene Storm clone H-X87838 M in pcDNA3.1/GS, was purchased from Invitrogen. ΔNβ-catenin, a β-catenin mutant with an N-terminal deletion (amino acid residues 1–50), was made by PCR amplification from wild type β-catenin using the following pair of primers: 5′-AGG GAT CCA ACC ATG AAT CCT GAG GAA GAG-3′ and 5′-AGT CTA GAT TAC AGG TCA GTA TCA AAC CAG-3′. The resulting fragment was cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen Corp) between BamH1 and XbaI and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Finally, the N-terminal coding region with the deletion was released by digestion with MunI and XhoI and used to replace the 5′-end of wild type β-catenin in pcDNA3.1/GS. Human RXRα cDNA in a human keratinocyte cDNA library (21Nagpal S. Ghosn C. DiSepio D. Molina Y. Sutter M. Klein E.S. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22563-22568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid system using RARγ as a bait. The RXRα coding region was amplified from this clone by PCR using a pair of following primers: 5′-AG GAA TTC ATG GAC ACC AAA CAT TTC CTG CCG-3′ and 5′-AG CTG CAG CTA AGT CAT TTG GTG CGG CGG CTC-3′. The resulting fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) between the EcoRI and PstI sites and then released by EcoRI and KpnI digestion. The released RXRα coding region was then cloned into a modified pCMV-FLAG vector (Sigma) containing the FLAG epitope DYKDDDDK. The RXRα deletion mutants (see Fig. 6A) were constructed by PCR amplification of hRXRα cDNA using primers as follows: 5′-AGG AAT TCT GCG CCA TCT GCG GGG ACC GC-3′ and 5′-AGG GTA CCC TAA GTC ATT TGG TGC GGC GCC TCC-3′ for RXRαCDE; 5′-AGG AAT TCA AGC GGG AAG CCG TGC AGG AGG AGC GG-3′ and 5′-AGG GTA CCC TAA GTC ATT TGG TGC GGC GCC TCC-3′ for RXRαDE; 5′-AGG AAT TCT CGC CGA ACG ACC CTG TCA CC-3′ and 5′-AGG GTA CCC TAA GTC ATT TGG TGC GGC GCC TCC-3′ for RXRαE; and 5′-AGG AAT TCA TGG ACA CCA AAC ATT TCC TGC CG-3′ and 5′-AGG GTA CCC TAG ATG AGC TTG AAG AAG AAG AG-3′ for RXRα ΔAF2. The resulting PCR fragments were cut by EcoR1 and KpnI and cloned into the pCMV-FLAG vector. For construction of RXRαΔC and RXRαΔCD, the EcoR1 fragment containing the A/B region of RXRα was obtained by PCR amplification with primers 5′-AGG AAT TCA TGG ACA CCA AAC ATT TCC TGC CG-3′ and 5′-AGG AAT TCG ATG TGC TTG GTG AAG GAA GCC-3′ and inserted into constructs RXRαDE and RXRαE at the EcoR1 site in front of the DE and E regions of RXRα, respectively. For making RXRαΔD, the EcoR1 fragment containing the ABC region of RXRα was prepared by PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-AGG AAT TCA TGG ACA CCA AAC ATT TCC TGC CG-3′ and 5′-AGG AAT TCC ATG CCC ATG GCC AGG CAC TTC-3′ and inserted into the EcoR1 site in front of the E region in construct RXRαE. Antibodies—Native or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG tag in RXRα, M2, and HRP-M2 were purchased from Sigma. Native or HRP-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies against the V5 tag in β-catenin, V5, and HRP-V5, respectively, were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of RXRα (D20), the C terminus of β-catenin (H102), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, H-250), GSK3β (H76), and a mouse monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin (D-10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Lines—HEK293, HeLa, CV1, and SW480 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To generate the cell lines CAT and mCAT that stably expresses β-catenin or ΔNβ-catenin, respectively, pGS-β-catenin or pGS-ΔNβ-catenin was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were subjected to selection in the presence of zeocin (Invitrogen) at 400–500 μg/ml. The selection medium was changed every 3 days, and individual zeocin-resistant clones were isolated. Clones stably expressing β-catenin or ΔNβ-catenin were identified by Western blotting. To produce CATXα and mCATXα cell lines that stably express RXRα with wild type β-catenin or mutant ΔNβ-catenin, pGS-β-catenin and pGS-ΔNβ-catenin were transfected into cell line Xα that stably expresses FLAG-tagged RXRα. These cell lines were established as described above. Inhibitors—Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and MG262 were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories and Calbiochem, respectively. Lysosome inhibitors, bafilomycin, leupeptin, E-64, and ammonium chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Reporter Gene Assays—For measuring the TOPFLASH activity, cells were seeded at 50,000 cells per well in 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (BD Biosciences). Twenty-four hours later, TOPFLASH and expression vectors were co-transfected into cells using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) in DMEM containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS. To monitor transfection efficiency, either 15 ng of phRG-TK renilla or 100 ng of CMX-LacZ DNA were co-transfected. Five hours later, vehicle or retinoids were added. The cells were treated for 16 h before harvest. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual luciferase reporter 100 assay system (Promega). Control Renilla activity was determined using the same kit. A second control, β-galactosidase activity, was measured by colorimetric assays. The reporter activity was normalized against either β-galactosidase or Renilla activity. Analysis of RXRα and its mutants in transactivation was performed as follows. 3.5 × 103 CV-1 cells per well of a 96-well opaque plate (Falcon) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE with the reporter plasmid CRBPII-TK-Luc together with 0.04 μg of RXRα mutants. Five hours later, DMEM containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS and retinoids were added to the wells. Cells were grown for a further 18 h and lysed for determination of luciferase activity. Protein Expression and Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 per plate into 100-mm dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS and, on the next day, transfected with 1–4 μg of various cDNA or parental expression vectors (8 μg of DNA in total) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Five hours later, the cells were fed with fresh DMEM medium containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS and vehicle or retinoids. After the retinoid treatment, the total cell lysates were prepared using a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Merck). The cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a QIAshredder (Qiagen) and cleared from insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a bench top Eppendorf centrifuge. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to either nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. After the removal of unbound antibodies, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for1hat room temperature and washed five times with PBST. The antibody-associated protein bands were revealed using the ECL plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells in growth phase were washed with RPMI 1640 medium without cysteine, methionine, and glutamine (Cell-gro), starved in the same medium for 60 min, and pulse-labeled using 200 μCi of 35S Promix (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Then, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640 three times and chased with the medium supplemented with cysteine (50 μg/ml), methionine (15 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) in the presence or absence of AGN194204. Total cell extracts were prepared as described above. RXRα and β-catenin were immunoprecipitated using the M2 and V5 antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and treated with the reagent Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min, vacuum-dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In Vivo Protein Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells at ∼80% confluence in 150-mm poly-d-lysine-coated plates (BD Biosciences) were transfected with expression vectors for β-catenin (8 μg), ΔN-β-catenin (8 μg), and RXRα (4 μg) and cultured overnight in DMEM containing high glucose and 10% activated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with vehicle or 1 μm AGN194204 for 20 min in the same medium and then with 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce), a reversible crosslinking reagent, in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. The reaction was quenched for 15 min by Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at 20 mm. The cells were lysed in ice-chilled radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and homogenized by QIAshredder (Qiagen). The extracts (1.5 mg per immunoprecipitation) were incubated overnight with specific antibodies and protein G-agarose beads with constant shaking at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated materials were washed with the ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading dye containing β-mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. This procedure frees the DSP-crosslinked molecules pulled down by the antibodies. Proteins were resolved on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. HEK293, mCAT (HEK293-derived cells stably expressing ΔNβ-catenin), Xα (HEK293-derived cells stably expressing RXRα), and mCATXα cells were seeded at 200–400 cells/well in regular growth medium. The next day, vehicle or retinoids were added. Cell proliferation was measured after 6 days of treatment using a cell proliferation kit purchased from Chemicon International. RXR Agonists Inactivate β-Catenin-mediated Transcription via Endogenous and Transfected RXRs—We investigated the effect of RXR-specific agonists on β-catenin-mediated TCF/LEF transcriptional activity, a surrogate marker for the oncogenic activity of β-catenin, using the TOPFLASH reporter gene, which contains TCF/LEF binding sites (22Korinek V.

In HEK293 cells, the significant reporter activity produced by endogenous β-catenin was reduced by AGN194204, an RXR-specific agonist (20Vuligonda V. Thacher S.M. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in the absence (∼50%) or presence (∼70%) of transfected RXRα (Fig. 1, a and b). The significantly increased reporter activity obtained with β-catenin transfection was still very effectively (∼80%) reduced by AGN194204 treatment in the presence of cotransfected RXRα (Fig 1, a and b). Similar inhibition was observed in CATXα cells that were stably transfected with both β-catenin and RXRα, whereas the AGN194204 effect was less pronounced in CAT cells that were stably transfected with only β-catenin (Fig. 1c). RXR Agonists Induce β-Catenin Degradation via Endogenous and Overexpressed RXRs—Because APC-dependent protein degradation pathways regulate β-catenin-mediated transcription (6Polakis P.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether AGN194204 inhibited TOPFLASH reporter activity by reducing β-catenin protein levels. HEK293 cells were treated with vehicle or the RXR agonist, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2a, AGN194204 decreased endogenous β-catenin (∼50%) and RXRα levels in HEK293 cells in the absence of transfected RXRα. AGN194204 further reduced endogenous β-catenin (∼80%) in the presence of transfected RXRα. In HEK293 cells transfected with β-catenin alone, AGN194204 had no effect on β-catenin because of the low levels of endogenous RXRα relative to transfected β-catenin (Fig. 2b). However, it dramatically reduced β-catenin protein levels concurrent with RXRα protein levels in cells transfected with both RXRα and β-catenin. Similar AGN194204 effects were obtained in stably transfected HEK293 cells (CATXα; Fig. 2c) or transiently transfected CV1, HeLa, and SW480 cells (Fig. 2e), indicating the ubiquitous nature of this phenomenon. The AGN194204 effects on reducing β-catenin protein levels were time- (Fig. 2c) and dose-dependent (Fig. 2f), and the efficiency of the reduction depended on RXR protein levels (Fig. 2, a and d). AGN194204 readily caused a significant decrease of β-catenin at a dose as low as 1 nm (Fig. 2f), reflecting its high affinity for RXRα. Several different RXR agonists, including AGN195362, AGN195456, AGN195741, AGN196060, AGN196459, and 9-cis retinoic acid, similarly reduced β-catenin protein levels (Fig. 2g, and data not shown). An RXR-specific antagonist, AGN195393 (24Dussault I. Beard R. Lin M. Hollister K. Chen J. Xiao J.H. Chandraratna R. Forman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), dose-dependently inhibited the AGN194204 effects on β-catenin and RXR protein levels (Fig. 2f). An RAR agonist, TTNPB, or an RAR antagonist, AGN194310, showed no effects (Fig. 2g). Pulse-chase analysis was performed to ascertain whether the RXR agonist effect occurs at the level of protein degradation. AGN194204 accelerated degradation of both 35S-labeled RXRα and β-catenin (Fig. 2h). In the presence of cycloheximide and the absence of AGN194204, β-catenin is readily subjected to degradation by the active APC-pathways in HEK293 cells (compare lane 3 to lane 1 in Fig. 2i) as expected. However, cycloheximide did not block the AGN194204-induced degradation of β-catenin and RXRα (comparing lane 4 to lane 3 in Fig. 2i), indicating that induction of transcriptional activity is not required for this effect. Together, these data indicate that RXR agonists reduce β-catenin protein levels by an RXR-mediated protein degradation pathway, which is independent of the RXR-mediated gene transcription activation pathway. In cells where the Siah- and GSK3β-regulated APC pathways are impaired by mutations or GSK3β is inhibited by Wnt signaling, levels of β-catenin are increased in the cytoplasmic compartment, and, ultimately, β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus where it transactivates the TCF/LEF-targeted genes. Our transactivation data indicated that nuclear β-catenin-related transcriptional activity was reduced by RXR agonists. We further examined whether inhibition of β-catenin-mediated gene transcription by AGN194204 is due to a reduction of β-catenin protein levels in the nucleus with an analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions of CATXα cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and β-tubulin were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, respectively, for monitoring the efficiency of separation of the two fractions. Decreases in β-catenin protein levels as a result of AGN194204 treatment were observed in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments (Fig. 2, j and k). The APC-dependent degradation of β-catenin and the agonist-dependent degradation of RXR proceed by proteasomal pathways (6Polakis P. Cell. 2001; 105: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de Thé H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether the RXR agonist-induced degradation of β-catenin involves this pathway, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG262 and MG132. As shown in Fig. 2, l and m, these two inhibitors dose-dependently blocked AGN 194204-induced degradation of both β-catenin and RXRα. However, lysosomal inhibitors such as bafilomycin, E64, NH4Cl, and leupeptin had no effect (data not shown). These data indicate that RXR agonist-induced degradation of β-catenin also proceeds by a proteasomal pathway. The RXR-regulated β-Catenin Degradation Pathway Is Independent of the p53/Siah-1- and GSK3β-regulated APC Pathways—To determine whether the GSK3β- or p53/Siah-regulated APC pathways are involved in the RXR agonist effects, a β-catenin mutant (ΔNβ-catenin) with a deletion of the N-terminal sequence (50 amino acids) that is targeted by the two APC-dependent pathways was prepared (6Polakis P.

Although this mutant, which is resistant to APC-mediated degradation pathways, showed higher TOPFLASH reporter gene activity than wild-type β-catenin, its increased activity was very effectively inhibited by AGN194204 in the presence of RXRα (Fig. 1d). High levels of TOPFLASH reporter activity associated with elevated β-catenin levels have been reported in SW480 colorectal cancer cells wherein both APC and p53 genes contain loss-of-function mutations (22Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 23Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

However, AGN194204 effectively inhibited reporter activity in SW480 cells containing cotransfected RXRα (Fig. 1e), which is consistent with the observed decrease in endogenous β-catenin levels in these cells (Fig. 2a). Similarly, whereas LiCl, a GSK3β inhibitor that is known to elevate free β-catenin levels (26Playford M.P. Bicknell"
https://openalex.org/W2013192515,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a major survival factor for malignant plasma cells involved in multiple myeloma. Using an RNase protection assay, we looked for gene expression of 10 anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins in 12 IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). A high Mcl-1 gene expression was found in all HMCLs and the other genes were variably expressed. Out of the 10 Bcl-2-family members, only the Mcl-1 gene was regulated by IL-6. Upon starvation of IL-6, Mcl-1 gene expression decreased in association with myeloma cell apoptosis and was upregulated after adding IL-6 again in association with myeloma cell survival. A constitutive Mcl-1 expression was induced with an Mcl-1-GFP retrovirus in two IL-6-dependent HMCLs. The Mcl-1 HMCLs have a marked reduced apoptosis upon IL-6 starvation compared to HMCLs transduced with control GFP retrovirus and may grow without adding IL-6. These data emphasize the major role of Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein in the IL-6-induced survival of human myeloma cells."

The PA protein can be divided into four domains based on its crystal structure, and functions can be attributed to the different domains based on mutational and biochemical analyses (16Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Domain 1 (residues 1–258) contains the furin cleavage site as well as the hydrophobic portion of PA, which is exposed upon furin cleavage to allow EF and LF to bind (16Petosa C. Collier R.J.

Several lines of evidence indicate that domain 2 (residues 259–487) is involved in oligomerization and contains the loop that inserts into the membrane to form the channel through which the LF and EF enter the cytosol (16Petosa C.

Various amino acids in domain 3 (residues 488–595) are necessary for oligomerization, and this has been the only function attributed to domain 3 to date (21Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. J.

Commun. 2001; 287: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Domain 4 (residues 596–735) is essential for binding to cellular receptor as indicated by several lines of evidence. A CNBr fragment of PA containing residues 663–735 successfully competed with PA in cell binding assays, and mutations in domain 4 prevented PA binding to cells (23Noskov A.N. Kravchenko T.B. Noskova V.P. Mol. Gen. Mikrobiol. Virusol. 1996; 6: 16-20Google Scholar, 24Brossier F. Sirard J.C. Guidi-Rontani C. Duflot E. Mock M. Infect.

Monoclonal antibody and mutational analysis studies further localized the residues necessary for binding to receptor. Monoclonal antibody 14B7 neutralized anthrax toxin by inhibiting PA binding to receptor and recognized a region of PA between residues 671 and 721 (17Little S.F. Novak J.M. Lowe J.R. Leppla S.H. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Lidgerding B.C. Friedlander A.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, multisubstituted PA variants in and near the small loop of domain 4 (between β strands 4β8 and 4β9) suggested that residues essential for binding were in that region (25Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alanine substitutions described in this work cover the small loop (amino acids 679–693) of domain 4. We also included another residue, Asn657, located nearby in the crystal structure and implicated by our earlier multisubstituted variants. The development of new reagents to prevent and treat anthrax can be aided by our understanding of the molecular interactions between the toxin components and cellular targets as well as by interactions between the toxin components and potential reagents. One of the molecular reactions it would be beneficial to understand in molecular detail would be that between anthrax toxin and its cellular receptor. As noted above, much progress has been made in the study of PA and recently also with its cellular receptors, TEM8 and capillary morphogenesis protein 2, but studies of the interaction between the toxin with receptor have to date been limited to deletions or multiple substitutions in the proteins (6Liu S.

One goal of this study was to determine which individual amino acids in the previously identified region of PA were important for interaction with its receptor. For development of improved vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics, it would be helpful to identify the residues in PA necessary for recognition and neutralization of PA. 14B7 is one of a group of monoclonal antibodies that neutralize anthrax toxin by inhibiting the binding of PA to cells (26Little S.F. Leppla S.H. Cora E. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each antibody in this class recognizes an antigenic region between amino acids 671 and 721 of PA (17Little S.F.

The second goal of this work was to identify amino acids in the small loop region of PA domain 4 necessary for interaction with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 14B7.

RAW264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Glutamax I, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. CHO cell clone 6 (CHO-CL6) and a furin-deficient cell line, CHO FD11, were previously described (6Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 5227-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm GlutaMax I, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Production and Purification of Small Loop Mutants—PA variants were constructed from parental plasmid pYS5 (32Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each variant, mutagenic primers encoding the desired amino acid substitution were made for each strand. The region between the change and the unique BamHI site downstream of the PA coding region on pYS5 was amplified with one mutagenic primer and a primer matching the BamHI site. The other mutagenic primer and a primer complementary to the unique PstI site in the PA coding region were used to amplify the region between the desired mutation and the PstI site. The products from the two reactions were then used to prime off each other in a third PCR whose product gave a fragment containing the desired change, having PstI- and BamHI-cut sites on the ends. The PCR products and pYS5 were each digested with PstI and BamHI prior to ligation. The construct for each variant was verified by sequencing. PA variants were produced and purified in a modification of previously described methods (25Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ramirez D.M. Leppla S.H. Schneerson R. Shiloach J. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 28: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, PA was expressed and secreted by B. anthracis strain BH445. Culture supernatants containing the desired protein were adjusted to 5 mm EDTA and filter-sterilized prior to the addition of ammonium sulfate to 2 m. Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow resin was then added in batch. After binding for 1 h with gentle mixing at 4 °C, resin was collected in a plastic Buchner funnel and washed with 600 ml of cold buffer (1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). PA variants were eluted from the resin with 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The resultant proteins were further purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (47 g/100 ml of eluted protein) followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100 column. Fractions were eluted from the column with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. Pooled fractions containing the PA variants were ∼90% pure, as judged on gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and were stored frozen at –80 °C. Cytotoxicity and Neutralization Assays—Cytotoxicity assays were performed with both RAW264.7 (mouse macrophage) and CHO-CL6 cell lines. For RAW264.7 assays, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 30,000–35,000 cells/well and incubated overnight. The next morning growth medium was removed by aspiration and replaced with 125 μl of new medium containing 200 ng/ml LF and a dilution series of PA or PA variants ranging from 0 to 1000 ng/ml, where each tested dilution was made in triplicate wells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cell viability was determined by the addition of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Viable cells converted the MTT to an insoluble blue pigment, which was measured as previously described (34Varughese M. Chi A. Teixeira A.V. Nicholls P.J. Keith J.M. Leppla S.H. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 87-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were plotted and analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego) as the percentage viability of control wells containing LF without PA. EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression sigmoidal dose-response analysis with variable slopes. Each assay was performed three times, and the graphs from a representative assay are shown in Fig. 1. Variant to wild type ratios of EC50 values were calculated. CHO-CL6 cytotoxicity assays were performed similarly, with two exceptions: 1) the cells were plated at a density of ∼15,000 cells/well, because after the addition of the toxins (50 ng/ml FP59 with a dilution series of PA or PA variants from 0 to 2000 ng/ml), cells were incubated 48 h prior to MTT addition; 2) FP59, a recombinant toxin consisting of the N-terminal PA-binding portion of LF fused to the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, was used in place of LF, because CHO cells are not lysed by lethal toxin. EC50 values were determined for three independent assays as above and are reported with S.E. 14B7 neutralization assays were also performed in 96-well plates in a similar manner as described above with RAW264.7 cells. In the 14B7 neutralization assays, PA or toxic PA variant and LF (200 ng/ml each) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 14B7 in a serial dilution from 0 to 10 μg/ml. Neutralization by rabbit polyclonal anti-PA antibody 5308 was tested by adding serum at a 1:800 dilution for preincubation with PA or toxic PA variant and LF (200 ng/ml each). For both types of assays (14B7 or polyclonal 5308), after the preincubation, the toxin/antibody solutions were added to cells from which medium had been aspirated and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The MTT addition and analysis were identical to those in the cytotoxicity assays. Assay of PA Binding to Cells—CHO FD11 cells were grown in 24-well plates to confluence. Cells were chilled to 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding medium (minimal essential medium with Hanks' salts, 1% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes). PA proteins were added to a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and incubation continued for 2 h. Cell monolayers were then washed five times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Biofluids, Rock-ville, MD) containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 units/ml benzonase DNase (Novagen), and 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) per 20 ml. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Prior to loading, the cell lysates were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 6% glycerol). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, followed by Western blotting. PA was visualized by chemiluminescence using the West Pico Kit (Pierce). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—Biosensor experiments were conducted with a Biacore X instrument. The antibody was covalently attached to a carboxymethyl dextran surface of an F1 chip using standard amine coupling (35Schuck P. Boyd L.F. Andersen P.S. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 20.2.1-20.2.21Google Scholar), with the antibody dissolved at 0.08 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The reaction was stopped when 300–400 resonance units were cross-linked. Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and the surface was regenerated with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0. For wild type PA and each variant, a series of association and dissociation sensorgrams were collected at different protein concentrations, starting at the stock concentration between 1 and 10 mg/ml and proceeding in serial dilutions by a factor 2 or 3 until no significant binding was detected. Each association sensorgram was observed until steady-state was reached and was corrected for buffer refractive index offsets by subtraction of the signal from a nonfunctionalized surface. After each concentration series, the stability of the surface was verified by injection of 1 μm (83 μg/ml) wild type PA. Mathematical data analysis was based on a model with a heterogeneous population of surface sites with continuous binding constant distributions (36Svitel J. Balbo A. Mariuzza R.A. Gonzales N.R. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4062-4077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, the measured equilibrium surface binding signal s(c) was described as a superposition of binding signals s eq(K A, c) from different populations of sites with different affinity, s(c)=∫KA,minKA,maxseq(KA,c)P(KA)dKA(Eq. 1) each following a Langmuir isotherm (37Langmuir I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1918; 40: 1361-1403Crossref Scopus (17710) Google Scholar). seq(KA,c)=1/(1+(KAc)-1)(Eq. 2) The differential affinity distribution P(K A) was integrated over the peak of the high affinity sites to give a weight average estimate of the binding constant (36Svitel J. Balbo A. Mariuzza R.A. Gonzales N.R. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4062-4077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Analytical Centrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-I/A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Antibody, wild type PA or variants, and mixtures were dissolved in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at loading concentrations of 0.1–0.3 mg/ml, and equilibrium absorbance profiles were acquired at rotor speeds of 9,000, 13,000, and 17,000 rpm; at a rotor temperature of 4 °C; and at wavelengths of 230, 250, and 280 nm. Protein extinction coefficients at 280 nm were estimated using the software SEDNTERP, kindly provided by Dr. J. Philo. Buoyant molar mass values for the proteins were obtained experimentally but were consistent with estimated values derived from amino acid sequence. Binding constants were calculated by global nonlinear regression with the software SEDPHAT, based on equations for the radial concentration distribution of ideally sedimenting species in mechanical and chemical equilibrium as described elsewhere (38Svedberg T. Pedersen K.O. The Ultracentrifuge. Oxford University Press, London1940Google Scholar, 39Schuck P. Braswell E.H. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). The model for the analysis of the radial total protein distribution included four exponential terms, accounting for free antibody, free PA, and 1:1 and 1:2 complexes, linked at each radius by mass action law and the statistical factors for independent binding to two identical sites. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at a rotor speed of 45,000 rpm and a temperature of 20 °C. Antibody, wild type PA or variants, and mixtures were diluted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. 220 μl of PA solutions were filled in the sample sector of Epon double-sector centerpieces, and mixtures of PA with antibody were filled in the reference sector. The light intensity transmitted through both sectors at 280 nm was measured with the absorbance scanning system in time intervals of 400 s. Using the software SEDFIT, the intensity data were transformed into pseudoabsorbance data (40Kar S.R. Kingsbury J.S. Lewis M.S. Laue T.M. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the model of diffusion-corrected sedimentation coefficient distributions, c(s) (41Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar, 42Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). As a result, separate sedimentation coefficient distributions for the PA and the mixtures were obtained, which resolved free PA, antibody, and the complex. Interpretation of the sedimentation coefficient distributions directly allowed both the determination of the active concentration of PA variants and the semiquantitative assessment of the strength of the interaction between PA and the antibody from the sedimentation coefficient of the complex. Several Residues in the Small Loop Region of PA Domain 4 Are Important for Toxicity—Previous studies in our laboratory with multiple substitutions in PA domain 4 indicated that the small loop region was critical for binding to the anthrax receptor (25Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the importance of individual residues, we made a set of alanine-scanning mutants covering the domain 4 small loop and including residue Asn657, which is outside the small loop but located nearby in the crystal structure. In a few cases, we made doubly or triply substituted proteins to ascertain if effects would be additive or cooperative. Initial assessments of binding ability were made utilizing the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cell line, which rapidly lyses upon the addition of PA and LF. If the PA variants failed to bind, the cells would be unaffected by the addition of LF and would metabolize the MTT dye similarly to untreated controls, forming a blue pigment. Variants that successfully bound to the receptor would transport LF, causing cell lysis and the inability to convert MTT to a blue pigment. The assay was performed three times, with results from a representative assay shown in Fig. 1A. The RAW264.7 assay exhibited slightly variable EC50 values from day to day, but the ratios of the substituted proteins to wild type remained constant. The range of ratios for PA variant/wild type EC50 values calculated from the three independent assays is reported in Table I.Table IProperties of domain 4 small loop region variantsVariantRAW264.7 EC50 variant/WTaWT, wild type.CHO-CL6 EC50bValues and S.E. reported for three assays, except when noted otherwise.14B7 neutralizationKDng/mlWT11.02 ± 0.16++<6 nmcDetermined by sedimentation equilibrium.

https://openalex.org/W2014632249,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and in silico expression analysis were applied to identify genes significantly downregulated in breast cancer within the genomic interval 6q23–25. Systematic comparison of candidate EST sequences with genomic sequences from this interval revealed the genomic structure of a potential target gene on 6q24.3, which we called SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1). Loss of the gene-internal marker D6S311, found in 30% of primary breast cancer, was significantly correlated with poor survival and increase in tumor size. Two SASH1 transcripts of approximately 4.4 and 7.5 kb exist and are predominantly transcribed in the human breast, lung, thyroid, spleen, placenta and thymus. In breast cancer cell lines, SASH1 is only expressed at low levels. SASH1 is downregulated in the majority (74%) of breast tumors in comparison with corresponding normal breast epithelial tissues. In addition, SASH1 is also downregulated in tumors of the lung and thyroid. Analysis of the protein domain structure revealed that SASH1 is a member of a recently described family of SH3/SAM adapter molecules and thus suggests a role in signaling pathways. We assume that SASH1 is a new tumor suppressor gene possibly involved in tumorigenesis of breast and other solid cancers. We were unable to find mutations in the coding region of the gene in primary breast cancers showing LOH within the critical region. We therefore hypothesize that other mechanisms as for instance methylation of the promoter region of SASH1 are responsible for the loss of expression of SASH1 in primary and metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2070768089,"Human immunodeficiency virus binds and enters cells via the Envelope glycoprotein gp160 at its surface. In infected cells, gp160 is found not only on the plasma membrane but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our aim was to establish rate-determining steps in the maturation process of gp160, using a radioactive pulse-chase approach. We found that gp160 has an intricate folding process: disulfide bonds start to form during synthesis but undergo extensive isomerization until the correct native conformation is reached. Removal of the leader peptide critically depends on formation of at least some disulfide bonds in subunit gp120 during folding. Envelope folds extremely slowly and therefore resides in the ER longer than other proteins, but the yield of properly folded molecules is high and degradation is undetectable. The large quantity of gp160 in the ER hence is a result of its slow transit through this compartment. We show here that newly synthesized HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein apparently follows a slow but high-yield folding path in which co- and post-translational formation of disulfide bonds in gp120, disulfide isomerization and conformation dependent removal of the leader sequence are determining and intertwined events."
https://openalex.org/W2084957323,"Grb10 is a protein that binds to the intracellular domains of activated tyrosine kinase receptors, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and insulin receptors. This occurs through the interaction of two C-terminal Grb10 motifs (BPS and Src homology domains) with receptor phosphotyrosine residues. Published data from transfection/overexpression studies support both positive and negative regulatory effects of Grb10, thus leaving its physiological role unclear. Because Grb10 has the structure of an adapter protein, the objective of this study was to determine whether Grb10 links other proteins to IGF-I receptors and thus modulates IGF-I signaling. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, the N terminus of Grb10 was shown to interact with two novel proteins, designated GIGYF1 (Grb10 interacting GYF protein 1) and GIGYF2. Mutation analysis indicates that a 17-amino acid sequence in GIGYF1 and GIGYF2, homologous to the GYF domain described previously, binds to tandem proline-rich regions in the N terminus of Grb10. In IGF-I receptor-expressing R+ fibroblasts, there is detectable binding of a Myc-tagged fragment of GIGYF1 to Grb10 in the basal state. Stimulation with IGF-I results in increased binding of GIGYF1 to Grb10 and transient binding of both Grb10 and GIGYF1 to IGF-I receptors, presumably via the adapter function of Grb10. At later time points, GIGYF1 dissociates, but Grb10 remains linked to IGF-I receptors. Overexpression of the Grb10 binding fragment of GIGYF1 in R+ cells results in a significant increase in IGF-I-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, we have identified two members of a novel protein family, which become transiently linked to IGF-I receptors by the Grb10 adapter protein following IGF-I stimulation.

Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) has shown greater Grb10 binding to insulin versus IGF-I receptors, although significant interaction of Grb10 with both receptors can be demonstrated readily. This is consistent with data showing that the tandem BPS and SH2 domains are involved in the interaction with the insulin receptor, whereas only the BPS domain binds strongly to the IGF-I receptor (11He W.

The interaction of Grb10 with insulin and IGF-I receptors involves receptor phosphotyrosine residues and is dependent on receptor activation. Grb10 is not directly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to hormone stimulation (17Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb10 has been reported as a result of its interaction with Tec (18Mano H. Ohya K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Ogawa W. Inazawa J. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Hatake K. Kasuga M. Ozawa K. Kajigaya S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Src (17Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Grb10 proteins are serine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and insulin (3Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of this phosphorylation is still unknown. Grb10 is believed to have a role in regulating cellular responses to insulin, IGF-I, and possibly other hormones. However, published studies on the effects of Grb10 overexpression in cultured cells have provided conflicting evidence for stimulatory versus inhibitory actions on mitogenesis and other hormone responses. For example, overexpression of human Grb10β in Chinese hamster ovary cells was shown to reduce both insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Data showing an inhibitory effect of Grb10α on IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis, as well as a decrease in the catalytic activity of both insulin and IGF-I receptors (19Stein E.G. Gustafson T.A. Hubbard S.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), also have been reported (20Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, other published work suggests positive effects of Grb10 on insulin and IGF-I action. Overexpression of a presumed dominant-negative fragment of Grb10, lacking the BPS-SH2 domain, partially inhibited cell growth stimulation by insulin and IGF-I in rat fibroblasts (5O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In another study, a presumed dominant-negative SH2 domain fragment decreased cell proliferation, whereas overexpression of full-length Grb10 increased DNA synthesis upon growth factor treatment (21Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Swamy O.R. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The conflicting data do not appear to be attributable to the effects of different Grb10 isoforms or the properties of specific cell types and thus leave the physiological role of Grb10, as well its mechanism of action, unclear. The SH2 domain of Grb10 has been reported to bind to some intracellular molecules such as mitogen-activated receptor 1, mitochondria-associated Raf (22Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Nantel A. Huber M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35719-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd-4 (24Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in addition to its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases. However, there are no data on the functional significance of these interactions as they may relate to Grb10 effects on cell signaling. In a recent study, an interaction between Grb10 and Akt was demonstrated, suggesting a role for Grb10 in promoting Akt translocation to the plasma membrane in response to c-kit receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, thus augmenting Akt activity (16Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The determinants of binding of Grb10 to Akt were not elucidated, although the PH and the SH2 domains were excluded. Because Grb10 has the structure of an adapter protein, it has the potential to function as a bridge protein, with the C terminus bound to phosphorylated receptors and the N-terminal region bound to one or more other proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid cloning system with the N-terminal portion of Grb10 as a bait, we have identified two novel proteins that bind to Grb10, which we have designated GIGYF1 (Grb10 interacting GYF protein 1) and GIGYF2. Studies on GIGYF1 demonstrate that it associates with Grb10 in cultured cells, becomes linked to activated IGF-I receptors, and modifies IGF-I signaling. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast strains L40 and AMR 70, the yeast expression vectors pVP16 and pBTM116, and 9.5- and 10.5-day mouse embryo cDNA libraries, plus a TA-1 fat cell library, in pVP16 were provided by Stanley Hollenberg (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (25Vojtec A.B. Hollemberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 26Hollemberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The LexA fusion plasmid pBTM116 was constructed by Paul Bartel and Stanley Fields (27Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglandz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Pratical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). To obtain a LexA-Grb10 hybrid construct, the mGrb10δ full-length cDNA (6Laviola L. Giorgino F. Chow J.C. Baquero J.A. Hansen H. Ooi J. Zhu J. Ridel H. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI-SalI. The resulting 516-bp fragment (Grb10-NT), which includes the complete proline-rich region of Grb10, was subcloned into the yeast vector pBTM116. The L40 yeast strain was transformed with pBTM116 containing the fused LexA-Grb10-NT coding sequence by a standard lithium acetate protocol (28Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 29Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). After growth in Trp– medium, L40/pBTM116/Grb10-NT yeast cells were transformed with a pool of pVP16/9.5-day and pVP16/10.5-day mouse embryo cDNA libraries and, separately, with a TA-1 mouse fat cell cDNA library in λGT11. Transformation with 500 μg of library plasmid DNA yielded ∼12 × 106 primary transformants, as confirmed by colony growth in Trp–/Leu– medium. The yeast were subsequently grown in Trp–/Leu– liquid medium for 16 h to allow for the expression and formation of the transactivating LexA/VP16 complex, and a fraction of the yeast suspension (corresponding to ∼4 × 106 transformants) was plated on Trp–/Leu–/His– plates. Library clones showing activation of both reporter genes (HIS3 and LacZ) were tested in the two-hybrid system for specificity of association with the Grb10-NT using a LexA-lamin construct as a negative control. Plasmids from library clones were subsequently isolated from the yeast, transferred to Escherichia coli, sequenced, and used to search for similar sequences in GenBank™. Full-length GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 cDNA Cloning—Approximately 6 × 105 plaques from a 15-day mouse embryo cDNA library in λGT11 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were screened with standard techniques using as probes partial cDNAs of GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 obtained from the two-hybrid screening. Clones obtained by this method containing the largest inserts of GIGYF1 (lacking a portion of the 5′ coding region) and GIGYF2 (lacking both 5′ and 3′ coding sequences) were chosen for further study. The remaining 5′ coding sequence of GIGYF1 was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR of mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using the Smart RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), a forward adapter primer, and GIGYF1-specific reverse primer. The product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions. The missing 5′ end of GIGYF2 was amplified from mouse liver Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) using the Smart RACE cDNA amplification kit as described for GIGYF1. The terminal 3′ coding sequence of GIGYF2 was amplified from mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA (Ambion) by Smart RACE, cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector, and sequenced in both directions. Northern Blotting—GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 probes (571 and 388 bp, respectively) were generated by NotI excision of the GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 cDNAs from the pVP16 plasmids obtained from the two-hybrid screening and labeled with [32P] deoxy-CTP by random priming (multiple DNA labeling kit; Amersham Biosciences). A mouse multiple tissue poly(A)+ mRNA Northern blot (mouse MTN™ blot; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized overnight with radiolabeled probes at 65 °C and washed twice with 2× SSC-0.05% SDS (40 min each) and once with 0.1× SSC-0.1% SDS, and specific mRNA bands were identified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletion mutations of the proline-rich region of Grb10 and the GYF domain of GIGYF1 were generated using the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 25–30-bp primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of each of three proline-rich boxes or the GYF domain, respectively. The proline-rich box 1 deletion (aa 78–89), box 2 deletion (aa 94–102), and box 3 deletion (aa 106–113) were amplified using the appropriate site-specific primers with a fragment of Grb10 in pBluescript as a template. The double proline-rich box deletions 1,2 (aa 78–102), 1,3 (aa 78–89 and 106–113), and 2,3 (aa 94–113) were amplified using appropriate combinations of the same primers as the single box mutations and with single-deletion mutants as templates. The 17-aa GYF domain deletion of GIGYF1 was amplified with specific primers using a fragment of GIGYF1 in pBluescript as template. Point mutations of the 17-aa GYF region of GIGYF1 (W489A, G503A, Y504A, F505A) were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The manufacturer's protocol was followed using sequence-specific primers and the GIGYF1/pGilda construct as a template. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the LexA-based Matchmaker kit (Clontech). GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 gene fragments were cloned into pGilda, and the Grb10 proline-rich domain (wild type) was cloned into pB42AD. The Grb10 and GIGYF1 mutants in pBluescript were subcloned into the pGilda yeast vector at EcoRI/BamHI and, sequentially, into pB42AD at the EcoRI/XhoI site. These constructs were transformed into the EGY48 yeast strain according to the manufacturer's protocol. Interactions between the Grb10 proline-rich domain and GIGYF1 or GIGYF2 were detected on selective medium agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal). A liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed on the co-transformed yeast cells, using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. GIGYF1 Fragment Transfection—A fragment of GIGYF1 containing aa 410–598 with an N-terminal Myc tag was generated by PCR using a forward primer containing the 10-aa sequence EQKLISEEDL recognized by Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) (Roche Applied Science) and reverse primer containing specific GIGYF1 cDNA sequence with the largest of the initial GIGYF1 two-hybrid clones as template. The PCR product was cloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of the pAdTrack vector (from Dr. T. C. He, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD), sequence-verified, and used for transient transfection in R+ IGF-I receptor overexpressing fibroblasts (30Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Barserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Renato Baserga, Jefferson Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Monolayers of R+ cells (30–40% confluent) in 10-cm dishes were incubated for 6 h with 9 μg of purified pAdTrack plasmid and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in 5.5 ml of OptiMem medium (Invitrogen) and then returned to standard growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 gm/liter glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 2.5 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). The cells were studied 48 h post-transfection. For stable transfection studies, a fragment of GIGYF1 containing aa 410 to 598 was generated by PCR using a forward primer designed to insert the six-aa DTYRYI N-terminal AU1 tag and reverse primer containing specific GIGYF1 cDNA sequence with the largest of the initial GIGYF1 two-hybrid clones as template. After cloning into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA 3.1 (Zeocin+) vector (Invitrogen) and sequence verification, the purified vector was transfected into R+ fibroblasts using the LipofectAMINE protocol as described above. After growth for 30 days in the presence of Zeocin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), clones were isolated by limiting dilution, tested for GIGYF1 expression by immunoblotting with AU1 monoclonal antibody (BabCO, Covance, Richmond, CA), and thereafter maintained in the presence of Zeocin (80 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected R+ cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES. IGF-I was added to the medium at a final concentration of 10–7m, and the cells were incubated for 0, 2, or 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with ice-cold buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm Na2VO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and lysed in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na2VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 μg/ml leupeptin. After clearing by centrifugation, protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. To determine Grb10/GIGYF1 association, 0.5 mg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb10 antibody and blotted with anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science). Phosphorylation of IGF-I receptors and IRS-1 was measured by direct blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). Shc phosphorylation was examined by blotting with a polyclonal phosphospecific Shc antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). Phosphorylation of ERK and Akt was measured using phosphospecific ERK antibody (from Dr. Laurie Goodyear, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) and phosphospecific Akt antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Specific antibodies were used to measure the content of IGF-I receptors (31Giorgino F. Chen J.-H. Smith R.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1433-1444PubMed Google Scholar), IRS-1, and Shc (Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA) by direct immunoblotting. Specific protein bands were identified with 125I-protein A and quantified on a PhosphorImager or identified by ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified on a densitometer. Statistical Analysis—Data from densitometric analysis were adjusted to reflect percent stimulation of specific proteins in transfected cells at each time point with respect to empty vector transfected controls. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. and were subjected to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, followed by paired t tests for comparisons between transfected cells and empty vector controls at each time point. Two-hybrid Cloning of Proteins Binding the N-terminal Region of Grb10 —A number of receptors and other tyrosine phosphoproteins have been identified that bind to the C-terminal region domains in Grb10. To search for proteins that bind to the N-terminal portion of Grb10 and thus may be linked to receptors by Grb10, yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening was performed using as a bait an N-terminal fragment of mouse Grb10δ that contains several proline-rich boxes but lacks the PH, BPS, and SH2 domains. The yeast vector pBTM116 expressing a fragment of mouse Grb10δ (aa 1–172) as a fusion protein linked to the C terminus of the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor LexA was introduced into the yeast reporter strain L40. Yeast expressing the pLexA-Grb10 fragment fusion protein were then transformed with combined 9.5- and 10.5-day mouse embryo or differentiated TA-1 fat cell cDNA expression libraries in fusion with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (25Vojtec A.B. Hollemberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). With this system, positive clones are identified by detecting the activation of two reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ, inserted into the L40 yeast genome with multiple LexA upstream activating sequences. A total of 64 and 78 yeast transformants were obtained from the embryo and fat cell libraries, respectively, representing 15 independent Grb10-interactive clones from the two libraries. Five of these clones consisted of partial sequences of two novel related proteins, which we have designated GIGYF1 and GIGYF2. GIGYF1 was encoded by three independent clones from the embryonic libraries and one clone from the fat cell library, whereas GIGYF2 was encoded by a single clone from the fat cell cDNA library. The GIGYF1 cDNA defined by the yeast two-hybrid clones represented a 571-bp ORF lacking a translation start site and stop codon. Similarly the GIGYF2 cDNA represented a 388-bp ORF lacking 5′ and 3′ terminal coding sequence. The remaining 10 clones were represented in single copy and were unrelated to GIGYF1 and GIGYF2. Full-length Cloning and Structural Analysis of GIGYF1 and GIGYF2—An extended 2473-bp cDNA encoding an additional 594 bp of 5′ sequence and the complete 3′ sequence was obtained by screening a mouse 15-day embryo cDNA library using the largest GIGYF1 cDNA from the two-hybrid cloning as a probe. An overlapping clone containing the remaining 659 bp of 5′ coding sequence was generated from mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA by 5′-RACE PCR, and full-length GIGYF1 cDNA containing 3132 bp of coding sequence was assembled in pBluscript by restriction digestion-ligation of the two overlapping clones. The full-length GIGYF2 cDNA (3876 bp of coding sequence) was obtained in a similar manner. Screening of the mouse 15-day embryo cDNA library yielded a 2677-bp clone lacking both 5′ and 3′ terminal coding sequence. These segments were generated by 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR using mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA, and the fragments were assembled by restriction digestionligation of overlapping clones. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 are homologous proteins with common structural elements encoded by distinct genes (Fig. 1, A and B). Structural motifs present in both GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 include three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and candidate binding sites for protein phosphatase-1 (RVPF), 14–3-3 proteins (RSpSXP), and phospholipase Cγ (V(F)DDY). In addition, there is a proline-rich region in both proteins, a consensus bipartite nuclear localization motif, and a region of clathrin light chain homology (Fig. 1B). A striking feature is multiple stretches of Gln and Glu residues in the C-terminal half of both proteins (Fig. 1A). Using the cloned cDNAs, mouse genomic sequences corresponding to both GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 were identified in GenBank™. The GIGYF1 gene mapped to mouse chromosome 5 as a relatively small gene (∼7000 bp) with a coding sequence of 3 kb composed of 24 exons and very short introns. Our cloned GIGYF1cDNA corresponds to an ORF that has been designated Perq1 (XM_124667) based on its high abundance of Pro, Glu, Arg, and Gln (32Wilson D.W. Riemer C. Martindale D.W. Schnupf P. Boright A.P. Cheung T.L. Hardy D.M. Schwartz S. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Miller W. Kop B.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There are several single nucleotide differences in the cloned GIGYF1 in comparison with the predicted ORF, three of which would result in amino acid sequence substitutions. The GIGYF1 cDNA that we have cloned includes an additional 30 aa extending N-terminally from the putative start site of the Perq1 protein proposed on the basis of genomic sequence. This region is encoded by an ORF that includes an addition 5′ exon and s"
https://openalex.org/W2044505153,"Our group recently identified Ras homolog member I (ARHI), a novel maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene that encodes a 26 kDa GTP-binding protein with high homology to Ras and Rap. Unlike other Ras family members, ARHI exhibits several unusual structural and functional properties. ARHI contains a unique 34 amino-acid extension at the N-terminus, and differs from Ras in residues critical for GTPase activity and in its putative effector domain. Like Ras, ARHI can bind to GTP with high affinity but has low intrinsic GTPase activity. In addition, while Ras is an oncogene, ARHI functions as an inhibitor for cell growth. (32)Phosphorus labeling showed that ARHI is maintained in a constitutively activated GTP-bound state in resting cells, possibly because of impaired GTPase activity. ARHI is associated at the cell membrane through its prenylation at the C-terminal cysteine residue. Mutation of the conserved CAAX box at the C-terminus led to a loss of its membrane association and a decreased ability to inhibit cell growth. Conversion of Ser(51) to Asn decreased GTP binding and reduced ARHI's biological activity. Mutation of Ala(46) to Val increased the ability of ARHI to inhibit cell growth, associated with a further decrease of its intrinsic GTPase activity. Moreover, conversion of residues in ARHI that are conserved in the Ras family for GTPase activity partially restored the GTPase activity in ARHI. Most strikingly, deletion of ARHI's unique N-terminal extension nearly abolished its inhibitory effect on cell growth, suggesting its importance in ARHI's inhibitory function. Thus, ARHI is a unique Ras family member that retains basic small GTPase function, but exhibits many unusual features. In contrast to most other Ras family members, ARHI has a long N-terminal extension, modest GTPase activity, and constitutive GTP binding in resting cells. Furthermore, unlike the Ras oncogene, ARHI inhibits cell growth, and loss of its expression in cells may contribute to the development of breast and ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2020619819,"Progressive liver dysfunction contributes significantly to the development of multiple organ failure after trauma/hemorrhage. This study tested the relative impact of necrotic and apoptotic cell death in a graded model of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial blood pressure=35+/-5 mmHg for 1, 2, or 3 h, followed by 2 h, 1 h, or no resuscitation, respectively) in rats. Prolonged periods of hemorrhagic hypotension (3 h) were paralleled by a profound decrease of hepatic ATP levels and occurrence of pericentral necrosis. Resuscitation after shorter periods of hemorrhagic hypotension resulted in restoration of tissue ATP whereas hepatocellular function as assessed by indocyanine green clearance remained depressed (49.9+/-1.6 mL/(min x kg) at baseline, 28.8+/-1.2 mL/(min x kg) after 2 h of resuscitation; P<0.05). Under these conditions, induction of caspase activity and DNA fragmentation were observed in pericentral hepatocytes that could be prevented by the radical scavenger tempol. Pretreatment with z-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-flouromethylketone prevented de novo expression of caspase-generated cytokeratin 18, DNA fragmentation, and depression of hepatocellular indocyanine green clearance. These data suggest that prolonged low flow/hypoxia induces ATP depletion and pericentral necrosis and restoration of oxygen supply and ATP levels after shorter periods of low flow ischemia propagate programmed cell death or ""pericentral apoptosis."""
https://openalex.org/W2023453290,"Susceptibility of T cells to TGF-beta1 produced by regulatory T cells has an important impact on the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance and therefore on the development of autoimmunity, cancer, and allergy. Histamine not only mediates the deleterious effects of allergic reactions, it can also modulate the Th1/Th2 cell balance. We demonstrate that histamine dose-dependently enhanced TGF-beta1-mediated suppression and TGF-beta1 responsiveness of CD4+ T cells. This effect was mediated by the histamine 2 receptor (H2R), as demonstrated by receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. Furthermore, the histamine effect on TGF-beta1 responsiveness was cAMP/PKA dependent. This pathway is activated by the H2R, which is preferentially expressed on Th2 cells. Thus a higher additive effect of histamine on TGF-beta1 responsiveness was found in Th2 cells compared with Th1 cells. In fact, findings are confirmed by analysis of cytokine regulation, since activation of the H2R/cAMP pathway promoted TGF-beta1-mediated IL-4 inhibition but was ineffective in suppressing IFN-gamma. These results demonstrate that histamine supports TGF-beta1 susceptibility of T cells. Moreover, Th2 cells are more affected by histamine-enhanced TGF-beta1 suppression, which is particularly important for the regulation of allergen-specific T cells in allergic immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2013166853,"Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) promotes tumor invasion and metastasis in several malignancies including prostate cancer, one of the most commonly detected male cancers that result in a high incidence of mortality. In the present study we have examined the differential regulation of uPA gene expression in different stages of prostate cancer by DNA methylation. We determined levels of uPA expression in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and in hormone-responsive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3) prostate cancer cell lines. We found that uPA is expressed only in the highly invasive PC-3 cells where the uPA promoter is unmethylated. The lack of uPA expression in PrEC and LNCaP cells, where uPA promoter is highly methylated, is due to suppression of uPA gene transcription by DNA methylation. Treatment of LNCaP cells with 5'-azacytidine, a potent demethylating agent, resulted in induction of uPA mRNA expression, uPA activity, and higher invasive capacity in vitro. Additionally, a marked increase in tumor volume was observed after inoculation of these cells into the flank of male BALB/c (nu/nu) mice. Collectively these studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation is the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for uPA gene silencing in normal and early stages of prostate cancer, which has a direct effect on tumor cell invasion and growth in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2054369275,"Using oligonucleotide microarray data of 45 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, we evaluated gene expression in hepatitis B virus-positive and hepatitis C virus-positive HCCs (HBV- and HCV-HCCs) for an association with liver cirrhosis (LC). In all, 89 genes were expressed differentially between HBV-HCCs associated with LC and those not associated with LC. Among them, tumors from LC patients showed significantly lower expression levels of 72 genes and significantly higher levels of 17 genes than the levels found in tumors from non-LC patients. The former included genes responsible for signal transduction, transcription, metabolism, and cell growth. The latter included a tumor suppressor gene and a cell-growth-related gene. Only eight genes were expressed differentially between HCV-HCCs associated with and without LC. Our findings provide as a framework for clarifying the role of LC in HBV- and HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1988625091,"NMR analyses of the labeling pattern obtained using various 13C-labeled precursors indicated that both the lipid tail and the quinone head of sorgoleone, the main allelopathic component of the oily root exudate of Sorghum bicolor, were derived from acetate units, but that the two moieties were synthesized in different subcellular compartments. The 16:3 fatty acid precursor of the tail is synthesized by the combined action of fatty-acid synthase and desaturases most likely in the plastids. It is then exported out of the plastids and converted to 5-pentadecatriene resorcinol by a polyketide synthase. This resorcinol intermediate was identified in root hair extracts. The lipid resorcinol intermediate is then methylated by a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase and subsequently dihydroxylated by a P450 monooxygenase to yield the reduced form of sorgoleone.

Sorgoleone (2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-[(Z,Z)-8′,11′,14′-pentadecatriene]-p-benzoquinone) (1) is the main allelopathic component of the oily root exudate of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) (Fig. 1) (1Chang M. Netzly D.H. Butler L.G. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7858-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Netzly D.H. Butler L.G.

The term sorgoleone is also used to describe a group of lipophilic p-benzoquinones structurally related to 1 that are also produced by sorghum roots having a hydroxy and a methoxy substitution at positions 2 and 5, respectively, and either a 15- or 17-carbon aliphatic tail with various degrees of unsaturation at position 3 (3Netzly D.H. Riopel J.L. Ejeta G. Butler L.G. Weed Sci. 1988; 36: 441-446Crossref Google Scholar). The primary mechanism of phytotoxic action of 1 is associated with inhibition of photosynthesis in higher plant systems by competing for the binding site of plastoquinone on photosystem II (4Einhellig F.A. Rasmussen J.A. Hejl A.M. Souza I.F. J. Chem. Ecol. 1993; 19: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Nimbal C.I. Yerkes C.N. Weston L.A. Weller S.C. Pestic. Biochem.

This lipophilic p-benzoquinone is also known to hinder electron transfer reactions involved in mitochondrial respiration and to inhibit the enzyme p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (7Rasmussen J.A. Hejl A.M. Einhellig F.A. Thomas J.A. J. Chem. Ecol. 1992; 18: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Meazza G. Scheffler B.E. Tellez M.R. Rimando A.M. Nanayakkara N.P.D. Khan I.A. Abourashed E.A. Romagni J.G. Duke S.O. Dayan F.E. Phytochemistry. 2002; 59: 281-288Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The herbicidal and allelopathic properties of 1 make isolation of the genes responsible for its biosynthesis desirable, as manipulation of those genes in sorghum or their introduction in other plant species could provide a better understanding of the role of 1 in plant-plant interaction and natural weed control. To identify the genes and characterize the enzymes they encode, it is necessary to determine the steps involved in the biosynthesis of 1. Little has been reported on this subject. Sorgoleone is found exclusively as a hydrophobic droplet exuding from the tips of root hairs (2Netzly D.H. Butler L.G. Crop Sci. 1986; 26: 775-778Crossref Google Scholar), and a recent investigation of sorghum roots suggested that the production of 1 is compartmentalized in the highly physiologically active root hairs (9Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Dayan F.E. Nimbal C.I. Weston L.A. Weed Technol. 2001; 15: 813-825Crossref Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites occurring in root hairs has not been studied in detail, although other specialized cells at the interface between a plant surface and its environment (i.e. trichomes) are known to produce unique secondary metabolites (10McConkey M.E. Gershenzon J. Croteau R.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Tellez M.R. Canel C. Rimando A.M. Duke S.O.

It has been postulated that the biosynthesis of 1 and related resorcinolic lipids is the result of the convergence of two pathways, namely the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of the aliphatic tail and the activity of polyketide synthase-type enzymes for the formation of the quinone head (13Dewick P.M. Medicinal Natural Products. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 73-74Google Scholar, 14Kozubek A. Tyman J.H.P. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although this convergence of pathways has been demonstrated for aflatoxin biosynthesis in fungi (15Herbert R.B. The Biosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites. 2nd Ed. Chapman and Hall, London1989: 51-52Google Scholar), examples in plants have not been completely elucidated but have been derived from incomplete experimental data complemented with biogenetic assumptions that have not necessarily been demonstrated for these compounds (14Kozubek A. Tyman J.H.P. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the case of 1, Fate and Lynn (16Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrated that exogenous isotopically labeled acetate was incorporated into the quinone head but not into the tail. No further isotopic labeling studies of the hydrophobic tail, nor any studies of the biogenesis of the substituents on the quinone head, have been reported. Consequently, many questions regarding the biosynthesis of this important allelochemical have been left unanswered (17Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to determine the entire biosynthetic pathway of 1 via retrobiosynthetic NMR analysis of the root exudate of sorghum seedlings grown in the presence of suitable isotopically labeled substrates and to identify key metabolic intermediates. Materials—Seeds of high sorgoleone-producing S. bicolor × Sorghum sudanense hybrid (SX17) were purchased from Dekalb Genetics (Dekalb, IL). [1,2-13C2]Palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized according to a scaled-up protocol of Hajra and Bishop (18Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All other chemicals, including [1-13C]acetate (99% 13C), [2-13C]acetate (99% 13C), l-[1-13C]acetylcarnitine chloride (99% 13C), d-[2-13C]glucose (99% 13C), [4-13C]3-hydroxybutyrate (99% 13C), [2-13C]malonate (99% 13C), [13C]methyl-l-methionine (99% 13C), and [1,2-13C2]palmitate (99% 13C), were purchased from Sigma. Seed Sterilization and Growth of Seedlings—Sorghum (SX17) seeds were surface sterilized in 20% Clorox bleach (final concentration of 1% sodium hypochlorite) for 10 min and rinsed with deionized water. The seeds were poured into a gravity funnel lined with cheesecloth and allowed to dry overnight in a laminar flow hood. Although not completely aseptic, this method allowed the seed to grow free of observable microbial contamination during the experiments. Twenty seeds (approximately 500 mg) were placed in 20 × 100-mm sterile polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon) over the surface of sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper (90 mm diameter). Five ml of sterile water was added to the dish, and the seeds were covered with a second sterile filter paper. The dishes were sealed and incubated in the dark at 25 °C. Sorgoleone was extracted from 6-day-old seedlings in all experiments unless otherwise indicated. Labeling Studies—Stock solutions of the labeled compounds were prepared as a 1:1 or 1:3 ratio of 13C:12C isotopes at 10 mm concentration of the combined forms, except for acetate and pyruvate, which were prepared in 1 mm stock solutions. The labeled precursors were added to the Petri dishes on the 4th day. The Petri dishes were opened, and the upper filters were discarded. Excess water in the dishes was removed and replaced with 2 ml of either 500 μm [4-13C]3-hydroxybutyrate, 500 μm [1,2-13C2]palmitate, 500 μm [13C]methyl-l-methionine, 1 mm [1-13C]acetate, 1 mm [2-13C]acetate, or 2 mmd-[2-13C]glucose. The excess water in the Petri dish was discarded because it contained ∼0.15% of the total amount of 1 produced by the roots. The same procedure was repeated on the 5th and 6th day. At the end of the labeling period, the roots were excised, and 1 was extracted as described below. All labeling procedures were done under low-intensity green light to prevent the formation of anthocyanins by sorghum roots. Extraction and Purification of Sorgoleone—Sorgoleone was extracted by immersing the roots in chloroform for 1 min. Sorgoleone absorbed to the bottom filter paper (about 20% of the final weight of sorgoleone) was also extracted with chloroform. The extract was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and evaporated in vacuo (Büchi Rotovapor, Brinkmann Instruments) at 30 °C. The dried yellow residue was redissolved in chloroform, transferred to vials, and dried under nitrogen. The crude extract was applied to 20 × 20-cm aluminum-backed silica thin layer plates and separated using hexane:2-propanol (9:1 v/v). The sorgoleone band (R F 0.36) was cut out and eluted from the silica by washing twice with 200 ml of CHCl3. The pooled material was dried under nitrogen and stored at –20 °C until NMR analysis. NMR and Mass Spectrometry Analysis— 13C NMR experiments were carried out in CDCl3 on a Bruker Avance DPX 300 (Bruker, Billerica, MA) instrument using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR version 1.3), with the following variables: 30° pulse, 2.17 μs; repetition time, 3 s; spectral width, 15.1 kHz; temperature, 27 °C. The decoupling pulse was 90 μs at 18 db. 13C NMR spectra of labeled and unlabeled (natural abundance) sorgoleone were obtained under the same experimental conditions. Each carbon peak was integrated and 13C enrichments were calculated using the formula: (a – b)/b, where a is the integrated NMR signal of the enriched carbon in the labeled sorgoleone and b is the integrated NMR signal of the same carbon in the unlabeled sorgoleone (19Leete E. Bodem G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 6321-6325Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 1The abbreviations used are: GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; PKS, polyketide synthase; OMT, O-methyltransferase. was performed on a JEOL (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) GCMate II system. The GC temperature program was as follows: the initial 120 °C was raised to 280 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held at this temperature for 1 min, then raised to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held at this temperature for 4 min. The GC capillary column was ZB-50 (0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 mm film thickness, 30 m length; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The carrier gas was ultrahigh purity helium at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The inlet (splitless), GC interface, and ion chamber temperatures were 250, 250, and 230 °C, respectively. Samples were prepared in CHCl3 at 1 mg/ml concentrations, and the volume of samples injected was 1 μl. Isolation and Identification of Resorcinolic Metabolic Intermediates in Sorghum bicolor Root Hairs—Root hairs were isolated from unlabeled sorghum roots as described by Röhm and Werner (20Röhm M. Werner D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 129-136Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the addition that the liquid nitrogen containing the isolated root hairs was decanted by pouring it through a stainless steel mesh sieve (No. 60, 250 μm) to remove larger root debris. Isolated root hairs were powdered in liquid nitrogen, extracted with 10 ml of 95% MeOH, and sonicated in a sonication bath (Branson 3510 Ultrasonic Cleaner) for 15 min. The extract was filtered through a Whatman No. 1 filter. The extraction procedure was repeated with the residue two more times, and the organic supernatants were pooled. The organic phase was dried with magnesium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of ethyl acetate/hexane (80:20 v/v) and applied to aluminum-backed silica plates. The extract was chromatographed in CHCl3/ethyl acetate/methanol (85:8:7 v/v), and the UV active band with an R F identical to that of a 5-pentadecyl resorcinol (Chem Service, Inc. West Chester, PA) was eluted from the plate (21Deszcz L. Kozubek A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The semipurified sample (1–2 mg) was diluted in 1 ml of CHCl3 and injected in a JEOL GCmate mass spectrometer as described previously. The injection volume was 1 μl. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of natural products via isotopic labeling is often a prerequisite to the characterization of the enzymes involved and the identification of the genes encoding them (22Bacher A. Rieder C. Eichinger D. Arigoni D. Fuchs G. Eisenreich W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 22: 567-598Crossref Google Scholar). The structural features of 1 and the published pattern of incorporation of acetate in xenognosin/sorgoleone reported by Fate and Lynn (16Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggested that the biosynthesis of 1 involves the convergence of the fatty acid and polyketide pathways. Other plant secondary metabolites with some resemblance to 1, such as the resorcinolic lipids, appear to be synthesized through the convergence of these pathways also (13Dewick P.M. Medicinal Natural Products. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 73-74Google Scholar, 14Kozubek A. Tyman J.H.P. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Labeling with [2-13C]acetate and [2-13C]malonate yielded similar patterns of incorporation on carbon atoms 2, 4, and 6 (151.9, 182.1, and 102.5 ppm, respectively) (Figs. 2B and 3). The percent incorporation was similar for both precursors ranging from 3.6 to 6.2% (Table I). Labeling with [1-13C]acetate led to enrichment in carbons 1 and 5 (183.2 and 161.5 ppm, respectively), but no incorporation was detected in carbon atom 3 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that, at the mechanistic level, the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the production of 2 catalyzes an orsellinic acid-type cyclization of the linear tetraketide intermediate (Fig. 3, steps III and IV), such as that catalyzed by stilbene synthase rather than a phloroacetophenone-type cyclization typically associated with chalcone synthase (23Tropf S. Karcher B. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7922-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Rawlings B.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 425-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although stilbene and chalcone synthase have similar nucleotide sequences, this difference in their reaction mechanism may provide useful information to help identify the genes encoding for the proper polyketide synthase participating in the biosynthesis of 1.Fig. 3Isotopic labeling of the benzoquinone moiety of sorgoleone with [2-13C]acetate. [1-13C]Acetate was incorporated in carbons 1 and 5 but not in 3. Steps I and II are catalyzed by acetyl-CoA ligase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Polyketide synthase catalyzes the condensation of 3 malonyl-CoA units to the fatty acyl-CoA starter unit (step III) followed by cyclization, reduction, and decarboxylation (step IV), yielding 2. Step V summarizes the remaining transformations leading to the formation of 1 (see “Results and Discussion”).

This carbon was not labeled with [1-13C]acetate. Open table in a new tab The fact that carbon 3 (119.6 ppm) of the quinone head is not labeled in the presence of [1-13C]acetate (Table I), whereas carbons 1 and 5 become isotopically labeled, precludes the possibility that acetate is the starter unit for the PKS involved in the synthesis of 1. Because 1, with a pentadecatriene lipid tail, accounts for >80% the sorghum root exudate, the starter unit is likely to be a novel Δ9,12,15 C16:3-CoA. However, the exudate also contains minor components consisting of sorgoleone derivatives with aliphatic tails of 15 or 17 carbons and various degrees of unsaturation (3Netzly D.H. Riopel J.L. Ejeta G. Butler L.G. Weed Sci. 1988; 36: 441-446Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that the PKS involved in the synthesis of 1 can utilize other C16 and C18 fatty acyl-CoAs as starter units. The product of PKS activity is 2 (2-[(8′Z,11′Z)-8′,11′,14′-pentadecatriene]resorcinol), a cardol-like intermediate as shown in Fig. 3, which was isolated and identified by GC-MS in sorghum root hair extracts. The extracted ion chromatogram showed m/z 313.1 [M+ – H] indicative of 2 (retention time 7 min 55 s) with characteristic fragment ions m/z 282 [M+ – O2], 206 (the pentadecatriene fragment), 149 [206+ – C4H7], 135 [149+ – CH2], 123 (methyl resorcinol fragment) supporting the identity of 2. The existence of 5-pentadecatriene resorcinol and related analogues has also been reported in grass species phylogenetically related to sorghum (14Kozubek A. Tyman J.H.P. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 21Deszcz L. Kozubek A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki Y. Esumi Y.

Chatterton N.J. Asay K.H. Jensen K.B. Genome. 1994; 37: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Attempts to label the lipid tail with acetate, malonate, and pyruvate were unsuccessful. Other substrates tested, such as l-acetylcarnitine (which is involved in the transport of fatty acids across the mitochondrial membranes and possibly fatty acid biosynthesis (29Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 622-623Google Scholar, 30Roughan G. Post-Beittenmiller D. Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) and 3-hydroxybutyrate (in which the acyl carrier protein conjugate is an intermediate in the early stages of fatty acid biosynthesis (29Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 622-623Google Scholar)), also failed to be incorporated. Further labeling experiments, bypassing fatty acid synthesis by providing labeled palmitate or palmitoyl-CoA, also proved unsuccessful. However, inhibition of root growth caused by palmitate and its low water solubility (log p = 7.15) and the low root uptake of palmitoyl-CoA were limiting factors interfering with incorporation of these substrates. Labeling of the alkyl carbons, in a pattern consistent with the catalytic mechanism of fatty-acid synthase (31Rawlings B.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1998; 15: 275-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was achieved only with d-[2-13C]glucose (Fig. 2, D and F; and Fig. 4, step II). Enrichment was observed in carbons 2′, 4′, 6′, 8′, 10′, 12′, and 14′, corresponding to increased signals at 28.4, 29.7, 30.0, 130.8, 25.9, 127.2, and 137.3 ppm, respectively (Fig. 4). The level of isotope incorporation in the tail ranged from 1.2 to 3.7% (Table I). Glucose is often used in retrobiosynthetic NMR analysis of pathways because it overcomes limitations associated with subcellular compartmentalization (22Bacher A. Rieder C. Eichinger D. Arigoni D. Fuchs G. Eisenreich W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 22: 567-598Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, the contrast between the labeling patterns obtained with acetate, malonate, and glucose is particularly striking because fatty-acid synthase uses both acetate and malonate as substrate, yet no incorporation in the tail was observed with these latter substrates. Incorporation of biosynthetic precursors into fatty acids is known to be problematic because their synthesis is compartmentalized in plastids. In most plant cells, exogenous acetate is not usually incorporated into C18 and shorter fatty acids because acetate does not readily cross the plastidic membranes, and plastids have their own endogenous pool of acetate used for fatty acid synthesis (32Ohlrogge J.B. Pollard M.R. Stumpf P.K. Lipids. 1978; 13: 203-210Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Pollard M.R. Stumpf P.K. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pollard M.R. Stumpf P.K. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 649-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even when endogenous acetate has been reported to be incorporated in short fatty acids, glucose has been demonstrated to be a far better substrate, because it can either be imported in nongreen plastids directly as glucose 6-phosphate and used as the source for the plastidic pool of acetate (35Tauberger E. Fernie A.R. Emmermann M. Renz A. Kossmann J. Willmitzer L. Trethewey R.N. Plant J. 2000; 23: 43-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rawsthorne S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 182-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or be broken down to triose phosphates in the cytosol and taken up in plastids via triose phosphate translocators (37Flügge U.-I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). An important aspect of the synthesis of 1 is the unusual desaturation pattern of the aliphatic tail. Most of the steps leading to the formation of Δ9 C16:1 fatty acids are ubiquitous in plants. However, the next two desaturation steps required to yield Δ9,12 C16:2 and especially Δ9,12,15 C16:3 are more unusual and must be catalyzed by as-yet-unknown fatty-acid desaturases (Fig. 4, reaction IV). It is important to differentiate this novel Δ9,12,15 hexadecatrienoyl-CoA derivative (3) involved in the biosynthesis of 1 from the well characterized ω3 and ω6 hexadecatrienoic acids that are important components of plastidic membranes (Δ7,10,13 and Δ4,7,10, respectively) (38Hitchcock C. Nichols B.W. Plant Lipid Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1971: 2-13Google Scholar, 39Jamieson G.R. Reid E.H. Phytochemistry. 1971; 10: 1837-1843Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Thompson Jr., G.A. Roughan P.G. Browse J.A. Slack R.G. Gardiner S.E. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining steps involved in the biosynthesis of 1 are the methylation of the hydroxyl on carbon 5 and the addition of two hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 4. Whereas the order of these reactions is not certain, the methylation is catalyzed by an O-methyltransferase (OMT) (41Engelmann T. Kaufmann F. Diekert G. Arch.

As expected, isotopic labeling of this methyl group was achieved with [13C]methyl-methionine, suggesting the presence of a S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent OMT. Methylation with labeled methionine yielded the greatest percent incorporation (nearly 27%) relative to the other substrates used in this study (Table I). The presence of 2 in root hair suggests that the methylation most likely occurs on 2 (Fig. 3) rather than a putative tetrahydroxy resorcinolic lipid intermediate. In any case, both intermediates are symmetrical with respect to the position of the hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the OMT would not distinguish between the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 and the one on carbon 5. The OMT found in sorghum root hairs appears to be quite specific for this substrate because a 4,6-dimethylated form of 1 is present only in small amounts in sorghum exudate (16Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 47Erickson J. Schott D. Reverri T. Muhsin W. Ruttledge T. J. Agric.

OMTs have been recognized to catalyze highly regiospecific reactions and to be quite substrate-specific (43Dixon R.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Wang J. Pichersky E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 50Ibrahim R.K.

In light of the dual hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of 1, the OMT involved in this pathway is also expected to be substrate-specific with a substrate-binding domain that can accommodate the very lipophilic tail of 1. Once a single methylation occurs, subsequent hydroxylation by a putative P450 monooxygenase (53Werck-Reichhart D. Bak S. Paquette S. Somerville C.R. Meyerowitz E.M. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MDAugust 30, 2002: 1-29Google Scholar) leads to the formation of 1 in its reduced hydroquinone form. The enzymatic synthesis apparently ends with the formation of the reduced form of 1 (a hydroquinone known as sorghum xenognosin for Striga germination) (54Fate G.D. Chang M. Lynn D.G. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The oxidation of the hydroquinone into the benzoquinone is most likely the result of autoxidation upon exposure to air (1Chang M. Netzly D.H. Butler L.G. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7858-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11369-11376Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the biosynthetic pathway of 1 initiates in the plastids with the synthesis of an unusual Δ9,12,15 hexadecatrienoic acid through the action of fatty-acid synthase and fatty-acid desaturases. Outside of the plastids, this polyunsaturated fatty acid serves as the starter unit for PKS yielding a resorcinolic lipid intermediate. The action of a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent OMT subsequently methylates the hydroxyl group on carbon 5, and the enzymatic synthesis ends with the hydroxylation in the aromatic ring by a P450 monooxygenase. Our research laboratory is now focusing on the characterization of the biochemical machinery involved in the biosynthesis of 1 and on identifying the genes encoding these enzymes.

It is present in the environment as a waste product of the paper industry and from the production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and also arises from the degradation of sulfur-containing pesticides (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, Me2SO forms naturally from photooxidation of DMS in the atmosphere and from degradation of DMS by phytoplankton in the marine environment (2Fuse H. Takimura O. Murakami K. Yamaoka Y. Omori T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because Me2SO has low volatility and is highly hygroscopic, it is rapidly scavenged from the atmosphere by rain and returned to earth, and thereby plays a role in the global sulfur cycle (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kellogg W.W. Cadle R.D. Allen E.R. Lazrus A.L. Martell E.A. Science. 1972; 175: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Microorganisms, including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, have the capability of reducing Me2SO and can utilize it as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic growth (4Zinder S.H.

Me2SO reductase from Escherichia coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides catalyzes the reduction of Me2SO to DMS (7Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J.

J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, which contains a molybdenum cofactor at the active center, is well characterized at the biochemical, biophysical, and molecular level and provides an excellent model system for investigating the structure and mechanism of electron transfer chain complexes (1Weiner J.H.

Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a number of NADPH-dependent enzymes that, in conjunction with methionine sulfoxide reductase (MXR1), can reduce Me2SO to DMS (11Hansen J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3915-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In E. coli, the combination of divalent cations as Ca2+ and Me2SO has been shown to stimulate the efficiency of DNA transfer into the cell (12Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian cells, it is reported that the transfection efficiency is increased by Me2SO treatment after electroporation (13Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of how Me2SO increases membrane permeability leading to DNA uptake is unclear.In mammalian cells Me2SO (2% (v/v)) can induce morphological changes, for example in mouse erythroleukemic cells (14Pollerberg G.E. Schachner M. Davoust J. Nature. 1986; 324: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), or cause differentiation, for example in neuroblastoma cells (15Yenofsky R. Cereghini S. Krowczynska A. Brawerman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Conversely, Me2SO blocks the differentiation of myoblasts, adipocytes, and antibody-producing plasma cells (16Blau H.M. Epstein C.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 95-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Scott R.E. Cell Prolif. 1993; 26: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Teraoka H. Mikoshiba M. Takase K. Yamamoto K. Tsukada K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Me2SO varies depending on the cell line and cell type. At the molecular level Me2SO is known to affect RNA splicing and causes a shift toward the proximal pair of splice sites on pre-mRNAs carrying competing 5′-splice sites or competing 3′-splice sites (19Bolduc L. Labrecque B. Cordeau M. Blanchette M. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17597-17602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this paper we have examined the molecular response to Me2SO exposure in yeast cells by studying global gene expression profiles using DNA microarrays. The expression of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and cell wall organization was affected by Me2SO treatment, and a comparison with other stress-inducing chemicals was performed using the bioinformatics tool, hierarchical cluster analysis. We carried out Northern blot analysis and phospholipid component analysis, and we quantified the amount of cellular membrane to assess the influence of Me2SO on the yeast cell. We found that Me2SO induces the expression of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, and we demonstrate elevated phospholipid biosynthesis and cellular membrane proliferation. From these studies we conclude that Me2SO damages cell membrane integrity, but the effects of this are mitigated in part by increased phospholipid biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae S288C (MATα SUC2 mal mel gal2 CUP1) was grown in YPD medium (1% BactoYeast Extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose) at 25 °C according to procedure outlined by Kitagawa et al. (20Kitagawa E. Takahashi J. Momose Y. Iwahashi H. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2002; 36: 3908-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentration of Me2SO causing growth inhibition was determined by exposing the yeast cells to various amounts of Me2SO (Fig. 1A). After treatment the numbers of colony-forming units were counted (Fig. 1B). An IC50 (growth inhibition to 50%) value corresponded to 10% (v/v) Me2SO in YPD medium at a cell density of 1.0 (OD660). After 2 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation for total RNA preparation. Non-treated cells cultured for 2 h from an OD660 of 1.0 were used as control.Preparation of Total RNA and mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from Me2SO-treated or non-treated cells by the hot phenol method (21Murata, Y., Momose, Y., Hasegawa, M., Iwahasi, H., and Komatsu, Y. (2002) Chem-Bio Informatics Journal http://www.cbi.or.jp/cbi/CBIj/vol2/2_18.pdf.Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA with an Oligotex-dT30 mRNA purification kit (Takara Otsu, Shiga, Japan).Preparation of Labeled cDNA—Fluorescently labeled cDNA probes were prepared from the mRNA pool by direct incorporation of fluorescent nucleotide analogues during the first-strand reverse transcriptase reaction. Each 20 μl of labeling solution consisted of 3–5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer, 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer provided with SuperScript TM II (Invitrogen). For estimation of the induced genes, cDNA made from poly(A)+ RNA of the control culture was fluorescently labeled with Cy3-UTP and that of the Me2SO-treated sample was labeled with Cy5-UTP (Amersham Biosciences) (normal method). For estimation of the repressed genes, cDNA made from poly(A)+ RNA of the control culture was fluorescently labeled with Cy5-UTP and that of the Me2SO-treated sample was labeled with Cy3-UTP (reverse method). Because the fluorescence of Cy5 is quenched more than that of Cy3, labeling was reversed in the control and Me2SO-treated samples for a more precise estimation of gene repression. The solution was incubated at 70 °C for 5 min and 42 °C for several minutes, and 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added, and reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 2 h. Another 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase was added 1 h after initiating reverse transcription. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA. Any remaining RNA was dissolved by addition of 0.5 n NaOH for 1 h at 65 °C. After neutralization with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA were mixed. The mixed cDNA probes were purified using Microcon YM-30 (Amicon Millipore).Hybridization and Image Scanning of the DNA Microarray—Competitive hybridization was performed on a DNA microarray of yeast from DNA Chip Research (Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan) for 48 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the labeled microarray was washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, rinsed with 0.2× SSC and 0.05× SSC, and then dried. Subsequently, the labeled microarray was scanned using a confocal laser ScanArray 4000 (GSI Lumonics, Billerica, MA) system. The fluorescent intensity of the resulting image data was quantified using Genepix (version 3.2.12). The calculation and normalization of the data were performed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). To eliminate background noise, the median value of some genes (TE) included as negative controls were subtracted from the row values for each gene. The intensity of each gene was divided by its control channel value in each sample. If the control channel value was below 0.01, the data point was deleted. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; the measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control value. The bottom 10th percentile was used as a test for correct background subtraction. This was never less than the negative value of the synthetic positive control. The fluorescent intensity of each spot on the images was subtracted from each background, and the ratios of intensity Cy5/Cy3 were calculated and normalized with a median value.To assess the variation of DNA microarray experiments, we labeled the mRNA samples eluted from the same culture with the fluorescent dye, Cy3 or Cy5, respectively, and determined the expression ratio after competitive hybridization on a DNA chip. The expected level of experimental variation was estimated to be within ∼2-fold, because the hybridization ratio varied between 2.0 and 0.5 (data not shown). We identified genes that had more than a 2.0-fold hybridization ratio for up-regulation and genes that had less than 0.5-fold hybridization ratio for the down-regulation. The experiments were independently repeated six times, and the genes with hybridization value ratios of more than 2.0-fold in at least five of the six experiments were considered to be up-regulated by Me2SO. The experiments for down-regulation were independently repeated three times, and the genes with hybridization value ratios of less than 0.5-fold in at least two of the three experiments were considered to be down-regulated by Me2SO treatment. The values for up-regulated genes were the average ratio from six independent culture experiments, and the ratio values averaged from three independent culture experiments were adopted in the case of down-regulated genes.Cluster Analysis—To extract meaningful information from the large amount of data generated by the DNA microarrays, we applied a bioinformatics tool called cluster analysis to recognize changes in the transcription patterns following exposure to Me2SO. The transcriptional data of herbicides, detergents, and food additives together with circumstance changes, such as temperature, pressure, and freezing/thawing, for cluster analysis are shown in kasumi.nibh.jp/~egenomix/. The various stress factors are outlined in the legend of Fig. 3. The gene groups that gave a significant variation in expression were selected from the genome-wide gene expression profile. 3,875 open reading frames, which induced commonly under different stress conditions, were extracted from the gene groups. We performed the hierarchical cluster analysis using GeneSpring. The settings for the calculations were as follows: similarity was measured by standard correlation; the separation ratio was 1.0; and the minimum distance was 0.001. The hierarchical clustering was constructed using the 3,875 open reading frames. The transcriptional profiles for exposure to Me2SO were compared with the expression profiles of other stress conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, the data are graphically displayed so that each row of colored bars represents the variation of transcript levels for every gene in a given mRNA sample, as detected on the DNA microarray. The variations in abundance of transcripts for each gene are depicted by means of a color scale.Fig. 3Hierarchical clustering analysis. The hierarchical clustering was performed using GeneSpring. Genes up-regulated by Me2SO (DMSO) exposure were compared with genes up-regulated in response to other stress factors that are cited at kasumi.nibh.jp/~egenomix/. The samples exposed to chemical stresses were treated with the following for 2 h: 0.2 mm acrolein, 2 ppm maneb, 2 ppm zineb, 75 mm thiuram, 0.01 mm 2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,3-benzenedicarbonitrile (TPN), 1/1,500 dilution Roundup, 0.016 mm 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP), 0.02% sodium n-dodecyl benzosulfonate (LAS), 0.01% SDS, 0.82 mm capsaicin, 1.36 mm gingerol, 10% (v/v) Me2SO, 1.3 mm lindane, 0.3 mm cadmium chloride, 2 mm lead chloride, 0.3 mm sodium arsenite, 0.7 mm mercuric chloride. Freezing/thawing was applied as a transition from –80 to 30 °C for 1 h. Yeast cells grown under normal pressure were subjected to 180 MPa for 0 min at 4 °C and allowed to recover for1hat25 °C (180 MPa and recovery). Yeast cells grown under 40 MPa for 16 h at 4 °C were allowed to recover for 1 h at 25 °C (40 MPa and recovery). High pressure (30 MPa) was applied as growth under 30 MPa for 16 h at 25 °C. Cadmium and thiuram were added simultaneously in yeast cells and then cultured for 2 h at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed by the method of Ausubel et al. (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg), isolated from control or Me2SO-treated cells for 2 h, was subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.0% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel (4–5 h at 100 V). RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics) and fixed using a UV cross-linker (120 mJ). For Northern blot analysis, the double-strand DNA probes of the genes implicated in metabolism of phospholipid and methionine were amplified from chromosomal DNA using the following primers: INO1, 5′-TCTGCAACAACGCTTGAAGGCG-3′ as the forward sequence and 5′-AGCCATTCACCGGGTGAAATCC-3′ as the reverse sequence; OPI3, 5′-ATGAAGGAGTCAGTCCAAGAGATCA-3′ as the forward sequence and 5′-CATATTCTTTTTGGCCTTATCACGG-3′ as the reverse sequence; MET6, 5′-AGACCACTCAATTTAAGTTGAACGG-3′ as the forward sequence and 5′-TCTCTCAGTACCTTCTCTCAATGG-3′ as the reverse sequence; MET17/25, 5′-ATCCAGAGCTGTACCAATTTACGC-3′ as the forward sequence and 5′-ACCAACATTGGCCAAGTTAGAGGC-3′ as reverse sequence; and ACT1, 5′-TAACGGTTCTGGTATGTGTAAAGCC-3′ as forward sequence and 5′-TGTAAGTAGTTTGGTCAATACCGGC-3′ as reverse sequence. Denatured probe was hybridized to the membrane-bound RNA and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics).Phospholipid Analysis and Inorganic Phosphate (Pi) Quantitative Analysis in Total Lipid—The extraction of total lipid from yeast cells was performed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium to exponential phase (OD660 = 1.0), and 10% (v/v) Me2SO was added. Me2SO-treated or non-treated yeast cells were harvested after 0, 2, 4, and 6 h and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Colony-forming units was counted at each time point. The frozen pellet was resuspended in a small volume of saturated NaCl solution, and total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v in the presence of 0.08% butylated hydroxytoluene, which acted as an antioxidant. After extraction of total lipid, chloroform and saturated NaCl solution were added, and the ratio of chloroform/methanol/water was adjusted to 1:1:1 (v/v). The organic and aqueous phase were separated by centrifugation. The chloroform layer was recovered, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas, and then resuspended in chloroform to give the total lipid sample. Aliquots corresponding to 5.0 × 108 cells were analyzed by TLC using Silica Gel 60 (Merck; 20 × 20 cm). The silica gel plates were developed with a chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid (100:60:9:13, v/v) solvent system for ∼60 min at room temperature and air-dried for about 15 min. The plates were then sprayed with 12% (v/v) H2SO4, 2% CuSO4 and placed in an oven at 180 °C for 15 min.The Pi in total lipid was determined by the method of Rouser et al. (24Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total lipid (5, 10, and 20 μl) were resuspended in chloroform and placed in a test tube (18 × 180 mm). The chloroform solvent was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. 70% perchloric acid (1 ml) was added to the dried lipid and then heated to 200 °C for 1.5 h. The test tube was cooled and rinsed with 5.0 ml of distilled water, and 1.0 ml of 2.5% ammonium molybdate solution was added. After thorough mixing with a vortex mixer, 1.0 ml of 10% ascorbic acid solution was added, followed by 2.0 ml of distilled water. The solution was heated in boiling water for 10 min, and after cooling the absorbance reading at 820 nm was determined. The absorbance values were then converted to micrograms of phosphorus by means of a factor derived from a standard curve (prepared using KH2PO4). The phosphorus content (micrograms) in the total lipid corresponding to 2.5 × 108 cells was determined.DiOC6 Staining—Yeast cells were grown under Me2SO-treated and non-treated conditions in YPD liquid culture. For 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining, cells were harvested at different time points (0, 0.5, 1–4, 6, and 7 h), and washed with TE buffer. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. DiOC6 was resuspended to 1 mg ml–1 in ethanol (as DiOC6 stock solution). 1 μl of DiOC6 stock solution was added to 1 ml of the yeast cell suspension. If the cell density was OD660 >1.0 at harvesting, the cell suspension was diluted with TE buffer to an OD660 of ∼1.0. Cells stained with DiOC6 were analyzed immediately. Staining was carried out as described by Block-Alper et al. (25Block-Alper L. Webster P. Zhou X. Supekova L. Wong W.H. Schultz P.G. Meyer D.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry—About 100,000–500,000 yeast cells were acquired per sample using EPICS XL system II (Beckman Coulter). The detection threshold was set in the channel just below the lowest detectable level of the yeast suspension with the lowest intensity. DiOC6-stained cells were detected in channel FL1. Cell size and intracellular structure were detected by forward scatter and side scatter. Analysis of the results was carried out using the Exo 32 software (Beckman Coulter counter) and each mean value of FL1, forward scatter, and side scatter was calculated.Fluorescence Microscopy—DiOC6-stained cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS-SP2, Leica). DiOC6 was excited using a 488-nm argon laser that was reflected by a dichroic mirror to the yeast cells through a ×100 objective oil immersion lens (PL APO; NA 1.4; Leica). The emission signal was directed through a pinhole to a slit (505–530 nm) and then to a photomultiplier device. Images were collected using the Leica 2000 confocal software program.RESULTSMe2SO Concentration and Duration of Exposure—S. cerevisiae can grow under various stress conditions such as temperature change, nutrient depletion, and the presence of noxious agents or toxic chemicals. However, for adaptation to drastic environmental growth conditions, complex changes in the pattern of gene expression are known to occur (26Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar, 27Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Genome-wide transcriptional analysis using a DNA microarray was employed to assess the effects of Me2SO exposure. After treatment with Me2SO, the growth inhibition and viability of yeast cells was examined (28Momose Y. Iwahashi H. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2001; 20: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To find the optimum conditions, S. cerevisiae cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were exposed to various amounts of Me2SO (Fig. 1A). 10% (v/v) Me2SO gave approximately the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for growth inhibition. Yeast cells were allowed to survive and grow at this concentration of Me2SO (Fig. 1B). Exposure to 10% (v/v) Me2SO for 2 h was sufficient to induce large changes in the gene expression profile. Therefore RNA was extracted from these cells and analyzed using microarray technology.DNA Microarray Analysis—The mRNA purified from nontreated or Me2SO-treated cells was labeled with the fluorescence dye, Cy3 or Cy5, respectively. Generated cDNA probes were mixed and hybridized to a whole genome yeast DNA microarray. To evaluate differences in gene expression, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of each spot. The expression of each gene following Me2SO treatment was quantified as the ratio of fluorescence intensity Cy5/Cy3. A total of 246 genes was down-regulated after 2 h of Me2SO exposure (21Murata, Y., Momose, Y., Hasegawa, M., Iwahasi, H., and Komatsu, Y. (2002) Chem-Bio Informatics Journal http://www.cbi.or.jp/cbi/CBIj/vol2/2_18.pdf.Google Scholar), and we analyzed the distribution of these genes according to functional categories in Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. These down-regulated genes included those involved in energy (mitochondrial respiration-related genes), ion homeostasis, and protein synthesis, etc. (Fig. 2B). 147 genes were identified as being up-regulated by exposure to Me2SO (21Murata, Y., Momose, Y., Hasegawa, M., Iwahasi, H., and Komatsu, Y. (2002) Chem-Bio Informatics Journal http://www.cbi.or.jp/cbi/CBIj/vol2/2_18.pdf.Google Scholar). The genes arranged in terms of function included energy (aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase-related genes), metabolism, and cell rescue, defense, aging, and death, etc. (Fig. 2A). Almost all of the up-regulated genes implicated in the metabolism category had functions related to phospholipid biosynthesis and the methionine synthesis pathway, as shown in Table I and Fig. 4. This suggests that cell membrane biosynthesis is influenced by Me2SO.Fig. 2The distribution of Me2SO-induced or -repressed genes divided into functional categories. A, the Me2SO-induced genes classified according to the functional categories of Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. B, the Me2SO-repressed genes classified according to the functional categories of Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. The horizontal values in A and B indicate the percentage of total genes of each functional category.

Subsequently, folding and modification of the substrate rapidly ensue. The close temporal coordination of these processes suggests that they may be structurally and functionally coordinated as well. Here we show that information encoded in the hydrophobic domain of a signal sequence influences the timing and efficiency of at least two steps in maturation, namely N-linked glycosylation and signal sequence cleavage. We demonstrate that these consequences correlate with and likely stem from the nature of the initial association made between the signal sequence and the translocon during the initiation of translocation. We propose a model by which these maturational events are controlled by the signal sequence-translocon interaction.

Our work demonstrates that the pathway taken by a nascent chain through post-translational maturation depends on information encoded in its signal sequence. N-terminal signal sequences enable nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RM, canine pancreatic rough microsomes; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; Prl, preprolactin; TIGRp, trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; GH, growth hormone; AP, acceptor tripeptide. for translocation. The signal sequence, newly emerged from the translating ribosome, is recognized in the cytoplasm by the signal recognition particle (1Keenan R.J. Freyman D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). By virtue of an interaction with its ER-localized receptor, signal recognition particle brings the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane (2Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Once at the ER, the ribosome is thought to facilitate the assembly or stabilization of the translocation channel, composed of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex (3Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 4Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The 35-kDa polytopic Sec61α subunit appears to form the channel walls, whereas the smaller bitopic β- and γ-subunits play an as yet undetermined role, perhaps in facilitating the insertion of the nascent chain into the channel (5Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.O. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2340-2346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An important advance in the understanding of the initiation of translocation was the discovery of a second step of signal sequence recognition. In addition to being recognized by the signal recognition particle, the signal sequence also interacts with the translocation channel itself (8Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not yet clear, this event is thought to stimulate the initiation of translocation. For the simplest secretory proteins, when the signal sequence is recognized by the channel, the ribosome assumes a tight interaction with the channel that shields the protein from the cytoplasm (8Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the channel opens toward the ER lumen, either via a conformational change in the channel or removal of a molecular plug covering the luminal aperture (11Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Jonhson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Not all signal sequences initiate translocation in the same way. Beyond merely stimulating the initiation of translocation, signal sequences can regulate the association between the ribosome and translocon and the exposure of the nascent chain to the cytoplasm or ER lumen (13Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Kim S.J. Hegde R.S. Mol. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In at least one case, that of the prion protein, the consequence of this regulatory step is the governance of the final topology achieved by the protein (13Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Kim S.J. Hegde R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Kim S.J. Mitra D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26132-26140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that signal sequences have a broad post-targeting role beyond the initiation of translocation, and in addition to their role in regulating the ribosome-translocon association. Immediately after translocation begins, the protein complexes of the ER lumen begin the process of maturation of the nascent chain. Maturation includes steps of covalent modification such as signal sequence cleavage, the addition of N-linked glycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage as well as protein folding and refolding carried out by chaperones in the lumen (18Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It is clear that the pathway of a nascent chain through the steps of maturation in the ER lumen varies from substrate to substrate (19Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the manner in which the steps of biogenesis are optimized for a particular protein is not yet clear. Given that signal sequence recognition is the first event in translocation at the ER and also that maturation is closely linked to translocation, we wondered whether the signal sequence-translocon interaction might control the progression of the nascent chain through the steps of maturation in the ER lumen. We demonstrate that signal sequences can indeed influence the timing and efficiency of maturational events, and this influence can be conferred to other proteins on which those signal sequences are engineered. This influence is likely exerted through the nature of the interaction between the signal sequence and translocon. Plasmid Constructions—cDNAs encoding substrates synthesized in the cell-free system were cloned into the pSP64 vector (Promega), and cDNAs encoding transfected substrates were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 Zeo (+) (Invitrogen). The glycosylation site in Prl was made by site-directed mutagenesis of Gln42 to Asn using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). Prl constructs with various signal sequences (Fig. 2A) were synthesized by PCR amplification of these signal sequences and ligation into an upstream SphI site and a silent AgeI site located in the mature domain of Prl. The plasmids encoding growth hormone (GH) and IgG were provided by Tom Rapoport (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and Prl receptor by Linda Schuler (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Chimeras of PrlCHO and GH-PrlCHO (Fig. 2B) were made by subcloning into upstream SphI, NheI, or Hind3 sites, a PpuMI site between the Prl n- and h-domains, a PflmI site between the h- and c-domains, and the silent AgeI site. Libraries of Prl hydrophobic domain mutations were constructed by ligation of degenerate oligonucleotides of the sequence (NYC)13 into the PpuMI and PflmI sites of PrlCHO (Fig. 2C), or by random QuikChange mutagenesis of Ser20-Asn21. Uncleavable signal sequences (Fig. 5D) were generated by mutation of GVVS of the PrlCHO or SN → QTCHO signal sequence to WPVP. Standard techniques were used in the construction of all clones (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar).Fig. 5The signal sequence controls glycosylation by regulating the timing of its own cleavage. A, Prl and SN → QT truncated at the indicated chain lengths were synthesized in the presence or absence of RM, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, Prl, SN → NH, SN → MP, and SN → QT were synthesized as in A, and the extent of signal sequence cleavage at each truncation point was quantitated. Data from a representative experiment are shown. C, PrlCHO and SN → QTCHO were truncated at the indicated chain lengths and synthesized in the presence or absence of RM and the peptide inhibitor of glycosylation, Ac-NYT, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The migrations of signal sequence-uncleaved material (pPrl), signal sequence-cleaved but nonglycosylated material (Prl), and signal sequence-cleaved and glycosylated material (Prl-CHO) are indicated. In this assay using truncated chains, the site of signal sequence cleavage seems to be somewhat heterogeneous, giving rise to two bands representing signal-cleaved material for both substrates. However, such heterogeneity in cleavage is not observed when the full-length proteins are synthesized. D, the signal sequences of PrlCHO and SN → QTCHO were mutated so as to render them uncleavable (see “Experimental Procedures”). The extent of glycosylation for these substrates was quantitated as in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Vitro Translation, Translocation, and Proteolysis—In vitro translation, translocation, and proteolysis have been described previously (10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Where indicated, substrates were synthesized in the presence of a tripeptide inhibitor of glycosylation, Ac-NYT. Truncated substrates were generated by PCR amplification of fragments of the relevant cDNAs, followed by transcription and translation. For targeting analysis (Fig. 4A), chains truncated at the indicated lengths were synthesized in the presence of RMs. Half of the material was set aside, whereas half was sedimented for 3 min at 50,000 rpm and 4 °CinaTLA 100 rotor over a 50-μl cushion of 0.5 m sucrose, 0.5 m KOAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc. Both total material and sedimented material were precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate at 0 °C for 30 min. Analysis of the state of the ribosome-translocon junction (Fig. 4B) was exactly as described (16Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For puromycin analysis (Fig. 6B), isolated RMs with associated targeted chains were resuspended in 250 mm KOAc, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgOAc, and 0.25 m sucrose with or without 1 mm puromycin (Sigma). Reactions were incubated at 32 °C for 15 min, followed by proteolysis.Fig. 6Prl and SN → QT nascent chains are in distinct conformations. A, Prl and SN → QT truncated at a chain length of 80 amino acids were synthesized in the presence or absence of RM. Following synthesis, either polysomes (for –RM) or microsomes (for +RM) were isolated by sedimentation. The isolated material was resuspended in a physiological salt buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, which solubilizes microsomes but is nondenaturing. Material was either set aside or digested with 10 μm trypsin at 0 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The band of highest molecular weight (marked by an arrow) in the tryptic digestions is undigested material (undig) and is present to a greater extent for Prl than for SN → QT. The second arrow represents a digestion product also seen more prominently for Prl than for SN → QT. The right panel shows data from an experiment carried out in the same way, quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograph in progressive intervals from highest molecular weight to lowest, with the y axis representing band optical density in arbitrary units. B, Prl and SN → QT were truncated at a chain length of 80 amino acids and synthesized in the presence of RM. Following synthesis, an aliquot of the material was set aside, whereas the remainder was treated with 1 mm puromycin at 32 °C for 15 min. A portion of the puromycin-treated material was subjected to proteolysis with proteinase K to digest material not released into the lumen. The bar graph to the right shows the percentage of material for each substrate that has achieved signal sequence cleavage after puromycin release.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tryptic Analysis—For tryptic digestion, Prl truncated at 80 amino acids was synthesized in the presence or absence of RMs at 32 °C for 20 min. Samples synthesized in the absence of RMs were isolated by sedimentation of the polysomes for 30 min at 100,000 rpm, 4 °C, in a TLA 100 rotor over a 100-μl cushion of 0.5 m sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc. Samples synthesized in the presence of RMs were isolated by sedimentation for 3 min at 50,000 rpm, 4 °C, in a TLA 100 rotor over 50 μl of the same sucrose cushion. Both polysomes and sedimented RMs were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc plus 1% Triton X-100. Digestion was carried out with 10 μm trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min at 0 °C. Trypsin was inactivated with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 min at 0 °C, followed by transfer to tubes containing boiling 1% SDS. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography. The films were scanned, and the intensities of bands in each lane were quantitated by measuring the densities of small increments of each lane in progressive intervals, from high molecular weight to low. Thus, the y axis of the graph in Fig. 6A is in arbitrary units. Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—In Fig. 7, following translation, targeted chains were recovered by sedimentation over a sucrose cushion and resuspended in a physiological salt buffer (10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (as before tryptic digestion, but without 1% detergent). Half of the material was set aside, and half was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with a 1 mm concentration of the cysteine-reactive homobifunctional reagent 1,8-bis-maleimidotriethyleneglycol (Pierce), from a 20 mm stock dissolved in water. Just prior to its addition to the reactions, cross-linker was incubated with agitation at 40 °C to stimulate dissolving. The reactions were quenched with 1 volume of 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, and 20 μg/ml RNase A at room temperature for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation with anti-PDI (Stressgen), 0.5% saponin was added to the quenched reaction, and the samples were incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C before dilution into 1× TXSWB (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl) and the addition of Protein A-agarose. A nonimmune control immunoprecipitation was carried out similarly (not shown). For other immunoprecipitations, quenched reactions were denatured with the addition of 0.5% SDS and heating to 100 °C. The samples were then diluted in 10 volumes of 1× TXSWB and incubated with antibody and Protein A-agarose overnight or with anti-Sec61α coupled to Sepharose provided by T. Rapoport. Cell Culture—COS-1 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. In Fig. 1C, lysates or media were harvested, denatured in SDS, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody raised against TIGRp. Miscellaneous—All autoradiographs were scanned using an Agfa Arcus II flatbed scanner and quantitated in Adobe Photoshop. Care was taken to scan all gels within the linear range of the film; under these conditions the accuracy of quantitation was comparable with that obtained by quantitation using a phosphor imager and quantitation software (data not shown). Gels are either 15% Tris/glycine or Tris/Tricine (10 or 15%). Biophysical calculations (21Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 5: 105-132Crossref Scopus (17279) Google Scholar) were performed using MacVector software, with a window size of 7. In order to test our hypothesis that signal sequences influence the progression of nascent chains through maturation in the ER lumen, we monitored the glycosylation of the trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response protein (TIGRp), also known as myocilin (23Stone E.M. Fingert J.H. Alward W.L. Nguyen T.D. Polansky J.R. Sunden S.L. Nishimura D. Clark A.F. Nystuen A. Nichols B.E. Mackey D.A. Ritch R. Kalenak J.W. Craven E.R. Sheffield V.C. Science. 1997; 275: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). TIGRp is a secreted protein and contains a single site for N-linked glycosylation, at position 57 of the nascent chain, which is 25 amino acids downstream of the site of signal sequence cleavage (Fig. 1A). We replaced the signal sequence of TIGRp with that of the secretory protein preprolactin (Prl) and compared the extents to which native TIGRp and TIGRp with the Prl signal sequence (Prl/TIGRp) were glycosylated. We found that Prl/TIGRp was glycosylated with a significantly lower efficiency, both in vitro and in vivo, than was TIGRp, despite the fact that both substrates translocate with equally high efficiency (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). Thus, the efficiency of at least one step (i.e. N-linked glycosylation) in the maturation of this native substrate is affected by the signal sequence of the nascent chain in a manner distinct from its ability to be translocated per se. We chose Prl as a substrate for further analysis because the steps in its translocation have been thoroughly characterized (8Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Jonhson A.E.

Thus, we reasoned that this substrate would best allow us to define the mechanism by which the signal sequence, which functions in translocation, can influence maturation. We engineered into the Prl mature domain, by point mutagenesis, a single site for glycosylation at amino acid number 42, which is 12 amino acids downstream of the site of signal sequence cleavage. The glycosylation of this substrate (PrlCHO) was compared with glycosylation of the PrlCHO mature domain fused to the signal sequences of various other proteins, including the prolactin receptor, GH, and IgG heavy chain. As with TIGRp, PrlCHO glycosylation was influenced to a large extent by the signal sequence used to direct its translocation; whereas the Prl receptor and native Prl signal sequences led to inefficient glycosylation of translocated chains, the GH and IgG heavy chain signal sequences allowed a majority of translocated chains to be modified (Fig. 2A). Thus, we confirmed that Prl biogenesis could be used as a reporter for the effects of signal sequences on maturation in the ER lumen. Signal sequences contain a central hydrophobic core of 6–15 amino acids, flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal polar domains of varying length. The hydrophobic domain is required for targeting and interaction with the translocon (1Keenan R.J. Freyman D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 8Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is thought to determine the dependence of the substrate on the presence of the translocating chain-associated membrane protein (27Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the c-terminal domain governs the site of signal sequence cleavage (28Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To determine which of these domains is responsible for affecting glycosylation of PrlCHO, we fused the PrlCHO mature domain to signal sequences consisting of various combinations of the N-, H-, and C-domains of the Prl or GH signal sequences. We found that the hydrophobic domain was most responsible for the control of glycosylation (Fig. 2B). To better understand the role of the hydrophobic domain in regulation of chain modification and maturation, we created a library of substrates derived from PrlCHO, with the hydrophobic domain of the signal sequence replaced by a random array of nonpolar or minimally polar amino acids. The extent of glycosylation for these substrates varied widely (Fig. 2C). However, the final extent of glycosylation did not correlate with the hydropathy, α-helical tendency, or leucine/isoleucine/valine content of the hydrophobic domain used (Fig. 2D). Therefore, information in the hydrophobic domain that regulates glycosylation efficiency is not encoded solely by any one of these parameters and perhaps is encoded in some other manner. To best pinpoint the mechanism by which a signal sequence could influence glycosylation, we wanted to isolate discrete mutations in the Prl signal sequence that could lead to changes in glycosylation while leaving functional properties related to translocation as intact as possible. To accomplish this goal, we randomly mutated Ser20 and Asn21 of the Prl signal sequence, since these polar residues are probably not required for targeting or the initiation of translocation, both of which are thought to rely on hydrophobic residues within the signal sequence (1Keenan R.J. Freyman D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 8Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The substrates generated by this technique varied widely in glycosylation efficiency, so for further study we chose one signal sequence (SN → NH) that, like the native Prl signal, led to inefficient modification and two (SN → MP and SN → QT) that led to very efficient glycosylation (Fig. 3A). The glycosylation of SN → MPCHO and SN → QTCHO was ∼3-fold more efficient than for PrlCHO and SN → NHCHO (Fig. 3B). Importantly, these signal sequences had similar effects when used to direct TIGRp translocation (Fig. 3C), suggesting that glycosylation of both TIGRp, a native glycoprotein, and Prl, an engineered glycoprotein, are governed by the same functional properties of the signal sequence. We next turned our attention toward the properties of these different signal sequences that lead to differences in glycosylation. In understanding how these signal sequences affect maturation, it was important to identify ways in which they differed independent of the potential of the chain to be glycosylated and then determine if any such differences predicted the final efficiency of glycosylation that could be achieved. Thus, we created versions of PrlCHO, SN → QTCHO, SN → MPCHO, and SN → NHCHO that lacked the engineered glycosylation site (i.e. these substrates were composed of the native Prl mature domain fused to the different signal sequences and are named Prl, SN → QT, SN → MP, and SN → NH). In all subsequent experiments when glycosylation itself (e.g. its timing or efficiency) was not considered, these glycosylation-incompetent substrates were used (Figs. 4, 5, A and B, 6, and 7). It is worth noting, however, that the glycosylation-competent versions of these substrates displayed indistinguishable behavior compared with their incompetent counterparts in all cases (data not shown). The best characterized role of signal sequences is in mediating targeting to the ER. Whereas the fact that the PrlCHO mature domain is translocated with high efficiency irrespective of the signal sequence used makes it unlikely that glycosylation is impacted by the targeting property of the signal sequence, for mechanistic insight it was important to formally exclude this possibility. We synthesized Prl and SN → QT nascent chains, truncated at increasing lengths, in the presence of ER-derived microsomal membranes. Targeted chains were then isolated by sedimenting the microsomes through a cushion of sucrose and high salt, and the percentage of material recovered in this way was quantitated. This analysis revealed that the timing of targeting for Prl and SN → QT is indistinguishable (Fig. 4A). The best currently described posttargeting role of signal sequences in maturation is in influencing the ribosome-translocon interaction (14Kim S.J. Hegde R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine if signal sequences could influence glycosylation independent of their role in regulating this association, we examined the timing with which Prl and SN → QT achieved a tight ribosome-translocon association. To accomplish this, we determined the percentage of nascent chains, truncated at various lengths, that were protected from digestion by exogenously added proteinase K, which has access only to material exposed to the cytoplasm. Both Prl and SN → QT achieved protease-resistant binding to the ER membrane with the same timing (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it seems likely that additional levels of posttargeting regulation besides that of the ribosome-translocon junction impinge upon the nascent chain. We proceeded to explore the mechanism by which signal sequences exert this influence. Inhibiting signal sequence cleavage can in some cases prevent modification of potential glycosylation sites in translocation substrates (29Chen X. VanValkenburgh C. Liang H. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2411-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the substrates analyzed in this study undergo quantitative signal sequence cleavage (Fig. 2A and data not shown); therefore, differential glycosylation cannot be attributable to the failure of any of these signal sequences to be cleaved. However, signal sequences also vary with respect to the timing with which they are cleaved, although how such a property is encoded and recognized by the translocation machinery is not understood (28Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We considered"

NAD+ synthetase catalyzes the final step in NAD+ synthesis in the well characterized de novo, salvage, and import pathways. It has been long known that eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases use glutamine to amidate nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide while many purified prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases are ammonia-dependent. Earlier, we discovered that glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetases contain N-terminal domains that are members of the nitrilase superfamily and hypothesized that these domains function as glutamine amidotransferases for the associated synthetases. Here we show yeast glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase Qns1 requires both the nitrilase-related active-site residues and the NAD+ synthetase active-site residues for function in vivo. Despite failure to complement the lethal phenotype of qns1 disruption, the former mutants retain ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity in vitro, whereas the latter mutants retain basal glutaminase activity. Moreover, the two classes of mutants fail to trans-complement despite forming a stable heteromultimer in vivo. These data indicate that the nitrilase-related domain in Qns1 is the fourth independently evolved glutamine amidotransferase domain to have been identified in nature and that glutamine-dependence is an obligate phenomenon involving intramolecular transfer of ammonia over a predicted distance of 46 Å from one active site to another within Qns1 monomers.

Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 1The abbreviations used are: NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NaAD or deamido-NAD, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide; GAT, glutamine amidotransferase; Qns1, glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase; 5FOA, 5-fluoroorotoic acid; HA, hemagglutinin. and its phosphorylated form NADP are essential for oxidizing reactions in the cell, whereas reduced forms of these co-enzymes, NADH and NADPH, are essential for supplying reducing equivalents. Beyond the reversible functions of NAD+ in hundreds of enzyme-dependent redox reactions, at least two types of enzymes consume NAD+ in eukaryotic nuclei in the process of forming or reversing post-translational modifications. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases respond to DNA strand breaks by transferring the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to target proteins, thereby facilitating DNA repair and other processes (1Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2Burkle A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Sirtuins, a family of protein lysine-deacetylases related to yeast Sir2, reverse regulatory acetyl modification of lysines on histones, p53, and other proteins typically to alter the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes (3Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 4Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NAD+ is consumed by Sir2 to produce a mixture of 2′- and 3′-O-acetylated ADP-ribose plus nicotinamide and the deacetylated polypeptide (5Sauve A.A. Celic I. Avalos J. Deng H. Boeke J.D. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15456-15463Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). NAD+-dependent deacetylation reactions are required not only for alterations in gene expression but also for repression of ribosomal DNA recombination and extension of lifespan in response to calorie restriction (6Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 7Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, Sirtuins perform lysine deacetylation to alter chromatin structure (8Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) as well as to regulate acetyl-CoA synthetase and potentially other metabolic enzymes (9Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerana J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Interest in the biological functions of Sir2 and Sirtuins has lead to re-examination of the biosynthetic routes to NAD+ in yeast and animals. It has long been established that the de novo, salvage, and import routes to NAD+ converge on nicotinic acid mononucleotide, which is then adenylylated to nicotinic acid dinucleotide (NaAD or deamido-NAD). Working with fungal and animal extracts, Preiss and Handler (10Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that the final enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis, NAD+ synthetase, uses glutamine as an amide donor as depicted in Scheme 1. NaAD+ATP+glutamine→NAD++AMP+PPi+glutamateSCHEME 1 Surprisingly, purification of NAD+ synthetase from Escherichia coli established the first of several prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases to be ammonia-dependent, at least in vitro (12Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Not long thereafter, purified yeast NAD+ synthetase was shown to be a large multimer and evidence was presented for the reaction pathway shown in Fig. 1 in which the enzyme forms an activated NaAD-adenylate (NaAD-AMP) intermediate that is subsequently exchanged for the side chain amine group from glutamine (13Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This work also showed that yeast NAD+ synthetase can use ammonia in vitro at elevated pH (13Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the pH/activity profile of yeast NAD+ synthetase suggests that the enzyme does not deprotonate NH4+ , which predominates at neutral pH. Thus, the glutamine dependence of eukaryotic (10Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) versus the ammonia dependence of E. coli (12Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) NAD+ synthetases created a problem in biochemistry and evolutionary biology that has stood for over 35 years. In the mean time, scores of enzymes have been characterized that couple a glutaminase domain to an ammonia-utilizing domain (14Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). These coupled glutaminases, termed glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) domains, have been classified as members of the triad-type or the N-terminal nucleophile-type superfamilies (14Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a superfamily of aminoacyl-tRNA trans-amidases were described as a third unrelated type of GAT (15Curnow A.W. Kw H. Yuan R. Si K. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Here we show that a domain related to nitrilase (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar) containing a conserved Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar) is the long sought GAT domain for eukaryotic NAD+ synthetase, Qns1 (Q for glutamine-dependent, NAD+ synthetase). As we noted earlier (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar), the nitrilase-related domain is found in all of the eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases and those prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases such as that from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are glutamine-dependent (17Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labo M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data establish that functional GAT and NAD+ synthetase active sites must be in the same polypeptide to function in vivo and in vitro. By showing that a heteromultimer consisting of polypeptides with mutations in the two different active sites is stably formed and yet is inactive in vivo, we provide genetic evidence for an obligate intramolecular path for ammonia. According to a homology model constructed for the glutaminase and the NAD+ synthetase domains of Qns1, the channel for transit of ammonia from the glutaminase active site to NaAD is ∼46-Å long and is lined with 12 amino acids that have been conserved in all of the known eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases.

Using single-stranded plasmid pB177 as template, primers 7039, 7040, 5095, 7033, and 7032 were used to generate qns1-E45A, qns1-K114A, qns1-C175A, qns1-D365A, and qns1-E527A alleles in plasmids pB379, pB378, pB178, pB252, and pB251, respectively (20Kunkel T.A.

Diploid yeast strain BY127 of genotype MATa/MATα, ura3/ura3, trp1/trp1, his3/his3, leu2/leu2, LYS2/lys2, MET15/met15 was integratively transformed with the resulting product. Stable transformants were selected on YPD medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418 and tested for heterozygosity at the QNS1 locus by PCR with primers R003 and R004. Heterozygous strain BY165 was transformed with plasmid pB175 carrying S. cerevisiae QNS1 and was induced to sporulate. Haploids obtained after tetrad dissection of this strain were scored for mating type, lysine and methionine prototrophy, and sensitivity to 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic (5FOA). Strain BY165–1d of genotype MATa, qns1Δ::kanMX4, ura3, trp1, his3, leu2, met15 carrying pB175 was transformed with plasmid pB229 carrying T. maritima QNS1 driven by a GAL1 promoter. These transformants exhibited galactose-dependent 5FOA resistance and then galactose-dependent and glucose-inhibited growth. Standard yeast media and methods were as described previously (25Kaiser C.

Enzyme Purification and Analysis—His-tagged yeast Qns1 proteins were expressed and purified from 2-liter cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) grown at 30 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and aerated an additional 5 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Clarified lysate was loaded on a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, which was washed with 50 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Enzymes were eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol and concentrated to 14–24 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris Cl, pH 7.5.

Glutaminase assays were performed with the same ingredients with or without NaAD. Ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase assays (0.1 ml) were initiated with 2.7 μg of wild-type or mutant enzymes. Glutamine-dependent assays were initiated with 270 ng of wild-type or 9 μg of mutant Qns1 enzymes. Glutamine-dependent assay volumes were 0.15 ml to allow one-third of the sample to be assayed for glutamate production. NaAD-free glutaminase assays contained 9 μg of enzyme in 0.05 ml. After triplicate 60-min, 37 °C incubations, reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min, chilled on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Supernatants were taken for product determinations using either alcohol dehydrogenase or glutamate dehydrogenase-coupled assays to determine NAD+ and glutamate (26Klem T.J. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) formation, respectively. NAD+ assays were in 0.9 ml of 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% ethanol. Absorbance (340 nm) was measured before and after a 10-min room temperature incubation with 39 units of alcohol dehydrogenase. NAD+ standards (0–100 nmol) were measured in the same reaction conditions before and after alcohol dehydrogenase incubation. Glutamate assays were in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NAD+, and 2.2 units glutamate dehydrogenase. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and clarified with a 2-min centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. For glutamate determinations, glutamate standards (0–32 nmol) underwent both incubations in parallel with samples and contained all of the ingredients other than Qns1. Absorbance (340 nm) was measured to quantify NAD+ reduced by glutamate dehydrogenase, which is limited by glutamate production. Immunoprecipitation—Wild-type laboratory yeast strain SEY6210 (18Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) transformed with plasmids carrying different Qns1 alleles under GAL1 promoter control were grown to early stationary phase in 50 ml of selective media with galactose as a carbon source. Cells were lysed by agitation with glass beads in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Clarified lysates (0.5 ml) were incubated with 30 μl of a suspension of anti-FLAG antibody cross-linked to agarose beads. After a 60-min incubation, beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and captured proteins were extracted with 8 m urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Duplicate Western blots were performed by probing with 1:10,000 dilutions of anti-FLAG or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Immune complexes were detected with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Sigma). QNS1 Is an Essential Yeast Gene—On the basis of its N-terminal domain of similarity to the nitrilase superfamily and its C-terminal similarity to single domain bacterial NAD+ synthetases, we identified the YHR074W gene of S. cerevisiae as the apparent yeast glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar), QNS1. This gene was disrupted with a G418 resistance marker in a wild-type diploid strain, which was induced to undergo meiosis and sporulation and was subjected to tetrad dissection. As shown in Fig. 2A, viability segregated 2 to 2. All of the viable progeny from this dissection were G418-sensitive, indicating that QNS1 is either essential for spore germination or viability in S. cerevisiae. The QNS1 gene from S. cerevisiae and the homologous gene from the thermophilic eubacterium T. maritima were cloned into yeast centromeric plasmids, the latter gene under transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter. Transformation of the former URA3-based plasmid into qns1 heterozygous strain PB165 prior to tetrad dissection allowed as many as four viable progeny to be recovered per tetrad (Fig. 2B). Transformation of the T. maritima QNS1 plasmid into an isolate with qns1Δ covered by S. cerevisiae QNS1 allowed the curing of the yeast gene, producing isolates that exhibited galactose-dependent and glucose-repressible growth. Fig. 2C shows this rare case of complementation of a eukaryotic gene deletion by a corresponding thermophilic gene. In contrast to its annotation as ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase (22Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M.

Fraser C.M. et al.Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), this bacterial NAD+ synthetase includes a nitrilase-related domain (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar) and does indeed encode glutamine-dependent enzyme activity. 2P. Bieganowski, H. C. Pace, and C. Brenner, unpublished results. Because 5FOA-resistant, i.e. Ura-isolates (27Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) of strain PB165, could not be recovered without a second Qns1-encoding plasmid and because transformants with the T. maritima plasmid exhibited galactose-dependent growth, we conclude that QNS1 is an essential gene not only for spore germination but for cell growth. Glutamine Dependent NAD + Synthetase Contains an Essential GAT Domain Related to Nitrilase—According to the domain structure of Qns1 (Fig. 3A), we predicted that the first 310 amino acids constitute a glutaminase domain containing an active-site Cys-175 that aligns with the essential nucleophile for all of the enzymes in the nitrilase superfamily (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, according to the crystal structure of NitFhit and subsequent analysis, all of the members of the nitrilase superfamily contain a catalytic triad consisting of an absolutely conserved Glu and Lys in addition to the Cys nucleophile (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar, 28Pace H.C. Hodawadekar S.C. Draganescu A. Huang J. Bieganowski P. Pekarsky Y. Croce C.M. Brenner C. Curr.

This predicted ion pair corresponds to Glu-45 and Lys-114 of Qns1. Residues 311 to the C terminus of Qns1 align with single domain ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetases, such as those from E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. Based on crystal structures of B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase (30Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5125-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we targeted Asp-365 and Glu-527 for substitution with Ala. Because the corresponding residues, Asp-50 and Glu-162 in B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase, are involved in recognition of one of two Mg2+ ions positioned at the site of adenylylation/amidation of NaAD (30Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5125-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we reasoned that resulting Qns1 mutants would fail to form the NaAD-AMP intermediate and result in loss of function. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3B, neither the E45A, the K114A, nor the C175A-predicted glutaminase mutants were functional in vivo nor were the predicted synthetase alleles D365A and E527A able to support growth. Additionally, truncation mutants missing either of the two domains failed to complement (data not shown). Thus, yeast NAD+ synthetase is an obligate glutamine-dependent enzyme in vivo. To test whether the point mutants were loss-of-function for the predicted reasons, we expressed and purified His-tagged wild-type and mutant Qns1 proteins in E. coli. For each protein, we measured glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity, ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity, and glutaminase activity in the presence and absence of NaAD (Table III). Consistent with the specific activity of native yeast glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase (13Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant Qns1 purified from E. coli produced 2440 ± 220 nmol NAD+/min/mg and produced 3430 ± 180 nmol glutamate/min/mg, indicating that a single glutamine is hydrolyzed for each ammonia consumed by the NAD+ synthetase active site. When glutaminase activity of wild-type enzyme was assayed in the absence of NaAD, glutamate production was reduced to 4% of the rate found in complete reactions. At pH 8, using NH4Cl as the source of ammonia, wild-type Qns1 produced 4% as much NAD+ as it did with glutamine as the ammonia source. Consistent with our prediction that the nitrilase-related domain is a GAT for eukaryotic NAD+ synthetase (16Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar), Qns1-C175A had at least a 5000-fold reduction in glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity and a >250-fold reduction in glutaminase activity that was not further reduced by leaving out NaAD. Comparing the Qns1-C175A mutant to wild-type Qns1, there was a <2-fold reduction in ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity, indicating that ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity does not depend on a functioning GAT domain. Although the Qns1-E45A and Qns1-K114A mutants failed to complement the lethal phenotype of qns1 deletion, we were able to measure 0.5 and 0.1% of the wild-type specific activity in glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity (the latter of which was at least eight times higher than the background of the assay) and 6 and 3%, respectively, in glutaminase assays containing NaAD. Just as the C175A mutant lost the wild-type enzyme's 27-fold stimulation of its glutaminase active site with presence of NaAD, the glutaminase activity of the E45A mutant with the ammonia-accepting NaAD substrate was no higher than without NaAD. In contrast, the residual glutaminase activity measured for Qns1-K114A was stimulated by NaAD by >60-fold.Table IIIActive site-dependent enzymatic activities of recombinant qns1EnzymeSpecific activityGln-dependent NAD synthetaseNH3-dependent NAD synthetaseGlutaminase with NaADGlutaminase without NaADnmol/min/mgQns12870 ± 20125 ± 34080 ± 30151 ± 4Qns1-E45A13.2 ± 1.957.2 ± 1.0267 ± 6240 ± 2Qns1-K114A4.1 ± 0.5107 ± 1128 ± 410.9 ± 0.3Qns1-C175A< 0.576.7 ± 2.414.1 ± 2.434.3 ± 0.9Qns1-E527A< 0.5<0.9101 ± 5118 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Although the near-normal ammo"

The amino acid sequence deduced from this open reading frame shows similarity (32% identity) with that of Bacillus phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase (Kato, Y., Nakamura, K., Sakiyama, H., Mayhew, S. G., and Asano, Y. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 800–809). The gene product expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the dehydration of aldoxime into nitrile. The Pseudomonas aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA) was purified from the E. coli transformant and characterized. OxdA shows an absorption spectrum with a Soret peak that is characteristic of heme, demonstrating that it is a hemoprotein. For its activity, this enzyme required a reducing reagent, Na2S2O4, but did not require FMN, which is crucial for the Bacillus enzyme. The enzymatic reaction was found to be catalyzed when the heme iron of the enzyme was in the ferrous state. Calcium as well as iron was included in the enzyme. OxdA reduced by Na2S2O4 had a molecular mass of 76.2 kDa and consisted of two identical subunits. The kinetic parameters of OxdA indicated that aliphatic aldoximes are more effective substrates than aromatic aldoximes. A variety of spectral shifts in the absorption spectra of OxdA were observed upon the addition of each of various compounds (i.e. redox reagents and heme ligands). Moreover, the addition of the substrate to OxdA gave a peak that would be derived from the intermediate in the nitrile synthetic reaction. P. chlororaphis B23 grew and showed the OxdA activity when cultured in a medium containing aldoxime as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. Together with these findings, Western blotting analysis of the extracts using anti-OxdA antiserum revealed that OxdA is responsible for the metabolism of aldoxime in vivo in this strain.

One of the fruits of our application-oriented nitrile studies is the current industrial production of acrylamide and nicotinamide involving NHase of an actinomycete, Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 (1Kobayashi M.

Records. 2001; 1: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is now used for the production of 5-cyanovaleramide, a herbicide intermediate, at the industrial level (28Hann E.C. Eisenberg A. Fager S.K. Perkins N.E. Gallagher F.G. Cooper S.M. Gavagan J.E. Stieglitz B. Hennessey S.M. DiCosimo R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2239-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because the amount of NHase produced comprises more than 50% of all soluble protein in P. chlororaphis B23 when this strain is cultured in the presence of methacrylamide (29Nagasawa T. Ryuno K. Yamada H. Experientia. 1989; 45: 1066-1070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there must be a very interesting regulation mechanism for the enzyme expression (8Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have already cloned the NHase gene from this strain, and discovered the existence of a gene cluster containing the NHase and amidase genes (30Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have clarified its nitrile degradation mechanism at the protein and gene levels, an enzyme and its gene involved in the nitrile-synthetic pathway (which might be present in this strain) have never been identified. In the biosynthesis of nitriles, aldoxime (R-CH=N-OH) is one of the candidate intermediates (31Sibbesen O. Koch B. Rouze P. Møller B.L. Halkier B.A. Wallsgrove R.M. Amino Acids and Their Derivatives in Higher Plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995: 227-241Google Scholar). Indoleacetaldoxime, which is derived from tryptophan, is dehydrated to indoleacetonitrile in some higher plants. Aldoximes are also converted to cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates (31Sibbesen O. Koch B. Rouze P. Møller B.L. Halkier B.A. Wallsgrove R.M. Amino Acids and Their Derivatives in Higher Plants.

Biochem. 1967; 2: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other than these aldoximes, some naturally occurring aldoximes have so far been found in microorganisms; e.g. 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoacetaldehyde oxime (which was discovered as a phosphorylated cholinesterase reactivator) in a fungus, Penicillium olsonii (36Amade P. Mallea M. Bouaïcha N. J. Antibiotics. 1994; 47: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, there have only been two reports on purified enzymes (involved in nitrile synthesis from aldoxime) whose genes have been cloned but which belong to different superfamilies: (i) CYP71E1, a cytochrome P450 (which catalyzes the conversion of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime to p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile) in dhurrin biosynthesis of sorghum (37Bak S. Kahn R.A. Nielsen H.L. Møller B.L. Halkier B.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and (ii) phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase (which catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime to phenylacetonitrile) linked with nitrilase in nitrile metabolism of Bacillus sp. strain OxB-1 (38Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In particular, regarding the phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase, only one paper (38Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) on analyses at the protein and gene levels has been published. Although the Bacillus enzyme has been found to bind loosely to heme and requires FMN for its enzymatic activity, the function of such cofactors remains unknown. Biochemical and genetic information on the enzyme remain limited. This enzyme is also expected to be applicable to the production of nitriles from the corresponding aldoximes, because the chemical dehydration of aldoximes usually requires harsh reaction conditions (39Xie S.X.

In the present study, we discovered a gene (oxdA) of a novel nitrile-synthesizing enzyme linked with NHase in P. chlororaphis B23. We constructed an Escherichia coli transformant overexpressing OxdA, and we purified OxdA and determined its enzymological, physicochemical, and spectroscopic properties. We also report that aldoxime dehydratase is a unique enzyme involved in the metabolism of aldoxime in vivo in P. chlororaphis B23. Materials—All aldoximes were purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and a low molecular weight standard kit were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. TSK gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M was purchased from Tosoh Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Cellulofine HAp was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Standard proteins for high performance gel filtration chromatography were obtained from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). All other biochemicals were standard commercial preparations. Plasmids, Strains, and Media—Plasmid pPCN4 carrying the 6.5-kb SphI-SalI fragment on pUC19 (30Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for sequencing of the upstream region of the amidase gene in P. chlororaphis B23. E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used as the host for pUC plasmids (40Yanisch-Perron C. Yieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21-Codonplus(DE3)-RIL (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as the host for one plasmid, pET-24a(+) (Novagen), and its derivative and was also used for expression of the aldoxime dehydratase gene (oxdA). E. coli transformants were grown in 2× YT medium (41Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The culture medium for P. chlororaphis B23 was composed of 1% sucrose, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.05% KH2PO4, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.001% of FeSO4·7H2O (pH 7.0). Unless otherwise stated, sucrose and (NH4)2SO4 were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. DNA Manipulations—Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Nucleotides were sequenced by the dideoxy chain-terminating method using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Unless otherwise stated, DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Maniatis et al. (41Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Aldoxime Dehydratase—The coding sequence of the enzyme was amplified by PCR with pPCN4 (30Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The following two oligonucleotide primers were used: sense primer (5′-CATATGGAATCTGCGATCGACACGC-3′) containing an NdeI recognition site (underlined) and 22 nucleotides of oxdA starting with the ATG start codon; and antisense primer (5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGGTGGGCGCGACAACGGC-3′) containing an SalI recognition site (underlined) and 21 nucleotides that are complementary to the 3′-end sequence of oxdA ending with the TGA stop codon. The amplified DNA was subcloned into vector pUC18 and checked by DNA sequencing. The insert DNA was digested with NdeI and SalI and then inserted into the respective sites of pET-24a(+). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-oxdA; in this construction, oxdA was under the control of the T7 promoter. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was transformed with pET-oxdA, and the recombinant cells were used for the overproduction and purification of aldoxime dehydratase. The transformed cells were incubated with reciprocal shaking at 37 °C in 240 ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After overnight cultivation, the entire culture was inoculated into 48 liters of the same medium, followed by incubation with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the T7 promoter, and further cultivation was carried out at 15 °C for 7 days. All purification procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. Potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was used throughout the purification. Centrifugation was carried out for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 100 mm buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then disrupted by sonication (Insonator model 201M; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) to prepare a cell-free extract. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (40–60% saturation), followed by dialysis against 10 mm buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer. Protein was eluted from the column with 1.2 liters of 10 mm buffer, the concentration of KCl being increased linearly from 0.1 to 0.4 m. The active fractions were collected, and then ammonium sulfate was added to give 70% saturation. After centrifugation of the suspension, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 m buffer and brought to 20% ammonium sulfate saturation. The enzyme solution was placed on a TSK gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (5 × 22 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer 20% saturated with ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted by lowering the concentration of ammonium sulfate (from 20 to 5%) in 1.2 liters of the same buffer. The active fractions were combined and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.1 m buffer, and then dialyzed against 10 mm buffer containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate. The enzyme solution was put on a phenyl-Sepharose column (5 × 22 cm) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. After the column had been washed fully with 10 mm buffer containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate, the enzyme was eluted with 10 mm buffer. The active fractions were combined and pooled. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme solution to give 70% saturation. After centrifugation of the suspension, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 m buffer, followed by dialysis against three changes of 2 liters of 1 mm buffer (pH 6.8). After centrifugation, the enzyme solution was loaded on a Cellulofine HAp column (5 × 22 cm) equilibrated with 1 mm buffer (pH 6.8). The column was eluted with a linear gradient, 1–100 mm, of the buffer (pH 6.8). The enzyme solution was refractionated with ammonium sulfate (50–60% saturation). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 0.1 m buffer. The resultant solution was dialyzed against 10 mm buffer and then centrifuged. The homogeneity of the purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Assays—All of the reactions were performed under linear conditions as to protein (∼2.5 μg/ml) and time (∼5 min). The standard assay A mixture comprised 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm butyraldoxime, and an appropriate amount of enzyme, in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of butyraldoxime and carried out for 5 min at 30 °C under aerobic conditions. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m KOH, and a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min). The reaction product was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC-14BPF; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column (3.2 mm × 2.1 m) packed with Gaskuropack 56 (80/100% mesh; GL-Science, Tokyo, Japan). Standard assay A was performed throughout the purification procedures. After the purification, the enzyme assaying in all of the following experiments was performed by means of standard assay B (anaerobically under reduced conditions), unless otherwise stated. In the case of standard assay B, Na2S2O4 (final, 5 mm) was added to the buffer. One unit of aldoxime dehydratase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of butyronitrile/min from butyraldoxime under the standard assay A and B conditions, respectively. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein. Determination of the Prosthetic Group—Heme staining was carried out as described by Klatt et al. (42Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Heme was identified, and its stoichiometry was estimated by conversion to the pyridine hemochrome (43Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1964: 240Google Scholar). This procedure consisted of adding pyridine (final, 20%) and then KOH (final, 50 mm) and a small amount of Na2S2O4 to the enzyme. After 15 min, the spectrum of the pyridine hemochrome was recorded. The hemochrome was determined using the published molar absorption coefficient (ϵ) for the hemochrome of protoheme IX, 34.4 mm–1 cm–1, at 557 nm (43Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1964: 240Google Scholar). Acid-acetone heme extraction was carried out (44Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was added with rapid stirring to 9 volumes of 15 mm HCl in acetone at 0 °C, followed by incubation for 10 min at 0 °C in the dark. After a 10-min centrifugation at 17,000 × g, the supernatant was pooled, and the same operation was repeated to prepare a pyridine hemochrome. Molecular Mass Determination—The purified enzyme sample was applied to a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was attached to an ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences), and then eluted with 100 mm buffer containing 0.15 m KCl at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For the enzyme in the ferrous state after reduction with Na2S2O4, on the other hand, 100 mm buffer containing 0.15 m KCl and 10 mm Na2S2O4 was used. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 280 and 422 nm. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the standard proteins, glutamate dehydrogenase (290 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (142 kDa), enolase (67 kDa), adenylate kinase (32 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Metal Analysis—All glassware was soaked in 2 m HCl overnight and then exhaustively rinsed with distilled water before use. Prior to analysis, the enzyme was dialyzed against 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The dialysis had no effect on the enzyme activity. The enzyme sample containing 0.94 mg of protein/ml was analyzed with an inductively coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrophotometer, Shimadzu ICPS-8000 (27.120 MHz). The metal contents of the enzyme sample were determined from the calibration curves for standard solutions. Immunoblot Analysis—A female New Zealand White rabbit was immunized four times at 2-week intervals. The first and second injections were performed intradermally with the purified OxdA (500 μg) in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). The booster injection was of 500 μg of antigen homogenized in an equal volume of incomplete adjuvant (Difco). Western blotting analysis was carried out as described below. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sequi-Blot™; Bio-Rad). After blocking with 1% skim milk, the blots were incubated with rabbit antisera directed against OxdA at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Methods—The absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer. The protein concentrations were determined with a Nakalai Tesque Co., Inc. (Kyoto, Japan) protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE were carried out as described by Davis (45Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar) and Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), respectively. For SDS-PAGE, the following marker proteins were used to determine the relative molecular mass of the enzyme: phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). Nucleotide Sequence of the Open Reading Frame and Identification and Purification of the Gene Product—In a previous study (30Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), based upon the results of SDS-PAGE analysis and enzyme assaying, we demonstrated that the region corresponding to the presumed 38-kDa protein (which would be located upstream of the amidase gene in P. chlororaphis B23) is required for maximum expression of the NHase gene in the E. coli transformant. Here, therefore, we sequenced the upstream region of the amidase gene in pPCN4 and found one open reading frame (ORF) clustered in the same direction with the structural genes of amidase, subunits α and β of NHase, the presumed 47-kDa protein (P47K), and OrfE. The nucleotide sequence of the ORF consists of 1,056 nucleotides (Fig. 1A), encoding 352 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 40,127 Da. A possible ribosome-binding site (GAGGA) is located 8 nucleotides upstream from the ATG. A search with the BLAST program revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF exhibits low similarity (32% identity) with that of the phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase gene (oxd) of Bacillus sp. OxB-1 (38Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These genes have been found to comprise a superfamily, our enzyme being the second member of this superfamily. An expression plasmid (pET-oxdA) for the ORF was constructed and introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)RIL. The recombinant protein was obtained as an insoluble form almost completely when the E. coli transformant was cultured at 37 °C. To increase the amount of the soluble enzyme form, various culture conditions were examined. Under the optimum conditions for 7 days at 15 °C, we succeeded in expressing the recombinant protein at a level corresponding to about 10% of the total amount of soluble protein (data not shown). Cell-free extracts prepared from the E. coli transformant carrying the ORF dehydrated butyraldoxime as a substrate, yielding butyronitrile. This finding demonstrated that this ORF encodes aldoxime dehydratase. Thus, the gene was designated as oxdA. OxdA was purified through the purification steps described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of OxdA was confirmed by migration of the protein as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼38 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The M r of the native enzyme was 76.4 kDa according to the results of gel filtration chromatography, indicating that OxdA consists of two identical subunits. The purified OxdA showed specific activity of 0.758 units/mg (under aerobic conditions) (Table I).Table IPurification of OxdAStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Cell-free extract18,9003,2500.172100(NH4)2SO4 (0.40-0.60)10,9001,6200.14950.0DEAE-Sephacel2,4903930.15812.1Butyl-Toyopearl4372460.5207.53Phenyl-Sepharose3532050.5816.31Cellulofine HAp2792060.7406.35(NH"

Upon stimulation with extracellular signals, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) stimulate the exchange of GDP to GTP to shift toward the active forms of small GTPases, recognizing the downstream targets. Here we show that KIAA0793, containing substantial sequence homology with the catalytic Dbl homology domain of the faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), is a specific GEF for Cdc42. We, therefore, tentatively named it FRG (FGD1-related Cdc42-GEF). Src kinase directly phosphorylates and activates FRG, as Vav family GEFs. Additionally, FRG is involved in the signaling pathway from the endothelin A receptor to c-Jun N-terminal kinase, resulting in the inhibition of cell motility. These results suggest that FRG is a member of Cdc42-GEF and plays an important role in the signaling pathway downstream of G protein-coupled receptors.

Furthermore, Rho family GTPases have been implicated in the control of diverse physiological responses, such as cell proliferation and cell motility as well as in physiopathological processes such as transformation and metastasis (7Ridley A.J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We previously showed that endothelin, a ligand of GPCRs, activates JNK via the signaling pathway dependent upon Src kinase and Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (33Yamauchi J. Miyamoto Y. Kokubu H. Nishii H. Okamoto M. Sugawara Y. Hirasawa A. Tsujimoto G. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this signaling pathway, Src kinase acts as an upstream regulator of Rac1 and Cdc42. However, the detailed mechanism linking Src kinase to Rho family GTPases remains unclear (34Sah V.P. Seasholz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of GPCR-mediated activation of Rho family GTPases, we performed a BLAST search using Dbl big sister (Dbs), a GEF involved in GPCR-mediated activation of Rho family GTPases (35Yamauchi J. Hirasawa A. Miyamoto Y. Kokubu H. Nishii H. Okamoto M. Sugawara Y. Tsujimoto G. Itoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as a query. As a result, we found a novel Rho family GEF gene, KIAA0793. The KIAA0793 protein shows sequence similarity to a human faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), which is a specific activator of Cdc42 (36Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G.

In the present study, we show that KIAA0793 is a specific GEF toward Cdc42, thus termed FRG (FGD1-related Cdc42-GEF). FRG is directly phosphorylated by Src kinase, which increases the Cdc42-GEF activity of FRG. We also demonstrate that FRG is involved in the signaling pathway linking the endothelin A (ETA) receptor to JNK, leading to the inhibition of cell motility. Taken together, our results indicate that FRG is a novel member of Cdc42-GEFs and may act as a direct regulator linking the Src kinase and Rho family GTPases in the chemore-pellant GPCR-JNK-signaling pathway.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Human kidney epithelial 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The final amount of the transfected DNA for a 60-mm dish was adjusted to 25 μg by an empty vector, pCMV. 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-2HA-FRG, 1 μg of pCMV-2HA-FRG-ΔDH, 1 μg of pCMV-2HA-FRG-ΔDHPH, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-FRG-FERM, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-FRG-proline, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-FRG-DHPH, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-FRG-2nd PH, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RhoA, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Rac1, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAGCdc42, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RhoG14V, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RacG12V, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Cdc42G12V, 1 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RhoT19N, 1 μg of pCMV-FLAG-RacT17N, 1 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Cdc42T17N, 3 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK4K95R, 3 μg of pUSE-CA-Src, 0.3 μg of pME-ETARenhanced green fluorescence protein, or 1 μg of SRα-HA-JNK1. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and cells were starved in a serum-free medium for 24 h before the addition of 100 nm endothelin-1. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—After the addition of endothelin-1, cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPESNaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for a 60-mm dish. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (400 μg) of the supernatants were mixed with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B preabsorbed with 0.5 μg of anti-FLAG or 0.5 μg of anti-HA antibody. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with kinase buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μm Na3VO4, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate) for JNK, kinase buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μm Na3VO4, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate) for Src kinase, or an exchange buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 mm EDTA). To compare the amounts of the immunoprecipitates or expressed proteins in the cell lysates in each transfection, the precipitates or aliquots of the cell lysates were boiled in a Laemmli sample buffer and then separated on 8–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and immunoblotted with antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Images of protein bands were captured using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 plug-in software and an EPSON GT-7000U scanner. The band intensity of kinases was semiquantified using NIH Image 1.61. Representatives of at least three separate experiments are shown in the figures. Kinase Assays—After the addition of 100 nm endothelin-1 for 20 min, transfected cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A for a 60-mm dish, and the lysates were centrifuged as described above. Aliquots (400 μg) of the supernatants were mixed with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B preabsorbed with anti-HA antibody.

Activities were normalized to the amounts of immunoprecipitated JNK, as estimated from these band intensities. Pull-down Assays of Rho Family GTPases—Cells were stimulated with or without 100 nm endothelin-1 for 15 min and then lysed in lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). To detect active GTP-bound Rho family GTPases in the cell lysates, we performed pull-down assays using recombinant GST-tagged mDia1RBD (for RhoA) and αPakCRIB (for Rac1 and Cdc42) as described previously (32Yamauchi J.

Aliquots (400 μg) of the supernatants mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B with 10 μg of GST-mDia1RBD or 20 μg of GST-αPakCRIB were precipitated by centrifugation, and complexes were boiled in a Laemmli sample buffer and then separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were immunoblotted using each antibody against Rho family small GTPases. Exchange Assays—After the addition of endothelin-1 for 15 min, cells were lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer A for a 10-cm dish, and the lysates were centrifuged as described above. Aliquots (800 μg) of the supernatants were used for the exchange assay. For releasing assays, the [3H]GDP-bound Rho family GTPases were obtained by incubation with an exchange buffer containing 125 ng/μl Rho GTPases, 250 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.3 μm [3H]GDP (0.3 μCi/μl) at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 mm MgCl2, and mixtures were immediately cooled on ice. The immunoprecipitated DH domains of FRG and the FRG protein were incubated in 30 μl of an exchange buffer containing 16 ng/μl Rho GTPases·[3H]GDP, 33 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, and 3 μm cold GDP at 30 °C for 0, 10, 20, and 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of an ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2) and filtered through nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immediately washed twice with an ice-cold wash buffer and air-dried. The radioactivity remaining on each membrane was measured by an LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Palo Alto, CA). For the binding assay, the immunoprecipitated DH domain of FRG and the FRG protein were incubated in 30 μl of an exchange buffer containing 16 ng/μl Rho GTPases, 33 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, and 3 μm [32P]GTP (0.1 μCi/μl) at 30 °C for 0, 10, 20, and 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding an ice-cold wash buffer and filtered through nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immediately washed twice with a wash buffer and air-dried. The radioactivity remaining on each membrane was measured as before. Activities were normalized to the amounts of FRG polypeptides in the immunoprecipitates. In Vitro Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Cells were lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer A for a 10-cm dish, and the lysates were centrifuged, as described above. Aliquots (800 μg) of the supernatants were used for an in vitro phosphorylation reaction using recombinant c-Src (6 units) in 30 μl of kinase buffer B containing 20 μm ATP at 30 °C for 15 min and then chilled on ice. The tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG protein was washed twice with an exchange buffer and used for an exchange reaction for Cdc42. Cell Motility Assay—Cell motility was measured using a 24-well Boyden chamber (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, upper wells with polyethylene terephthalate filters (8-μm pore size) were coated with 10 μg/ml extra cellular matrix E-C-L (Upstate). Serum-starved cells (2 × 105 cells in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium per well) were loaded into upper wells, which were immediately plated on the chamber containing 165 nm endothelin-1 (750 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium per well). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, upper filters were stained with a Diff-Quick staining kit (Biochemical Sciences Inc., Sterling Height, MI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells that had not migrated were wiped away from the inner surface of the upper wells. Using an optical microscope, the number of migrated cells was counted in at least three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using SAS StatView 5.0. Values shown represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. A Student's t test was carried out for intergroup comparisons (*, p < 0.01). KIAA0793 Shows a Significant Homology to Cdc42-specific GEFs—We performed a BLAST search using the DH domain of Dbs because Dbs was implicated in the signaling pathway linking GPCRs to Rho family GTPases (35Yamauchi J.

The search revealed the appearance of several uncharacterized proteins exhibiting a putative DH domain. One of them, KIAA0793, was of particular interest and further characterized. Fig. 1 shows the structural features of KIAA0793 in comparison with those of other Rho family GEFs. This molecule contains a tandem of DH and two PH domains, the DH domain being closely related to those of CDEP (chondrocyte-derived ezrin-like domain-containing protein) (43Koyano Y. Kawamoto T.

KIAA0793 contains an N-terminal region exhibiting extensive homology to the FERM domain, also called band 4.1 homology domain of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins, which function as the cross-linker between plasma membranes and actin filaments (45Bretscher A.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). KIAA0793 Activates Cdc42 but Not RhoA and Rac1—To examine which Rho family GTPases are activated by the DH and PH domains of KIAA0793, the ability of KIAA0793 to induce the dissociation of [3H]GDP from recombinant RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins was measured. It has been demonstrated that the isolated fragment containing DH and PH domains of Rho family GEFs acts as a limited catalytic domain toward Rho family GTPases (12Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K.

https://openalex.org/W2050372094,"We report chromosome 3p deletion mapping of 32 cervical carcinoma (CC) biopsies using 26 microsatellite markers located in frequently deleted 3p regions to detect loss of heterozygosity and homozygous loss. In addition, two STS markers (NLJ-003 and NL3-001) located in the 3p21.3 telomeric (3p21.3T) and 3p21.3 centromeric (3p21.3C) regions, respectively, were used for quantitative real-time PCR as TaqMan probes. We show that quantitative real-time PCR is reliable and sensitive and allows discriminating between 0, 1 and 2 marker copies per human genome. For the first time, frequent (five of 32 cases, i.e. 15.6%) homozygous deletions were demonstrated in CCs in both 3p21.3T and 3p21.3C regions. The smallest region homozygously deleted in 3p21.3C was located between D3S1568 (CACNA2D2 gene) and D3S4604 (SEMA3F gene) and contains 17 genes previously defined as lung cancer candidate Tumor suppressor genes (TSG(s)). The smallest region homozygously deleted in 3p21.3T was flanked by D3S1298 and NL1-024 (D3S4285), excluding DLEC1 and MYD88 as candidate TSGs involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Overall, this region contains five potential candidates, namely GOLGA4, APRG1, ITGA9, HYA22 and VILL, which need to be analysed. The data showed that aberrations of either NLJ-003 or NL3-001 were detected in 29 cases (90.6%) and most likely have a synergistic effect (P<0.01). The study also demonstrated that aberrations in 3p21.3 were complex and in addition to deletions, may involve gene amplification as well. The results strongly suggest that 3p21.3T and 3p21.3C regions harbor genes involved in the origin and/or development of CCs and imply that those genes might be multiple TSG(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1964290462,"Chromosome 9 alterations are the most frequently encountered cytologic anomalies in urothelial carcinoma (UC). We previously screened 139 low-stage UCs for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9, and identified five distinct regions likely to harbour tumour-suppressor genes. The present study focused on deletion mapping in the 9q22 region with 11 additional microsatellite markers. New deletions in the 9q22 region were found in five tumours. Deletion mapping allowed us to identify a 0.5 CM common minimal region of deletion between markers D9S280 and D9S1809, encompassing PATCHED (PTC), a gene identified as a tumour suppressor in basal cell carcinoma and in medulloblastoma. A marker located in the first intron of this gene showed the highest percentage of deletion (45%). cDNA sequencing in 15 tumours with deletion of PTC showed no mutation in the remaining allele. However, average expression of PTC mRNA measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR was significantly decreased in tumours with LOH in the 9q22 region, compared to normal urothelium (P=0.04), while it showed marked fluctuations in tumours without deletion. Our results suggest that the PTC gene is a putative suppressor at the 9q22 locus and that haploinsufficiency of this gene may be an early event in the development of papillary bladder tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2091092470,"Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase structurally related to focal adhesion kinase, has been implicated in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and ion channels, the induction of apoptosis, and in the modulation of the cytoskeleton. In order to understand how Pyk2 signaling mediates these diverse cellular functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal part of Pyk2 that contains potential protein-protein interaction sites as bait. A prominent binder of Pyk2 identified by this method was the Arf-GTPase-activating protein ASAP1. Pyk2-ASAP1 interaction was confirmed in pull-down as well as in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and contact sites were mapped to the proline-rich regions of Pyk2 and the SH3 domain of ASAP1. Pyk2 directly phosphorylates ASAP1 on tyrosine residues in vitro and increases ASAP1 tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 308 and 782 affects the phosphoinositide binding profile of ASAP1, and fluorimetric Arf-GTPase assays with purified proteins revealed an inhibition of ASAP1 GTPase-activating protein activity by Pyk2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore provide evidence for a functional interaction between Pyk2 and ASAP1 and a regulation of ASAP1 and hence Arf1 activity by Pyk2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase structurally related to focal adhesion kinase, has been implicated in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and ion channels, the induction of apoptosis, and in the modulation of the cytoskeleton. In order to understand how Pyk2 signaling mediates these diverse cellular functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal part of Pyk2 that contains potential protein-protein interaction sites as bait. A prominent binder of Pyk2 identified by this method was the Arf-GTPase-activating protein ASAP1. Pyk2-ASAP1 interaction was confirmed in pull-down as well as in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and contact sites were mapped to the proline-rich regions of Pyk2 and the SH3 domain of ASAP1. Pyk2 directly phosphorylates ASAP1 on tyrosine residues in vitro and increases ASAP1 tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 308 and 782 affects the phosphoinositide binding profile of ASAP1, and fluorimetric Arf-GTPase assays with purified proteins revealed an inhibition of ASAP1 GTPase-activating protein activity by Pyk2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore provide evidence for a functional interaction between Pyk2 and ASAP1 and a regulation of ASAP1 and hence Arf1 activity by Pyk2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Pyk2 and FAK 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; PH, pleckstrin homology; SH, Src homology; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; aa, amino acids; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. comprise a distinct family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases that are involved in transmission of extracellular signals to intracellular kinase cascades and regulation of diverse cellular responses such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Pyk2 and FAK share about 45% amino acid identity and a similar domain structure: a unique N terminus containing a FERM (band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain, a central protein tyrosine kinase domain, two proline-rich sequences, and an FAT (focal adhesion targeting) domain in the C terminus. FAK is found in almost all tissues, whereas Pyk2 is mainly expressed in neuronal and hematopoietic cells. Whereas FAK is localized to focal adhesion sites in adherent cells, Pyk2 is rather diffused throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated in perinuclear regions (2Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both kinases can be regulated by integrins, growth factor receptors, and G-protein-coupled receptors. However, Pyk2 is unique in the way that its activation is triggered by intracellular calcium elevation and/or protein kinase C (3Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15125-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Together with Src that binds to autophosphorylated tyrosine 402 of Pyk2, it can function upstream of small G-proteins, such as Ras, Rac, and Rho, linking different transmembrane receptors with mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (1Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 3Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins constitute another family of small GTPases that were originally identified as co-factors required for the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs subunits (5Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arf1, the best characterized mammalian Arf, recruits coat proteins to membranes of the Golgi apparatus and has been implicated in intra-Golgi and Golgito-endoplasmic reticulum transport, endosome function, and synaptic vesicle formation (6Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 8Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, Arf GTPases are also involved in recruitment of paxillin to focal adhesions and remodeling of the cytoskeleton as cells change shape or move (9Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Arfs are distinct from other small GTPases in their strictly GTP-dependent recruitment to membranes and in the virtual absence of any intrinsic GTPase activity. Therefore, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are necessary for the completion of the full GTP-GDP cycle of Arfs (10Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A number of Arf-GAPs have been identified of which some are co-regulated by acidic lipids and phosphoinositides. One of those Arf-GAPs is ASAP1 (Arf-GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeats and PH domain) that binds to Src and displays phospholipid-dependent activity toward Arf1 and Arf5. Upon binding, Src can phosphorylate ASAP1, but the functional consequence of this phosphorylation has remained unclear (12Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). More recently, FAK has also been shown to interact with ASAP1, and an involvement of ASAP1 in cell spreading and focal adhesion localization of FAK as well as paxillin has been suggested (13Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, FAK does not phosphorylate ASAP1 nor modulate its activity. Pyk2 can also interact with an Arf-GAP called PAPα (Pyk2 C-terminal associated protein), but again the functional consequence of this interaction has remained elusive (14Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have identified ASAP1 as a new binding partner of Pyk2 and mapped the interaction to the SH3 domain of ASAP1 and the proline-rich regions of Pyk2. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a direct phosphorylation of ASAP1 by Pyk2 and a subsequent regulation of the ASAP1 GTPase activity. We therefore suggest a role of Pyk2 in regulating Arf function and potentially vesicular trafficking. Our results provide a first molecular mechanism how tyrosine kinases can modulate signaling of small Arf GTPases.

All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen, and all other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Applichem, ICN, Merck, and Sigma. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—For yeast two-hybrid studies, a C-terminal portion of Pyk2 (aa 781–1009) or FAK (aa 693–1053) cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment in-frame with the LexA sequence in pBTM116. The pGEX-PRNK (proline-rich non-kinase) vector encoding the fusion protein GST-PRNK was constructed by insertion of PRNK (aa 781–1009 of Pyk2) into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-4T. FLAG-tagged ASAP1 was a gift from P. Randazzo (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). To obtain the FLAG-ASAP1-δSH3 deletion mutant, ASAP1 lacking the SH3 domain (aa 1–1054) was subcloned in EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG. Point mutants of mouse ASAP1 were generated using the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Tyr-308 was replaced by phenylalanine using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GAT CCG AAA GAA GTA GGT GGT TTA TTT GTT GCT AGC AGG GCT AAC AGT TCT-3′ and 5′-AGA ACT GTT AGC CCT GCT AGC AAC AAA TAA ACC ACC TAC TTC TTT CGG ATC-3′. Thereafter ASAP1-Y308F as template and the following oligonucleotide primers were used for generation of Y308F/Y782F mutant: 5′-GAC AAG CAG CGG CTC TCC TTC GGC GCC TTC ACC AAC-3′ and 5′-GTT GGT GAA GGC GCC GAA GGA GAG CCG CTG CTT GTC-3′. Pyk2 variants P717A, P859A, and P717A/P859A have been described previously (15Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Blaukat A. Barth B.U. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Aoto H. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Sasaki T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and were generated using a similar mutagenesis strategy. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—An L40 yeast reporter strain carrying pBTM116-PRNK, in which PRNK, a C-terminal fragment of Pyk2, was expressed as a fusion protein with the LexA DNA-binding domain, was transformed with a day 9.5 mouse embryonic cDNA library fused to the VP16 activation domain (17Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar). Transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method (18Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 106 transformants were screened for growth on Trp–Leu–His– plates supplemented with 20 mm 3-aminotriazole. His+ colonies were subsequently subjected to nitrocellulose filters on which a β-galactosidase assay was performed to verify the bait-prey interaction. Plasmid DNAs isolated from positive yeast clones were introduced into Escherichia coli HB101, and amplified and recovered library plasmids were sequenced. To reconfirm the LacZ+ phenotype, recovered library plasmids were re-transformed in L40 yeast carrying pBTM116-PRNK, and β-galactosidase activity of re-transformants was tested in yeast lysates with a liquid β-galactosidase assay (17Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection experiments, cells were grown until 60–80% confluence and transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA, using a modified calcium phosphate method (MBS; Stratagene). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml/10-cm dish of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) including protease (0.5 mm Pefabloc™, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Trasylol® (aprotinin)) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were incubated by gentle rocking for 45 min at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were used for in vitro binding assay, affinity purification, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum, 7% horse serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin. MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin. Within 3 day after seeding, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and then treated as indicated. In Vitro Binding Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins or GST alone (about 5 μg) were incubated with 200-μl cell lysates from transfected HEK293T cells (100–200 μg) at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotating platform. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and associated proteins were released with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and 5 min of incubation at 98 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with a Pyk2-specific polyclonal antibody (antibody 694 (3Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15125-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) or an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody to detect FLAG-tagged ASAP1 constructs. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Equal amounts of lysates (100–200 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotating platform by using anti-Pyk2 (antibody 598 (3Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15125-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) or anti-FLAG antibodies. Immune complexes were isolated using protein A-Sepharose or primary antibodies pre-coupled to agarose beads. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were released with SDS sample buffer and 5 min of incubation at 98 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—FLAG-tagged ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase reactions were performed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP including 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and incubation at 98 °C for 5 min. In vivo 32P labeling was performed using 1 mCi/ml in phosphate-free DMEM for 6 h as detailed previously (19Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Muller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40431-40440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled FLAG-ASAP1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and processed identically to in vitro labeled species. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager FX Pro, Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (19Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Muller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40431-40440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled ASAP1 bands were identified and in situ subjected to trypsin digestion. Phosphopeptides were separated on cellulose TCL plates in two dimensions by electrophoresis and chromatography, visualized by PhosphorImager analysis, and extracted from the matrix. Thereafter, phosphoamino acid composition was determined, and positions of phosphorylated residues were determined by Edman sequencing. By using this information, phosphorylation sites were predicted and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of mutants. Purification of Arf and FLAG-ASAP1—Arf1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) together with N-myristoyltransferase and purified in the myristoylated form in three steps as follows: (i) precipitation with 35% ammonium sulfate saturation; (ii) DEAE-Sepharose chromatography; (iii) MonoS chromatography as described previously (20Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To isolate FLAG-ASAP1 from transiently transfected HEK293T cells, affinity purification with anti-FLAG M2 affinity matrix following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) was performed. Briefly, lysates obtained from 10 10-cm dishes were incubated with 400 μl of anti-FLAG matrix for 3 h on a rotating platform at 4 °C. The matrix was washed three times with 10 ml of lysis buffer and once with 10 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Specifically bound proteins were eluted at 4 °C by incubation with TBS containing 150 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide. Eluates were divided into aliquots, shock-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Purity of proteins and phosphorylation status were analyzed by Coomassie or silver staining and Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. Protein-Lipid Overlay Assay—Protein-lipid overlay assays with affinity-purified FLAG-tagged ASAP1 were performed according to Dowler et al. (21Dowler S. Kular G. Alessi D.R. Sci. STKE. 2002; 129: PL6Google Scholar). Phospholipids and blank sample immobilized on membranes were blocked with 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for1hat room temperature. Thereafter membranes were incubated for 1 h in the same solution containing 0.5 μg/ml of FLAG-tagged ASAP1 and washed with TBST for 30 min. Following incubation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, proteins bound to phospholipids were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Fluorimetric GTPase Assay—To follow Arf1-GTPase activity, we used a previously described fluorimetric assay based on the change of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Arf1 during its transition from GTP- to GDP-bound state (22Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The assay was performed with a Jasco FP6500 fluorimeter in a cylindrical cuvette at 37 °C under stirring conditions. In a typical experiment, the cuvette initially contained a suspension of liposomes with or without 1 mol % PI(4,5)P2 in reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2). Liposomes were prepared as described (22Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and contained 43 mol % phosphatidylcholine (PC), 19 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine, 5 mol % phosphatidylserine (PS), 10 mol % phosphatidylinositol (PI), 7 mol % sphingomyelin, 16 mol % cholesterol. Then Arf1-GDP (4 μg) and GTP (10 μm) or the non-hydrolyzable analogue GTPγS were injected, and GDP/GTP exchange was accelerated by addition of 4 mm EDTA (23Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GTP-loaded Arf1 was stabilized by addition of 4 mm MgCl2, and Arf1-GTPase activity was followed after injection of purified FLAG-tagged ASAP1 (∼2 μg) or control proteins. Tryptophan fluorescence was recorded at 340 nm (bandwidth 20 nm) upon excitation at 297.5 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). Identification of ASAP1 as an Interaction Partner of Pyk2—In order to improve understanding of how Pyk2 mediates its diverse cellular functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal part of Pyk2 (PRNK) that contains several potential protein-protein interaction sites as bait (Fig. 1A). We screened 3 × 106 clones of an embryonic mouse cDNA library using the LexA system (17Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar) and identified 30 clones that were positive in growth and filter as well as liquid β-galactosidase assays. Three independent clones encoded cDNAs covering the SH3 domain of ASAP1, a phospholipid-dependent GTPase-activating protein for small Arf GTPases. ASAP1 consist of a PH domain followed by an Arf GAP domain, three ankyrin repeats, three proline-rich sequences, eight E/DLPPKP repeats, and an SH3 domain (Fig. 1A). It is a 130-kDa protein that is expressed in many tissues but is most abundant in testis, brain, lung, and spleen (12Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Activation of ASAP1 involves PI(4,5)P2 binding to the PH domain and may be implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (24Kam J.L. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Gruschus J. Roller P. Stauffer S. Clark J. Aneja R. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9653-9663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Pyk2-ASAP1 interaction and its specificity were confirmed by re-tranformation of the empty library vector, ASAP1 SH3 domain, and a β-catenin in LexA, LexA-PRNK, as well as in LexA-LEF yeast, subsequent growth (Fig. 1B), and β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1C). The β-catenin-LEF interaction (26Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal FAK fragment (FRNK, FAK-related nonkinase) that has been shown previously (13Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to interact with ASAP1 SH3 domain served as positive controls. Only the PRNK-ASAP1 SH3 domain and positive controls resulted in growth of yeast and expression of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1, B and C). Altogether, our yeast two-hybrid data suggest a specific and tight interaction between the C-terminal Pyk2 fragment PRNK and the ASAP1 SH3 domain. In Vitro binding of PRNK and Pyk2 to the SH3 Domain of ASAP1—To confirm the Pyk2-ASAP1 interaction found in the yeast two-hybrid screen and to more precisely map domains that mediate binding, we expressed Pyk2, PRNK, a mutant form PRNK-P859A in which the proline-rich region is disturbed, and the SH3 domain of ASAP1 as GST fusion proteins in E. coli, purified them on glutathione-Sepharose, and used these baits to pull down mammalian proteins expressed in HEK293T cells. In support of our yeast two-hybrid data, the GST-PRNK fusion protein bound to full-length ASAP1 expressed in HEK293T cells, whereas interaction was abrogated when proline 859 in GST-PRNK was mutated to alanine or GST alone was used as bait (Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed in a reverse experiment using a GST fusion protein of the ASAP1 SH3 domain that bound to full-length Pyk2 and PRNK but not to PRNK-P859A expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). Comparable levels of the different GST baits were used for pull downs as demonstrated by Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose membranes before proceeding with Western blots (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panel). Furthermore, expression of corresponding binding proteins in HEK293T cells was confirmed by Western blotting using either anti-FLAG or anti-Pyk2/PRNK antibodies (Fig. 2, A, upper panel, and B, middle panel). In summary, these data from in vitro interaction assays suggest specific binding of ASAP1 to proline-rich sequences in Pyk2 surrounding proline 859. SH3 domain-mediated interactions are frequently of moderate affinity and specificity (27Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 29Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test the specificity of the ASAP1-Pyk2 interaction by using a panel of different SH3 domains fused to GST in pull-down assays with lysates from PRNK and Pyk2 expressing HEK293T cells. GST alone served as a negative control, and GST-Grb2 that can bind to Pyk2 via multiple interactions was used as a positive control (4Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Comparable levels of the different GST baits were applied for the pull down as demonstrated by Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose membranes before proceeding with Western blots (Fig. 3, lower panels) and by probing membranes with an anti-GST antibody (not shown). In this setting, PRNK and Pyk2 did bind only to Grb2 and ASAP1 baits but not to the SH3 domains of Ras-GAP, Abl, Src, phospholipase-Cγ, p85, and Crk suggesting a high degree of specificity of the SH3 domain-mediated association of ASAP1 and Pyk2 (Fig. 3, upper panel). Co-immunoprecipitation of Pyk2 and ASAP1—To confirm the interaction of full-length proteins in living cells and to map further the contact sites we used, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with different FLAG-ASAP1 and Pyk2 constructs. Isolation of ASAP1 by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-Pyk2 antibodies revealed binding of full-length FLAG-ASAP1 to Pyk2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4A, left upper panel). No corresponding band was seen when Pyk2 cDNA was omitted from the transfections and when an ASAP1 construct lacking the SH3 domain (ASAP1-δSH3) was co-expressed with Pyk2. In a reverse experiment, FLAG-ASAP1 but not FLAG-ASAP1-δSH3 could be detected in Pyk2 immunoprecipitates from co-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, right upper panel). Immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of Pyk2 and ASAP1 (Fig. 4A, lower panels) and expression levels of Pyk2, ASAP1, and ASAP1-δSH3 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B) were verified by Western blotting using anti-Pyk2 or anti-FLAG antibodies. For a more precise mapping of the region in Pyk2 that interacts with the ASAP1 SH3 domain, we disrupted both proline-rich regions of Pyk2 individually or in combination by site-directed mutagenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments either with anti-FLAG or with anti-Pyk2 antibodies revealed a moderate reduction of ASAP1 binding to Pyk2-P859A where the binding motif of the second proline-rich region was mutated (Fig. 4C, upper panels). A more dramatic effect was observed upon disruption of the first proline-rich domain of Pyk2 (Pyk2-P717A), and binding of ASAP1 was completely abolished in the corresponding double mutant. Quality of the immunoprecipitation was controlled by re-probing blots with antibodies against bait proteins (Fig. 4C, lower panels), and comparable quantities of FLAG-ASAP1 and Pyk2 proteins in cell lysates were demonstrated by Western blotting using corresponding antibodies (Fig. 4D). These experiments demonstrate binding of ASAP1 via its SH3 domain to the second and more effectively to the first proline-rich domain of Pyk2. To validate our co-immunoprecipitation strategy, we also reproduced"

Collagen fibrils also bind to the integrin α2β1 and the platelet receptor glycoprotein VI to activate and aggregate platelets. The distinct triple helical recognition motifs for these receptors, GXOGER and (GPO)n, respectively, all contain hydroxyproline. Using unhydroxylated collagen I produced in transgenic plants, we investigated the role of hydroxyproline in the receptorbinding properties of collagen. We show that α2β1 but not α1β1 mediates cell adhesion to unhydroxylated collagen. Soluble recombinant α1β1 binding to unhydroxylated collagen is considerably reduced compared with bovine collagens, but binding can be restored by prolyl hydroxylation of recombinant collagen. We also show that platelets use α2β1 to adhere to the unhydroxylated recombinant molecules, but the adhesion is weaker than on fully hydroxylated collagen, and the unhydroxylated collagen fibrils fail to aggregate platelets. Prolyl hydroxylation is thus required for binding of collagen to platelet glycoprotein VI and to cells by α1β1. These observations give new insights into the molecular basis of collagen-receptor interactions and offer new selective applications for the recombinant unhydroxylated collagen I.

These observations give new insights into the molecular basis of collagen-receptor interactions and offer new selective applications for the recombinant unhydroxylated collagen I. The collagens include the most abundant proteins in mammalian tissues providing a scaffold and framework for extracellular matrix assembly. In addition, they can modulate cell behavior through interactions with cellular receptors. All members of the collagen family are built up of three chains and contain at least one triple helix domain formed by repeating GXY sequences (where X is often proline (P) and Y is often hydroxyproline (O)). Such molecules associate to form complex structures, of which the fibril-forming collagens constitute the most abundant matrix component (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1992: 103-147Google Scholar). The higher order organization of the collagens, collagen I being the best example, proved crucial to the triggering of specific cell responses; native triple helical structure is essential for cell and platelet adhesion, and the fibrillar structure is required for platelet activation and aggregation (2Barnes M.J. Weiss J.B. Jayson M.I.V. Collagen in Health and Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1982: 179-197Google Scholar). The cell surface receptors α1β1 and α2β1 of the integrin family are principally collagen receptors, although they can interact with other extracellular matrix components (e.g. laminins). The specificity of the more recently discovered collagen binding integrins, α10β1 and α11β1, remains to be determined. Different receptor families have also been identified as containing collagen receptors, such as the membrane-spanning proteoglycans, syndecans (3San Antonio J.D. Karnovsky M.J. Gay S. Sanderson R.D. Lander A.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the recently described tyrosine kinase receptors DDR1 and DDR2 (4Vogel W. FASEB J. 2000; 13: 77-82Google Scholar). In platelets, the recently described glycoprotein VI is a key signaling collagen receptor and is an immunoglobulinn superfamily receptor (5Clemetson J.M.

Several important clues to the understanding of the interaction of α2β1 integrin with collagen arose from the development of triple helical synthetic peptides containing designated recognition sequences (6Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Biopolymers. 1996; 40: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From these studies, a GFOGER sequence was identified as a crucial, high affinity α1β1 and α2β1 integrin binding site in collagen I (7Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Other GXOGER motifs in the collagen I primary sequence were further acknowledged as common collagen binding sites for both α1 and α2 integrin subunits (8Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The interaction of integrins with collagen occurs via a 200-amino acid inserted domain (I-domain) homologous with the collagen-binding A-domain of von Willebrand factor in the N-terminal region of the integrin α-subunit (9Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is divalent cation-dependent, requiring ions such as Mg2+ for high affinity. The I-domain provides a general means of integrin-collagen recognition, common also to the α10 and α11 subunits (10Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20383-20389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol.

Heino J. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7270-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of the α2-I domain with the GFOGER triple helix motif indicated a crucial role for the glutamate residue, directly coordinating the metal ion, as well as the existence of ligand-induced conformational changes, which probably underlie either the affinity regulation or the signaling capacity of integrins (13Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Although α1- and α2-I-domains are structurally very similar and recognize the same binding sequences, their relative affinities for collagen types differ; for example, α1β1 binds collagen IV with a higher affinity than collagen I, for which α2β1 is a better receptor (14Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Kapyla J. Ivaska J. Riikonen R. Nykvist P. Pentikainen O. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3348-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), indicating subtle differences in the binding specificities. Distinct binding sites might also exist as only α1β1 was shown to recognize the transmembrane collagen XIII (16Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Kapyla J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biological functions such as signal transduction of the two integrins are distinct. α1β1 exerts Ras-mediated negative control over collagen synthesis (17Gardner H. Broberg A. Pozzi A. Laato M. Heino J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 263-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas α2β1 activates collagen synthesis and metalloproteinase expression via a different pathway (for a review, see Ref. 18Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The two integrins can be differentially expressed; e.g. α2β1, but not α1β1, is expressed in platelets, where it is essential for platelet adhesion to collagens of the vascular subendothelium, facilitating subsequent interactions with another platelet-collagen receptor, glycoprotein VI (GPVI), 1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; CRP, collagen-related peptide; rColl I, recombinant collagen I homotrimer; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; OHrColl I, hydroxylated recombinant collagen I.1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; CRP, collagen-related peptide; rColl I, recombinant collagen I homotrimer; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; OHrColl I, hydroxylated recombinant collagen I. resulting in thrombus formation via platelet activation. Collagen is a major platelet agonist. Although many collagen receptors have been identified in platelets, α2β1 integrin and GPVI are the most important so far (19Siljander P.R-M. Farndale R.W. Gresele P. Page C.P. Fuster V. Vermylen J. Platelets in Thrombotic and Nonthrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 158-178Google Scholar). Studies on platelets from integrin-deficient mice (20Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D.

Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 22Nieswandt B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have provided new insights into the role of these two receptors in platelet-collagen interactions. Together, the results indicate a crucial role for GPVI in the activation of platelets by fibrillar collagen and suggest a requirement for GPVI recognition that precedes the full adhesive interaction with α2β1. The ability of GPVI to up-regulate the affinity of α2β1 was shown by Jung and Moroi (23Jung S.M. Moroi M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, an interactive model for collagen receptor function in platelets has been proposed, in which collagen binds GPVI, leading to subsequent activation of the integrin to a higher affinity state that strengthens the initial binding. Collagen-related peptide (CRP), composed of 10 repeated GPO triplets, was shown to be a selective ligand for GPVI (24Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRP, when cross-linked, is a powerful GPVI-dependent platelet agonist, which mimics the GPVI signaling action of the native collagen I (25Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its ability to form a triple helix, a corresponding GPP polymer is inactive, suggesting a specific role of hydroxyproline in collagen-GPVI recognition (26Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, other ligands, such as the snake venom toxin convulxin, can react with GPVI using a distinct mechanism (27Niedergang F. Alcover A. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Francischetti I.M.B. Bon C. Leduc M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that other modes of binding GPVI may lead to platelet activation. Since the α1β1 and α2β1 binding motif, GXOGER, like the GPO motif for GPVI, contains a hydroxyproline residue, we aimed to define the role of hydroxyproline in collagen recognition by these major collagen receptors. Using unhydroxylated triple helical collagen I produced in transgenic tobacco (28Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that hydroxyproline plays an important role in triple helix folding and fibril formation (29Perret S. Merle C. Bernocco S. Berland P. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43693-43698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This recombinant unhydroxylated collagen I offers a direct and potent means of gaining insights into the role of hydroxyproline of the whole collagen molecule in collagen receptor recognition, which complements the use of collagen-like peptides. Although the two integrins are structurally similar (8Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 30Kamata T. Liddington R.C. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32108-32111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), our data showed that α2β1 but not α1β1 was capable of recognizing the unhydroxylated collagen. Moreover, GPVI-dependent platelet aggregation was shown to be strictly dependent on prolyl hydroxylation. Collagens contain a high percentage of hydroxyproline, a very rare residue in other proteins. This molecular signature indicates specific roles for hydroxyproline in collagen; diverse events such as molecule folding, thermal stability and fibril formation require prolyl hydroxylation. To this list we add an essential role in cell adhesion and platelet aggregation, two crucial biological functions of collagen. Collagen Preparation—Collagens were extracted from fetal calf bones by pepsin digestion and the two collagen I isoforms, namely the heterotrimer [α1(I)]2α2(I) and the homotrimer [α1(I)]3, were separated by repeated salt fractionation as previously described (2Barnes M.J. Weiss J.B. Jayson M.I.V. Collagen in Health and Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1982: 179-197Google Scholar). Recombinant collagen I homotrimer (rColl I) was extracted and purified from field-grown tobacco plants transformed with human proα1(I) chain cDNA lacking the N-propeptide coding sequence, referred to as PRS-ΔNproα1(I) (29Perret S. Merle C. Bernocco S. Berland P. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43693-43698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hydroxylated recombinant collagen was obtained by co-transformation of tobacco leaves with the collagen construct PRS-ΔNproα1(I) and cDNA coding the two subunits of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase, the C. elegans α-subunit and the mouse β-subunit, as described (31Merle C. Perret S. Lacour T. Jonval V. Hudaverdian S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Collagen concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Samples were hydrolyzed under vacuum (6 n HCl, 115 °C, 24 h) in the presence of 2β-mercaptoethanol in a Pico Tag system (Waters) and then analyzed with a Beckman amino acid analyzer. Collagen fibrils were obtained by dialyzing collagen solution (400 μg/ml in 0.5 m acetic acid) against 10 mm phosphate buffer at 4 °C as previously described (29Perret S. Merle C. Bernocco S. Berland P. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43693-43698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Standard collagen fibril suspension was a gift from Ethicon Inc. (Somerville, NJ) and was dialyzed against 10 mm acetic acid before use. Synthetic Peptides and Antibodies—The collagen-related peptide OH-Gly-Cys-Hyp-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)10-Gly-Cys-Hyp-Gly-NH2 referred to as CRP was synthesized as a homotrimer as described (32Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The following blocking monoclonal antibodies were used for cell adhesion inhibition tests: human anti-α1 A domain integrin (clone FB12) was from Chemicon International; human anti-α2 integrin (Gi9) was from Immunotech; human anti-β1 integrin (P4C10) was from Invitrogen; and rat anti-α1 integrin (Ha31/8) was from PharMingen. Monoclonal antibody against human α2 integrin (6F1) was a generous gift from Dr. B. Coller (Mount Sinai Hospital, New York) (33Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-GPVI polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. K. Clemetson (Theodor Kocher Institute, University of Berne, Switzerland). The GR144053 compound was a gift from Glaxowellcome, (Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK). Cell Adhesion and Inhibition Assays—Human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080), mammary epithelial cells (HBL100), human skin fibroblasts, rat glioma cells (RuGli) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (or 10% for fibroblasts), glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultivated in the Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 BulletKit (Clonetics, Cambrex, France). 96-Well plates (Costar) were coated overnight at 4 °C with collagen substrates at a concentration range of 0–10 μg/ml (0.1 ml/well) or other concentrations as specified. After blocking the wells with 1% BSA, cells freshly suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (6 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto wells (0.1 ml/well) and allowed to attach at 37 °C for 20–45 min, depending on the cell type used. Then the wells were washed with PBS, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in water. After extensive washing, the dye adsorbed to the cells was solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm with an ELISA plate reader (SLT Lab Instrument). Each assay point was carried out in triplicate. For inhibition assays, wells were routinely coated at a collagen concentration of 0.1 μg/well; only rColl I was coated at 1 μg/well with HBL100. Cells freshly suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were mixed with the antibodies at a given concentration for 10 min at 37 °C and then seeded onto the coated wells. The assays were then continued as described above. Adhesion is normalized to the cell attachment signal on bovine collagen I heterotrimer. Solid-phase Assays—Soluble human α2β1 integrin, consisting of the two integrin ectodomains joined together by the dimerizing motifs of the transcription factors Fos and Jun, were generated as described previously (34Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, soluble α1β1 integrin was generated, which will be described elsewhere. 2S. Niland and S. A. Eble, manuscript in preparation. To measure α2β1 integrin binding, bovine type I collagen and rColl I were coated at 40 μg/ml. To determine α1β1 integrin binding, all collagen substrates were coated at 20 μg/ml to a microtiter plate at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA in TBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 (TBS/Mg-buffer). Soluble α2β1 or α1β1 integrin at the indicated concentrations was added in 1% BSA in TBS/Mg-buffer, containing 1 mm MnCl2, to the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Binding of soluble α2β1 was performed in the presence of 400 nm 9EG7, a β1 integrin-activating antibody (kindly provided by Dr. D. Vestweber, University of Muenster, Germany). After removing nonbound integrins by washing twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, either without or with 10 mm EDTA, bound integrin was fixed to the plate by 2.5% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 10 min and detected by an rabbit antiserum directed against the human integrin β1 subunit, diluted 1:400 in 1% BSA in TBS/Mg-buffer, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies directed against rabbit immunglobulins (Sigma), diluted 1:600 in 1% BSA in TBS/Mg-buffer. Between the antibody incubations, the wells were washed three times with TBS/Mg-buffer. Eventually, the ELISA was developed by conversion of para-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma), which was measured in an ELISA reader at 405 versus 595 nm. Nonspecific background values, measured in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, were subtracted from the OD values to obtain specific integrin binding signals. Platelet Adhesion and Aggregation—Fresh blood was provided by the National Blood Service (Cambridge, UK) or by the “Centre de Transfusion Sanguine” (Lyon, France). Platelet adhesion was measured colorimetrically at 20 °C using washed platelets essentially as described (35Onley D.J. Knight C.G. Tuckwell D.S. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24560-24564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were adjusted to a platelet concentration of 108/ml with 10 mm Hepes, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Immulon2 96-well plates (Dynex Technologies, Ashford, Middlesex, UK) were coated with collagen I monomers or CRP at a concentration of 10 μg/ml or with collagen fibrils at 50 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C and were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min prior to adhesion. 2 mm MgCl2 was added 5 min before seeding platelets onto coated wells in triplicate. For inhibitory assays, the platelet suspension was preincubated with 2 μg/ml 6F1 or 0.5% anti-GPVI or control rabbit serum or with 2 μm GR 144053F compound for 5 min after the addition of MgCl2. Aggregation was measured turbidimetrically at 20 °C after the addition of collagen fibrils as indicated, using human citrated PRP obtained by centrifugation of fresh blood 12 min at 200 × g. The aggregation test was carried out for at most 12 min with magnetic stirring at 900 rpm (Icare). Electron Microscopy—Platelet suspension and aggregates were collected after platelet aggregation measurement, rinsed with PBS, and subsequently fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then postfixed in 1% OsO4 in PBS for 30 min, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observations were performed with a Philips CM120 microscope at the Centre Technologique des Microstructures (Université Claude Bernard, Lyon I, France). Cell Adhesion-promoting Activity of the Unhydroxylated Collagen—Very many cells can adhere to and spread on collagen type I. Because the adhesive properties of the recombinant collagen are important for its development as a biomaterial, we assessed the ability of primary cell types, including human skin primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs), to bind to rColl I. Both of these cell type express the major collagen receptors, the integrins α1β1 and α2β1. Our results show that adhesion and spreading of both the fibroblasts and HUVECs were fully supported by rColl I (Fig. 1). To investigate whether α1β1 and α2β1 could mediate cell adhesion and spreading on rColl I, we selected three different cell lines with differential integrin expression. HBL100 (a human mammary epithelial cell line) contains significant amounts of both α1β1 and α2β1 integrins; HT1080 (a human fibrosarcoma cell line) and RuGli (a rat gliosarcoma) mainly express α2β1 and α1β1, respectively. HBL100 cells adhered less efficiently to rColl I than to homotrimeric and heterotrimeric native collagen I. The plateau levels of adhesion were always about 20–30% lower in the different experiments (Fig. 2A). HT1080 cells showed comparable levels of adhesion to rColl I and to the bovine collagens, having similar plateau values to each substrate (Fig. 2B). The morphology of the adherent cells under phase-contrast microscopy showed that both cell types were capable of fully spreading on rColl I (data not shown). In contrast, whereas RuGli cells attached well to homo- and heterotrimeric collagens, no adhesion was observed to rColl I (Fig. 2C), suggesting that interaction of cells with rColl I was α2β1-specific. Adhesion to Unhydroxylated Collagen I Is α2β1 - but not α1β1 -dependent—To verify the role of α2β1, but not α1β1 in cell adhesion to rColl I, function-blocking monoclonal antibodies specific for α1, α2, and β1 were introduced. Complete inhibition of HBL100 cell adhesion to bovine homotrimeric and heterotrimeric collagens was achieved only by the simultaneous addition of antibodies against α1 and α2 integrin subunits, whereas antibody to β1 subunit abolished HBL100 cell adhesion to all substrates. In contrast, HBL100 cell adhesion to the recombinant collagen was inhibited by antibodies against α2 but not α1 subunit (Fig. 3A). Antibodies against α2 and β1 integrin subunits completely abolished HT1080 cell adhesion to all substrates (Fig. 3B). Complete inhibition of RuGli cell adhesion to homo-and heterotrimeric collagens was achieved by the addition of rat α1 antibodies (Ha31/8) (Fig. 3C), confirming that adhesion was solely mediated by α1β1. Altogether, the data further support the concept that α2β1 integrin is the dominant adhesion receptor for the unhydroxylated collagen. Prolyl Hydroxylation of the Recombinant Collagen Improves the α1β1 Binding Activity—The α1β1 and α2β1 binding sites in the collagen I identified so far are identical, and each contains a GXOGER motif (7Knight C.G.

To assess the dependence of the integrin affinity on proline hydroxylation of collagen I, solid phase binding assays with soluble recombinant integrins α1β1 and α2β1 were performed. Binding to collagen substrates was measured over a range of integrin concentrations in the presence of 2mm Mg2+ or of 1 mm EDTA. Cation-dependent binding of α1β1 and α2β1 integrins was confirmed for all substrates. Whereas α2β1 binding to bovine collagen I and to unhydroxylated homotrimer was similar (Fig. 4A), the apparent affinity of α1β1 for the fully hydroxylated bovine collagens was 1 order of magnitude greater than for the unhydroxylated homotrimer (Fig. 4B). The importance of prolyl hydroxylation for α1β1 binding to collagen was further assessed by analyzing α1β1 adhesion to hydroxylated recombinant collagens (OHrColl I), obtained by co-transfection with collagen and prolyl-4-hydroxylase genes as described (31Merle C. Perret S. Lacour T. Jonval V. Hudaverdian S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The samples tested, OHrColl I a and b, were purified from two different stably transfected plants and contained 7.2 and 8.9% hydroxyproline, respectively, whereas native bovine collagen I contained 10.2% hydroxyproline. Recombinant α1β1 at all concentrations tested bound significantly better to OHrColl I than to rColl I, and binding increased depending on the increasing hydroxylation level (Fig. 4B). These data confirmed that reduction of collagen I prolyl hydroxylation significantly impaired α1β1 binding activity, consistent with the finding that cells adhered to the unhydroxylated rColl I solely via integrin α2β1. Platelets Adhere to the Recombinant Collagen in an α2β1–dependent Manner—Platelet-collagen interaction is considered to be mediated essentially by the two collagen receptors, α2β1 and GPVI. According to the original two-site two-step receptor model, platelets first bind via α2β1 and subsequently become activated by GPVI. The present observation that α2β1 mediates the adhesion of nucleated cells to rColl I suggested that the recombinant collagen might also support platelet adhesion. Whereas both rColl monomers and fibrils did support some platelet adhesion, the level of attachment was lower than to the control substrates (i.e. native bovine collagen I fibrils, pepsin-digested collagen I monomers, and the GPVI-specific CRP) (Fig. 5), suggesting that the presence of hydroxyproline enhances platelet binding to collagen, via either GPVI or the GPVI-mediated activation of α2β1. The roles of α2β1 and GPVI in platelet adhesion to rColl I, were assessed by using inhibitory antibodies. To measure primary adhesion rather"

The mass spectrometric experiments show that MM-CK is unfolded gradually when titrated with acid. MM-CK is a dimer (the native state) at pH 7.0 and becomes an equilibrium mixture of the dimer and a partially folded monomer (the intermediate) between pH 6.7 and 5.0. The dimeric protein becomes an equilibrium mixture of the intermediate and an unfolded monomer (the unfolded state) between pH 5.0 and 3.0 and is almost fully unfolded at pH 3.0 reached. The results from a “phase diagram” method of fluorescence show that the conformational transition between the native state and the intermediate of MM-CK occurs in the pH range of 7.0–5.2, and the transition between the intermediate and the unfolded state of the protein occurs between pH 5.2 and 3.0. The intrinsic molar enthalpy changes for formation of the unfolded state of MM-CK induced by acid at 15.0, 25.0, 30.0, and 37.0 °C have been determined by ITC. A large positive molar heat capacity change of the unfolding, 8.78 kcal mol–1 K–1, at all temperatures examined indicates that hydrophobic interaction is the dominant driving force stabilizing the native structure of MM-CK. Combining the results from these four methods, we conclude that the acid-induced unfolding of MM-CK follows a “three-state” model and that the intermediate state of the protein is a partially folded monomer.

This enzyme catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer between ATP and creatine (Cr) in the presence of Mg2+, and the release of an equimolar quantity of hydrogen ion (see Reaction I). Cr+MgATP2-⇌PCr2-+MgADP-+H+(Eq. 1) Because most of the CK in the body normally exists in muscle, the elevated level of CK in human blood is an important diagnostic indicator for diseases of the nervous system and the heart muscle, for malignant hypothermia and for certain tumors. Cytosolic creatine kinase from rabbit muscle (MM-CK) is a dimer of two identical 43-kDa subunits of known sequence (5Putney S. Herlihy W. Royal N. Pang H. Vasken-Aposhian H. Pickering L. Belagaje R.

The crystal structure of the enzyme at 2.35-Å resolution has revealed that the dimeric interface of the enzyme is held together by a small number of hydrogen bonds (6Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Among its 380 amino acids, each monomer contains four tryptophans located in a restricted area at positions 210, 217, 228, and 272, in which tryptophan 228 is crucial for the activity of the enzyme (6Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and tryptophan 210 is important for dimer cohesion (7Perraut C. Clottes E. Leydier C. Vial C. Marcillat O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tryptophan is a very useful intrinsic probe, because its emission fluorescence spectrum varied with the molecular environment of the side chain; disruption of the native structure leads to changes in the exposure of the tryptophan side chains to solvent that can readily be monitored by recording the protein fluorescence emission spectrum (7Perraut C. Clottes E. Leydier C. Vial C. Marcillat O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chemical denaturants, such as guanidine hydrochloride and urea, have been widely used in the investigations of the unfolding of CK (7Perraut C. Clottes E. Leydier C. Vial C. Marcillat O.

Because there is a direct interaction between a denaturant and a protein, some thermodynamic parameters may reflect protein-denaturant interaction rather than intrinsic parameters of the protein (15Liang Y. Huang G.C. Chen J. Zhou J.M. Thermochim. Acta. 2001; 376: 123-131Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the heat of dilution of a denaturant may disturb seriously the measurement of heat accompanying the conformational change of a protein by the denaturant (15Liang Y. Huang G.C. Chen J. Zhou J.M. Thermochim. Acta. 2001; 376: 123-131Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 17Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Acid-induced unfolding of proteins, however, obviates the above inconveniences, because the unfolding agent, H+, is itself a part of the buffer used. Although some experimental approaches have been used to elucidate the mechanism of the unfolding of CK induced by acid in the past decade (18Raimbault C. Couthon F. Vial C. Buchet R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thermodynamic information for the unfolding, which is necessary for a thorough understanding of the mechanism, is eagerly awaited. One of the purposes of this investigation is to provide detailed thermodynamic data for the acid-induced unfolding of MM-CK to furnish insights into the mechanism for the unfolding of this dimeric protein. In late 1980s and early 1990s, the emergence of two revolutionary techniques, electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, has greatly enhanced the role of MS in the study of biological macromolecules instead of volatile small molecules (19Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6380) Google Scholar, 20Bakhtiar R. Tse F.L.S.

These techniques have achieved good mass resolution at higher masses for biological macromolecules and are now becoming increasingly popular for probing protein higher order structure and dynamics under a variety of conditions. ESI-TOF MS is a versatile and highly sensitive method for the detection, quantitation, and structural analysis of a wide variety of analytes, including large biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. At present, this method has been widely used to study noncovalent biological complexes (22Pramanik B.N. Bartner P.L. Mirza U.A. Liu Y.-H. Ganguly A.K. J.

An unfolded protein in solution leads to the formation of higher charge states than the same protein in a tightly folded conformation (26Konermann L. Douglas D.J.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is an important tool for the study of both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of biological macromolecules by virtue of its general applicability and high precision, as shown by recent developments (35Stites W.E.

Nature. 2002; 415: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Only a limited number of authors have, however, paid attention to the isothermal titration calorimetric investigations of the protein unfolding induced by acid (40Bhakuni V. Xie D. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Jamin M. Antalik M. Loh S.N. Bolen D.W. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a previous publication from this laboratory (15Liang Y. Huang G.C. Chen J. Zhou J.M. Thermochim. Acta. 2001; 376: 123-131Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the unfolding of MM-CK induced by guanidine hydrochloride was investigated by isothermal calorimetry. In this study, ESI-TOF MS, ITC, fluorescence spectroscopy, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE were combined to study the unfolding of MM-CK induced by acid. The intrinsic molar enthalpy changes for formation of the unfolded state of this protein induced by acid at different temperatures are reported for the first time. Combining the results from these four methods, we conclude that hydrophobic interaction is the dominant driving force stabilizing the native structure of MM-CK and the acid-induced unfolding of this protein follows a “three-state” model. Materials—Rabbit MM-CK (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and hen egg-white lysozyme (Amresco Chemical Co., Solon, OH) were used without further purification. The A1cm1&x0025; values of 8.8 (11Fan Y.X. Zhou J.M. Kihara H. Tsou C.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and 26.5 (49Sasahara K. Sakurai M. Nitta K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) at 280 nm were used for the concentration measurements of MM-CK and lysozyme, respectively. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS) was purchased from Sigma. Creatine was obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory (Shanghai, China) with purity of 99%, and the disodium salt of ATP was a Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts product (Heidelberg, Germany) with purity of >99%. All chemicals used were made in China and of analytical grade. All reagent solutions were prepared in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffers (pH 3.0–7.0) for ESI-TOF MS and ITC experiments and in 0.1 m citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers (pH 3.0–7.0) for fluorescence and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—ESI-TOF MS experiments were conducted using a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF II, Micromass, Altrincham, UK) equipped with a Z-Spray ESI source at room temperature. Calibration of the instrument is performed by using the multiply charged ions produced by hen egg white lysozyme diluted to 10 μm in pure water. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, an additional desalting procedure was performed with Centricon (Millipore Corp.) using 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) as a reconstitution solution. Samples are prepared by adding 6 μm MM-CK (final concentration) to 10 mm ammonium acetate buffers of different pH. After a short incubation time at room temperature, they are continuously infused into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The accelerating voltage was equal to 200 V, and the pressure in the interface region was 6.5 millibars. All spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode in the 500–6500 m/z mass range. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were carried out at 15.0, 25.0, 30.0, and 37.0 °C using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). All solutions were thoroughly degassed before use by stirring under vacuum. Before each experiment, the ITC sample cell was washed several times with acetate buffer. The sample cell was loaded with 1.43 ml of acetate buffer (pH 3.0–6.7), and the reference cell contained doubly distilled water. Titration was carried out using a 250-μl syringe filled with the native MM-CK solution (pH 7.0), with stirring at 300 rpm. The concentrations of MM-CK were varied between 15 and 30 μm. Injections were started after baseline stability had been achieved. A titration experiment consisted of 28 consecutive injections of 10-μl volume and 20-s duration each, with a 6-min interval between injections. To correct for the heat effects of dilution and mixing, control experiments were performed in which an identical solution but without MM-CK (pH 7.0) was injected into acetate buffer (pH 3.0–6.7). The heat released by dilution of MM-CK was negligible. Calorimetric data were analyzed using MicroCal ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument. The enthalpy change for each injection was calculated by integrating the area under the peaks of recorded time course of change of power and then subtracting that for the control titration. The molar enthalpy change accompanying the conformational change of MM-CK induced by acid, Δconf H m, was the average value of the enthalpy change for each injection, and the intrinsic molar enthalpy change for formation of the unfolded state of MM-CK induced by acid, ΔUHm0 , was the average value of the molar enthalpy changes at pH 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 at each temperature. The heats of ionization for the carboxylic groups of the protein during the acid-induced unfolding at different pH values were calculated using n Glu = 54, n Asp = 58 (56Asp + 2C-terminal) and the reported thermodynamic parameters for the ionization of the side chains of aspartate and glutamate (46Jamin M. Antalik M. Loh S.N. Bolen D.W. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The intrinsic molar free energy change, ΔUGm0 , was determined by a three-state model as described previously (8Gross M. Lustig A. Wallimann T. Furter R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10350-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Fan Y.X. Zhou J.M. Kihara H. Tsou C.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using H+ as an unfolding agent. The intrinsic molar entropy change, ΔUSm0 , and the molar heat capacity change associated with the unfolding of MM-CK, ΔU C P,m, were thus obtained. After the calorimetric experiment on the acid-induced unfolding, the pH value of the residual solution taken from the sample cell was almost the same as that of the acetate buffer used. The residual activities of MM-CK in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffers at different pH values were also determined by ITC at 25.0 °C. The specific activity of the enzyme under the native condition (pH 7.0) was 159 ± 10 units mg–1 (n = 3). The sample cell was loaded with 1.43 ml of MM-CK-creatine-mixed solution (pH 3.0–7.0), and the reference cell contained doubly distilled water. Titration was carried out using a 250-μl syringe filled with ATP-MgAc2 mixture (pH 3.0–7.0), with stirring at 300 rpm. A titration experiment consisted of one injection of 1 μl of the titrant and nine consecutive injections of 20-μl volume and 40-s duration each, with a 4-min interval between injections. The control experiment was performed in which ATP-MgAc2 mixture was injected into creatine solution in the absence of the enzyme at the same pH. The specific activity and the remaining activity of the enzyme are thus calculated from the thermal power and the apparent molar enthalpy change of the enzymatic reaction using the reported equations (2Liang Y. Huang G.C. Chen J. Zhou J.M. Thermochim. Acta. 2000; 348: 41-47Crossref Google Scholar, 50Todd M.J. Gomez J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopic experiments on the unfolding of MM-CK induced by acid in citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers at different pH values were carried out at 25 °C using an LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Shelton, CT). Each MM-CK solution, at a final concentration of 0.29 μm, was incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature. The excitation wavelength at 295 nm was used for the intrinsic fluorescence measurements, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded between 300 and 390 nm. The excitation and emission slits were both 10 nm, and the scan speed was 1000 nm min–1. ANS Binding Measurements—For the binding studies using the hydrophobic dye ANS, the samples from the acid-induced MM-CK (final concentration of 0.11 μm) unfolding series in citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers at different pH values were incubated with a 150-fold molar excess of ANS for 30–60 min at room temperature in the dark. The fluorescence emission spectra were then recorded between 400 and 650 nm at 25 °C with excitation at 390 nm. The excitation and emission slits were both 10 nm, and the scan speed was 100 nm min–1. Assays in the absence of the protein were performed to correct for unbound ANS emission fluorescence intensities. “Phase Diagram” Method of Fluorescence—The phase diagram method of fluorescence is a sensitive approach for the detection of unfolding/refolding intermediates of proteins (16Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Fan Y.X. Zhou J.M. Fink A.L. Uversky V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 51Bushmarina N.A.

The essence of this method is to build up the diagram of I(λ1) versus I(λ2), where I(λ1) and I(λ2) are the fluorescence intensity values measured on wavelengths λ1 and λ2 under different experimental conditions for a protein under going structural transformations. Because fluorescence intensity is the extensive parameter, it will describe any two-component system by a simple relationship (16Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Fan Y.X.

As stated in Equation 1, with the change of denaturing factor, such as denaturant concentration, temperature, and pH of the solution, the transition from the initial to the final state follows a “two-state” or “all-or-none” model without formation of the intermediate states, the dependence I(λ1) = f(I(λ2)) must be linear. If the transition from the initial to the final state follows a “three-state” or “multi-state” model with the formation of one or several intermediate states, the dependence I(λ1) = f(I(λ2)) must be nonlinear and contains two or more linear portions. Moreover, each linear portion of the I(λ1) = f(I(λ2)) dependence will describe an individual all-or-none transition. In principle, λ1 and λ2 are arbitrary wavelengths of the fluorescence spectrum, but in practice such diagrams will be more informative if λ1 and λ2 will be on different slopes of the spectrum such as 320 and 365 nm (16Kuznetsova I.M.

Cross-linking Using Glutaraldehyde—For native and acid-treated MM-CK (5.33 μm, in buffers at pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, and 3.0 for 60 min at 25 °C), an aliquot of 25% (m/v) glutaraldehyde was added so as to make a final concentration of 1% glutaraldehyde (53Prakash K. Prajapati S. Ahmad A. Jain S.K. Bhakuni V. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This sample was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min followed by quenching the cross-linking reaction by adding 200 mm sodium borohydride. After 20-min incubation, 5 μl of 10% aqueous sodium deoxycholate was added. The pH of the reaction mixture was lowered to 2–2.5 by addition of orthophosphoric acid, which resulted in precipitation of the cross-linked protein. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4 °C), the precipitate was re-dissolved in loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was run with 10% gels. Mass Spectrometry of Acid-induced Unfolding of MM-CK—As shown in Fig. 1, MM-CK unfolded gradually when titrated with acid. MM-CK is a dimer (the native state) at pH 7.0 (data not shown) and becomes an equilibrium mixture of the dimer and a partially folded monomer (the intermediate) between pH 6.7 and 5.0. At pH 6.7, the major signals observed in the mass spectrum were due to multiply charged ions of the dimer. Minor signals reveal the co-existence of small amounts of the intermediate. An equilibrium mixture of the intermediate and an unfolded monomer (the unfolded state) was detected between pH 5.0 and 3.0, and decreasing the pH to 4.0 resulted in disappearance of the dimer. The protein was almost fully unfolded at pH 3.0 reached, and only a trace of the intermediate was observed. Comparison of Inactivation with Quaternary Structure Changes of MM-CK at Different pH—ITC curves of the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to creatine catalyzed by MM-CK at pH 7.0 and 5.0 and at 25.0 °C are shown in Fig. 2, from which (in part, the ITC curves at other pH values were not shown) the residual activities of the enzyme at different pH values were determined using the given method. The contents of the dimer at different pH values were estimated by ESI-TOF MS from Fig. 1 (in part, the mass spectra at other pH values were not shown). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of inactivation with quaternary structure (represented by the contents of the dimer) changes of MM-CK in acetate buffers of different pH. As can be seen from Fig. 3, t"

Lys8 and Asp125 are active site residues in mevalonate kinase that also appear to play a catalytic role in CDP-ME kinase. Both the mevalonate and the non-mevalonate pathways therefore involve closely related kinases with similar mechanisms.

Isoprenoids are a hugely diverse group of molecules found in all organisms and are constructed from just two building blocks: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Most eukaryotes use the mevalonate pathway to synthesize IPP from acetyl CoA via mevalonate (1Qureshi N. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New, York1981: 47-94Google Scholar), but many bacteria and plant plastids use the “non-mevalonate” pathway to produce IPP and DMAPP (2Kuzuyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This pathway starts with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (3Rohmer M. Knani M. Simonin P. Sutter B. Sahm H. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and involves seven enzymes (Fig. 1). Both the sixth and seventh steps require dioxygen-free conditions (4Kollas A.K. Duin E.C.

Since this pathway is not found in mammals but is found in several pathogenic microorganisms, for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, it is an important target for development of novel antimicrobial compounds.

The fourth step of the non-mevalonate pathway involves the phosphorylation of 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME).

The sequence of T. thermophilus HB8 CMK consists of 275 amino acid residues and is highly similar to its homologues from Escherichia coli and M. tuberculosis, with 33 and 35% sequence identity, respectively (Fig. 2). Additionally, we demonstrate the substrate specificity of CMK. Several residues in the enzyme are identified that may be important for the enzyme activity, based on comparison with homologous structures.Fig. 2Structure-based sequence alignments of the enzymes of the GHMP kinase superfamily.

After incubation for 1 h at 50 °C for T. thermophilus HB8 CMK and 37 °C for E. coli CMK, 0.5 μl of these mixtures were applied to thin-layer chromatography on a cellulose gel (Merck). The cellulose plate was developed with a mixture of 2-butanol, acetic acid, and water (3:2:2) and then exposed to an imaging plate (Fujifilm) in which the intensity of photostimulated luminescence was proportional to the adsorbed radiation energy. The final autoradiogram was produced with a BAS-1500 image reader (Fujifilm). Overall Structure of CMK—The structure of T. thermophilus HB8 CMK was refined to 1.7-Å resolution (Fig. 3a). The residues Met1 to Gly268 were observed clearly in the final 2F o – F c electron density map (Fig. 4a), but the C-terminal region from Asp269 to Ala275 was apparently disordered and not visible in the map. The monomer structure consists of two domains (Figs. 2 and 3b). The N-terminal domain from Met1 to Ala148 consists of four α-helices (H1–4) and six β-strands (S1–6). The C-terminal domain from Leu149 to Ala275 consists of five α-helices (H5–9) and four β-strands (S7–10). DALI searches (29Holm L. Sander C.

The structure-based sequence alignment by DALI indicates that the secondary structure of CMK is extremely similar to all these enzymes (Fig. 2).

Since there is a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, the only symmetry elements present in the crystal are the 21 screw axes. In contrast, other members of the GHMP superfamily mostly form dimers. HSK dimerizes through hydrophobic helices in the C-terminal domain and β strands in the N-terminal domain (15Zhou T.

R. norvegicus MVK forms a similar dimer to HSK, but more elongated due to different orientation of the two monomers (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol.

The dimer interface and relative orientation of the partner chains do not appear to be conserved among GHMP superfamily dimers, and dimerization plays no apparent functional role in these proteins. Putative ATP and Magnesium-binding Site—The complex structures of R. norvegicus MVK with ATP-magnesium (PDB code 1kvk) and M. jannaschii HSK with ADP-magnesium (PDB code 1fwk) showed that motif 2 forms a phosphate-binding loop. ATP bound to MVK is an anti conformation (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but ADP adopts a rare syn conformation when complexed to HSK (15Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3b and 4b). The amino acid residues bonding to ATP in R. norvegicus MVK are Lys13, Asn55, Asn104, Ser108, Ser135, and Gly142 (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and those in HSK are Asn58, Val59, Lys83, Ser97, and Thr179 (15Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thr179 in HSK is equivalent to Thr243 in R. norvegicus MVK; mutation of this residue decreases the enzyme activity (33Cho Y.K. Rios S.E. Kim J.J. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12573-12578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Apart from this threonine, all the ATP-binding residues are in the N-terminal domain. Overlapping R. norvegicus MVK and M. jannaschii HSK onto T. thermophilus HB8 CMK shows that Asn58 and Lys83 in T. thermophilus HB8 CMK locate near ATP or ADP (Fig. 4b), and these residues may be important for ATP binding. A magnesium ion is found bound to Ser146 and Glu193 in R. norvegicus MVK (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and to Glu126 in HSK (32Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in both cases binding to the β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATP. Mutations at Ser146 in human MVK (identical to Ser146 in R. norvegicus MVK) and Glu193 in R. norvegicus MVK cause a decrease in enzyme activity (33Cho Y.K. Rios S.E. Kim J.J. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12573-12578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, these residues are not conserved in T. thermophilus HB8 CMK. Ser146 in R. norvegicus MVK is equivalent to Gly94 in T. thermophilus HB8 CMK, and both Glu193 in R. norvegicus MVK and Glu126 in M. jannaschii HSK are equivalent to Gly123 in T. thermophilus HB8 CMK (Fig. 2). The crystal structure suggests that Ser95 and Asp125 might provide alternative ligands to hold a magnesium ion (Figs. 3b and 4b). Ser95 neighbors Gly94, which is equivalent to Ser146 in R. norvegicus MVK. Superimposing the magnesium ion in R. norvegicus MVK onto T. thermophilus HB8 CMK shows that the metal ion center would be 1.4 Å from the γ-oxygen atom of Ser95 and 3.3 Å from the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp125. The position corresponding to the magnesium ion in M. jannaschii HSK, however, is further from these side chains, 4.9 Å from Ser95 and 5.8 Å from Asp125. Catalytic Mechanism—From the structure of MVK bound to ATP, Fu et al. (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested that the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme involves Asp204 acting as a catalytic base, removing a proton from the acceptor (C5) hydroxyl of mevalonate. In MVK, the carboxyl group of the side chain of Asp204 makes a salt bridge with the amine group on the side chain of Lys13, which in turn makes a close interaction with the γ-phosphate group of ATP. The C5 hydroxyl sits about 4 Å from the aspartate and the γ-phosphate. The amine group of Lys13 also interacts with the C5 hydroxyl group of mevalonate and lowers its pK a for efficient catalysis. This role for the aspartate has several precedents including phosphofructokinase (35Berger S.A. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and hexokinase (36Aleshin A.E. Kirby C. Liu X. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and mutation of this residue to asparagine reduced activity by a factor of about 104 (34Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies also showed that mutating Lys13 to methionine in R. norvegicus MVK causes about 60-fold diminution in the V max value (37Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Structural comparison of MVK and HSK, however, shows that Lys13 and Asp204 of MVK correspond to Thr10 and Asn137 in M. jannaschii HSK, respectively, and the catalytic mechanism of MVK cannot be valid for HSK (30Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The catalytic lysine and aspartate residues of MVK correspond to Lys8 and Asp125 in T. thermophilus HB8 CMK (Fig. 2). Although the amine nitrogen atom of Lys8 is 4.2 Å from the nearest carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp125 (Fig. 4b), slightly longer than the 4-Å limit usually used in defining a salt bridge (38Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 867-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), the fundamental mechanism of CMK may be the same as that of MVK. Lys8 forms very similar interactions to Lys13 in MVK, which may fix the amine group in a suitable position for efficient catalysis. In addition, the conserved side chains around the magnesium binding site of MVK (see above) suggest that a magnesium ion could play the same role in CMK. Thus, both the mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways seem to have a kinase with very similar reaction mechanism. Substrate Specificity—Since the substrate specificity of CMK has not been reported previously, both T. thermophilus HB8 and E. coli CMK were assayed for kinase activity using a variety of substrates. Both enzymes showed kinase activity for CDP-ME, but not for ADP-ME and UDP-ME (Fig. 5), showing that the cytosine group in CDP-ME plays an essential role for substrate recognition by CMK. MEP cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.60) converts MEP to CDP-ME in the presence of CTP at the third step of the non-mevalonate pathway (Fig. 1). This enzyme can utilize ATP or UTP instead of CTP, although with less activity (28Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kaneda K. Dairi T. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 703-706Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because CMK phosphorylates CDP-ME selectively, only CDP-ME2P is supplied as substrate for the next step. How CDP-ME is distinguished from related ME-derivatives by CMK remains unclear. Among CMKs from different species, the sequence RXDGYHXLXTXF is highly conserved at the loop between S1 and S2 and the N-terminal region of S2 (Figs. 2 and 3a). Other GHMP superfamily proteins do not retain this sequence. The functional role of this region has not been determined, except that Asp19 in HSK binds to the substrate (32Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, this conserved region is the primary candidate as the region contributing of specificity for the cytidine moiety of CDP-ME. Docking CDP-ME onto the enzyme by eye shows that the region may well recognize the cytidine moiety of the substrate (Fig. 3b). Mutational analysis are underway to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084929462,"Human group IIA phospholipase A2 (hIIA PLA2) is a 14 kDa secreted enzyme associated with inflammatory diseases. A newly discovered property of hIIA PLA2 is the binding affinity for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican-1. In this study, the binding of hIIA PLA2 to apoptotic human T cells was investigated. Little or no exogenous hIIA PLA2 bound to CD3-activated T cells but significant binding was measured on activated T cells induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-CD95. Binding to early apoptotic T cells was greater than to late apoptotic cells. The addition of heparin and the hydrolysis of HSPG by heparinase III only partially inhibited hIIA PLA2 binding to apoptotic cells, suggesting an interaction with both HSPG and other binding protein(s). Two low molecular weight HSPG were coimmunoprecipitated with hIIA PLA2 from apoptotic T cells, but not from living cells. Treatment of CD95-stimulated T cells with hIIA PLA2 resulted in the release of arachidonic acid but not oleic acid from cells and this release was blocked by heparin and heparinase III. Altogether, these results suggest a role for hIIA PLA2 in the release of arachidonic acid from apoptotic cells through interactions with HSPG and its potential implication in the progression of inflammatory diseases."

We found that Hoxa-13 and Hoxd-13, which are members of the Abd-B subfamily of Hox genes and are crucial for the autopod development of the limb, stimulate transcription from the Bmp-4 promoter. This stimulation was dependent on the GC box within the promoter and independent of the putative Hox protein binding site. The stimulation by HoxA-13 was remarkably enhanced by cotransfection with members of a family of zinc finger GC box binding transcriptional factors including Sp1. The stimulation was suppressed by another Abd-B Hox protein, HoxA-11, indicating that each Abd-B Hox protein has a different effect on the target genes through the Sp1 system. We have identified multiple functional domains involved in transcriptional regulation, including three independent transcriptional activation domains (ADs) in HoxA-13. AD1 and AD3 in helices 1 and 2 of the homeodomain individually cooperate with Sp1-dependent stimulation. The homeodomain is also required for cooperation of the AD with Sp1. By contrast, AD2 strongly activates transcription in an Sp1-independent manner only when the homeodomain has been removed. These observations indicate that HoxA-13 regulates transcription through multiple pathways. In addition, we found that a helix 3 mutation of the HoxA-13 homeodomain behaves as a dominant negative form.

Hox genes are an evolutionarily well conserved gene system, which determines positional identity along the body axis during development of bilateral animals (1McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, Hox genes are well known to be involved in skeletal pattern formation in the trunk and limbs (2Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Among them, Hox genes belonging to the Abd-B subfamily of the HoxA and HoxD cluster are expressed in the limb mesenchyme in a position-specific fashion (3Dolle P. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Falkenstein H.

The Hox genes encode homeodomain proteins that function as transcriptional regulators of downstream target genes through DNA binding by the homeodomain (9Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Genes controlling the cell cycle and cell adhesion have been reported to be Hox targets (10Bromleigh V.C. Freedman L.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24670-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, the target genes of Abd-B homeoproteins during limb cartilage formation have not yet been identified. A significant number of the downstream genes are supposed to be common among Abd-B homeoproteins, since nonparalogous Abd-B Hox proteins showed functional redundancy during cartilage formation (13Zakany J. Fromental-Ramain C. Warot X. Duboule D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13695-13700Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is also proposed that Hox proteins regulate the quantity of transcription of common target genes (14Rijli F.M. Chambon P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that are involved in the growth and differentiation of limb cartilage, so that the question is how different Hox homeoproteins result in quantitatively different effects on the transcription of target genes and which domains of the Hox homeoproteins are responsible for such differences. Another important issue concerns which transcriptional system is involved in regulating the quantity of transcription of target genes. Full-length HOX proteins bind DNA very poorly in in vitro assays and/or exhibit little binding specificity (15Shen W.F. Chang C.P. Rozenfeld S. Sauvageau G. Humphries R.K. Lu M. Lawrence H.J. Cleary M.L. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence suggest that the diversity of Hox function is crucially dependent on cofactors, such as Exd/Pbx (16Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 17Chan S.-K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Pbx proteins physically interact with the YPWM motif of the Hox proteins belonging to paralog groups 1–8, increasing their DNA binding affinity and defining their sequence specificity (16Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 17Chan S.-K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the formation of this Hox-cofactor complex on transcription has been thoroughly analyzed in Drosophila. For example, a recent study proposes the “activity regulation model” in which Exd cofactors interact with the Dfd homeodomain and unmask the transcriptional activation domain in the Dfd protein through DNA binding (19Li X. Murre C. MacGinnis W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since Abd-B subfamily Hox proteins do not have a typical YPWM motif and Hox proteins of paralog groups 11–13 do not interact with Exd/Pbx, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by Abd-B Hox proteins is poorly understood. In addition, there have been a few recent papers that describe apparent HOX protein targets, albeit not in the context of cooperative DNA binding with Pbx (11Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D.

These lines of evidence suggest that Hox proteins function through a variety of pathways. In addition to the Hox Abd-B subfamily genes, bone morphogenetic proteins are signaling molecules that play crucial roles in limb cartilage development (25Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 26Dahn R.D. Fallon J.F. Science. 2000; 289: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). During the course of our research analyzing the relationship between Bmp genes and Hox genes, we discovered that each Hox protein in the Abd-B subfamily has a unique effect on transcription from the Bmp-4 promoter in NG108-15 cells. We found that HoxA-13 and HoxD-13 cooperate with GC box-binding proteins such as Sp1 to stimulate transcription from the GC box-dependent promoter. On the other hand, HoxA-11 and HoxD-11 suppress the stimulation by HoxA-13 and HoxD-13. The interaction of Hox protein with the Sp1 system seems to be independent of DNA binding of Hox proteins. We identified three independent transcriptional activation domains (ADs) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, activation domain; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBS, Hox binding site; CRSP, cofactor required for Sp1 activation.1The abbreviations used are: AD, activation domain; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBS, Hox binding site; CRSP, cofactor required for Sp1 activation. in HoxA-13 and propose a novel multifunctional model. Two ADs independently stimulate the GC box-binding protein-dependent transcription system, and the other AD functions in the cytoplasm independently of GC box-binding protein only when the homeodomain is removed. Finally, helix 3 of HoxA-13 is shown to be crucial for both GC box-binding protein-dependent and -independent transcriptional stimulation. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—NG108–15 cells, a hybrid cell line of mouse neuroblastoma and rat glioma, were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transfection assays, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded per well of 3.5-cm dishes and transfected at 50% confluence. A solution containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), 6 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen), 250 ng of reporter plasmid, 500 ng of effector plasmid, and 50 ng of internal control plasmid encoding Rous sarcoma virus sea pansy luciferase in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used for transfection. Three hours after transfection, the cells were washed and supplemented with growth medium. Cells were harvested for luciferase assays 36 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured by Lumat LB9501 (Berthold) and normalized to sea pansy luciferase activity. Transfection-reporter assays were performed in duplicate and repeated three times with different preparations of the same plasmid. Plasmid Construction—To construct expression vectors for transfection, fragments containing full-length coding regions of chick Hoxa-13, Hoxd-13, Hoxa-11, Hoxd-11, Hoxa-10, Hoxa-9, and Hoxa-4 were subcloned into the pMiw expression vector (27Suemori H. Kadokawa Y. Goto K. Araki I. Kondo H. Nakatsuji N. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 29: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which contained the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter. To generate several deletion constructs of HoxA-13, pMiw-HoxA-13 plasmid was digested with pairs of restriction enzymes, EcoRV and BamHI (aa 1–272; A13-dC33), AatII and BamHI (aa 1–227; A13-dHD), NcoI and EcoRV (aa 1–191; A13-N191), and NcoI and AatII (aa 1–191 and 225–305; A13-dAD) followed by internal ligation or oligolinker-mediated ligation. Two fusion constructs, A13N-A11HD (aa 225–305 of HoxA-13 replaced with aa 222–297 of HoxA-11) and A11NA13HD (aa 1–224 of HoxA-13 replaced with aa 1–210 of HoxA-11), were produced by PCR. For reporter gene construction (described in the legend to Fig. 1B), DNA fragments containing the 5′-flanking region and exon 1a of both mouse and chick Bmp-4 were subcloned into a position upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in pGL2-basic (Promega). To construct the internal control vector, the sea pansy luciferase coding sequence (XbaI-NheI fragment) from pRLCMV (Promega) was subcloned into XbaI site of pBKRSV (Stratagene). For the internal deletion of the Hox binding site (–260dHBS) and mutation of the GC box (–260mut) in the –260 bp mouse Bmp-4-reporter constructions, we performed a PCR experiment using primers, which deleted AATT in the Hox binding site and mutated GGCGGG to GGCTTG in GC box, respectively. Protein coding regions of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, TIEG1, and BTEB1 cDNA were subcloned into the pMiw expression vector. The full-length Sp1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a mouse cDNA library. Full-length coding sequences of both Sp3 (EcoRI-SalI fragment) and Sp4 (SmaI fragment) were prepared from human cDNA clones provided by Dr. G. Suske (Erasmus University). Full-length TIEG1 coding sequence was prepared with EcoRI and HindIII digestion of human TIEG1 cDNA clone, which was provided by Dr. M. Subramaniam (Mayo Clinic/Foundation). Full-length BTEB1 coding sequence was prepared with PstI digestion of the human BTEB1 cDNA clone, which was provided by Dr. Y. Fujii (Tohoku University). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—NG108–15 cells were transfected with pMiw control vector, HoxA-13 or Sp1 alone, or both HoxA-13 and Sp1 as described above. After 36 h of culture, the cells were lysed by sonication in 2× binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40. Binding reactions were performed with 30 μg of the lysates, which were diluted 1:1 with distilled water, and Cy5.5-labeled oligonucleotides containing a GC box consensus site (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′), named SP1BS, or 2× Hox binding site (5′-TCAATTAAATGATCAATTAAATGA-3′), named NP2, in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 30 min. For the supershift assay, lysates were preincubated with anti-Sp1 antibody (sc59G; Santa Cruz) or anti-HoxA-13 antibody (see below) on ice for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were subjected to 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by Odyssey (LI-COR). Antibody Preparation and Immunohistochemical Staining of Transfected Cells—Preparation of anti-chick HoxA-13 antibody was as previously described (28Yokouchi Y. Nakazato S. Yamamoto M. Goto Y. Kameda T. Iba H. Kuroiwa A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2509-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This antibody is cross-reactive with mouse HoxA-13 proteins. For immunohistochemical staining of NG108–15 cells, 1 × 105 cells were seeded per well of 4-well chamber slides (Nunc) and subjected to transfection with 1 μg of each expression vector/well. The following steps were performed at room temperature. Transfected cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and then washed twice with PBS. Following treatment with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, the primary antibody reaction was performed for 1 h with 1:3000 diluted rabbit anti-HoxA-13 IgG or one of several specific antibodies. For the secondary antibody reaction, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 1 h. After several washes with PBS, cells were sealed with Parmafluor (IMMUNON) and then photographed under UV illumination. HoxA-13 and HoxD-13 Stimulate Transcription from the Mouse or Chick Bmp-4 Promoter—The mouse Bmp-4 gene has two different promoters, followed by the 5′-untranslated region exon 1a or exon 1b (Fig. 1B) (29Kurihara T. Kitamura K. Takaoka K. Nakazato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mRNA containing exon 1a is a major product in the mouse limb bud. 2M. Suzuki, N. Ueno, and A. Kuroiwa, unpublished results. To test the effect of Hox proteins on Bmp-4 transcription, we first constructed a reporter plasmid containing exon 1a and 2.4 kb of 5′-flanking region of the mouse Bmp-4 gene. This construct was co-transfected into NG108–15 cells together with expression plasmids encoding full-length chick HoxA-13, HoxD-13, HoxA-11, HoxD-11, HoxA-10, HoxA-9, or HoxA-4. HoxA-13 and HoxD-13 stimulated reporter gene transcription up to 23-fold and up to 9-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). Stimulations by HoxA-10, HoxA-9, and HoxA-4 were weak but reproducible. HoxA-11 and HoxD-11, as well as a pMiw control vector, exhibited no stimulation (Fig. 1A). Similar stimulation patterns by each Hox protein were also observed in the chick Bmp-4 promoter. Reporter gene transcription driven by –2.8 kb of chick Bmp-4 promoter 3M. Suzuki, N. Ueno, and A. Kuroiwa, unpublished clone. was stimulated 13–17-fold by HoxA-13 and 6–9-fold by HoxD-13 but not by HoxA-11 or HoxD-11 (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that each Hox protein has a unique effect on transcription from mouse and chick Bmp-4 promoters. The GC Box but Not the HBS Is Essential for Cooperative Stimulation by HoxA-13 and Sp1—To identify the responsible cis element for HoxA-13-dependent transactivation in the Bmp-4 promoter, we tested deletion constructs of the mouse and chick Bmp-4 promoter. Using the mouse Bmp-4 promoter, the –260 bp construct was transactivated up to 5-fold by HoxA-13, but when deletion extended to –80 bp, stimulation was no longer observed (Fig. 1B). Using the chick Bmp-4 promoter, the –600 bp construct still retained sensitivity to HoxA-13 (Fig. 1C). The minimal regions of both mouse and chick Bmp-4 promoter that exhibit HoxA-13-dependent transactivation have no TATA box. We found one of each Hox binding site (HBS; ATTA) and GC box (GGGCGG) in the mouse Bmp-4 promoter and two Hox binding sites and six GC boxes in the chick Bmp-4 promoter as the conserved motifs (Fig. 1, B and C). To analyze role of the common regulatory elements, the Hox binding site (–260dHBS) or GC box (–260mut) had been deleted or mutated from the mouse Bmp-4 minimal promoter (–260wt) luciferase constructs (Fig. 2A). We observed that deletion of Hox binding core sequence had no effect on the stimulation of promoter activities by HoxA-13 and Sp1 (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, mutations in the GC box from GGGCGG to GGGCTT (–260mut), which abolished sequence specific DNA binding of Sp1 (30Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), caused complete loss of the mouse Bmp-4 promoter activity (Fig. 2C). Moreover, we observed the transcription from the SV40 promoter, which consists of six GC boxes and a TATA box (Fig. 2A), was strongly stimulated by HoxA-13 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the GC box, but not the Hox binding site, was critical for cooperative stimulation by HoxA-13 and Sp1. HoxA-13 Stimulates Transcription Cooperatively with GC Box-binding Transcription Factors—The GC box is known as a binding site of Sp family zinc finger transcription factors (31Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of Sp family transcription factors in the stimulation of Bmp-4 promoter by Hox proteins, we tested the effect of some members of the Sp family transcription factors, Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, TIEG1, and BTEB1, on transcription of the Bmp-4 promoter. These GC box-binding transcription factors stimulate the transcription 2–5-fold alone (Fig. 3A). Remarkable enhancement of transcription up to 50-fold was seen following co-transfection of Sp1 together with HoxA-13 (Fig. 3A). Sp3, Sp4, TIEG1, and BTEB1 also exhibited 15–20-fold enhancement of transcription. In addition, HoxD-13 also showed remarkable synergism with Sp1 (Fig. 3B). HoxA-13 Did Not Alter the Sp1 Binding Profile either at the Quantitative or the Qualitative Level—We found no significant increase in the amount of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins by Western blot analysis after transfection of HoxA-13 to NG108–15 cells (data not shown). This indicates that HoxA-13 stimulated the transcription through potentiation of DNA binding activity or alteration of components of the GC box-binding protein. To explore these possibilities, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a GC box (SP1BS) or two HBS (NP2) and nuclear extracts prepared from NG108-15 cells with either transfected pMiw control vector, HoxA-13, or Sp1 alone or both Sp1 and HoxA-13. Using SP1BS as a probe, three major shift bands were observed with all extracts (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). Among them, the intensity of one shift band, indicated as Sp1, was increased when Sp1 was transfected (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 7–12) and supershifted in the presence of anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11 indicated as SS). We observed no quantitative and qualitative change in band shift even in the presence of HoxA-13 (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 4 and 19). In addition, the presence of anti-HoxA-13 antibodies did not alter the band pattern (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12), indicating that HoxA-13 was not included in putative transcriptional components bound to the GC box. Productions of HoxA-13 proteins in the transfected cells were monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using NP2 as the probe (Fig. 3C, bottom). One major shift band was detected using the nuclear extract from the transfected cells (Fig. 3C, bottom, lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11), and this band disappeared in the presence of anti-Hoxa-13 antibody (Fig. 3C, bottom, lanes 6 and 12). Surprisingly, these results indicate that HoxA-13 caused no considerable change in GC box binding complex and did not participate in the binding complex. Identification of Transcriptional Activation Domains in HoxA-13—To determine the functional domain of the HoxA-13 protein, the HoxA-13 protein coding regions were mutated, and the effect of the alternation was analyzed using the transient transfection system. Wild type HoxA-13 and the mutated proteins showed different subcellular localization; however, the level of accumulation of each protein was almost equal as judged by immunostaining with HoxA-13-specific antibodies (Fig. 4A). The amino acid sequence of helix 3 in the homeodomain is highly conserved, and all Hox proteins carry WFQ residues. As a recognition helix, helix 3 enters the major groove of target DNA, and the Q residue of the WFQ motif interacts with the bases of the target DNA (32Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Ottig G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). We constructed helix 3 mutants of HoxA-13 and analyzed their effect on transcription. The mutant in which the well conserved WFQ residues of helix 3 in the homeodomain were replaced with AAA (A13–3A) and a deletion that removes 33 amino acids from the C-terminal including helix 3 (A13-dC33) exhibited no transactivation (Fig. 4B), although the protein localized in the nuclei (Fig. 4A). In contrast, strong enhancement of transactivation was observed when the homeodomain was deleted (A13-dHD) (Fig. 4B). This strong activation was not due to increased accumulation of A13-dHD protein in the transfected cells over the wild type protein (data not shown). This strong activation was no longer observed when the deletion extended another 37 amino acids toward the N-end (A13-N191); furthermore, transactivation itself was abolished (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that amino acid residues in the 192–227 region contain a transcriptional AD, whose function seems to be suppressed in cis by the homeodomain. To identify activation domains of HoxA-13 outside the 192–227 region, this region was internally deleted from HoxA-13 (A13-dAD). Interestingly, A13-dAD still transactivated both mouse and chick Bmp-4 promoters up to 6-fold (Fig. 4B), suggesting that HoxA-13 has additional activation domain(s) independent of the 192–227 region. The mutant A13-dHD showed unique subcellular localization. The protein product was detected in the nuclei 18 h after transfection, whereas 65% of the expressing cells exhibited cytoplasmic localization of A13-dHD 36 h after transfection (Fig. 5), suggesting that A13-dHD was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. A13-dHD showed no transactivation 18 h after transfection, despite nuclear localization. On the other hand, transcriptional stimulation by wild type HoxA-13 was already detected 18 h after transfection. Transcriptional activation by A13-dHD was detected 36 h after transfection, when most proteins were found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). These results indicate that transient localization in the nucleus or localization in the cytoplasm is necessary for transactivation by A13-dHD. The Domain Responsible for Synergism with Sp1—We then analyzed synergism of these mutated Hox constructs with Sp1. Transfection of Sp1 strongly enhanced transcription in the presence of A13-dAD as well as that of wild type HoxA-13. In contrast, Sp1 exhibited no enhancement of transactivation by A13-dHD (Fig. 4C), although increased amounts of the effector construct were present (data not shown). This indicates that the mechanism of transactivation by A13-dHD, which would be due to the activation domain in the 192–227 region, is independent of Sp1. These results indicate the presence of another activation domain(s), which is responsible for cooperative interaction with Sp1, in the homeodomain or within both the 1–191 region and the homeodomain. The N-terminal domain (N1–191), lacking the Sp1-independent activation domain, showed no transactivation (Fig. 4B). However, this does not exclude the possibility that the N1–191 region participates in Sp1-dependent transactivation in cooperation with the homeodomain. We were unable to analyze activity of the construct containing the homeodomain alone (N225HD+Cter) because the protein was very unstable in the transfected cells (data not shown). We therefore fused the N-terminal region of HoxA-11, which exhibited no activity in NG108 cells, and the HoxA-13 homeodomain (A11NA13HD). A11N-A13HD transactivated both Bmp-4 promoters up to 6-fold (Fig. 4B). This suggests that a novel AD besides the 192–227 region exists in nonconserved regions of the homeodomain between HoxA-13 and HoxA-11, such as around helices 1 and 2. Activation Domain in N1–191—We then examined the function of the N1–191 region. For this purpose, the opposite fusion construct, in which the N-terminal region of HoxA-13 was followed by the HoxA-11 homeodomain (A13N-A11HD) was prepared. This fusion protein transactivated both Bmp-4 promoters up to 5-fold and A11N-A13HD (Fig. 4B). In addition, both A11N-A13HD and A13N-A11HD exhibited significant synergism with Sp1 as well as with wild type HoxA-13 and A13-dAD (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that transactivation by A13N-A11HD may be due to another AD, which is independent of the AD in the 192–227 region. This possibility is strongly supported by the following two pieces of evidence. The first is that A13N-A11HD proteins were localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4A), although the AD in the 192–227 region of A13-dHD also functioned when the proteins were exported to the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 5. The other piece of evidence is the result of competition of stimulation by N1–191. When the N1–191 construct was cotransfected with wild type HoxA-13, stimulation was suppressed. This suppressive effect of N1–191 was observed when transfected with either A13N-A11HD or A13-dAD. On the other hand, suppression was not seen with A13-dHD and A11N-A13HD (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that an additional AD is present in N1–191 and that this domain is responsible for the activities of A13-dAD and A13N-A11HD and partly for wild type HoxA-13 but not for A13-dHD.

https://openalex.org/W2060576011,"Transgenic mice, which selectively express the WAP-HBX transgene in mammary gland epithelial cells (ME-cells), were established in order to elucidate the consequences of HBX gene expression on organ differentiation, cell death program and tumor development. Transgene expression was demonstrable by RT-PCR, Northern and Western blot analysis during pregnancy, lactation and after weaning. HBX synthesis neither affect mammary gland differentiation nor apoptosis in ME-cells. Although breast cancer formation was rare in WAP-HBX animals (<1%), WAP-HBX*p53+/- hybrid animals developed breast tumors at an increased rate (12/85) after a latency period of 8-18 months. We also show here for the first time that HBX can immortalize ME-cells generated from mammary gland tissue segments in a p53-independent fashion. HBX causes cyclin D1 gene overexpression during early pregnancy, and this is maintained in ME-cells isolated either from mammary gland or from breast tumors. Intranuclear cyclin D1 accumulation also occurs in the absence of external growth factors and the BrdU incorporation rate remains high under serum starvation conditions. Finally, both cyclin D1 induction and HBX mitotic activity are dependent on p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not on MEK-1 kinase activity."

Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The more distally located NBD2 may have a regulatory function instead of being a true ATP hydrolytic site (16Nakatogawa H.

SecYEG-bound SecA binds preproteins via direct recognition of the signal sequence and mature domain (12Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 18Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Translocation of the preprotein is driven by multiple cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at SecA (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 20van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Each catalytic cycle of SecA involves two distinct translocation steps that utilize the energy of either preprotein or ATP binding to allow the translocation of the preprotein in 20- to 30-amino acid steps (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although several studies have addressed the order of events during protein translocation, relatively little is known about the SecA-SecYEG interaction in this process. SecA has been proposed to partition between the cytoplasm and the inner membrane during its reaction cycle (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 21Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), but other studies question the SecA membrane cycling model as a significant fraction of active SecA remains stably associated with the membrane throughout the translocation reaction (22Chen X. Xu H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence, using SecA bound to a liposome surface instead to SecYEG, suggests that ATP hydrolysis drives the release of the SecA-bound preprotein (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To address the SecA cycling model directly, we have studied the SecA-SecYEG interaction by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR is a versatile technique that allows rapid, online monitoring of protein interactions. We have used the Biacore Pioneer L1 chip to immobilize inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) containing wild-type and overproduced levels of SecYEG. The immobilized vesicles bind SecA with high affinity in a SecYEG-dependent manner and could be used to monitor protein translocation online. The data demonstrate that SecA binds tightly to the SecYEG complex when it contains a trapped preprotein translocation intermediate. Dissociation from the SecYEG·preprotein complex requires ATP hydrolysis. The results provide direct evidence for a translocation model in which SecA can cycle between a soluble and SecYEG-associated state in an ATP-dependent manner. Materials—E. coli SecA (1Cabelli R.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ADP, ATP, AMP-PNP, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. SPR—SPR measurements were performed using a two-channel BIAlite SPR system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). IMVs (2 mg/ml in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were passed 11 times through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and immobilized on a Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Binding experiments were performed in Buffer A with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 150 mm KCl at 25 or 30 °C. Stability of the baseline and regeneration of SecA binding sites were obtained by injection of 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 10. Data Analysis—The SPR response prior to injection and the time of injection were adjusted to zero. Binding curves were corrected for changes in the refractive index of the buffer and nonspecific binding to IMVs and the chips surface by the BiacoreX control software 2.0.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Corrected binding curves of SecA association and dissociation were quantitatively analyzed using the BIAevalution 2.2.4 software (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The data were fitted to a pseudo-first order model of simple 1:1 binding (A + B ↔ AB) by non-linear regression. The dissociation rate constant was derived from the equation R t = R 0 e –koff(t–t0) where R t is the response in response units (RU) at time t, R 0 is the response at t 0, and k off is the dissociation rate constant. The association rate constant k on was derived from the equation R t = R eq(1 – e –(kon[C]+koff)(t–t0), where [C] is the ligand concentration, and R eq is the steady state response level. In addition, the dissociation phase was fitted to a parallel dissociation model (AB1 + AB2 ↔ A + B1 + B2), using the equation R t = R 1 e –koff1(t–t0) + (R 0 – R 1)e –koff2(t–t0). The affinity (K D) was calculated from the ratio k off/k on and from the response levels attained at equilibrium for different SecA concentrations by Scatchard analysis. Other Biochemical Techniques—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Detection of SecA-SecYEG Interaction by Surface Plasmon Resonance—To study the interaction between SecA and the SecYEG complex, IMVs containing overexpressed SecYEG (SecYEG+) were immobilized on a Pioneer L1 sensor chip. The surface of this sensor chip consists of dextran modified with lipophilic anchoring molecules that protrude the lipid bilayer thereby immobilizing the vesicles. The Bialite SPR system contains two flow cells that enable simultaneous monitoring of a sample and a control. A control surface was prepared by loading IMVs containing wild-type (WT) levels of SecYEG onto the second cell. IMV immobilization caused an SPR response between 2500 and 4500 RU (data not shown). Loading levels of the control (WT) and sample (SecYEG+) cells were similar to allow direct comparison. The binding of SecA to the immobilized IMVs was followed in time (Fig. 1A). The responses of the WT and SecYEG+ IMVs in Fig. 1A include a “bulk” contribution to the SPR signal, i.e. a change in the signal because of changes in the refractive index of the injection buffer. After bulk correction, the SecYEG+ response was increased five times compared with the WT response, demonstrating specific SecA-SecYEG interaction. Specific binding of SecA to SecYEG reached saturation of available binding sites at a SecA concentration of about 48 nm (data not shown). The association and dissociation rates of the SecA-SecYEG interaction were determined after correction of the SecYEG+ IMV response for the WT IMVs response, which includes the bulk contribution and nonspecific SecA binding (see Fig. 1A and Table I). The association of SecA with the SecYEG complex fitted best to a pseudo-first order model of simple 1:1 binding (A + B ↔ AB), with a k on of 2.5 ± 0.4 × 10–6m–1s–1 (see Fig. 1B and Table I). The dissociation phase was more accurately described by a parallel dissociation model (AB1 + AB2 ↔ A + B1 + B2) with a k off1 of 2.8 ± 0.4 × 10–2 s–1 (27%) and a k off2 of 3.9 ± 0.4 × 10–3 s–1 (73%) (see Fig. 1C and Table I). Parallel dissociation can be caused by the presence of two ligand binding sites with different affinities. However, this phenomenon has been reported to occur frequently in SPR experiments and can also be attributed to sterical hindrance (molecular crowding), mass transport limitations, or non-uniform immobilization of the binding sites (29Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The k off1 of the parallel dissociation model yielded an unrealistic (negative) k on; therefore, the parallel character of the dissociation phase probably does not reflect the existence of two different SecA binding sites. The affinity (K D) determined by the ratio k off/k on (Table I) was comparable with the SecA binding affinity reported in previous studies (30van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for SecA binding kinetics were independent of SecA concentration (3–96 nm), and an increased flow rate from 20 to 40 μl/min yielded comparable response curves, indicating that the kinetics were not influenced by mass transport limitations. To validate the kinetic analysis of the SecA-SecYEG interaction, the results were subjected to the self-consistency tests proposed by Schuck and Minton (33Schuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The K D determined by Scatchard analysis (3.6 ± 0.2 nm for SecYEG) from the response levels attained at equilibrium for different SecA concentrations was comparable with the k off/k on ratio. The k off calculated using linear regression of the dependence of k obs on [C] (k obs = k on[C] + k off, where [C] is the SecA concentration) was approximately equal to k off determined by fitting to R t = R 0 e –koff(t–t0) and the k obs > k off for all SecA concentrations tested (data not shown). SPR experiments with immobilized vesicles containing SecYE instead or SecYEG (Table I) yielded identical results. This confirms a previous study (10Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in which SecG was shown not to contribute to the high affinity binding of SecA to the SecYE complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SPR can be used to directly monitor the kinetics of the high affinity interaction between SecA and the SecYEG complex.Table IKinetic constants of SecA-SecYEG interactionIMVskonkoffkoff1koff2KD k off/konm-1 s-1s-1s-1s-1mSecYEG2.5 ± 0.4 × 1065.2 ± 0.4 × 10-32.8 ± 0.4 × 10-2 (27%)3.9 ± 0.4 × 10-3 (73%)2.0 ± 0.2 × 10-9SecYE3.1 ± 0.4 × 1065.3 ± 0.4 × 10-32.6 ± 0.4 × 10-2 (26%)4.2 ± 0.4 × 10-3 (74%)1.9 ± 0.1 × 10-9 Open table in a new tab Binding of proOmpA to the SecA·SecYEG Complex—SecYEG-bound SecA binds preproteins either in a complex with the chaperone SecB or as free preprotein, but the exact affinity of the interaction of SecA with preproteins is not known (34Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). To characterize the interaction of the preprotein proOmpA with SecYEG-bound SecA in more detail by SPR, IMVs were immobilized as described above and saturated with SecA. Subsequently, proOmpA was injected in either the presence or absence of SecB. In the absence of SecB, proOmpA binding resulted in a response of 60 RU (Fig. 2, dashed line) and occurred with an affinity of 14 ± 1 nm (Table II). In the presence of SecB the binding response increased to 120 RU (Fig. 2, solid line). This increased response is probably because of the binding of the larger proOmpA·SecB complex, because binding of SecB alone could not be detected under the conditions applied (Fig. 2, dotted line). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the SecB was normally active (data not shown). The proOmpA·SecB complex bound to the SecA·SecYEG complex with an affinity of 16 ± 2 nm (Table II), which is nearly identical to the affinity of proOmpA binding in the absence of SecB.Table IIKinetic constants of the interaction of proOmpA or proOmpA:SecB with SecYEG bound SecALigandkonkoffKDm-1 s-1s-1mproOmpA2.6 ± 0.1 × 1053.6 ± 0.1 × 10-314 × 10-9proOmpA:SecB1.9 ± 0.3 × 1052.9 ± 0.1 × 10-316 × 10-9 Open table in a new tab Protein Translocation Monitored by SPR—To determine whether SPR can be used to monitor the interactions that occur during the protein translocation cycle, experiments were conducted in the presence of ATP. Injection of SecA, proOmpA, and SecB resulted in an SPR response of ∼200 RU (Fig. 3A, dashed line), which corresponds largely to the sum of the individual binding steps of SecA (100 RU; see Fig. 1) and the proOmpA·SecB complex (120 RU; see Fig. 2). When ATP was included in the injection buffer, a significant increase in the SPR response was observed that did not reach saturation at the end of the association phase (Fig. 3A, solid line). To address the possibility that the increased SPR response with time was caused by translocation of injected proOmpA, an experiment was conducted that allowed for only one round of translocation. Oxidation of proOmpA induces the formation of an internal disulfide bridge between Cys290 and Cys302, which causes a translocation arrest in the absence of the proton motive force (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 35Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, translocated proOmpA accumulates as a translocation intermediate (I29) that occupies the translocation site and blocks it for a second round of translocation (7Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 35Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alkaline carbonate treatment after the immobilization of the vesicles removes the F1 domain of the F0F1-ATPase and thus the ability to generate a proton motive force upon the addition of ATP (data not shown). When SecA, proOmpA·SecB, and ATP were injected under oxidizing conditions, the SPR signal saturated quickly and reached a much lower level than under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). The maximal response for the injection of SecA, ATP, and oxidized proOmpA·SecB (∼200 RU; see Fig. 3B, solid line) was comparable with the response of an injection of SecA and proOmpA·SecB without nucleotides (Fig. 3B, dotted line). This is consistent with the observation that oxidized proOmpA blocks the translocation sites for further translocation (7Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 35Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of a Cys-less proOmpA mutant yielded a response similar to wild-type proOmpA under reducing conditions (data not shown). After reduction of the disulfide bond with dithiothreitol, addition of SecA, proOmpA·SecB, and ATP resulted in a further increase in the SRP response consistent with a new cycle of translocation (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the immobilized vesicles are capable of translocation and that SPR can be used to monitor protein-protein interactions during translocation. Release of SecA from a SecYEG-trapped Preprotein Is ATP-dependent and Does Not Require Completion of Translocation—In the absence of ATP, binding of SecA and proOmpA·SecB was reversible, and dissociation occurred immediately at the end of the injection (Fig. 3A, dashed line). In contrast, when the complex was formed under translocation conditions (i.e. with ATP), it remained stably associated with the membrane (Fig. 3A, solid line) and was even resistant against alkaline carbonate treatment (data not shown). This can be explained in part by translocation of proOmpA, but this reaction is not expected to inhibit dissociation of SecA. Only upon a second injection with ATP, part of the complex dissociated from the membrane, whereas ADP was unable to elicit the release (Fig. 3C). To test whether this dissociation represented SecA that was associated previously with the SecYEG complex, the recovery of high affinity SecA binding sites was monitored by a new injection with SecA. For this purpose, SecA was first injected together with the translocation ligands proOmpA, SecB, and ATP and allowed to dissociate in the presence or absence of ATP. Subsequently, a second injection of SecA was passed over the sensor chip, and the binding responses were compared with that of SecA in the absence of translocation ligands (initial response) (Fig. 3D). When complex dissociation was analyzed in the absence of ATP, a second SecA injection resulted in a response of only 30% of the initial response (Fig. 3D). However, when the complex was allowed to dissociate in the presence of ATP, a second injection of SecA resulted in a response of 55% (Fig. 3D). The increase in SPR response corresponds to the amount of material that dissociated from the membrane upon injection of ATP (Fig. 3C). This suggests that ATP is able to release part of the complex from high affinity SecA binding sites. ADP or the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP failed to dissociate the complex, and under those conditions no high affinity binding sites for SecA were recovered (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the dissociation of SecA from the membrane after one or more rounds of translocation requires the hydrolysis of ATP. An ATP-dependent release from the membrane has previously been proposed based on the behavior of a protease-protected 30-kDa fragment of SecA (21Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 36Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In these studies, formation of the 30-kDa fragment could also be driven by AMP-PNP in the absence of a preprotein. SPR showed that SecA dissociated readily after it had been bound to the SecYEG complex in the presence of AMP-PNP (Fig. 3E, dotted line). The dissociation could, however, be blocked by a second injection with AMPPNP (Fig. 3E, solid line). These results show that also a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue can lock SecA at the membrane, but in contrast to the complex formed in the presence of preprotein and ATP, the AMP-PNP-dependent complex readily dissociates upon depletion of the nucleotide. The ATP injection that is required for the dissociation of SecA could be necessary to complete the translocation of the partially translocated preproteins. Alternatively, SecA could dissociate from the membrane upon ATP hydrolysis irrespective of completion of translocation. To discriminate between these possibilities, the dissociation of SecA from the oxidized proOmpA translocation intermediate was studied. Similar to the complex formed under reducing conditions, the oxidized complex did not dissociate from the membrane at the end of injection (Fig. 3B). Dissociation and regeneration of SecA binding sites could be obtained by addition of ATP (Fig. 3D), implying that completion of translocation is not required for the release of SecA from the translocation site. To analyze the re-association of SecA with translocation sites that are occupied by partially translocated preproteins, binding of SecA to an oxidized proOmpA·SecYEG complex was examined. SecA was injected together with the translocation ligands proOmpA·SecB and ATP under either oxidizing or reducing conditions. After the end of the injection, complexes were allowed to dissociate in the presence of ATP. Subsequently, a second injection of SecA was passed over the sensor chip, and the binding responses were compared. After preincubation under oxidizing or reducing conditions, the second SecA injection resulted in a similar SPR response of ∼60 RU (see Fig. 3D and Fig. 4, left panel). The dissociation phase, however, was different for the two conditions. When SecA was bound to the oxidized proOmpA·SecYEG complex it remained stably associated with the membrane (Fig. 4, left panel). Again ATP was required for dissociation (Fig. 4, right panel), whereas AMP-PNP and ADP were unable to release SecA. The second round of SecA binding to the complex formed under reducing conditions was reversible, and dissociation occurred immediately after the end of the injection (Fig. 4, left panel). In contrast to oxidized proOmpA, reduced proOmpA does not form stable translocation intermediates. Likewise, after reduction of the disulfide bond of oxidized proOmpA with dithiothreitol, a second injection of SecA also resulted in reversible binding (data not shown). Conversion of the intermediate I29 to full-length translocated proOmpA can be driven by low ATP concentrations once the disulfide bridge is reduced (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that SecA binds with a very high affinity to the SecYEG complex when it contains a partially translocated preprotein and that effective dissociation of this preprotein·SecYEG complex requires the hydrolysis of ATP. The SecA motor of the E. coli preprotein translocase is a highly dynamic protein that in the cell distributes between cytosolic and membrane-associated states (37Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L.P. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of SecA with the inner membrane has been studied previously by binding experiments using radiolabeled SecA. This demonstrated that the SecA association with the membrane occurs with high affinity with the SecYEG complex (34Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and with low affinity with the negatively charged lipids (12Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this discontinuous binding assay provides no information about the kinetics of the interaction and cannot easily be applied when protein translocation conditions prevail. To directly monitor the SecA interaction with SecYEG, we have analyzed this process by SPR. This technique has been used extensively for studies on soluble proteins, but the method has only recently become applicable for studies on the interaction with membranes. So far, these studies only concerned the interaction between a soluble protein or peptide and a lipid bilayer. The results presented here show that SPR can be used to obtain detailed and quantitative information on the interaction between the peripheral SecA protein and its membrane receptor, the SecYEG complex. The affinity for the binding of SecA to SecYEG determined by SPR is comparable with values determined previously (30van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by binding experiments with radiolabeled SecA. In addition, SPR could be used to study the interactions that occur during protein translocation. Based on the formation of a protease-protected 30-kDa fragment, the SecA reaction cycle has been proposed to involve nucleotide-induced membrane insertion and de-insertion steps (21Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because the 30-kDa fragment could be chased by an excess of non-radioactive SecA, SecA was proposed to alternate between a cytosolic and membrane-associated state during its reaction cycle (21Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, other studies failed to demonstrate a translocation-dependent dissociation of membrane-bound SecA and concluded that membrane cycling is not an essential feature for protein translocation (22Chen X. Xu H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The SPR results presented here demonstrate directly that SecA can dissociate from the activated SecYEG complex during a translocation cycle. In the absence of a preprotein, SecA binding to the SecYEG complex is readily reversible. However, when SecA is actively engaged with a preprotein trapped in the translocation channel, SecA release strictly requires the hydrolysis of ATP. The ATP-dependent dissociation is not related to completion of translocation, because SecA also dissociates in an ATP-dependent manner from partially translocated preproteins that remain trapped because of the presence of disulfide bridge. These data confirm previous suggestions that upon ATP hydrolysis, SecA releases the bound preprotein (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our SPR study, this conclusion was based on an experiment with SecA bound to lipid vesicles in the absence of the SecYEG complex under non-translocating conditions. The SPR observations also show resemblance to the behavior of the SecA proteolytic 30-kDa fragment that can be chased by an excess of non-radioactive SecA in the presence of ATP (21Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), although this experiment does not demonstrate net release of SecA from the translocation site. In the absence of a preprotein, the 30-kDa fragment of SecA could be formed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, and formation of the 30-kDa SecA fragment was attributed to the binding of ATP during the translocation reaction (36Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The requirements for the formation of a stable SecA·SecYEG complex that was detected by SPR are different. Various reports suggest that the 30-kDa fragment formed in the presence of AMP-PNP may differ from the one formed under translocation conditions (36Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 39Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The SPR experiments demonstrate that SecA readily dissociated form the SecYEG complex after injection in the presence of AMP-PNP, unless the nucleotide was also present during the dissociation. A SecA·SecYEG complex that remained stable after depletion of nucleotides could only be formed under translocation conditions or when SecA re-bound to the SecYEG complex containing a partially translocated preprotein. This suggests that stable membrane association of SecA under translocation conditions is dependent on the presence of a preprotein rather than the binding of ATP. The presence of the preproteins is, however, not sufficient as a dissociable SecA·preprotein·SecYEG complex is formed when SecA and proOmpA are injected in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3, A and C). Apparently, stable membrane association of SecA does not result from the binding of ATP directly but needs to be preceded by an ATP-dependent preprotein translocation step. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that SecA interacts with high affinity with the exposed non-translocated polypeptide domains of the preprotein. This may anchor SecA more stable to the SecYEG pore complex such that ATP hydrolysis is needed to dissociate the SecA-preprotein interaction (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Alternative explanations need to be considered, as well. SecA has been proposed to be subjected to changes in its quaternary structure during its reaction cycle (40Benach J. Chou Y.T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L. Golsaz C.M. Gierasch L.M. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3628-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 42Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Differences in the oligomeric state of SecA could affect the affinity of the SecA-SecYEG interaction, but in our SPR experiments we cannot discriminate between a monomeric and dimeric state of SecA at the translocase. Because of the presence of a trapped translocation intermediate, the SecYEG complex may exist in a different conformational state that permits a tight interaction with SecA. Biochemical and electron microscopy studies have indicated that the translocation pore is formed by an oligomeric assembly of SecYEG complexes (7Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In a three-dimensional structure reconstituted from two-dimensional SecYEG crystals the SecYEG complex is dimeric and displays a deep cavity at the dimer interface (38Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Because this cavity is closed at the periplasmic side of the membrane, the structure was proposed to represent a “closed state” of the translocation channel (38Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The structure would convert into an “open state” when the complex is actively involved in translocation, but it is not clear whether the open state reflects a different conformational or oligomeric state. In this respect, electron microscopy suggests that SecYEG dimers tetramerize upon activation of SecA by AMP-PNP or ATP and a preprotein (7Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the oligomeric state of the active SecYEG pore complex remains a topic of debate, both models propose that the protein-conducting pore needs to be activated at the initiation of translocation. The ATP-dependent step that is required for the stable membrane association of SecA could be related to this activation of the translocation pore. In such a scenario, SecA binds to the inactive SecYEG complex in a reversible manner. Upon binding of a preprotein and ATP to SecYEG-bound SecA the SecYEG complex is activated, and this event locks SecA at the translocation site. When SecA is released from the membrane after the hydrolysis of ATP, the trapped translocation intermediate can stabilize the pore in the activated state. As a consequence, in a second reaction cycle SecA can bind tightly to the SecYEG complex in the absence of ATP. In a non-arrested reaction cycle, re-binding of SecA to the translocation intermediate results in a translocation progress (19Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 20van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that SPR can be used to monitor the association and dissociation kinetics of a peripheral protein component with its membrane receptor embedded in its natural lipid environment. The SPR results confirm a translocation model in which SecA alternates between a free (cytosolic) and membrane-associated state. The study further demonstrates that during the translocation reaction, SecA is tightly bound to the activated SecYEG complex but can be released upon the hydrolysis of ATP.

However, dissemination of genes encoding virginiamycin acetyltransferases, enzymes that confer resistance to streptogramins, threatens to limit the medical utility of the quinupristin-dalfopristin combination. Here we present structures of virginiamycin acetyltransferase D (VatD) determined at 1.8 Å resolution in the absence of ligands, at 2.8 Å resolution bound to dalfopristin, and at 3.0 Å resolution in the presence of acetyl-coenzyme A. Dalfopristin is bound by VatD in a similar conformation to that described previously for the streptogramin virginiamycin M1. However, specific interactions with the substrate are altered as a consequence of a conformational change in the pyrollidine ring that is propagated to adjacent constituents of the dalfopristin macrocycle. Inactivation of dalfopristin involves acetyl transfer from acetyl-coenzyme A to the sole (O-18) hydroxy group of the antibiotic that lies close to the side chain of the strictly conserved residue, His-82. Replacement of residue 82 by alanine is accompanied by a fall in specific activity of >105-fold, indicating that the imidazole moiety of His-82 is a major determinant of catalytic rate enhancement by VatD. The structure of the VatD-dalfopristin complex can be used to predict positions where further structural modification of the drug might preclude enzyme binding and thereby circumvent Synercid® resistance.

The challenge presented by life-threatening nosocomial bacterial infections involving multiply antibiotic-resistant, Gram-positive pathogens has prompted renewed interest in the medical use of streptogramins (1Leclercq R. Courvalin P. Lancet. 1998; 352: 591-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (also called virginiamycins, pristinamycins, and synergistins). These are a group of natural-product antibiotics that contain two distinct active components, streptogramins A and B. The individual compounds act as bacteriostatic agents, but combinations of streptogramins A and B demonstrate bactericidal activity against Gram-positive microorganisms as a result of synergistic inhibition of the ribosomal peptide elongation cycle (2Cocito C. DiGiambattista M. Nyssen E. Vannuffel P. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1997; 39: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Synercid®, a new semisynthetic streptogramin formulation, was approved recently by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bacteremia associated with glycopeptide (vancomycin)-resistant Enterococcus faecium and of postoperative infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (3Henney J.E. JAMA. 1999; 282: 1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synercid® is a mixture of dalfopristin and quinupristin, derivatives of streptogramin A and streptogramin B, respectively, each of which has been modified to enhance the bioavailability of the antibiotic (4Bounine, J.-P., and Conrath, G. (November 30, 1999). U. S. Patent 5,994,338Google Scholar).A number of streptogramin resistance mechanisms have been identified that are directed to either A or B components (5Roberts M.C. Sutcliffe J. Courvalin P. Jensen L.B. Rood J. Seppala H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2823-2840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but resistance to streptogramin A alone is sufficient to dramatically reduce efficacy of the combined antibiotic (6Rende-Fournier R. Leclerq R. Galimand M. Duval J. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Streptogramin A resistance is achieved by a putative active efflux mechanism or, more commonly, by inactivation attributable to O-acetylation of the single hydroxy group of the antibiotic. Efflux may be mediated by the product of the vga (virginiamycin factor A) gene, whereas acetylation is catalyzed by virginiamycin acetyltransferase (Vat) 1The abbreviations used are: Vat, virginiamycin acetyltransferase; vat, gene encoding Vat; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; LβH, left-handed β-helix; VM, virginiamycin M1; TLS, translation-libration-screw.1The abbreviations used are: Vat, virginiamycin acetyltransferase; vat, gene encoding Vat; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; LβH, left-handed β-helix; VM, virginiamycin M1; TLS, translation-libration-screw. proteins using acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) as the acetyl-donor substrate (6Rende-Fournier R.

Vats are members of a superfamily of trimeric enzymes containing a left-handed β-helical (LβH) protein domain built from a repeating hexad amino acid sequence motif (9Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1649-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genes (vat) encoding such acetyltransferases are frequently encountered in veterinary strains of staphylococci and enterococci, probably reflecting the widespread use of virginiamycin as a growth promoter in animal husbandry, but at present are relatively rare in clinical isolates (12Thal L.A. Zervos M.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1999; 43: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, as dalfopristin is also a substrate of Vat enzymes, dissemination of vat determinants via inter- and intraspecific horizontal gene transfer has the potential to severely limit the utility of the quinupristin-dalfopristin combination in the treatment of glycopeptide (vancomycin)-resistant E. faecium and other serious infections.The crystal structure of VatD from E. faecium strain BM4145 (6Rende-Fournier R. Leclerq R. Galimand M. Duval J. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was determined recently at 2.5 Å resolution in the absence of ligands and in complex with substrates AcCoA and virginiamycin M1 (VM) at 2.7 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively (11Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this report, we extend the structural analysis of the apoenzyme to 1.8 Å resolution and present 2.8 Å data for a complex of VatD and dalfopristin. The latter define important contacts between the antibiotic and amino acids of the VatD active site, including a strictly conserved histidyl residue, His-82. Mutational analyses indicate that deletion of the imidazole group of His-82 reduces the activity of VatD by a minimum of five orders of magnitude. In addition to identifying important determinants of catalytic rate enhancement, the structure of the dalfopristin-VatD complex also provides a structural basis for the rational design of new streptogramin A-derived antibiotics that are no longer susceptible to inactivation by Vat-mediated acetylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and Assay of Native VatD Protein—Native VatD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli JM101 from plasmid pAT421 (6Rende-Fournier R. Leclerq R. Galimand M. Duval J. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and purified to apparent homogeneity (>95%) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham-Pharmacia) by anion-exchange (Q-Sepharose FF and Mono-Q 10/10) and hydrophobic interaction (Phenyl-Sepharose HP) column chromatography. The concentration of homogeneous VatD was determined at 280 nm using the theoretical extinction coefficient of 4.7 × 104m–1 cm–1 calculated according to Edelhoch (13Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). VatD activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA with standard substrate concentrations of 0.1 mm VM and 0.4 mm AcCoA and in the presence of 1 mm 5–5′-(dithiobis)-2-nitrobenzoic acid. 5–5′-(Dithiobis)-2-nitrobenzoic acid reacts stoichiometrically with the free thiol of the CoA produced by VatD catalysis, yielding the thionitrobenzoate anion that absorbs strongly at 412 nm (E = 1.36 × 104m–1 cm–1).Preparation of Selenomethionyl VatD—To produce selenomethionine-substituted VatD protein, a pET28a/vatD recombinant plasmid (28Snidwongse J. Structural and Mechanistic Analyses of Virginiamycin Acetyltransferase D. Ph.D. thesis, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom2002Google Scholar) was introduced into the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834 (DE3). Cell-free extracts were prepared from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced exponential-phase cultures grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with selenomethionine (20 μg ml–1) and the other 19 l-amino acids. Selenomethionine-substituted VatD protein was purified as described for the native enzyme.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The His-82 codon (CAT) of the vatD gene in pAT421 was replaced by GCG (encoding alanine) using paired mutagenic oligonucleotides IM144 (5′-TATGAATGGAGCAAACGCGAGAATG-GATGGCTC-3′) and IM145 (5′-GAGCCATCCATTCTCGCGTTTGCTCCATTCATA-3′) (mismatched nucleotides are underlined) using the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene). The additional nucleotide substitution introduces a silent (T to C) mutation in the third position of codon 81 (Asn), generating a new BstUI restriction site that was exploited to screen for plasmid derivatives containing the desired mutation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire vatD coding and 5′ noncoding sequences was then used to confirm the presence of the correct nucleotide substitutions (CAT to GCG at codon 82) and the absence of additional mutations in the modified plasmid, pAT421/Ala-82 (data not shown).Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials were conducted using the hanging-drop method of vapor diffusion; 5 μl of protein solution (0.15 to 0.25 mm in 1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant. Crystals of native and selenomethionine-incorporated enzyme were obtained after two to five days of incubation at 17 °C using 2.7 to 3.0 m sodium formate as a precipitant. The free enzyme crystallized in the space group F222 with cell dimensions a = 181.4 Å, b = 183.0 Å, c = 184.1 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The crystals have six copies of the monomer in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 48%. The crystals were stabilized in 20% glycerol and 3 m sodium formate before flash cooling at 100 K. Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected to 2.7 Å (2.8 Å for the inflection wavelength) from a single crystal on station BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. Three wavelengths were chosen near the selenium absorption edge (see Table I) based on an x-ray fluorescence scan of the frozen crystal to maximize the f″ component (λ1 peak), to minimize the f′ component (λ2, inflection) and to maximize the Δf′ component (λ3, remote). The data collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility were processed and merged using DENZO/SCALEPACK from the HKL suite of programs (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

Data were processed and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement—The diffraction data from the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment were analyzed, and estimates of heavy atom structure factors, F A values derived from an analysis of the anomalous differences between reflections at the three wavelengths, were determined using the program XPREP (Bruker, AXS, Madison, WI). The anomalous signal was found to extend to 3.0 Å, and F A values were cut to this resolution. The locations of the selenium atoms were found from the selenomethionine data of the free enzyme using the program SHELXD (15Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar). Of the possible 48 sites corresponding to 8 from each monomer in the asymmetric unit, 46 were found. The selenium sites were refined, and phases were calculated using MLPHARE (16Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar) with the λ2 data as native. Solvent flattening was applied using DM (17Cowtan K. Bailey S. Wilson K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, Vol. 31.

Diffraction data were manipulated using the CCP4 suite of programs (19Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr.

The model was refined against the 1.8 Å data set, and further rebuilding took place, including TLS refinement (21Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr.

The final model contained 10,313 atoms, including 759 of solvent, and gave R = 0.176 and R free = 0.207 (see Table II for refinement statistics). The program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W.

The dalfopristin molecule was fitted to the density, and further individual XYZ and TLS refinement gave a final R = 0.272 and R free = 0.303.Rigid body refinement of the free enzyme model against the 3.0 Å VatD data with AcCoA bound was performed with initial B-factor values set to 70 Å2 as suggested by a Wilson plot of the data, and 6-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied. Difference electron density maps were generated, which revealed clear and unambiguous density for the AcCoA. AcCoA was fitted to the density, and further individual XYZ and TLS refinement gave a final R = 0.245 and R free = 0.295.RESULTSQuality of the Models—The 1.8 Å structure of VatD contains six copies of the polypeptide chain (two trimers) in the asymmetric unit (labeled A, B, C, X, Y, and Z). The electron density is of high quality throughout the majority of the map (Fig. 1a), and the final model is composed of 1,217 of an expected total of 1,254 residues. A Ramachandran plot shows that all but six of the non-glycine residues lie either in the most favorable or additional allowed regions. Examination of the χ1-χ2 plots for all residue types showed that 99% of side chains lie in favorable conformations. The improved resolution of our free enzyme structure determination compared with those published previously (11Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) allows greater confidence in defining side chain conformations and provides a more complete description of the solvent structure around the enzyme that may have relevance for its catalytic activity and/or substrate affinity. There is an average of 126 solvent molecules per subunit in our higher resolution structure compared with 47 and 27 per subunit in the earlier 2.5 and 2.7 Å free enzyme structures, respectively (11Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The 2.8 Å structure of VatD with dalfopristin bound contains a trimer in the asymmetric unit (the individual polypeptide chains being labeled A, B, and C). The electron density is of good quality throughout the majority of the map (Fig. 1b), and the model is composed of 612 of an expected 627 residues. Clear electron density is observed for dalfopristin molecules (labeled H, I, and J) bound at all three active sites of the VatD trimer.The 3.0 Å structure of VatD with AcCoA bound is isomorphous with the 1.8 Å free enzyme structure. The electron density is of good quality for this resolution (Fig. 1c), and the final model is composed of 1,211 of 1,254 residues. Electron density corresponding to five complete AcCoA molecules and one partial molecule lacking the acetyl group (labeled H to M) was observed at the six active sites of the two trimers.Structure of the VatD Subunit—The enzyme is a homotrimer with overall dimensions of 75 Å × 75 Å × 35 Å, and the monomers are related by a non-crystallographic 3-fold axis. Each monomer contains four α-helices, seven 310 helices, and 16 β-strands with a substantial number of turns as defined using the program PROMOTIF (24Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1d). The units of regular secondary structure together make up ∼46% of the VatD polypeptide chain. The monomer structure comprises four elements: the N-terminal region, a left-handed parallel β-helix (LβH) domain, an extended loop, and a C-terminal helical domain.The N-terminal region, residues 1–29, includes a single β-strand (βA) and α-helix (αA) and caps one end of the LβH domain (residues 30–75 and 114–167). The LβH domain is the largest structural element of VatD and folds as a left-handed spiral into five triangular coils (25Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It contains 14 short β-strands (βB-βO) and two 310 helices (B and C). The LβH domain is interrupted by the extended loop region (residues 76–113), which includes four short 310 helices (D–G) and is extruded from the LβH domain at the tight turn position in the second coil. The LβH domain terminates in a β-strand (βP) that is not part of a coil but instead forms an antiparallel β-interaction with the final strand (βO) of the fifth coil. The C-terminal domain (residues 168–202) contains three α-helices (αH, αJ, and αK) and a single 310 helix (I).Quaternary Structure and Intersubunit Contacts—The solvent-accessible surface areas of the VatD monomer and trimer (calculated using AREAIMOL (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å) are ∼11,000 and 25,000 Å2, indicating that ∼30% of the monomer becomes buried on formation of the trimer. Sixty-one of 209 residues are involved in intersubunit contacts, the majority being either interactions between the extended loop region and the LβH domain or between the LβH domains of adjacent subunits. There are 10 intersubunit hydrogen bonds, 9 of which involve donors or acceptors provided by residues located in the extended loop.His-82 Is a Catalytic Residue of VatD—The GenBank database currently contains gene sequences encoding 11 distinct classes (discounting minor allelic variants) of Vat proteins that are present in Gram-positive bacteria (data not shown). Of 15 VatD residues that form direct contacts (<4 Å) with dalfopristin and/or VM (those shown in Fig. 2c plus Gly-79 and Asn-92), only His-82 and Tyr-54 are absolutely conserved in these Vat variants. Another candidate catalytic group, the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr-37* that forms a hydrogen bond with the O-18 hydroxyl, which is the site of antibiotic acetylation, also appears to be dispensable because the gene encoding a Vat enzyme in Clostridium acetobutylicum contains an isoleucine codon at this position (27Nolling J. Breton G. Omelchenko M.V. Makarova K.S. Zeng Q.D. Gibson R. Lee H.M. Dubois J. Qiu D.Y. Hitti J. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Sabathe F. Doucette-Stamm L. Soucaille P. Daly M.J. Bennett G.N. Koonin E.V. Smith D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4823-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Because His-82 is the only absolutely conserved amino acid residue positioned close to the acetylated hydroxy group of dalfopristin and VM (O-18 to Nϵ2 distances of 3.9 and 4.4 Å, respectively), we decided to address the consequences of deleting this imidazole group by using site-directed mutagenesis. The results showed that Ala-82 VatD behaved identically to the wild-type enzyme at each chromatographic step, suggesting that the replacement of His-82 by alanine did not result in any major rearrangement of the VatD structure.Fig. 2aThe active site of VatD. a, stereo image of the VatD trimer showing AcCoA superimposed on the model of the dalfopristin complex.

Amino acid residues shown are those making contacts (<4 Å) with the substrate. Asterisks denote residues from a symmetry-related subunit.

The altered positions of the pyrollidine groups (and proximal elements of the macrocycle) arise because the C-1-C-2 double bond of VM becomes saturated, when the additional C-2 substituent is introduced to produce dalfopristin, changing the pyrollidine ring from a planar to a puckered conformation. e, stereo image ofthe AcCoA-VatD complex showing amino acid residues that form contacts (<4 Å) with the substrate.

Conotoxin precursors consist of a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and the mature toxin domain. An early suggestion that the propeptide domain might act as an intramolecular chaperone (6Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was not supported by in vitro folding experiments on a hydrophilic conopeptide (7Price-Carter M. Gray W.R. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15547-15557Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the high degree of propeptide conservation in hydrophobic conotoxins (Fig. 1B) indicated that this domain might be required in vivo for efficient secretion. We used the extremely hydrophobic conotoxin-TxVI (8Fainzilber M. Kofman O. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2574-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to examine this question. Here we show that secretion of TxVI is strongly dependent on its propeptide domain, which enhances TxVI export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hitchhiking on sorting receptors from the sortilin Vps10p domain family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—An FL-Fc construct comprised of the open reading frame of TxVI (GenBank™ accession number AF193261) fused at its C-terminal to the Fc domain of human IgG was cloned into pCDNA3. A propeptide deletion (ΔP) was prepared by ligating oligonucleotides encoding the signal peptide to a PCR product encoding the mature toxin domain fused with the Fc. A GFP fusion (FL-GFP) was constructed by excision of the Fc domain followed by ligation of EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A GFP construct targeted to the ER (Sig-GFP) was made by replacing the TxVI sequence of FL-GFP with a signal sequence derived from the p75 neurotrophin receptor.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Pulse Chase—COS7 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and transfected with FuGENE-II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Pulse-chase experiments were carried out 24–48 h post-transfection. Cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine (Sigma), and pulsed in medium supplemented with [35S]Cys-Met (0.1 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were chased in full medium. Cell lysates were in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate and proteinase inhibitors (Merck).Gel Analysis and Quantitation— 35S-Labeled proteins were separated on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and exposed on a BAS-2500 (Fuji) phosphorimager screen. Results were analyzed and quantified using Image Gauge 3.41 software (Fuji).Protein Interaction Screens—The RRS system selects for protein interactions that rescue a yeast strain in which the endogenous Ras signaling pathway is repressed at 36 °C. Yeast strains, plasmids, and screening protocols for RRS were as described previously (9Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baits were prepared by cloning the propeptide domains of TxVI, PnIB, or BDNF in pADH-Ras, and proTxVI-ADH-Ras was used to screen a rat pituitary cell line cDNA library.Enzymatic, Antibody-based, or Protein Interaction Assays— endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) digests were carried out as described previously (10Rothman J.E. Fine R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fc constructs were purified over protein A-Agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A rabbit anti-sortilin antibody (11Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on BIAcore 2000 (Biacore) equipped with CM5 sensor chips maintained at 20 °C under a continuous flow of HEPES-buffered saline or MES buffers at the indicated pH (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFull-length and deletion constructs of TxVI were tagged C-terminally with the Fc domain of IgG. This relatively large tag was deliberately chosen to avoid the possibility of degradation of extremely short propeptide deletion products (13Heurgue-Hamard V. Dincbas V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Equivalent expression efficacy of the tagged proteins was verified by in vitro translation, followed by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments in transfected COS cells. Labeled TxVI-Fc was easily detectable in the medium of cells transfected with the full-length construct and accumulated at a linear rate for 8 h (Fig. 1C), thereby establishing that the capacity to efficiently secrete domains with high surface hydrophobicity is not restricted to Conus venom ducts. The intracellular expression level of the proprotein deletion was approximately half that of the full-length protein, and it was secreted at a 6–7-fold slower rate than that observed for the full-length product (Fig. 1, C and D), resulting in an order of magnitude difference in the amount of secreted TxVI. In similar experiments carried out with the extracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which is composed of four hydrophilic cysteine-rich domains, fusion with the TxVI-pro sequence did not significantly enhance secretion of the construct from transfected cells (data not shown).To clarify the role of the pro domain in enhancing TxVI secretion, we conducted an RRS screen for propeptide-interacting proteins and obtained five independent clones corresponding to two overlapping segments of the lumenal domain of sortilin (Fig. 2A). Sortilin is a member of the Vps10p domain family (11Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction is specific, as evidenced by a lack of interaction between sortilin and the propeptide domains of two small cysteine-rich hydrophilic proteins (Fig. 2B) and by coimmunoprecipitation of sortilin with pro-TxVI from transfected mammalian cells (Fig. 2C). Only 1% of the total cellular sortilin was co-precipitated with TxVI (Fig. 2C), suggesting that sortilin-TxVI interaction in the cell is spatially or temporally restricted. Testing of a number of propeptide deletion constructs localized the sortilin-binding domain to the N-terminal region of the propeptide (Fig. 2D). Further verification of the sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction was obtained by surface plasmon resonance, demonstrating concentration dependent binding with an apparent K d of 1 μm and stoichiometry of 0.2 mol of peptide bound per mol of sortilin immobilized (Fig. 2E). Since less than half of the sortilin is likely to be immobilized on the chip in an orientation favorable for peptide binding, the latter value suggests binding of the propeptide to a single site on sortilin. Binding is lost upon reduction of sortilin (Fig. 2F). The endogenous sortilin propeptide is known to bind to the lumenal domain of mature sortilin, and its cleavage and dissociation activates certain functions of sortilin (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We therefore tested for binding of TxVI propeptide in the presence of sortilin propeptide and observed binding of the TxVI propeptide superimposed onto the binding curve for sortilin propeptide, indicating that the binding sites for these two ligands are distinct (Fig. 2G). Finally, we tested the TxVI propeptide for binding to SorLA, another member of the Vps10p family (17Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22788-22796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both full-length SorLA and its isolated Vps10p domain bind TxVI propeptide, whereas megalin (an low density lipoprotein domain-containing receptor that lacks the Vps10p domain) does not (Fig. 2H).Fig. 2The propeptide domain of TxVI interacts with the Vps10p domain of sortilin family receptors.

F, lack of binding of pro-TxVI to sortilin that was reduced before immobilization.

H, TxVI propeptide binds to the Vps10p domain (residues 1–731) of sorLA with a response indistinguishable from that observed upon binding to full-length (residues 1–2107) sorLA.

One possibility would be an interaction between sortilin and TxVI commencing in the ER, followed by joint transport to the Golgi. Indeed localization of sortilin binding to the N-terminal region of the TxVI prodomain, and the ability of the TxVI prodomain to bind sortilin before cleavage of the sortilin propeptide, both support such a scenario. Co-precipitates of TxVI-Fc and sortilin from pulse-labeled transfected COS cells were therefore subjected to Endo-H digest to discriminate between ER versus Golgi forms of the proteins. The labeled sortilin band that co-precipitated with the TxVI-Fc was clearly Endo-H-sensitive (Fig. 3A), confirming that the interaction between the two proteins occurs in the ER. Biacore experiments (Fig. 3B) then revealed that the prodomain-sortilin interaction was pH-sensitive, with affinity decreasing from pH 7.4 (ER) to pH 6.2 (Golgi), with a complete loss of the interaction at pH 5.5 (secretory granules). Endo-H treatment of cell lysates from pulse-chase experiments showed a higher efficiency of ER export for full-length TxVI-Fc, with ∼6% of labeled full-length TxVI in the Golgi after 1-h chase, compared with less than 1% for the prodeletion construct (Fig. 3C). We then proceeded to examine the rate of ER to Golgi trafficking of the TxVI-Fc protein with and without co-transfected sortilin. Co-transfection of sortilin enhanced ER export of TxVI, and the fraction of the protein in the Golgi at later time points in the chase was increased from 6 to 8% at steady state in control to 12% with additional sortilin (Fig. 3D). In complementary experiments sortilin was co-transfected with TxVI-GFP or with signal peptide-GFP, and the complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-sortilin. This allowed direct examination of ER-Golgi transport of sortilin by Endo-H digestion, revealing that presence of the toxin markedly slows ER export of sortilin (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data show that the sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction occurs in the ER and that sortilin enhances ER export of the TxVI protein to the Golgi.Fig. 3Sortilin interaction with the TxVI propeptide enhances ER export. A, Endo-H digest of sortilin from [35S]Cys-Met pulse-chased transfected COS7 cells (10-min pulse-chase times indicated in hours (hr)). The left panels show sortilin co-precipitated in pull-downs of TxVI-Fc, while the right panel shows direct immunopreciptation of sortilin. Since all the sortilin co-precipitated with TxVI is Endo-H-sensitive, the interaction occurs in the ER. B, Biacore analyses of TxVI propeptide binding to sortilin at three different pH values, approximating ER (pH 7.4), Golgi (pH 6.2), and secretory granules (pH 5.5).

Statistical significance: * indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently it has become apparent that ER export is a process regulated by different signals and facilitating molecules (18Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have shown that the prodomain of conotoxin-TxVI acts as a facilitator of ER export and enhances secretion of this hydrophobic mini-protein. Intriguingly, the sortilin-binding site in the prodomain is close to its N terminus, i.e. within precisely those residues that are the first to enter the ER lumen during translation of TxVI. The prodomain-sortilin interaction occurs in the ER; and the TxVI propeptide binds a site on sortilin that is not masked by the sortilin propeptide; thus, the interaction occurs before sortilin is activated in the Golgi by truncation of its own propeptide. These data and the effect of the proteins on each other's ER export kinetics fit a scenario whereby the interaction essentially occurs while both proteins are co-maturing. The slowing of sortilin export in the presence of the toxin may reflect the imposition of a rate limit due to folding or maturation of TxVI. Thus, the prodomain of TxVI can facilitate ER export by a “hitchhiking mechanism,” linking its hydrophobic mature domain to a protein that traverses the ER efficiently and rapidly. Vps10p family members have been found across a very broad evolutionary range in multicellular organisms (20Hampe W. Urny J. Franke I. Hoffmeister-Ullerich S.A. Herrmann D. Petersen C.M. Lohmann J.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus the proposed mechanism may be evolutionarily ancient and could have been co-opted by Conus species to allow high expression of hydrophobic conopeptides. It should be noted that our findings do not rule out prodomain interactions with additional proteins outside the sortilin family. Screening for interactors of prodomains from different hydrophobic conotoxins and structure-function analyses of the TxVI prodomain interaction with Vps10p family receptors will help define the prevalence of this mechanism in the secretory pathway. It will also be interesting to see if other eukaryotes utilize prodomain “tags” to mark secreted proteins with hydrophobic surfaces as bona fide products that should pass quality control in the ER. Biosynthesis and folding of secreted proteins are regulated by quality control mechanisms targeted to exposed hydrophobic surfaces or free thiols on misfolded proteins, thus retaining them in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Endo-H, endoglycosidase-H; RRS, Ras rescue system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Endo-H, endoglycosidase-H; RRS, Ras rescue system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

Misfolded proteins that escape ER quality control can also be directed to vacuolar degradation from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or returned via retrograde transport to the ER (3Vashist S. Kim W.

Paradoxically, certain conotoxins expose extensive hydrophobic surfaces upon folding to their stable bioactive structures (Fig. 1A and Refs. 4Kobayashi K. Sasaki T. Sato K. Kohno T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of mechanisms for efficient secretion of hydrophobic mature domains. Conotoxin precursors consist of a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and the mature toxin domain. An early suggestion that the propeptide domain might act as an intramolecular chaperone (6Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was not supported by in vitro folding experiments on a hydrophilic conopeptide (7Price-Carter M. Gray W.R. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15547-15557Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the high degree of propeptide conservation in hydrophobic conotoxins (Fig. 1B) indicated that this domain might be required in vivo for efficient secretion. We used the extremely hydrophobic conotoxin-TxVI (8Fainzilber M. Kofman O. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2574-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to examine this question. Here we show that secretion of TxVI is strongly dependent on its propeptide domain, which enhances TxVI export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hitchhiking on sorting receptors from the sortilin Vps10p domain family. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—An FL-Fc construct comprised of the open reading frame of TxVI (GenBank™ accession number AF193261) fused at its C-terminal to the Fc domain of human IgG was cloned into pCDNA3. A propeptide deletion (ΔP) was prepared by ligating oligonucleotides encoding the signal peptide to a PCR product encoding the mature toxin domain fused with the Fc. A GFP fusion (FL-GFP) was constructed by excision of the Fc domain followed by ligation of EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A GFP construct targeted to the ER (Sig-GFP) was made by replacing the TxVI sequence of FL-GFP with a signal sequence derived from the p75 neurotrophin receptor.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Pulse Chase—COS7 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and transfected with FuGENE-II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFull-length and deletion constructs of TxVI were tagged C-terminally with the Fc domain of IgG. This relatively large tag was deliberately chosen to avoid the possibility of degradation of extremely short propeptide deletion products (13Heurgue-Hamard V. Dincbas V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Equivalent expression efficacy of the tagged proteins was verified by in vitro translation, followed by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments in transfected COS cells. Labeled TxVI-Fc was easily detectable in the medium of cells transfected with the full-length construct and accumulated at a linear rate for 8 h (Fig. 1C), thereby establishing that the capacity to efficiently secrete domains with high surface hydrophobicity is not restricted to Conus venom ducts. The intracellular expression level of the proprotein deletion was approximately half that of the full-length protein, and it was secreted at a 6–7-fold slower rate than that observed for the full-length product (Fig. 1, C and D), resulting in an order of magnitude difference in the amount of secreted TxVI. In similar experiments carried out with the extracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which is composed of four hydrophilic cysteine-rich domains, fusion with the TxVI-pro sequence did not significantly enhance secretion of the construct from transfected cells (data not shown).To clarify the role of the pro domain in enhancing TxVI secretion, we conducted an RRS screen for propeptide-interacting proteins and obtained five independent clones corresponding to two overlapping segments of the lumenal domain of sortilin (Fig. 2A). Sortilin is a member of the Vps10p domain family (11Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction is specific, as evidenced by a lack of interaction between sortilin and the propeptide domains of two small cysteine-rich hydrophilic proteins (Fig. 2B) and by coimmunoprecipitation of sortilin with pro-TxVI from transfected mammalian cells (Fig. 2C). Only 1% of the total cellular sortilin was co-precipitated with TxVI (Fig. 2C), suggesting that sortilin-TxVI interaction in the cell is spatially or temporally restricted. Testing of a number of propeptide deletion constructs localized the sortilin-binding domain to the N-terminal region of the propeptide (Fig. 2D). Further verification of the sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction was obtained by surface plasmon resonance, demonstrating concentration dependent binding with an apparent K d of 1 μm and stoichiometry of 0.2 mol of peptide bound per mol of sortilin immobilized (Fig. 2E). Since less than half of the sortilin is likely to be immobilized on the chip in an orientation favorable for peptide binding, the latter value suggests binding of the propeptide to a single site on sortilin. Binding is lost upon reduction of sortilin (Fig. 2F). The endogenous sortilin propeptide is known to bind to the lumenal domain of mature sortilin, and its cleavage and dissociation activates certain functions of sortilin (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We therefore tested for binding of TxVI propeptide in the presence of sortilin propeptide and observed binding of the TxVI propeptide superimposed onto the binding curve for sortilin propeptide, indicating that the binding sites for these two ligands are distinct (Fig. 2G). Finally, we tested the TxVI propeptide for binding to SorLA, another member of the Vps10p family (17Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22788-22796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both full-length SorLA and its isolated Vps10p domain bind TxVI propeptide, whereas megalin (an low density lipoprotein domain-containing receptor that lacks the Vps10p domain) does not (Fig. 2H).Since sortilin is thought to be involved in TGN-endosome trafficking, how might it influence TxVI evasion of quality control mechanisms in the ER? One possibility would be an interaction between sortilin and TxVI commencing in the ER, followed by joint transport to the Golgi. Indeed localization of sortilin binding to the N-terminal region of the TxVI prodomain, and the ability of the TxVI prodomain to bind sortilin before cleavage of the sortilin propeptide, both support such a scenario. Co-precipitates of TxVI-Fc and sortilin from pulse-labeled transfected COS cells were therefore subjected to Endo-H digest to discriminate between ER versus Golgi forms of the proteins. The labeled sortilin band that co-precipitated with the TxVI-Fc was clearly Endo-H-sensitive (Fig. 3A), confirming that the interaction between the two proteins occurs in the ER. Biacore experiments (Fig. 3B) then revealed that the prodomain-sortilin interaction was pH-sensitive, with affinity decreasing from pH 7.4 (ER) to pH 6.2 (Golgi), with a complete loss of the interaction at pH 5.5 (secretory granules). Endo-H treatment of cell lysates from pulse-chase experiments showed a higher efficiency of ER export for full-length TxVI-Fc, with ∼6% of labeled full-length TxVI in the Golgi after 1-h chase, compared with less than 1% for the prodeletion construct (Fig. 3C). We then proceeded to examine the rate of ER to Golgi trafficking of the TxVI-Fc protein with and without co-transfected sortilin. Co-transfection of sortilin enhanced ER export of TxVI, and the fraction of the protein in the Golgi at later time points in the chase was increased from 6 to 8% at steady state in control to 12% with additional sortilin (Fig. 3D). In complementary experiments sortilin was co-transfected with TxVI-GFP or with signal peptide-GFP, and the complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-sortilin. This allowed direct examination of ER-Golgi transport of sortilin by Endo-H digestion, revealing that presence of the toxin markedly slows ER export of sortilin (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data show that the sortilin-pro-TxVI interaction occurs in the ER and that sortilin enhances ER export of the TxVI protein to the Golgi.Fig. 3Sortilin interaction with the TxVI propeptide enhances ER export. A, Endo-H digest of sortilin from [35S]Cys-Met pulse-chased transfected COS7 cells (10-min pulse-chase times indicated in hours (hr)). The left panels show sortilin co-precipitated in pull-downs of TxVI-Fc, while the right panel shows direct immunopreciptation of sortilin. Since all the sortilin co-precipitated with TxVI is Endo-H-sensitive, the interaction occurs in the ER.

Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have shown that the prodomain of conotoxin-TxVI acts as a facilitator of ER export and enhances secretion of this hydrophobic mini-protein. Intriguingly, the sortilin-binding site in the prodomain is close to its N terminus, i.e. within precisely those residues that are the first to enter the ER lumen during translation of TxVI. The prodomain-sortilin interaction occurs in the ER; and the TxVI propeptide binds a site on sortilin that is not masked by the sortilin propeptide; thus, the interaction occurs before sortilin is activated in the Golgi by truncation of its own propeptide. These data and the effect of the proteins on each other's ER export kinetics fit a scenario whereby the interaction essentially occurs while both proteins are co-maturing. The slowing of sortilin export in the presence of the toxin may reflect the imposition of a rate limit due to folding or maturation of TxVI. Thus, the prodomain of TxVI can facilitate ER export by a “hitchhiking mechanism,” linking its hydrophobic mature domain to a protein that traverses the ER efficiently and rapidly. Vps10p family members have been found across a very broad evolutionary range in multicellular organisms (20Hampe W. Urny J. Franke I. Hoffmeister-Ullerich S.A. Herrmann D. Petersen C.M. Lohmann J. Schaller H.C.

Thus, the prodomain of TxVI can facilitate ER export by a “hitchhiking mechanism,” linking its hydrophobic mature domain to a protein that traverses the ER efficiently and rapidly. Vps10p family members have been found across a very broad evolutionary range in multicellular organisms (20Hampe W. Urny J. Franke I. Hoffmeister-Ullerich S.A. Herrmann D. Petersen C.M. Lohmann J. Schaller H.C. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus the proposed mechanism may be evolutionarily ancient and could have been co-opted by Conus species to allow high expression of hydrophobic conopeptides. It should be noted that our findings do not rule out prodomain interactions with additional proteins outside the sortilin family. Screening for interactors of prodomains from different hydrophobic conotoxins and structure-function analyses of the TxVI prodomain interaction with Vps10p family receptors will help define the prevalence of this mechanism in the secretory pathway. It will also be interesting to see if other eukaryotes utilize prodomain “tags” to mark secreted proteins with hydrophobic surfaces as bona fide products that should pass quality control in the ER.

https://openalex.org/W1976737434,"We have studied the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in signaling of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. By using a chimeric receptor (E/R) in which RET kinase can be tightly controlled by the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF), we have found that RET triggering induces a strong increase of PKCalpha, PKCdelta and PKCzeta activity and that PKCalpha, not PKCdelta and PKCzeta, forms a ligand-dependent protein complex with E/R. We have identified tyrosine 1062 in the RET carboxyl-terminal tail as the docking site for PKCalpha. Block of PKC activity by bisindolylmaleimide or chronic phorbol esters treatment decreased EGF-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of E/R, while it caused a similarly sized increase of EGF-induced E/R tyrosine kinase activity and mitogenic signaling. Conversely, acute phorbol esters treatment, which promotes PKC activity, increased the levels of E/R serine/threonine phosphorylation and significantly decreased its phosphotyrosine content. A threefold reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the constitutively active RET/MEN2A oncoprotein was observed upon coexpression with PKCalpha. We conclude that RET binds to and activates PKCalpha. PKCalpha, in turn, causes RET phosphorylation and downregulates RET tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling, thus functioning as a negative feedback loop to modulate RET activity."
https://openalex.org/W2110574820,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a B-lymphotropic oncogenic retrovirus whose transcriptional promoter is located in the viral 5' long terminal repeat (LTR). To date, no B-lymphocyte-specific cis-regulatory element has been identified in this region. Since ETS proteins are known to regulate transcription of numerous retroviruses, we searched for the presence in the BLV promoter region of binding sites for PU.1/Spi-1, a B-cell- and macrophage-specific ETS family member. In this report, nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral LTR identified a PUbox located at -95/-84 bp. We demonstrated by gel shift and supershift assays that PU.1 and the related Ets transcription factor Spi-B interacted specifically with this PUbox. A 2-bp mutation (GGAA-->CCAA) within this motif abrogated PU.1/Spi-B binding. This mutation caused a marked decrease in LTR-driven basal gene expression in transient transfection assays of B-lymphoid cell lines, but did not impair the responsiveness of the BLV promoter to the virus-encoded transactivator Tax(BLV). Moreover, ectopically expressed PU.1 and Spi-B proteins transactivated the BLV promoter in a PUbox-dependent manner. Taken together, our results provide the first demonstration of regulation of the BLV promoter by two B-cell-specific Ets transcription factors, PU.1 and Spi-B. The PU.1/Spi-B binding site identified here could play an important role in BLV replication and B-lymphoid tropism."
https://openalex.org/W1984498194,"Transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor, reduces the infarct size after focal cerebral ischemia in rat, but the molecular basis underlying the protection is unknown. Excitotoxicity and global inhibition of translation are acknowledged to contribute significantly to the ischemic damage. Here we studied whether TGF-α can rescue neurons from excitotoxicity in vitro and how it affects calcium homeostasis, protein synthesis, and the associated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) intracellular signaling pathways in mixed neuron-glia cortical cultures. We found that 100 ng/ml TGF-α attenuated neuronal cell death induced by a 30-min exposure to 35 μm N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) (as it reduced lactate dehydrogenase release, propidium iodide staining, and caspase-3 activation) and decreased the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ elicited by NMDA. TGF-α induced a prompt and sustained phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and prevented the loss of Akt-P induced by NMDA 3 h after exposure. The protective effect of TGF-α was completely prevented by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the Erk1/2 pathway. Studies of incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins showed that NMDA decreased the rate of protein synthesis, and TGF-α attenuated this effect. TGF-α stimulated the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) but did not affect eIF2α, two proteins involved in translation regulation. PD 98059 abrogated the TGF-α effect on eIF4E. Our data demonstrate that TGF-α exerts a neuroprotective action against NMDA toxicity, in which Erk1/2 activation plays a key role, and suggest that the underlying mechanisms involve recovery of translation inhibition, mediated at least in part by eIF4E phosphorylation.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), little is known about its effects on neural cells. TGF-α binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which stimulation induces its dimerization, autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, and triggers a cascade of reactions that requires the contribution of adapter proteins and kinases. EGFR activates several signal transduction pathways, among others are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI 3-kinase/Akt) and the p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, also referred to as extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) (5Yamada M.

Among the very early consequences of energy depletion after an ischemic insult to the brain are membrane depolarization that induces excitatory amino acid release and inhibition of global protein synthesis, and both significantly contribute to the development of brain infarct (6Nowak Jr., T.S.

Initiation of translation is a complex process that requires an initiator methionyl-tRNA and the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) for the assembly of mRNA and the ribosome subunits (17Dever T.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 398-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Availability and activity of some of these factors, which depends on their phosphorylation state, will determine the efficiency of translation (18Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

In order to better understand how TGF-α exerts its neuroprotective action in vivo, we examined the effect of TGF-α in a model of excitotoxicity in cortical cultures. Thereafter, we studied some of the transduction signaling pathways activated by TGF-α and its effect on NMDA-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+, the rate of amino acid incorporation into proteins, and the phosphorylation of eIF2α and eIF4E. All products for culture except minimum essential medium (MEM) were purchased from Invitrogen. Chemicals and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant human TGF-α was from Oncogene Research Products (Boston), and tyrphostin AG 1478, Ac-DEVD-AMC, and Ac-DEVD-CHO were from Alexis (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). PD 98059 and the mouse antibody against eIF4E were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against NeuN and anti-eIF2α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Vectastain ABC reagent and mouse biotinylated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody were from Vector Laboratories. The protease inhibitor mixture Complete and antibody against β-tubulin were from Roche Applied Science. Mouse anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (i.e. anti-pErk1/2) (Thr-202/Tyr-204), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), rabbit anti-phosphoeIF4E (Ser-209), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51), and rabbit anti-p44/p42 (Erk1/2) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). l-[4,5-3H]Leucine (SA = 73 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phase Lock Gel™ heavy tubes were a generous gift of Eppendorf Iberica (Barcelona, Spain). Microcon 30 was purchased from Amicon-Millipore (Bedford, MA), and DE52-cellulose was from Whatman. Cell Cultures—Mixed primary cortical cultures of neurons and glia were prepared from 18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (IFA-CREDO, Lyon, France) as described previously (27Petegnief V. Saura J. De Gregorio-Rocasolano N. Paul S.M. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml gentamycin and seeded onto poly-l-lysine (5 μg/ml)-precoated 24-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 3680 cells/mm2. Medium was partly changed on 4, 7, and 10 days in vitro (DIV) with MEM supplemented with B27. For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. For the determination of intracellular Ca2+, cells were plated at a density of 3180 cells/mm2 on 48-well plates. For the determination of leucine-specific activity (SA) in [3H]leucyl-tRNA, cells were plated at a density of 3470 cells/mm2 on 6-well plates. Treatments—Excitotoxic lesion was performed on 12 DIV by treating cultures for 30 min with NMDA. Medium was thereafter replaced with MEM supplemented with B27 and gentamycin. Unless otherwise stated, recombinant human TGF-α was added twice to the culture medium: on 7 DIV and immediately after the 30-min NMDA incubation on 12 DIV. PD 98059 at 40 μm was added 30 min before NMDA and was also present in the medium after NMDA washout. Tyrphostin AG 1478 at 10 μm was added after NMDA removal 10 min before TGF-α on 12 DIV. Measurement of LDH Activity—Cell death was estimated 24 h after the lesion by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the medium according to a modification of the method of Wroblewski and LaDue (28Wrobleswski F. LaDue J.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1955; 90: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Briefly, the decrease in 0.75 mm NADH absorbance at 340 nm was followed in a phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) in the presence of 4.2 mm pyruvic acid as substrate. Serial dilutions of medium from 0.2% Triton X-100-lysed cells were used to construct a standard curve, and cell death was expressed as the percentage of maximal death in the dose-response study. In all other experiments, the value of LDH activity in control cultures was subtracted from values of treated cultures, and 35 μm NMDA values were normalized to 100% (maximum cell death) as described in Bruer et al. (29Bruer U. Weih M.K. Isaev N.K. Meisel A. Ruscher K. Bergk A. Trendelenburg G. Wiegand F. Victorov I.V. Dirnagl U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Results of LDH release were expressed in percent of NMDA and presented as means ± S.E. Propidium Iodide Nuclear Staining—Cultures pre-treated or not with TGF-α were lesioned with NMDA. Sixteen hours after NMDA lesion, cultures were incubated with 7.5 μm of propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min at 37 °C and protected from light. After two washes with PBS, cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and washed with PBS. PI-positive cells were counted in 8 fields per well and the sum of the 8, corresponding to a total area of 1.1776 mm2, was calculated. Results were expressed as percent of control. Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—The caspase-3 activity enzymatic assay was performed according to Valencia and Moran (30Valencia A. Moran J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using 100 μg of proteins and 25 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC as the substrate. Fluorescence of AMC, generated by cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AMC (excitation/emission 380/460 nm), was monitored every 5 min for 30 min in a CytoFluor 2350 Millipore scanner. Enzymatic activity was calculated as Δ fluorescence/mg protein/min and expressed as percent of control. We checked that 50 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO, the caspase-3 selective inhibitor, completely blocked NMDA-induced caspase-3 activity. NeuN Immunocytochemistry—After exposure for 5 days to 100 ng/ml TGF-α, mixed cultures were washed with 10 mm cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, and endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by a 2-min incubation in 1% H2O2 diluted in methanol/PBS (30:70). Blocking was then performed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing Triton X-100 and 7% horse serum. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (anti-NeuN 1:100), washed, and incubated with a mouse biotinylated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. After a wash, cells were incubated with the ABC reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The reaction was developed in 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Three control wells and 3 TGF-α-treated wells within a same 24-well plate were analyzed. NeuN-immunoreactive cells were counted in 3 fields per well, and the sum of the 3, corresponding to a total area of 0.44 mm2, was calculated. The result was expressed in NeuN-positive cells per mm2. A t test was performed for statistical analysis. Measurement of Cytosolic [Ca2 + ]—Cells were loaded with 15 μm of the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for1hat37 °C, washed three times with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.62 mm MgSO4, 6 mm glucose), and incubated with 35 μm NMDA for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence of Fluo-3/AM (excitation/emission 485: 530 nm) was monitored at different times from 0.5 to 10 min with a CytoFluor 2350 Millipore scanner. Results were expressed as percent of control at each time point. Western Blot—Cultures were washed with cold PBS and harvested at several time points in RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm PBS, 1% Igepal AC-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels in denaturing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After 1 h blocking in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) containing 5% albumin bovine and 5% non-fat dry milk, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF4E (Ser-209), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51), rabbit anti-p44/p42, mouse anti-eIF4E diluted 1:1000, and goat anti-eIF2α diluted 1:100. After two washes in T-TBS, membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody at 1:2000. The reaction was visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system based on the luminol reaction. Reprobing the membranes with an antibody against β-tubulin diluted 1:15,000 was carried out to check equal loading in the lanes. Incorporation of [3H]Leucine into Proteins—A time course of leucine uptake was performed in order to determine the time at which [3H]leucine steady state between the medium and the cells was reached. Culture medium was withdrawn, and cells were incubated in 300 μl of MEM/B27 (commercial MEM contains 0.052 g/liter of leucine) in the presence of 4 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for different times ranging from 1 to 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was then removed, and cells were washed once with 0.5 mg/ml non-radioactive leucine in PBS, harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25% Igepal), and processed as described in Alcazar et al. (13Alcazar A. Martin de la Vega C. Bazan E. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were spun for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and an aliquot was taken for protein determination before addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were precipitated by a 30-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (trichloroacetic acid soluble fraction) were separated from the pellet (trichloroacetic acid precipitable fraction). The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction was resuspended in 0.2 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured to determine [3H]leucine incorporation into proteins. Radioactivity was also measured in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction to calculate intracellular soluble radioactivity (dpm/mg of protein) at each time point. According to the uptake results showing that steady state was already reached by 20 min, in further experiments we chose to study the effect of treatments on the incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins (dpm/mg protein/min) after 30 min of incubation with the radiotracer. The content of intracellular free leucine (nanomole) was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography in a separate experiment as follows. After the treatments, medium was replaced with MEM/B27 without [3H]leucine, and 30 min later the cells were washed with leucine-free PBS and processed as above. Five μl of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction were brought to pH 10 with 1 m NaOH and mixed with 15 μl of the derivatizing reagent o-phthaldialdehyde at 1 mg/ml. Separation of endogenous leucine was carried out in a reverse-phase C18 column (Tracer Nucleosil C18, 5-μm particle size, 10 × 0.4 cm; Teknokroma, Spain) using the following mobile phase: solution A (100 mm sodium acetate, 5.5 mm triethylamine, 11% acetonitrile, pH 5.5) and solution B (acetonitrile) mixed with a gradient program from 100 to 30% of solution A within 60 min at 0.8 ml/min. Leucine content was calculated after fluorimetric detection (excitation/emission 360:450 nm) using an external standard method according to Suñol et al. (31Suñol C. Artigas F. Tusell J.M. Gelpi E. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Leucine-specific Activity in [3H]Leucyl-tRNA—Under steady-state conditions, the rate of protein synthesis is a function of the SA of the precursor pool for the incorporation of amino acids into proteins (32Keen R.E.

A. 1988; 85: 9341-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The immediate precursor pool is not the free amino acid in the intracellular space but the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA. For this reason we determined in a separate group of experiments the SA of leucyl-tRNA for certain conditions. Isolation of aminoacyl-tRNA and deacylation was performed according to a modification of the protocol described by Keen et al. (32Keen R.E. Barrio J.R. Huang S.C. Hawkins R.A. Phelps M.E. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1989; 9: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Medium from control, TGF-α-, or NMDA-treated cultures was removed, and cells were incubated in 1 ml of MEM/B27 containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was then removed, and the cells were washed once with 3 ml of leucine-free PBS and kept at –80 °C. Cells from 6 wells per condition were resuspended in a 3.5-ml final volume of buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bentonite, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) and vigorously mixed with 3.5 ml of saturated phenol at pH 5 for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 × g at room temperature in Phase Lock Gel heavy tubes, and the aqueous phase containing total RNAs was collected and chromatographed in a 0.7 × 10 cm DE52 DEAE-cellulose column with buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. One-min fractions were collected for a total of 60 ml. Aminoacyl-tRNAs were eluted with a higher salt concentration (700 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) in 0.7-min fractions for a total of 30 ml. Radioactivity was measured in 0.5-ml aliquots, and the peak fraction containing the [3H]leucyl-tRNA was further processed to deacylate the aminoacyl-tRNA. pH was adjusted to 9 by addition of 400 mm sodium borate, pH 9.5, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Free leucine was separated from tRNA in Microcon 30 ultrafiltration systems by spinning at 14,000 × g for 25 min at 15 °C. The ultrafiltrate was concentrated in a speed-vac system and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described above. The content of free leucine (nmol) was measured, and the associated radioactivity (dpm) was determined to calculate [3H]leucine SA (dpm/nmol) derived from the corresponding leucyl-tRNA. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and the number of replicates (n) is indicated in the legend of each figure and table. Unless indicated, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni post hoc test was performed to determine which groups were significantly different. The Kruskall Wallis analysis followed by the Dunn's test for multiple comparisons was used to compare groups with non-homogenous variance. Two-way ANOVA was performed to compare changes in intracellular calcium (Fig. 1E) and the effect of NMDA and TGF-α on neuronal death (Fig. 1B). One symbol indicates p < 0.05, two p < 0.01, and three p < 0.001. TGF-α Reduces NMDA-induced Excitotoxicity—A NMDA dose-response study was undertaken to estimate the concentration that kills 50% of NMDA-sensitive neurons, as assessed by LDH release. LDH release assay, measuring cell permeability, was previously shown to correlate with cell death (35Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). EC50 was 37.9 ± 7.2 μm (Fig. 1A), so we chose to perform further experiments with 35 μm NMDA. TGF-α at 1, 30, or 100 ng/ml was added 5 days before and after the NMDA lesion, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” According to LDH release, TGF-α reduced NMDA-induced neuronal death by 40% (p < 0.05) at the highest concentration (Fig. 1B). This result was further validated with propidium iodide staining that showed attenuation of NMDA-induced neuronal loss by TGF-α (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, in agreement with previous reports (36Tenneti L. D'Emilia D.M. Troy C.M. Lipton S.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 946-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37Thomas C.E. Mayle D.A. Brain Res. 2000; 884: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Borg J. London J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), NMDA induced activation of caspase-3, which again was prevented by TGF-α (Fig. 1D). Additionally, we checked that addition of 100 ng/ml TGF-α on 7 DIV did not alter the number of neurons. After exposure for 5 days to TGF-α, mixed cultures were fixed on 12 DIV and stained with the antibody against NeuN, a marker of neuronal nuclei. Control and TGF-α-treated cultures showed 892 ± 132.2 and 936 ± 130.5 NeuN-positive cells per mm2, respectively, and no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. Because excitotoxicity induces disturbances in calcium homeostasis, we studied changes in cytosolic calcium in our model. Free intracellular calcium in cultures exposed to NMDA was raised to 2–3-fold over control values (Fig. 1E). The effect was observed as early as 30 s and was maintained for at least 10 min. TGF-α reduced the NMDA-induced increase in intracellular calcium by about 25% at all time points (p < 0.05). TGF-α Neuroprotection Is Mediated through EGFR by Activation of Erk1/2—TGF-α is an endogenous ligand of EGFR. Here we found that the protective effect of TGF-α was mediated through EGFR as AG 1478, a specific inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR prevented the protective effect of TGF-α (Fig. 1F). EGFR is coupled to several intracellular signaling pathways. Here we studied Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation after TGF-α and NMDA treatments. TGF-α induced a strong phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in a concentration-dependent manner at 5 min (Fig. 2A). NMDA caused a comparatively moderate Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). In the presence of both drugs Erk1/2 activation was higher than after single treatment (Fig. 2A). However, the effect of NMDA was transient as it was detected at 5 min during NMDA exposure, but it was no longer found at 1 (Fig. 2D) or 3 h after NMDA removal (Fig. 2B), whereas Erk1/2 phosphorylation by TGF-α was maintained at these times. We then wanted to figure out whether Erk1/2 activation was responsible for TGF-α protection. Preincubation with PD 98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK1/2), totally blocked Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). PD 98059, which did not compromise neuronal survival on its own, fully prevented the TGF-α neuroprotective effect, but it did not alter NMDA-induced toxicity (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the MEK/Erk1/2 pathway is involved in a TGF-α neuroprotective process. In addition, we observed that AG 1478 blocked TGF-α-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2, showing that this effect is mediated through activation of EGFR (Fig. 2D). In contrast to the TGF-α-induced Erk1/2 activation, we did not observe any activation of Akt after treatments (Fig. 2, A and D). However, 3 h after NMDA lesion the level of Akt-P was reduced in relation to control (Fig. 2B). This effect was not seen at earlier time points, i.e. during 5 min of NMDA exposure (Fig. 2A) and at 1 h after NMDA (Fig. 2D), likely reflecting an early step in neuronal"

Peroxynitrite-induced nitration of tyrosine residues in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) may even be one of the earliest biochemical events associated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced damage to dopamine neurons. Exposure of TH to peroxynitrite or NO2 results in nitration of tyrosine residues and modification of cysteines in the enzyme as well as inactivation of catalytic activity. Dopamine (DA), its precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid completely block the nitrating effects of peroxynitrite and NO2 on TH but do not relieve the enzyme from inhibition. o-Quinones formed in the reaction of catechols with either peroxynitrite or NO2 react with cysteine residues in TH and inhibit catalytic function. Using direct, real-time evaluation of tyrosine nitration with a green fluorescent protein-TH fusion protein stably expressed in intact cells (also stably expressing the human DA transporter), DA was also found to prevent NO2-induced nitration while leaving TH activity inhibited. These results show that peroxynitrite and NO2 react with DA to form quinones at the expense of tyrosine nitration. Endogenous DA may therefore play an important role in determining how DA neurons are affected by reactive nitrogen species by shifting the balance of their effects away from tyrosine nitration and toward o-quinone formation.

Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). ONOO– is a powerful oxidant that can modify proteins and cell organelles, damage DNA, and cause lipid peroxidation, properties that are thought to underlie its cytotoxicity (2Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ONOO– nitrates free tyrosine and tyrosine residues in proteins, modifications that are used as markers of ONOO– action under conditions of cellular damage and in numerous diseases (4Crow J.P.

ONOO– has been implicated as a causal factor in dopamine (DA) neuronal damage that occurs after exposure to the neurotoxic amphetamines (6Imam S.Z. Crow J.P. Newport G.D. Islam F. Slikker Jr., W.

Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 30: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The participation of ONOO– in cellular or neuronal toxicity is an evolving and complicated issue. Real-time measures of intracellular nitration indicate that ONOO– may not cross cell membranes in sufficient amounts to cause intracellular tyrosine nitration (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This may be a reflection of preferential nitration of hydrophobic, transmembrane tyrosines by ONOO– as compared with tyrosines in the aqueous phase (14Zhang H. Bhargava K. Keszler A. Feix J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8969-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mayer and colleagues (15Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have argued on chemical and kinetic grounds that ONOO– is altogether ineffective as a tyrosine nitrating species in vivo. ONOO– is by no means the only nitrating species and a strong case can be made for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a more relevant nitrating reagent (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M.

The tyrosine-nitrating properties of ONOO– and NO2 are not often considered within a context of cellular phenotype, but this could be extremely important in the case of DA neurons. ONOO– and NO2 react with DA to form o-quinones and various nitro-catechols (17Kerry N. Rice-Evans C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18d'Ischia M.

DA-mediated neurotoxicity is associated with increased formation of catechol-quinones, and quinones are known to modify cysteine residues in proteins (22Hastings T.G. Zigmond M.J. J.

Catechol-quinones have also been implicated in Parkinson's disease (26Hastings T.G. Berman S.B. Creveling C.R. Role of Catechol Quinone Species in Cellular Toxicity. F. P.

The interaction of DA with reactive nitrogen species could have important consequences in DA neurons by determining the pathway of toxicity, yet the influence of DA on the protein-nitrating properties of ONOO– and NO2 has not been considered. Given that tyrosine nitration of TH may be an early biochemical event in the DA neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease (9Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), we have studied the effects of DA on nitration of TH. It is found presently that catechols prevent nitration of TH by ONOO– and NO2. Using intact cells expressing the human DA transporter (31Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Park S.U. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Kuhn D.M. J.

Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we also observe that intracellular tyrosine nitration is prevented by DA. These findings suggest that nitrotyrosine formation may be suppressed in DA neurons as long as catechol synthesis and storage are intact and point to catechol-quinones as early participants in DA neuronal damage. Materials—Tetrahydrobiopterin was obtained from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), glutathione-agarose, DA, DOPA, DOPAC, sodium nitrite, sodium periodate, myeloperoxidase, and horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Sigma. Calbiochem was the source of 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO). Catalase and a monoclonal antibody against TH were products of Roche Applied Science. Thrombin and pGEX fusion protein vectors were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The mammalian cell expression vector pEGFP-C3 was purchased from Clontech. Zeocin, pCMV/Zeo, and LipofectAMINE 2000 were products of Invitrogen. Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.

Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were products of PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Bio-Max MR film was from Kodak. All other reagents were obtained from commercial sources in the highest possible purities. Cloning and Assay of TH—TH was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The recombinant protein was purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and the glutathione S-transferase fusion tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, resulting in a highly purified TH preparation (>95% pure) as previously described (25Kuhn D.M.

Lovenberg W. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Preparation of ONOO – and NO 2 and Treatment of TH—ONOO– was synthesized by the quenched-flow method of Beckman et al. (37Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by the extinction coefficient ϵ302 = 1670 m–1cm–1. The hydrogen peroxide contamination of ONOO– solutions was removed by manganese dioxide chromatography and filtration (37Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The typical concentration of stock ONOO– solutions ranged between 300 and 400 mm. ONOO– was added to TH with vigorous mixing in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm DTPA, and incubations were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C. The volume of ONOO– added to the enzyme samples was always less than 1% (v/v) and did not influence pH. When tested, catechols were added immediately prior to ONOO– when tested. Upon completion of incubation with ONOO– and other additions, enzyme samples were diluted with 10 volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and assayed for catalytic activity or post-translational modification (nitration or quinolation) after SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose (see below). NO2 was produced by reacting horseradish peroxidase or myeloperoxidase (specified below) with hydrogen peroxide (100 μm) in the presence of sodium nitrite (10–500 μm) as described by Espey et al. (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TH was exposed to NO2-generating conditions with or without catechols for 60 min at 30 °C after which the enzyme was diluted with 10 volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and assayed for catalytic activity or post-translational modification as described above for ONOO–. Post-translation Modification of TH by Reactive Nitrogen Species and Catechol-quinones—Following treatment with ONOO– or NO2 with or without catechols, TH was subjected to SDS-PAGE (62Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) and 5% nonfat dry milk, and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for nitrotyrosine (1:2000 dilution). After incubations with primary antibodies, blots were incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and immunoreactive protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Catechol-quinone modification of TH was assessed in separate experiments by staining blots with NBT in the presence of 2 m potassium glycinate buffer pH 10 as described previously (38Paz M.A. Fluckiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of Cysteine Residues in TH by ONOO – and NO 2 —The effect of ONOO– and NO2 with or without catechols on TH cysteine residues was determined with the use of the thiol-reactive biotinylation reagent PMAB as described previously (33Kuhn D.M. Sadidi M. Lu X. Kriepke C. Geddes T. Borges C. Watson J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14336-14342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PMAB reacts selectively with reduced cysteines in proteins and does not react with cysteines that have been oxidized. This probe is not quantitative but allows a relative measure of the extent to which cysteine residues have been modified. Untreated TH or enzyme exposed to ONOO– or NO2 with or without catechols as described above was diluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for subsequent labeling with PMAB (50 μm). Proteins were labeled for 60 min at room temperature in the dark after which they were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting to nitrocellulose. PMAB reactivity was detected with horseradish-conjugated streptavidin and visualized with ECL. Direct Real-time Evaluation of Tyrosine Nitration with Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein—A fusion protein comprised of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and TH was constructed by cloning the full-length cDNA of TH into the vector pEGFP-3C at its XhoI/BamHI restriction sites in the multiple cloning site. In this orientation, the eGFP fusion tag was upstream of the TH amino terminus, and the entire fusion protein complex had a molecular mass of 87 kDa. The pEGFP/TH fusion vector was stably transfected into HEK293/EM4 cells already stably expressing the human DA transporter (hDAT) as described previously (31Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Park S.U. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Kuhn D.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4399-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because hDAT-expressing cells were resistant to hygromycin and Geneticin (G418), cells were transfected with pEGFP/TH and pCMV/Zeo in a ratio of 10:1 (in LipofectAMINE 2000), and selection was carried out in zeocin (40 μg/ml) and by observing eGFP fluorescence with a fluorescence microscope. Both elements of the eGFP/TH fusion protein retained their respective functionality (i.e. fluorescence and TH catalytic activity). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The resulting stable transformants expressed eGFP/TH (for evaluation of tyrosine nitration in intact cells) and hDAT (for transport of DA into cells). Real-time evaluation of eGFP/TH tyrosine nitration was carried out as described by Espey et al. (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Intact cells (1 × 106) were washed into phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) and exposed to NO2 via incubation with PTIO and PAPA/NO (39Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at 37 °C with or without pre-loading of cells with DA as previously described (32Park S.U. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Kuhn D.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4399-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of intracellular tyrosine nitration caused by NO2 was monitored through measures of reductions in eGFP/TH fluorescence at 488em/512ex nm (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol.

Immediately after measures of fluorescence, intact cells were placed on ice, washed 3× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated in 60 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6). TH activity was subsequently measured in the cell supernatant after sedimentation of membranes by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. ONOO– caused a concentration-dependent inactivation of TH activity as previously reported (33Kuhn D.M. Sadidi M. Lu X. Kriepke C. Geddes T. Borges C. Watson J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14336-14342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10289-10294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, at a concentration of 100 μm, TH activity was reduced to 50% of control. Fig. 1A presents data showing the effects on TH activity of adding DA in the presence of ONOO–. It can be seen that DA had little effect on the ONOO–-induced inhibition of TH. Concentrations up to 100 μm DA plus ONOO– did not change the effect on TH catalytic activity caused by ONOO– alone. The effect of ONOO– on TH activity was statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA), but the effect of DA on ONOO–-induced inhibition of TH was not. Additional catechols were tested for their influence on the ONOO–-induced inactivation of TH. Fig. 1B shows that equimolar concentrations (20 μm) of DOPA, and DOPAC, in the presence of ONOO–, caused varying degrees of inhibition of TH. The effect of DOPAC was similar to that of DA in that it did not change the extent of inhibition caused by ONOO– alone. In contrast, DOPA decreased the inhibition caused by ONOO–. The effects of DOPA were significantly different from control and ONOO– alone (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's test). In view of the fact that catechols prevent the nitration of free tyrosine caused by ONOO– (20Pannala A.S. Rice-Evans C.A. Halliwell B. Singh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 40Stepien K. Zajdel A. Wilczok A. Wilczok T. Grzelak A. Mateja A. Soszynski M. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1523: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we tested their effects on ONOO–-induced nitration of tyrosine residues in TH. Fig. 2A shows that ONOO– (100 μm) caused extensive nitration of tyrosine residues in TH as measured by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against nitrotyrosine. Catechol compounds were tested at a concentration of 20 μm, and each completely prevented the ONOO–-induced nitration of TH. Although a careful titration of the concentration effects of the catechols on ONOO–-induced nitration was not carried out, we have observed that molar ratios of about 1:5 (DA:ONOO–) are sufficient to block the TH-nitrating properties of ONOO–. The last lane in Fig. 2A shows that the DA aminochrome (formed by reacting DA with sodium periodate), like DA itself, also blocked ONOO–-induced tyrosine nitration in TH. When a blot similar to the one in Fig. 2A was exposed to redox cycling staining, it was observed that the catechol compounds in the presence of ONOO– converted TH to a redox cycling protein. Fig. 2B shows that DA and DOPAC produced the strongest redox cycling staining in TH after exposure to ONOO–. DOPA was somewhat less potent than DA and DOPAC in this regard. These results with ONOO–-DA interactions agree with previous studies showing that chemical or enzymatic conversion of DA to its aminochrome or o-quinone, respectively, modifies TH, converting the enzyme to a redox cycling quinoprotein (25Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because the effects on TH of tyrosine nitrating species other than ONOO– have not been investigated, we used increasing concentrations of sodium nitrite to generate a range of concentrations of NO2 in the presence of constant levels of horseradish peroxidase (25 units) and hydrogen peroxide (100 μm). Fig. 3A shows that TH was quite sensitive to inhibition by NO2. TH was inhibited by 40–50% at a nitrite concentration of 200 μm; when the nitrite concentration reached 500 μm, TH activity was inactivated by 60–70%. Omission of any one or two of the components needed to generate NO2 prevented inhibition of TH, indicating that the enzyme was not inhibited by the peroxidase, nitrite, or hydrogen peroxide. Substitution of myeloperoxidase for horseradish peroxidase produced the same inhibition of TH catalytic activity (data not shown). The effects of NO2 on TH activity were statistically significant (p < 0.01, ANOVA). The effects of DA on the NO2-induced inhibition of TH are presented in Fig. 3B. Low concentrations of DA (5–20 μm) slightly enhanced the inhibition of TH activity caused by NO2. For example, TH activity was reduced to about 50% of control by NO2 in the absence of DA, whereas 20 μm DA increased the inhibitory effects of NO2 on TH to 40% of control. Higher concentrations of DA (50–100 μm) did not further alter the NO2-induced reduction in TH activity. The overall effect of DA on the inhibition of TH by NO2 was statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Equimolar concentrations of DOPA and DOPAC were also tested for effects on NO2-induced inhibition of TH, and the results are included in Fig. 3C. The inhibitory effects of NO2 were not altered by DA or DOPA but were significantly increased by DOPAC. Whereas DA and DOPA increased the inhibition of TH by NO2 from 50% to about 65%, DOPAC plus NO2 resulted in a near-total inactivation of TH (i.e. 95% inhibition). The effect of catechols on nitration of TH by NO2 was tested, and the results are presented in Fig. 4A. The NO2-generating conditions that caused inhibition of TH catalytic activity (Fig. 3 above) resulted in the nitration of tyrosine residues in the TH monomer (60 kDa). Omission of any one of the components needed to produce NO2 prevented tyrosine nitration in TH (data not shown). It can be seen in Fig. 4A that equimolar concentrations (20 μm) of DA, DOPA, and DOPAC prevented NO2-induced nitration of tyrosine residues in TH. In agreement with results using ONOO– as the nitrating species (Fig. 2), exposure of TH to NO2 in the presence of any of the catechols converted the enzyme to a redox cycling quinoprotein, as shown in Fig. 4B. In view of results showing that catechol prevention of TH nitration by ONOO– or NO2 did not relieve the enzyme of inhibition, we tested the effects of these treatments on the status of cysteine residues in TH. In agreement with previous studies (33Kuhn D.M. Sadidi M. Lu X. Kriepke C. Geddes T. Borges C. Watson J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14336-14342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), ONOO– lowered PMAB labeling of TH as shown in Fig. 5 (middle lane of each nitration condition), an indication of cysteine modification. NO2 caused similar reductions in PMAB labeling as seen with ONOO–. When ONOO– or NO2 was combined with DA, the reduction in PMAB labeling was still observed. DOPA and DOPAC produced the same effects on PMAB labeling as seen with DA in combination with ONOO– or NO2 (data not shown). Digital scans of the data in Fig. 5 indicate that the nitrating species reduced PMAB labeling by ∼95% and the DA-quinones also reduced labeling to roughly the same extent. Espey et al. (13Espey M.G. Xavier S. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) recently introduced a method to measure intracellular tyrosine nitration directly and in real-time based on the sensitivity of eGFP to nitration-induced reductions in fluorescence. We created stable transformants expressing an eGFP/TH fusion protein in HEK293/EM4 cells bearing the hDAT (31Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This cell line was chosen for use presently because of its low endogenous content of DA and because the hDAT could be used to transport DA into intact cells. Exposure of these cells to NO2 via treatment with PTIO-PAPA/NO caused a significant reduction in eGFP fluorescence as shown in Fig. 6. When cells were preloaded with DA before exposure to NO2, the nitration-induced reduction in fluorescence was largely prevented (Fig. 6). The effect of DA on the NO2-induced reduction in eGFP fluorescence was significant (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's test). TH activity was almost completely inhibited after exposure of intact cells to NO2. It can also be seen in Fig. 6 that DA provided partial protection against NO2-induced inhibition of TH. In agreement with Pfeiffer et al. (41Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol.

A cyclic closed-chain dodecapeptide mimicking the conformation-specific domain of CXCR4 (cDDX4) was prepared in which Gly-Asp, as the dipeptide forming a spacer arm, links the amino and carboxyl termini of the decapeptidyl linear chain (linear DDX4, Asn176 to Ile185) derived from the undecapeptidyl arch (UPA; Asn176 to Cys186) of extracellular loop 2 (ECL-2) in CXCR4. Immunization of BALB/c mice with cDDX4 conjugated with a multiple-antigen peptide (cDDX4-MAP) induced conformational epitope-specific antibodies, and monoclonal antibody IA2-F9 reacted with cDDX4, but not with linear DDX4, as determined by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance. The antibody also reacted with cells expressing CXCR4 but not with cells expressing the other HIV coreceptor, CCR5. Furthermore, the antibody inhibited the replication of HIV-1 X4 virus (using CXCR4), as shown by an infection assay using both MAGIC-5 cells and MT4 cells, but not that of HIV-1 R5 virus (using CCR5).

Following its binding to CD4, the viral envelope protein changes its conformation to bind to the chemokine receptor and initiates fusion with the cellular membrane (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M.

Because chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are the main coreceptors for cellular entry of HIV-1, viral strains are classified as R5, X4, or R5X4 according to the usage of chemokine receptor (5Feng Y.

HIV-1 R5 virus generally transmits the infection, and predominates in an early stage of infection and in long-term nonprogressors (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, HIV-1 X4 virus emerges during chronic infection, and its emergence is associated with a rapid decline in the count of CD4 (+) T cells and progression to AIDS (7Scarlatti G. Tresoldi E.

The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has a marked effect on the epidemic of AIDS, whereas the limitations of HAART, such as the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants and several inherent adverse effects, were also reported (10Gunthard H.F. Frost S.D. Leigh-Brown A.J. Ignacio C.C. Kee K. Perelson A.S. Spina C.A. Havlir D.V. Hezareh M. Looney D.J. Richman D.D. Wong J.K. J. Virol. 2000; 73: 9404-9412Crossref Google Scholar, 11Richman D.D.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CXCR4 antagonists that prevent entry of X4 virus are one of the candidates. Some studies showed that blockade of CXCR4 can possibly prevent emergence of X4 virus and change the phenotype of already existing X4 virus to R5 virus (14Este J.A. Cabrera C. Blanco J. Gutierrez A.

In addition, a recent statistical study showed that long term nonprogressors have high levels of plasma stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), which is a ligand for CXCR4, and low CXCR4 expression levels on T lymphocytes; in advancing disease, the expression level of CXCR4 increases (16Soriano A. Martinez C. Garcia F. Plana M. Palou E. Lejeune M. Arostegui J.I. DeLazzari E. Rodriguez C. Barrasa A. Lorenzo J.I. Alcami J. DelRomero J. Miro J.M. Gallart T. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that CXCR4 is an attractive target, which not only inhibits the entry of X4 virus but may also delay the disease progression to AIDS, and may become the target of immunotherapeutic approaches. CXCR4 has been shown to be critical for development (17Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) but is probably dispensable in adults. However, when developing a self-antigen as a target of an immunotherapeutic approach, unexpected effects must be taken into consideration together with sufficient immune responses. Hence, it is desirable to design an immunogen that targets a restricted protein region rather than the whole protein. Therefore, a linear peptide immunogen has the advantage in that it can elicit a desired immune response against a restricted protein region, whereas it can hardly induce antibodies against the conformational epitope (20Arnon R. Horwitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Dakappagari N.K. Douglas D.B. Triozzi P.L. Stevens V.C. Kaumaya P.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3782-3789PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, because CXCR4 is a member of the seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor family, and it has conformational and flexible extracellular regions, most conformational-specific anti-CXCR4 antibodies were induced by direct immunization of cells that expressed human CXCR4 (22Baribaud F. Edwards T.G. Sharron M. Brelot A. Heveker N. Price K. Mortari F. Alizon M. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8957-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Endres M.J. Clapham P.R.

Cell. 1996; 87: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Therefore, the antibody induced by a linear synthetic peptide against the extracellular loop region of CXCR4 could recognize a denatured protein but could not recognize the native protein. A linear peptide is inadequate for mimicking the conformational loop region of CXCR4, and mimicking the native conformational epitope by a peptide is critical for inducing the antibody against a conformational epitope. Therefore, to use the peptide immunogen for an immunotherapeutic approach targeting CXCR4, it is essential for the designed peptide immunogen to target not only the restricted region of CXCR4 but also to mimic the conformational epitope of the targeted region. In this study, we investigated the application of a cyclic dodecapeptide peptide (cDDX4) that was designed to mimic the native conformational epitope of the undecapeptidyl arch (UPA) (24Misumi S. Nakajima R. Takamune N. Shoji S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11614-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Nardin E.H. Oliveira G.A. Calvo-Calle J.M. Castro Z.R. Nussenzweig R.S. Schmeckpeper B. Hall B.F. Diggs C. Bodison S. Edelman R. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 5: 1486-1496Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in CXCR4 for use as a novel immunotherapy for AIDS. Immunization with cDDX4 conjugated with a multiantigen peptide (cDDX4-MAP) induced conformational epitope-specific antibodies that preferentially recognized the cyclic structure of the antigen and cross-reacted with cell surface CXCR4. In addition, the induced antibody inhibited the replication of HIV-1 X4 virus but not that of HIV-1 R5 virus as determined by infection assay using MAGIC-5 cells and by a productive infection assay using MT4 cells. These results indicate that cDDX4 sufficiently mimics the conformational epitope of UPA in cell surface CXCR4 and possibly induces antibodies that inhibit cellular entry of HIV-1. In addition, immunization of cynomolgus monkeys with cDDX4-MAP also elicited cDDX4-specific antibodies with anti-HIV activity. Taken together, we propose that an immunotherapeutic approach using cDDX4-MAP as the self-antigen immunogen may be a novel strategy for AIDS therapy. Cell Culture—The human T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected cell line (MT4), human T cell lines (CEM and Molt4#8), human monocytic cell lines (THP-1 and U937), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2 in the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MAGIC-5 cells and CD4-transduced human glioma cell lines (NP2/CD4, NP2/CD4/CXCR4, and NP2/CD4/CCR5) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% or 10% FCS, respectively. Anti-CXCR4 Antibody Generation—The antigen and antibody were prepared using the protocol of Misumi et al. (24Misumi S. Nakajima R. Takamune N. Shoji S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11614-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To mimic the native conformational epitope of human CXCR4, the CXCR4-derived linear dodecapeptide (linear DDX4: N2H-DNVSEADDRYIG-COOH) was synthesized using an automatic peptide synthesizer and then cyclized. The cyclic dodecapeptide (cDDX4: DNVSEADDRYIG) was conjugated with a multiple-antigen peptide (MAP) through the formation of the peptide bound between the β-carboxyl group of Asp within the cDDX4 and the amino group within MAP. MAP, which is composed of 2-fold bifurcating polylysine core developed as a carrier of a peptide antigen, is capable of eliciting a strong antibody response in mice, monkeys, and humans (25Nardin E.H. Oliveira G.A. Calvo-Calle J.M. Castro Z.R. Nussenzweig R.S. Schmeckpeper B. Hall B.F. Diggs C. Bodison S. Edelman R. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 5: 1486-1496Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (Waters), and their molecular masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Burker Franzen Analytik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Female BALB/c mice were immunized with the cDDX4-MAP conjugate using the protocol of Galfre and Milstein (26Galfre G. Milstein C.

The resulting hybridoma that produced the most potent supernatant was screened in 96-well plates for the reactivity to Multi-Pin Block (Chiron Technologies), which was conjugated with cDDX4 and was cloned by limiting dilution. The anti-CXCR4 antibody, IA2-F9, was recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation and purified using a Sephadex G-150 column (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis using Surface Plasmon Resonance—Recognition of the cyclic structure of cDDX4 by IA2-F9 was analyzed by the surface plasmon response technology using BIA-core2000 as described previously (24Misumi S. Nakajima R. Takamune N. Shoji S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11614-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Bernard A. Bosshard H.R. Eur. J.

The free β-carboxyl group of Asp that was used as a spacer-armed dipeptide in cDDX4 was conjugated to 5-[5-(N-succinimidyloxycarbonyl)pentylamido]hexyl d-biotinamide through ethylenediamine. Biotinylated cDDX4 was immobilized to streptavidin-coated sensor chips. For competition assay, purified IA2-F9 was pretreated with cDDX4 (1 and 10 nmol) or linear DDX4 (1 and 10 nmol) at room temperature prior to BIAcore analysis. All the antigen-antibody interactions were analyzed in a binding buffer (0.02% KH2PO4, 0.29% Na2HPO4, 12H2O, 0.8% NaCl, and 0.02% KCl) at a constant flow rate of 50 μl/min and a constant temperature of 25 °C. The bound antibody was eluted from the biotinylated cDDX4 by a short pulse (20 μl) of 10 mm Gly-HCl (pH 2.0). This regeneration procedure did not alter the ability of cDDX4 to bind to the antibody in subsequent cycles. Kinetic analysis was performed on BIAcore2000 using BIAcore evaluation software. For detecting anti-cDDX4 antibodies in sera derived from immunized cynomolgus monkeys, the sera were dialyzed using Spectra/Por (cutoff molecular masses, 100,000; Spectrum Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed. Antibody and Flow Cytometry—The following antibodies were used: an anti-CXCR4 mAb (clone 12G5, BD Biosciences), an isotype-matched control antibody (Sigma), purified IA2-F9, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G or anti-mouse IgM. Cells (1 × 105) were washed with washing buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.02% NaN3) and incubated with 10 μg/ml primary antibody (purified IA2-F9 or 12G5) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with the same washing buffer and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgM. Then the cells were washed again and analyzed using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Chemotaxis Assay—The migration of Molt4#8 and THP-1 was assayed in 24-well cell-culture chambers using an insert with 5.0-μm pore membranes (Corning, Corning, NY) according to the protocol of Gosling et al. (29Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Atchison R.E. Arai H. Tsou C.L. Goldsmith M.A. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells (5 × 106) were pretreated with or without IA2-F9 for 30 min and were placed in the upper chamber. Chemotaxis was conducted in the presence of 10 nm SDF-1α (placed in the lower chamber). After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, cells that migrated from the upper chamber to the lower chamber were quantified by trypan blue dye exclusion. MAGIC-5 Assay—The antiviral activity of IA2-F9 was determined by an infection assay using MAGIC-5 cells (32Hachiya A. Aizawa-Matsuoka S. Tanaka M. Takahashi Y. Ida S. Gatanaga H. Hirabayashi Y. Kojima A. Tatsumi M. Oka S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because MAGIC-5 cells express CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4, they are susceptible to infection by R5, X4, and R5X4 viruses. The cells were seeded (1 × 104 cells per well) and cultured in a 48-well plate for 24 h. After removal of the medium from each well, the cells were incubated for 30 min with IA2-F9 at the indicated concentrations and were infected with the virus in the presence of DEAE-dextran (20 μg/ml) for 2 h and washed with the culture medium. The cells were cultured in the medium containing IA2-F9 for 48 h, fixed with 1% formaldehyde-0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min, washed, and then stained with X-gal. The number of blue-stained cells was counted under a light microscope. Control experiments were carried out under identical conditions in the absence of the antibody. For determining anti-HIV activity of sera at 0 and 10 weeks derived from immunized cynomolgus monkeys, antibodies were purified from the serum using an NAb™ Protein L Spin kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determining anti-HIV activity of sera at 25 and 27 weeks, sera were dialyzed with PBS(–) using Spectra/Por (cutoff molecular mass, 100 kDa; Spectrum Laboratories Inc.) and adjusted to a concentration corresponding to a 1/10 dilution of sera with PBS(–). Productive Infection Assay—MT4 cells (1 × 105) were preincubated with IA2-F9 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min, and then HIV-1 X4 virus (m.o.i. = 0.01) was inoculated to these cells. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with IA2-F9 (0, 1, and 10 μg/ml) for 72, 96, and 120 h. Then the culture supernatant of each cell was collected, and the p24 antigen level was measured by antigen-capture enzyme-linked assay using a RETRO-TEK HIV-1 p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ZeptoMetrix Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunization Schedule—All the cynomolgus monkeys were housed in individual cages and maintained according to the rules and guidelines of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases for experimental animal welfare. Three cynomolgus monkeys, 4–6 years old, were immunized intraperitoneally at 0 and 1 week with 300 μg of cDDX4-MAP in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted subcutaneously at 6 weeks with 300 μg of cDDX4-MAP in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Furthermore, these monkeys were reboosted subcutaneously at 25 weeks with 300 μg of cDDX4-MAP in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Another three cynomolgus monkeys were immunized with MAP following the same immunization schedule. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 10, 25, and 27 weeks, which were then subjected to BIAcore analysis and MAGIC-5 assay. Design and Synthesis of cDDX4 —The hypothetical structure model of CXCR4 was based on its homology with rhodopsin (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar), and energy-minimized with the Molecular Operating Environment, MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) (Fig. 1A). The extracellular loop-2 (ECL-2) region of CXCR4, and its structure deduced by MOE (Figs. 1B-1 and 2) has a unique arch structure consisting of 11 amino acid residues (UPA) on the basis of the Cys186 residue bound to a Cys109 residue of ECL-1 by a disulfide bond (Swiss-Prot P30991, Fig. 1B-1). The cDDX4 moiety designed to mimic the native conformational epitope of UPA was generated by cyclization of a decapeptide (176NVSEADDRYI185) derived from the UPA sequence by insertion of a spacer-armed dipeptide (Gly-Asp) (shown in red in Fig. 1C). The deduced structure of cDDX4 (shown in blue) was adopted to the structural model of UPA in CXCR4 using the MOE-Align tool (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada, shown in yellow in Fig. 1D).Fig. 2MALDI-TOF MS spectra of linear DDX4 and cDDX4. The spectra exhibit two peaks at m/z 1317.7 and 1335.2: the upper peak corresponds to the ion derived from linear DDX4, and the lower peak to the ion derived from cDDX4. The matrix was a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in solution of acetonitrile-water (1:2, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fraction with a molecular mass of 17.5 corresponding to H2O was deleted after cyclizing the linear DDX4 with the peptide bond.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cyclization of the linear peptide was confirmed by molecular mass analysis using MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 2). The spectra of linear DDX4 and cDDX4 exhibited major peaks at m/z 1335.2 and 1317.7, respectively. The difference in molecular mass between linear DDX4 and cDDX4 indicates the formation of a peptide bond. The cDDX4 was combined with MAP to enhance immunogenicity and then immunized to BALB/c mice. Conformational Specificity of IA2-F9 —Immunization of BALB/c mice with cDDX4-MAP induced production of high titers of antibodies. Using cDDX4-Multi-Pin Block for a screening antigen, monoclonal antibody IA2-F9 that has the highest enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer was established. To analyze the conformational epitope-specific recognition of IA2-F9, the surface plasmon resonance technology using BIA-core2000 was applied. cDDX4 was immobilized to a sensor chip by streptavidin-biotin interaction. IA2-F9 recognized cDDX4 on the sensor chip in a dose-dependent manner (K d = 1.55 × 10–8m) (Fig. 3A). IA2-F9 binding competition was observed in the case of pretreatment of IA2-F9 with cDDX4 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, pretreatment of the linear peptide did not affect the binding of IA2-F9 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that IA2-F9 is a conformational epitope-specific mAb that can recognize the cyclic structure of the cDDX4 antigen. Binding of IA2-F9 to Cell Surface CXCR4 —Mimicry of a conformational epitope by a peptide is critical for induction of antibodies that can recognize the native protein by a peptide antigen. Paradoxically, only a peptide antigen that mimics the conformational epitope could induce antibodies that react with the native protein. The binding of IA2-F9 to cells expressing CXCR4 was determined by flow cytometry. IA2-F9 could recognize CXCR4 but not CCR5 expressed on NP2/CD4 cells (Fig. 4, A–C). These results indicate that IA2-F9 is a conformational epitope-specific mAb and specifically recognizes cell surface CXCR4. Furthermore, analysis of a panel of cells demonstrated that all cells known to express CXCR4, including MT4, THP-1, MAGIC-5, Molt4#8, U937, and PBMCs, were stained by IA2-F9 (Fig. 4, D–I). Chemotaxis Assay—The effect of IA2-F9 binding on the chemokine receptor activity was investigated by chemotaxis assay using SDF-1α as the chemoattractant. Both human T cell lines Molt4#8 and THP-1 were used with or without IA2-F9. Although each cell line showed different chemotaxic reactivities against SDF-1α, IA2-F9 inhibited weakly (THP-1) or moderately (Molt4#8) the SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 5). Anti-HIV Activity of IA2-F9 —Because ECL-2 is thought to be critical for HIV-1 X4 viral entry (31Zhou N. Luo Z. Luo J. Liu D. Hall J.W. Pomerantz R.J. Huang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42826-42833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), anti-UPA antibodies are expected to inhibit the viral infection. The anti-HIV activity of IA2-F9 was determined by an infection assay using MAG-IC-5 cells (32Hachiya A. Aizawa-Matsuoka S. Tanaka M. Takahashi Y. Ida S. Gatanaga H. Hirabayashi Y. Kojima A. Tatsumi M. Oka S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MAGIC-5 cells were generated from CD4- and CXCR4-positive HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal (MAGI) cells by transfection with a CCR5 expression plasmid to confer susceptibility to infection of not only X4 virus but also R5 virus. MAGIC-5 cells were inoculated with LAV-1 (X4 virus), JRFL (R5 virus), or 89.6 (R5X4 virus), in the absence or presence of IA2-F9 at indicated concentrations. IA2-F9 inhibited infection of LAV-1 but not those of JRFL and 89.6 (Fig. 6). To verify the antiviral activity of IA2-F9 in an alternative experiment, the inhibitory effect of IA2-F9 on HIV-1 replication in T cells was investigated. MT4 cells, a human T cell line, were infected with HIV-1 X4 virus, LAV-1 (m.o.i. = 0.01) in the presence of IA2-F9 at varying doses, and the spread of infection was monitored based on the accumulation of p24 antigen in culture supernatants. IA2-F9 at 10 μg/ml inhibited HIV-1 LAV-1 infection at the peak of virus production in the control experiment as shown in Fig. 7. These results indicate that cDDX4-MAP could induce the antibody with anti-HIV activity, and suggest the potential of immunization with cDDX4-MAP in AIDS therapy. Immunogenicity of cDDX4-MAP in Cynomolgus Monkeys—To verify whether cDDX4-MAP could induce CXCR4-specific antibodies with anti-HIV-1 activity in nonhuman primates as well as rodents, an experiment was performed using cynomolgus monkeys immunized following the time schedule shown in Fig. 8A. Three cynomolgus monkeys were immunized with cDDX4-MAP in Freund's complete adjuvant or Freund's incomplete adjuvant by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Another three cynomolgus monkeys were immunized with MAP as the control. The cDDX4-immobilized BIAcore sensor chip was used for detecting cDDX4-specific antibodies in immunized monkeys. cDDX4-bound antibodies were detected in the sera from three monkeys 10 weeks after the initial immunization (Fig. 8B). On the other hand, no significant responses were detected in MAP-immunized monkeys, which are the control (monkeys 4–6). These results indicate that cDDX4-MAP could induce CXCR4-specific antibodies not only in BALB/c mice but also in cynomolgus monkeys. Anti-HIV Activity of Partially"
https://openalex.org/W2105740478,"Glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids have been previously demonstrated to regulate negatively the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by phospholipase C-gamma1. In the present study, the depletion of endogenous glucosylceramide by D-t-EtDO-P4 in cultured ECV304 cells induced autophosphorylation of Src kinase at tyrosine residue 418 within the catalytic loop and dephosphorylation of Src kinase at tyrosine residues 529 within the carboxyl-terminal regulatory region. Phosphotransferase activities of Src kinase were also induced in the glucosylceramide-depleted cells. c-Src kinase activity and phosphorylations at Src Tyr-418 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor Tyr-1068 were significantly enhanced by bradykinin in response to 100 nm D-t-EtDO-P4 compared with control cells. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on Tyr-418 and Tyr-529 residues of c-Src were reversed by treatment of 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-t-butyl(pyrazolo)[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), an inhibitor of Src kinase, in control cells. Glucosylceramide-depleted cells resisted treatment with PP2, and both phosphorylation of Tyr-418 and dephosphorylation of Tyr-529 induced by depletion of glucosylceramide were maintained. Compared with untreated cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 was enhanced by EGF stimulation in glucosylceramide-depleted cells, associated with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 stimulated by EGF. The Src inhibitor, PP2, significantly blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 in control cells, whereas in glucosylceramide-depleted cells, suppression of Src kinase activity by PP2 toward EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 was less significant. Thus the activation of Src kinase by depletion of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids in cultured ECV304 cells is a critical up-stream event in the activation of phospholipase C-gamma1."
