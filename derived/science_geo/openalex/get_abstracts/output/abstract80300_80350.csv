https://openalex.org/W1599011232,"The Ca2+-pumping ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes, purified nearly to homogeneity (Niggli, V., Penniston, J. T., and Carafoli, E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9955-9958), can be reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The purified and the reconstituted forms of the enzyme displayed the properties expected of the intact Ca2+ pump; they had an appropriate (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity which displayed a relatively low affinity for Ca2+. Added calmodulin increased both the maximum rate and the affinity for Ca2+ of the enzyme. Mg2+ alone caused no significant ATP hydrolysis in the purified enzyme, indicating that the Mg2+-ATPase is a separate enzyme. Vesicles of the reconstituted enzyme accumulated Ca2+ with a ratio of Ca2+ accumulated to ATP hydrolyzed of approximately 1. Ca2+ accumulation and ATPase of the reconstituted enzyme were inhibited concurrently by vanadate ion, with a K 1/2 for inhibition which was indistinguishable from that observed for the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase in whole erythrocyte ghosts. While the above properties were all consistent with those observed for the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase in whole erythrocyte ghosts, the purified enzyme displayed an unexpected response to acidic phospholipids. Enzyme reconstituted with or prepared in phosphatidylserine acted as if calmodulin were already present, and added calmodulin caused no effect beyond that due to phosphatidylserine. This mimicry of the calmodulin effect by acidic phospholipids is similar to that reported for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Wolff, D. J., and Brostrom, C. O. (1976) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 173, 720-723)."

https://openalex.org/W1521691742,"Leukotriene C4 and leukotriene D4 are slow reacting substances produced by mouse mastocytoma cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells, respectively. Serine x borate complex, an inhibitor of glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), prevented the formation of the biologically more potent leukotriene D4 and caused accumulation of leukotriene C4 in rat basophilic leukemia cell suspensions. 5,8,11-Eicosatriynoic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, prevented the biosynthesis of leukotriene C4 (ID50, 5 microM) by mastocytoma cells. The results demonstrate that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is involved in the biosynthesis of leukotriene D4 and suggest that leukotriene C4 is formed as an intermediate."

It was reported earlier that opiate antagonists inhibit the hypotensive action of clonidine and alpha-methyldopa in spontaneously hypertensive but not in normotensive rats and that beta-endorphin has hypotensive effects of its own. Together, these findings indicate that release of beta-endorphin by central alpha-receptor agonists may contribute to the antihypertensive action of these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1516677878,"In sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles or in the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase purified from sarcoplasmic reticulum, quercetin inhibited ATP hydrolysis, Ca2+ uptake, ATP-Pi exchange, ATP synthesis coupled to Ca2+ efflux, ATP-ADP exchange, and steady state phosphorylation of the ATPase by inorganic phosphate. Steady state phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP was not inhibited. Quercetin also inhibited ATP and ADP binding but not the binding of Ca2+. The inhibition of ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport by quercetin was reversible, and ATP, Ca2+, and dithiothreitol did not affect the inhibitory action of quercetin."

https://openalex.org/W1534257883,"Plasma membrane fractions from rat corpus luteum contain two kinds of Ca2+-stimulated ATPase, one having a high affinity for Ca2+, the other a low affinity for Ca2+. The high affinity ATPase had a specific Ca2+ requirement with a K 1/2 of 0.2 to 0.3 microM; it had a Vmax of 105 nmol min-1 mg-1 and distributed, upon subcellular fractionation, with recognized plasma membrane enzymes. The properties of this enzyme indicate that it is a CA2+ extrusion pump. The low affinity pump (K 1/2 for Ca2+, about 15 microM) was nonspecific, being stimulated equally well by Ca2+ of Mg2+; its function is unknown. Although the high affinity ATPase resembled the erythrocyte Ca2+-pumping ATPase in the properties mentioned above, it differed in that it failed to respond to Mg2+ or calmodulin. The lack of response to Mg2+ was due to the enzyme's retention of endogenous Mg2+; it did, after incubation with chelators, show a Mg2+ requirement. However, we were unable to show any effect of added calmodulin or trifluoperazine. This failure may be related to the high content of tightly bound calmodulin in these membranes. Much of this calmodulin could not be extracted even by washing with 1 mM EGTA and/or 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. This enzyme, the erythrocyte enzyme, and the adipocyte plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase all belong to the class of Ca2+ ATPases with plasma membrane distribution and high affinity for Ca2+, indicating that they are Ca2+ extrusion pumps. However, the data indicate that tissue-specific differences exist within this class, with the enzyme from adipocytes and rat corpus luteum belonging to a subclass in which the requirement for Mg2+ and any response to calmodulin are difficult to demonstrate."
https://openalex.org/W1546304652,"Calcium accumulation by human erythrocyte inside-out vesicles was linear for at least 30 min in the presence of ATP. In untreated inside-out vesicles, 3.76 +/- 1.44 nmol of calcium/min/unit of acetylcholinesterase were transported, compared with 10.57 +/- 2.05 (+/- S.D.; n = 11) in those treated with calmodulin. The amount of calmodulin necessary for 50% activation of Ca2+ accumulation was 60 +/- 22 ng/ml (+/- S.D.; n = 4). The Km (Ca2+) for calmodulin-stimulated accumulation was 0.8 +/- 0.05 microM (+/- S.D.; n = 5) using Ca2+ /ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) buffers, or 25 microM with direct addition of unbuffered calcium. In the absence of calmodulin, these values were 0.4 and 60 microM, respectively, Km (ATP) values of 90 and 60 microM in the presence and absence of calmodulin, respectively, were measured at constant magnesium concentration (3 mM). In the presence of calmodulin, a broad pH profile is exhibited from pH 6.6 to 8.2. Maximal calcium accumulation occurs at pH 7.8. In the absence of calmodulin, the pH profile exhibits a linear upward increase from pH 7.0 to 8.2. The (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity, measured under identical conditions, was 2.40 +/- 0.72 nmol of Pi/min/unit of acetylcholinesterase in the untreated vesicles and 11.29 +/- 2.87 nmol of Pi/min/unit of acetylcholinesterase (+/- S.D.; n = 4) in calmodulin-treated vesicles. A stoichiometry of 1.6 Ca2+/ATP hydrolyzed was determined in the absence of calmodulin; in the presence of calmodulin, this ratio was decreased to 0.94 Ca2+/ATP hydrolyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1648183009,"An ATP-dependent transport system which is active at concentrations of free Ca2+ in the submicromolar range has been identified in adipocyte plasma membranes. The system appears to represent the functional component of the high affinity insulin-sensitive calcium-stimulated, magnesium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase preveiously described in the same preparation (Pershadsingh, H. A., and McDonald, J. M. (1979) Nature 281, 495-497). This ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport pump was stimulated approximately 3-fold by the Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein, calmodulin. This effect was confined to the plasma membrane since a similar effect was undetectable in the fraction enriched in endoplasmic reticulum. Calmodulin stimulation was dose-dependent but saturable with half-maximal activation occurring at 0.72 microgram/ml (43 nM). Calmodulin appeared to stimulate the system primarily by decreasing the apparent half-maximal saturation constant for free Ca2+ from 0.20 +/- 0.04 microM to 0.07 +/- 0.01 microM (n = 3). The Hill coefficient increased from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 (n = 3), thus showing an increased positive cooperativity which allows the pump to be activated by an exceedingly narrow Ca2+ threshold in the presence of calmodulin. The calmodulin stimulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ extrusion pump in adipocytes, working in opposition to metabolic signals which increase cytoplasmic Ca2+, could constitute a self-regulating negative feedback device for maintaining a low steady state level of intracellular Ca2+. This feedback system may be of critical importance in regulation of cellular metabolism by insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1510433829,"In mammals, a trifunctional protein (ME pyr1-32) synthesizes L-5,6-dihydroorotate in three sequential reactions catalyzed by carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3). 14C-labeled HCO3- has been used as a precursor for the synthesis of L-5,6-dihydroorotate by purified ME pyr1-3, and when this product is converted enzymatically to orotidine 5'-monophosphate, the concentrations of the two intermediates of ME pyr1-3, carbamyl phosphate, and N-carbamyl-L-aspartate, reach steady state concentrations of approximately 0.20 microM and 7.1 microM, respectively. At pH 7.4 in the presence of 0.1 mM 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate and 10% (v/v) glycerol, pure ME pyr1-3 has a Michaelis constant for HCO3- of 0.61 mM and a maximal specific activity of 329 pmol of L-5,6-dihydroorotate synthesized/min/microgram, equivalent to a turnover number of 65.8 mol min-1 (mol of subunit)-1. Consideration of the Km and Vmax values of aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase determined under the same conditions as the overall rate of synthesis of L-5,6-dihydroorotate by ME pyr1-3, indicates that the local concentrations of carbamyl phosphate at the active site of aspartate transcarbamylase and of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate at the dihydroorotase site must be 2.2-fold and 3.1-fold higher, respectively, than their average concentrations in the bulk solvent. Similar concentrations are predicted by calculation of steady state concentrations from ratios of the rate constants for the three activities. A high local concentration of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate at the third site is also indicated by a 3.6-fold reduction in the transient time for dihydroorotase activity from that predicted. Competition experiments performed with exogenous carbamyl phosphate and N-carbamyl-L-aspartate indicate only partial channeling of these intermediates. The inhibitory effect of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), at concentrations up to at least 2.4 microM, upon the aspartate transcarbamylase activity of ME pyr1-3 can be overcome by accumulated carbamyl phosphate. This mechanism for resistance to PALA could be manifest in cells which lack an effective phosphatase activity to hydrolyze carbamyl phosphate. L-Cysteine, a slow acting but potent inhibitor of dihydroorotase in the absence of substrates (Christopherson, R. I., and Jones, M. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3358-3370), also inactivates dihydroorotate when ME pyr1-3 is synthesizing L-5,6-dihydroorotate."

https://openalex.org/W1536473678,"Adenosine increases the activity of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in intact pheochromocytoma cells. The effect of adenosine is not dependent upon extracellular Ca2+, and is not accompanied by an increase in catecholamine secretion from the cells. Adenosine deaminase decreases the basal activity of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and almost completely abolishes the activation of this enzyme by adenosine. In cells treated with adenosine deaminase, 2-chloroadenosine causes a 2- to 5-fold increase in tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity. 2-Chloroadenosine produces half-maximal activation at a concentration of 0.1 microM, and maximal activation at 10 microM. Incubation of cells with 2-chloroadenosine produces a stable activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, as measured in vitro. Finally, 3-chloroadenosine increases the content of cAMP in pheochromocytoma cells, and increases the incorporation of 3H into cAMP in cells that have been preincubated with [3H]adenine. This rise in cAMP presumably mediates the activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase by 2-chloroadenosine. Adenosine appears to be an endogenous regulator of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity in pheochromocytoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582342363,"The characteristics of a GTPase reaction between poly(U)-programmed ribosomes, EFTu . GTP, and the near-cognate aminoacyl (aa)-tRNA, Leu-tRNA Leu 2, have been studied to assess the role of this reaction in proofreading of the codon-anticodon interaction. The reaction resembles the GTPase reaction with cognate aa-tRNAs and EFTu . GTP in its substrate requirements, in its involving EFTu . GTP . aa-tRNA ternary complexes, and in its requiring a free ribosomal A-site. The noncognate reaction differs from the cognate one in that aa-tRNA becomes stably bound to the ribosomes only 5% of the time; it therefore seems best characterized as an abortive enzymatic binding reaction. The rate of reaction is a significant fraction (4%) of that of the cognate aa-tRNA, indicating that recognition of ternary complexes by ribosomes involves a level of error greater than that of translation as a whole. The rejection of the noncognate aa-tRNA following GTP hydrolysis is therefore a vital step in the translation process and fulfills the criteria set for a proofreading reaction. Leu-tRNA Leu 2 which escapes rejection through proofreading, forms a stable complex with the ribosomal A-site, so it appears that the Leu-tRNA2 which was rejected never reached the A-site and that proofreading precedes full A-site binding."

https://openalex.org/W1573225149,"Calcium regulation of actin-activated porcine aortic myosin MgATPase was studied. The MgATPase of the purified actomyosin was stimulated about 10-fold by 0.1 mM Ca2+. The 20,000 molecular weight light chain subunit (LC20) of myosin was phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase that required Ca2+. Half-maximal activation of both kinase and ATPase occurred at about 0.9 microM Ca2+. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myosins, free of actin, kinase, and phosphatase, were purified by gel filtration. The MgATPase of phosphorylated myosin was activated by rabbit skeletal muscle actin; unphosphorylated myosin was actin activated to a much lesser extent. Actin activation was maximal in the presence of Ca2+. Regulation of the aortic myosin MgATPase seems to involve both direct interaction of calcium with phosphorylated myosin and calcium activation of the myosin kinase. The MgATPase of trypsin-treated actomyosin did not require Ca2+ for full activity. The trypsin-treated actomyosin was devoid of LC20. When purified unphosphorylated aortic myosin was treated with trypsin, the LC20, was cleaved and the MgATPase, which was not appreciably actin activated before exposure to protease, was increased and was activated by skeletal muscle actin. After incubation of this light chain-depleted myosin with light chain from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, the actin activation but not the increased activity, was abolished. Unphosphorylated LC20 seems to inhibit actin activation in this smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1544048330,"The rate of calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle was stimulated by inside-negative membrane potential generated by K+ gradients in the presence of valinomycin. The increase in the calcium transport rate was accompanied by a proportional increase in the rate of calcium-dependent ATP hydrolysis, without significant change in the steady state level of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. Changes in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane potential during calcium transport were monitored with the optical probe, 3,3‘-diethylthiadicarbocyanine. The decrease in the absorbance of 3,3‘-diethylthiadicarbocyanine at 660 nm following generation of inside-negative membrane potential was reversed during ATP-induced calcium uptake. These observations support an electrogenic mechanism for the transport of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum."

This material has immunological and chromatographic properties identical to those of synthetic cyclic somatostatin. The occurrence of somatostatin-like material in antidiuretic hormone-sensitive portions of the renal urinary system suggests a local regulatory or paracrine role for somatostatin.
https://openalex.org/W1481556476,"The protomeric form of purified acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase is inactivated by the binding of avidin to the biotinyl prosthetic group; the catalytically active filamentous form of the enzyme is resistant to avidin. This differential sensitivity to avidin was used to examine the influence of nutritional state on the proportion of polymeric and protomeric carboxylase occurring in avian liver. Hepatic carboxylase was 80% avidin-resistant (polymeric) in the fed chick. Food deprivation for 2 and 6 h reduced the avidin resistance to 54% and 30%, respectively. Similarly, within 1 h after fat intubation, the fraction of polymeric carboxylase had significantly decreased. Accompanying the change in carboxylase transformation was a comparable reduction in 3H2O incorporation into liver fatty acid. These data indicate that the protomer-polymer transition defined for purified acetyl-CoA carboxylase also occurs with the enzyme in vivo and that a lower polymer/protomer ratio is associated with reduced rates of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1508551098,"Although glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli is composed of 12 identical subunits, there is no evidence that homologous subunit interactions occur in fully unadenylylated or fully adenylylated enzyme. Meister and co-workers (Manning, J. M., Moore, S., Rowe, W. B., and Meister, A. (1969) Biochemistry 8, 2681-2685) have shown that L-methionine-S-sulfoximine, one of the four diastereomers of methionine sulfoximine, preferentially inhibits glutamine synthetase irreversibly in the presence of ATP, due to the formation of tightly bound products, ADP, and methionine sulfoximine phosphate. Using highly purified unadenylylated glutamine synthetase and the two resolved diastereomers of L-methionine-S,R-sulfoximine, we have studied both the kinetics of glutamine synthetase inactivation in the presence of excess methionine sulfoximine and ATP, and the binding of methionine sulfoximine to the enzyme. The results reveal that (a) the apparent first order rate constant of irreversible inactivation by the S isomer decreases progressively from the expected first order rate, indicating that an inactivated subunit retards the reactivity of its neighboring subunits toward methionine sulfoximine and ATP; (b) the R isomer does not inactivate glutamine synthetase irreversibly in the presence of ATP; however, the R isomer is capable of protecting the enzyme temporarily from the irreversible inhibition by the S isomer; and (c) the binding of the S isomer monitored by changes in protein fluorescence exhibits an apparent negative cooperative binding isotherm, whereas the R isomer yields an apparent positive cooperative pattern."

As previously shown (Shields, d. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 4074), a major polypeptide of 18,000 dalton, designated preprosomatostatin, was immunoprecipitable. Here, evidence is presented for an additional somatostatin-immunoreactive polypeptide of apparent Mr = 19,000. The 19 kilodalton polypeptide was similar, but not identical with the 18 kilodalton preprosomatostatin, as determined by tryptic peptide analysis. Comparison of the tryptic peptides of the 19,000 dalton polypeptide with those of unlabeled somatostatin demonstrated that it contained the authentic somatostatin sequence. Like the 18,000 dalton precursor, the 19,000 dalton polypeptide had the mature somatostatin sequence located at its COOH terminus; it is proposed that this molecule is a minor species of preprosomatostatin."

https://openalex.org/W275445690,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were shown to possess a class of tightly bound calcium ions, inaccessible to the chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at 0 degrees C or 25 degrees C, amounting to 4.5 nmol/mg of protein (approximately 0.5 mol/mol (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase). The calcium ionophores, A23187 and X537A, induced rapid exchange of tightly bound calcium in the presence of chelator. Chelator alone at 37 degrees C, caused irreversible loss of bound calcium, which correlated with uncoupling of transport from (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase activity. Uncoupling was not accompanied by increased permeability to [14C]inulin. Slow exchange of tightly bound calcium with medium calcium was unaffected by turnover of the ATPase or by tryptic cleavage into 55,000- and 45,000-dalton fragments. Binding studies with labeled calcium suggested that tight binding involves a two-step process: Ca2+ + E in equilibrium K E . Ca2+ leads to E < Ca2+ where E and < Ca2+ represent the ATPase and tightly bound calcium, and K = 1.6 X 10(3) M-1. It is suggested that tightly bound calcium is located in a hydrophobic pocket in, or in close proximity to the ATPase, and, together with tightly bound adenine nucleotides (Aderem, A., McIntosh, D. B., and Berman, M. C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 3622-03632), is related to the ability of the ATPase to couple hydrolysis of ATP to vectorial transfer of calcium across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1518533674,"Poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis and elongation factor G (EF-G)-dependent GTPase activity were used to study the partial reconstitution of L7/L12-deficient ribosomes with proteins L7/L12 and fluorescent conjugates. Seventy-five per cent of these activities are restored when unmodified L7/L12 dimer is added to L7/L12-deficient cores at a ratio of 1:1. Various covalent fluorescent conjugates of L7/L12 bind to these cores about as well as unmodified protein. A fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate derivative of L12 shows almost no functional activity when bound. However, mixed reconstitutes of this conjugate and unmodified L12 have 75% functional activity when half the protein is unmodified. These results can be explained by a model in which there are two independent binding sites on the ribosome for two dimers of L7/L12. The binding of dimers to ribosomes is totally random and complete; the particle is 100% active so long as it has one active dimer bound to either one of the two sites. However, more complex models cannot be ruled out. An 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) derivative of L7 is labeled semispecifically at the COOH terminus. This conjugate shows partial functional activity. When assay results are analyzed using the above model, it appears that the specific COOH-terminal modification has no effect on activity. However, all but a small fraction of the nonspecific IAEDANS modifications lead to inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1515713920,"The optical isomers of 3-amino-1-chloro-2-pentanone, which are the alpha-chloroketone analogs of L- and D-alpha-aminobutyrate, were synthesized and found to be highly potent irreversible inactivators of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. These chloroketones are 20 to 30 times more active than L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chlorpentanoate. L- and D-Glutamate, in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, protect the enzyme against inactivation. The enzyme is almost completely inhibited by cystamine under conditions in which 0.5 mol of this compound is bound/mol of enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with cystamne, which produces inhibition that is reversible by dithiothreitol, prevents the interaction of the new chloroketones, L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoate and methionine sulfoximine with the enzyme. The findings suggest that a sulfhydryl group at the active site interacts with the chloroketones and with cystamine and that the chloroketone inhibitors and cystamine bind to the enzyme as glutamine analogs. The data also suggest that a gamma-glutamyl-S-enzyme intermediate may be formed in the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1500109059,"The interaction of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase with the adenosine 5'-triphosphate analogue, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (5'-FSO2BzAdo), has been studied. This interaction results in the covalent attachment of the 5'-FSO2BzAdo to the enzyme with concomitant loss of catalytic activity. Although adenine nucleotides interact with glutamine synthetase at three distinct sites–a noncovalent AMP effector site, a regulatory site of covalent adenylylation, and the catalytic ATP/ADP binding site–our studies suggest that reaction with 5'-FSO2BzAdo occurs only at the active center. When glutamine synthetase was incubated with 5'-FSO2BzAdo, the decrease in catalytic activity obeyed pseudo-first order kinetics. The plot of the observed rate constant of inactivation versus the concentration of 5'-FSO2BzAdo was hyperbolic, consistent with reversible binding of the analogue to the enzyme prior to covalent attachment. Protection against inactivation was afforded by ATP and ADP; L-glutamate did not protect the enzyme against inactivation, but rather enhanced the rate of inactivation, consistent with the observations of others (Timmons, R. B., Rhee, S. G., Luterman, D. L., and Chock, P. B. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 4479-4485) that there is synergism in the binding of the two substrates to the enzyme. The incorporation of approximately 1.09 mol of the 5'-FSO2BzAdo/mol of glutamine synthetase subunit resulted in the total loss of enzymatic activity. The results suggest that 5'-FSO2BzAdo occupies the ATP binding site at the active center of glutamine synthetase and binds covalently to an amino acid residue nearby."
https://openalex.org/W1563745606,"The endoplasmic reticulum of adipocytes can accumulate calcium by an active transport system linked to (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity (Black, B. L., Jarett, L., and McDonald, J. M. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 596, 359-371). The ability of this transport system to regulate intracellular calcium levels was tested by incubating adipocytes with various concentrations of calcium and measuring the calcium transport activity in subsequently isolated endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (microsomes). The calcium transport system responded to changes in extracellular calcium concentration; 2.5 mM calcium elicited a transport rate 21 to 34% greater than that of microsomes from cells incubated in the absence of calcium. The stimulatory effect of extracellular calcium was maximum at 2.5 mM, was reduced in magnitude at higher calcium concentrations, was demonstrable after a cell incubation period as short as 5 min, and was maintained for an additional 60 min. The transport system also could be modulated by preincubating isolated microsomes in calcium-containing medium prior to assay of calcium transport. Preincubation with low calcium concentrations elicited a 22 to 33% stimulation of subsequent calcium uptake with half-maximal stimulation at 0.19 +/- 0.02 microM free calcium. Preincubation with high calcium (200 microM) resulted in a 28% inhibition of calcium uptake. The stimulatory effect required ATP during the preincubation period and was modulated by ATP in the 0.05 to 0.5 mM range. The stimulation was not due to changes in efflux of calcium or in affinity of the transport system for calcium. The (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity of a deoxycholate-treated microsomal preparation was increased under preincubation conditions identical with those eliciting stimulation of calcium uptake, suggesting that modulation of enzyme activity produced the stimulatory effect. The results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum plays a homeostatic role in control of intracellular calcium levels and suggest that the homeostatic response is mediated through interaction of the organelle with calcium and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1482573511,"Previous work (Maruta, H., Gadasi, H., Collins, J. H., and Korn, E. D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6292-6300) had shown that phosphorylation of the heavy chain of Acanthamoeba myosin IA is required for actin activation of its Mg2+-ATPase activity and that, like the phosphorylation site, the catalytic site and the actin binding site are also on the heavy chain. We now show that limited digestion of phosphorylated myosin IA by subtilisin allows separation of the catalytically active peptide fragment from the phosphorylated peptide without any significant loss of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. A proteolytic fragment with full actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity has also been isolated from subtilisin digests of nonphosphorylated myosin IA, which, before proteolysis, did not have actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. The simplest interpretation of these data is that, in its nonphosphorylated state, the phosphorylation site of Acanthamoeba myosin IA inhibits the catalytic site and that this inhibition can be reversed either by phosphorylation of the site or by proteolytically separating it from the catalytic site. Alternatively, phosphorylation and proteolysis may, by unrelated mechanisms, induce similar conformational changes in the myosin heavy chain that lead to activation of its actomyosin ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1578955036,"Rat liver regeneration is regulated by a humoral signal that includes insulin and a sustained elevation in glucagon. The intracellular response is characterized by a rise in cAMP as well as altered cGMP metabolism, i.e. increased particulate guanylate cyclase activity. To evaluate the role of hormones in the regulation of guanylate cyclase during liver regeneration, the enzyme activity of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was examined. Hepatocytes were maintained for 22 h in medium containing various combinations of insulin, glucagon, and cAMP. The cells were then harvested and homogenized and the guanylate cyclase activity was assessed in vitro. Hepatocytes maintained in 100 nM insulin exhibited a 42% (p < 0.001) increase in guanylate cyclase activity when compared to cells cultured in medium alone. Incubation with glucagon (100 nM) produced a 52% (p < 0.01) rise. In the presence of insulin (100 nM), culturing with as little as 5 nM glucagon resulted in increased activity, and 100 nM glucagon produced a 161% (p < 0.001) rise above cultures maintained in insulin alone. Thus, the combination of the two hormones produced an effect that was significantly (p < 0.01) greater than additive. Dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphoric acid were at least as effective as glucagon; the enzyme activity of cells maintained in 5 microM N6,02'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphoric acid and 100 nM insulin was 243% (p < 0.001) above those in insulin alone. The findings suggest that the activity of hepatocyte guanylate cyclase is regulated by a synergistic action of insulin and glucagon and that positive interactions between the two cyclic nucleotide second messenger systems exist."
https://openalex.org/W1498542285,"Abstract The reactivities of human plasma factor XIIIa toward iodoacetic acid and toward alpha-bromo-4-hydroxy-3-nitroacetophenone have been studied under conditions where this dimeric enzyme reacts with the reagents in half-of-the-sites fashion and under conditions where it reacts with the reagents in all-of-the-sites fashion. Direct measurements of alkylation of active site -- SH groups in the apparently identical subunits of the enzyme as functions of remaining catalytic activity are in agreement with the observed reactivities. In addition to extending earlier evidence for half-of-the-sites reactions in factor XIIIa (Chung, S. I., Lewis, M. S., and Folk, J. E. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 940-950), the present findings suggest that the all-of-the-sites reactivity results from a positively cooperative interaction between enzyme subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1529779168,"A new RNA-dependent ATPase has been isolated from yeast chromatin extracts and partially characterized. The protein has a sedimentation coefficient of about 7 S. The enzyme hydrolyzes specifically ATP (or dATP) to ADP (or dADP) and Pi in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions and requires a single-stranded polynucleotide as cofactor. The order of efficiency of synthetic polymers is poly(rU) > poly(rI) greater than or equal to poly(dU) > poly(rA) greater than or equal to poly(rC). Among natural polymers, single-stranded DNA and poly(rA)-containing mRNA from yeast are also active but less so than poly(rU). The enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 8 and is fully inhibited by 0.25 M NaCl. The Km for ATP is0.2 mM. The resemblance between this ATPase and DNA-dependent ATPases from other sources, as well as the termination factor rho, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1545031960,"Abstract The breakdown of guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) into GDP and PPi is catalyzed by a Mn2+-dependent 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase, the translation product of the spoT gene. The escherichia coli enzyme is normally found to be associated with the crude ribosome fraction. It is reported here that the guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 3'-diphosphate 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase activity in this fraction is activated by ATP in the presence of a relatively heat-stable, low molecular weight, supernatant factor (BS100). This stimulation is not due to a removal of reaction products such as by the phosphorylation of GDP to GTP or by the hydrolysis of PPi. Hydrolysis of ATP is probably required because neither adenosine 5'-(3-thio)triphosphate nor adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate can substitute for ATP. Levallorphan, a morphine analog, which had been shown to inhibit in vivo ppGpp degradation, inhibits specifically the stimulation of ppGpp hydrolysis by ATP and the supernatant factor. The possible relationship of this system and the in vivo energy-dependent control of ppGpp degradation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1622267604,"The unadenylylated, manganese form of glutamine synthetase (L-glutamate: ammonia ligase (ADP forming), EC 6.3.1.2 from Escherichia coli catalyzes a novel, AMP-dependent (reversible) synthesis of pyrophosphate and L-glutamate from orthophosphate and L-glutamine: Formula (See Text). The hydrolysis of the L-glutamine amide bond is coupled to the stoichiometric synthesis of pyrophosphate, although as PPi accumulates, additional hydrolysis of L-glutamine occurs in a secondary reaction catalyzed by the [manganese x enzyme x AMP x PPi] complex. The synthesis of PPi probably occurs at the subunit catalytic site in the positions normally occupied by the beta, gamma-phosphates of ATP. To promote PPi synthesis, AMP apparently binds to the subunit catalytic site rather than to the allosteric inhibitor site; equilibrium binding results suggest that Pi directs the binding of AMP to the active site. In this reaction, Mg2+ will not substitute for Mn2+, and adenylylated glutamine synthetase is inactive. Pyrophosphate is synthesized by the unadenylylated, manganese enzyme at approximately 2% of the rate of that of ATP in the reverse biosynthetic reaction. If P1 is replaced by arsenate, the enzymatic rate of the AMP-supported hydrolysis of L-glutamine is 100-fold faster than is PPi synthesis and is one-half the rate of the ADP-supported, irreversible arsenolysis of L-glutamine. This latter activity also is supported by GMP and IMP, suggesting that the catalytic site of glutamine synthetase has a rather broad specificity for the nucleotide base. The reactions supported by AMP directly relate to the mechanism of glutamine synthetase catalysis."
