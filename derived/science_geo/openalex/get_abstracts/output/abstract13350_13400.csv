It is suggested that these neurons supply oculomotor centers with the velocity command signals needed to support pursuit eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W2030719871,"Frog hearts stained with merocyanine 540 show a 1.5 to 2.0 percent increase in fluorescence intensity at 585 nanometers during the cardiac action potential when excited with a 540-nonometer light beam. Fluorometric action potentials similar to those recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in pacemaker, atrial, and ventricular tissues were recorded by focusing a 1-millimeter excitation beam on various regions of the heart. The signal-to-noise ratio for a single action potential ranged between 10/1 and 40/1. In spontaneously pacing hearts the slower rate of rise of the fluorescence action potential is due to the slow propagation of the electrical signal. In solutions containing normal calcium concentrations the fluorometric signal is altered by contractions. Merocyanine 540 is biologically inert as it stains the cardiac cell membrane and acts as a sensitive optical probe of the change in transmembrane potential."

In both cases the rejection process was restored by an intravenous injection of recipients with living peritoneal exudate cells (50 to 80 percent macrophages) syngeneic to the thyroid donor.

This factor was extracted from Rana pipiens eggs and assayed by microinjection in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The activity of this factor is Mg-dependent, Ca-sensitive, and associated with heat-labile protein. Centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient revealed that the factor exists in three different molecular sizes."

https://openalex.org/W2025374137,"Cells bearing the T-cell differentiation alloantigens TL and Thy-1 were enumerated in preparations of spleen and lymph node cells of nu/nu mice. Healthy nu/nu mice had few or no demonstrable TL+ or Thy-1+ cells whereas mice with viral hepatitis, including some born of nu/nu X nu/nu matings, had many. Healthy nu/nu mice were treated daily with the thymic hormone thymopoietin or with ubiquitin, polypeptides that induce the differentiation of TL+Thy-1"" cells from TL-Thy-1- precursors in vitro. After 14 days, 20 to 40 percent of their spleen cells were of the TL+Thy-1+ phenotype typical of thymocytes and 10 to 25 percent of their lymph node cells were TL-Thy-1+, typical of later T-cell differentiation. Similar frequencies of such cells were found in untreated nu/nu mice suffering from severe viral hepatitis. These data conform to the current view that prothymocytes are preprogrammed cells whose maturation to thymocytes, normally induced in the thymus by thymopoietin, can be triggered by other agents under abnormal circumstances. Tests of T-cell function were not included in this study."

https://openalex.org/W1999950046,"When observers are asked to rate the visual distinctness of borders formed by the junction of two photic stimuli, normal trichromatic subjects behave in a manner similar to that of tritanopes in a color mixture experiment. All stimuli that look the same to the tritanope produce the same border distinctness with any other stimulus. Sets of such stimuli, whose members do not form borders with each other, map as single points along a curved line, where the Euclidean distance between pairs of points representing the two stimuli is nearly proportional to the rated distinctness of the border formed between them. In the absence of luminance differences, the perception of contour apparently depends on the stimulation of only two cone types."

This purified glycoprotein has procoagulant, antigen, and von Willebrand factor activities. In three patients with a variant of the von Willebrand's disease syndrome, their factor VIII/von Willebrand factor protein was present in normal amounts and had normal procoagulant and antigen activities; however, this protein was deficient in both carbohydrate and von Willebrand factor activity. The carbohydrate portion of the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor glycoprotein is of major importance in its interactions with platelets or the blood vessel wall, or both."

https://openalex.org/W2066326118,"Three types of evidence are presented showing that the retention of cell water does not necessarily depend on the possession of an intact cell membrane. The data agree with the concept that water retention in cells is due to multilayer adsorption on proteins and that the maintenance of the normal state of water relies on the presence of adenosine triphosphate as a cardinal adsorbent, controlling the protein conformations."

https://openalex.org/W1668775808,"An in vitro study of the liver 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D2 and the kidney 1- and 24-hydroxylations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 was undertaken in order to determine whether the discrimination against vitamin D2 seen in chicks in vivo is the result of a block of one or more of the steps in the activation of the vitamin D2 molecule. Vitamin D2 hydroxylation reactions in the chick are virtually identical with those observed with the vitamin D3 series. It is, therefore, concluded that the chick possesses the required enzymatic machinery to synthesize 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 and that the discrimination must be because of some unknown metabolic reaction of the vitamin D2 compounds, to a defect in the transport of vitamin D2 metabolites, or to target organ discrimination."

https://openalex.org/W2039556404,"THE nuclear and cytoplasmic concentrations of solutes in cells are often unequal. This has been observed for ions1,2, small molecules3–5, and for macromolecules6–10. The role of maintaining these concentration differentials is commonly assigned to the nuclear envelope, but this practice is predicated on a questionable analogy with the plasma membrane. Most of the information derived from tracer kinetics4,8,9 and electrical resistance10–13 indicates that the nuclear envelope is too permeable to distinguish or differentially transport small solutes. Thus, we must look to other, presumably equilibrium, mechanisms to account for many nucleocytoplasmic solute asymmetries. One useful step in the analysis of solute distributions between two phases is to establish a reference phase to which the concentrations of substances in the other two phases can be compared. A suitable reference phase for cytoplasm and nucleus cannot, of course, be separated from them by the cell membrane, which itself has complex, asymmetric transport properties. Thus, the reference phase must be intracellular. We have carried out experiments in which a defined aqueous reference phase (a gelatin gel) was introduced into the cytoplasm, and the partition of solutes between this phase, cytoplasm, and nucleus was determined. We deal here with the intracellular distribution of 3H-sucrose—a small, non-metabolised substance which reaches a greater concentration in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm4."

https://openalex.org/W2000471764,"The effect of trace metals on plasma alpha1-antitrypsin was studied in vitro by adding known concentrations of trace metals, either alone or in combination, to plasma. Cadmium was the only trace metal that reduced the concentration of alpha1-antitrypsin and depressed the trypsin inhibitory capacity. No such effects were found with divalent lead, mercury, nickel, iron, and zinc ions. The present study appears to offer a plausible explanation for the emphysema that occurs in industrial workers exposed to cadmium."

https://openalex.org/W1572878362,"A nucleoside phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleosides to nucleotides by low energy phosphate esters, has been isolated and purified 500-fold from the membrane fraction of Erwinia herbicola. Its most noteworthy difference from other enzymes of this class is that it is membrane bound and can be isolated and handled only in the presence of a detergent. With a ribonucleoside acceptor, adenosine, the reaction product is exclusively 5'-AMP; with deoxyadenosine, 5'- and 3'-nucleotide products appear in the approximate ratio of 2:1, respectively. The enzyme has no detectable phosphatase activity with the best phosphate donors, 5'-dAMP and 5'-dTMP, and very little with less active donors, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate. This phosphotransferase should be a useful agent for preparing 5'-nucleotides from unusual synthetic bases."

https://openalex.org/W1519359272,"125I-labeled deoxyuridine (IdUrd) has been used to estimate the turnover of DNA in liver, tail, and hind limb during spontaneous and triiodothyronine-induced metamorphosis. It was found that the total amount of liver DNA remained constant and there was no significant loss of the label from the liver DNA, which would be expected if there was an increase in DNA turnover during metamorphosis. Also, the change in specific activity of liver DNA parallels that of tail DNA during spontaneous metamorphosis. These data suggest that metamorphic transitions in the tadpole liver do not involve significant changes in DNA turnover. It was observed that the incorporation of label into hind limb DNA showed a high variability among individual animals as compared to liver and tail tissue. The data presented suggest that the observed variability is not a random phenomenon but related directly to the rate at which animals will metamorphose."

https://openalex.org/W1580667708,"Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is an adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ethanolamine and propanolamine to ammonia and the corresponding aldehydes. A mechanism has been proposed for this and other adenosylcobalamin-dependent reactions which involves cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of the cofactor followed by abstraction of a substrate hydrogen atom by the adenosyl fragment to form 5'-deoxyadenosine. In support of this proposal, a previous study demonstrated that the deamination of propanolamine by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is accompanied by the reversible cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of the cofactor, with the production of 5'-deoxyadenosine (Babior, B.M., Carty, T.J., and Abeles, R.H. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1689-1695). The present study is concerned with the origin of the third hydrogen atom on the methyl group of the 5'-deoxyadenosine produced in that reaction. The 5'-deoxyadenosine isolated from an incubation mixture initially containing enzyme, [5',5'-D2]adenosylcobalamin, and [1,1-D2]propanolamine was chemically degraded so that the 4' and 5' carbon atoms were, respectively, converted to the carbonyl and methyl carbons of acetaldehyde. Analysis of the p-nitrophenylhydrazone of the acetaldehyde by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy revealed 3 deuterium atoms/molecule, indicating that two of the methyl hydrogens originated from adenosylcobalamin and the third was donated by substrate. This observation provides further support for the participation of 5'-deoxyadenosine in the mechanism of adenosylcobalamin-dependent reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1534408678,"Abstract The adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme ethanolamine ammonia-lyase contains two active sites per molecule. The effects of methylcobalamin on the properties of this enzyme differ qualitatively depending on whether one or both of these sites is occupied by the cobamide. At 0.5 mol of methylcobalamin/mol of active sites, catalytic activity fell rapidly to approximately 30% of control levels, thereafter remaining constant for an hour. With the partially inhibited enzyme, Km values for ethanolamine and adenosylcobalamin were 5.5 muM and 1.6 muM, respectively, values that do not differ significantly from those of uninhibited enzyme. When the methylcobalamin per active site ratio was increased to 1, the decline in activity became progressive with time, eventually falling to levels much lower than seen at a cobamide per active site ratio of 0.5. Methylcobalamin also promotes the formation of a complex stable to gel filtration between ethanolamine and enzyme. Complex formation increased with increasing methylcobalamin per active site ratios up to a ratio of 0.7/1, at which point 0.5 mol of ethanol/mol of active sites was taken up. Ethanolamine uptake did not increase at higher methylcobalamin to active sites ratios. Methylcobalamin itself was taken up by enzyme, forming a complex containing 0.5 mol of methylcobalamin/mol of active sites that was stable to gel filtration. Measurement by the technique of Hummel and Dreyer ((1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 63, 530-532), however, showed one methylcobalamin binding site per active site. The formation of enzyme-ligand complexes stable to gel filtration was not affected by 5'-deoxyadenosine nor did 5'-deoxyadenosine by itself promote the formation of a stable complex between enzyme and ethanolamine. These observations were interpreted as evidence indicating half-site reactivity of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase with methylcobalamin. Comparison with previous results suggested that this half-site reactivity was an epiphenomenon not related to catalysis."
