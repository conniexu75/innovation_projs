https://openalex.org/W2122438668,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized as an important signaling molecule in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Recently, H2S donors were reported to induce neutrophil apoptosis and to suppress expression of some leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules. Using rats, we examined the possibility that H2S is an endogenous regulator of key inflammatory events at the leukocyte-endothelial interface. Via intravital microscopy, we observed that H2S donors (NaHS and Na2S) inhibited aspirin-induced leukocyte adherence in mesenteric venules (ED50 of 5.0 micromol/kg for Na2S), likely via activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels. Inhibition of endogenous H2S synthesis elicited leukocyte adherence. Leukocyte infiltration in an air pouch model was also suppressed by H2S donors (NaHS, Lawesson's reagent, and N-acetylcysteine; ED50 of 42.7, 1.3, and 29.9 micromol/kg, respectively) and exacerbated by inhibition of endogenous H2S synthesis. Carrageenan-induced paw edema was suppressed by H2S donors (NaHS and Na2S; ED50s of 35 and 28 micromol/kg, respectively) to the same extent as by diclofenac and enhanced by an inhibitor of H2S synthesis. Suppression of edema formation by H2S donors was mimicked by a K(ATP) channel agonist and reversed by an antagonist of this channel. These results suggest that endogenous H2S is an important mediator of acute inflammation, acting at the leukocyte-endothelium interface. These findings have important implications for anti-inflammatory drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2026136832,"PCSK9 is the ninth member of the proprotein convertase (PC) family. Some of its natural mutations have been genetically associated with the development of a dominant form of familial hyper- or hypocholesterolemia. The exact mechanism of action of PCSK9 is not clear, although it is known to enhance the intracellular degradation of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in acidic compartments, likely the endosomes/lysosomes. We analyzed the post-translational modifications of PCSK9 and show that it is sulfated within its prosegment at Tyr38. We also examined the susceptibility of PCSK9 to proteolytic cleavage by the other members of the PC family. The data show that the natural gain-of-function mutations R218S, F216L, and D374Y associated with hypercholesterolemia result in total or partial loss of furin/PC5/6A processing at the motif RFHR218↓. In contrast, the loss-of-function mutations A443T and C679X lead either to the lack of trans-Golgi network/recycling endosome localization and an enhanced susceptibility to furin cleavage (A443T) or to the inability of PCSK9 to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (C679X). Furthermore, we report the presence of both native and furin-like cleaved forms of PCSK9 in circulating human plasma. Thus, we propose that PCSK9 levels are finely regulated by the basic amino acid convertases furin and PC5/6A. The latter may reduce the lifetime of this proteinase and its ability to degrade the cell-surface LDL receptor, thereby regulating the levels of circulating LDL cholesterol.

The mammalian genome data base predicts the presence of 500–600 proteinase genes that cover all the potential enzymatic cleavages of a given species at all developmental stages. Of these, the most abundant serine proteinases represent about one-third of all five proteinase classes (1Puente X.S. Sanchez L.M. Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar).

The mammalian PC family comprises nine members: PC1/3, PC2, furin, PC4, PACE4, PC5/6, PC7, SKI-1 (subtilisin/kexin isozyme-1)/S1P (site 1 protease), and PCSK9/NARC-1 (2Seidah N.G. Chretien M.

This led to the identification of the PCSK9 gene as the third chromosomal locus associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia, with the LDLR and apoB comprising the other two loci (15Abifadel M. Varret M. Rabes J.P. Allard D. Ouguerram K. Devillers M. Cruaud C. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Erlich D. Derre A. Villeger L. Farnier M. Beucler I. Bruckert E. Chambaz J. Chanu B. Lecerf J.M. Luc G.

Seidah N.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 290-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was thus hypothesized that high levels of active PCSK9 are associated with a faster rate of degradation of the cell-surface LDLR, resulting in increased amounts of circulating LDL cholesterol, as the uptake of the latter in liver hepatocytes by the LDLR will be diminished accordingly and vice versa. Thus, the level of cell-surface LDLR is indirectly proportional to the level of PCSK9 in the liver and presumably small intestine. This hypothesis is reinforced by the in vivo observations that, in mice lacking a functional Pcsk9 gene (Pcsk9 knockout mice), the level of hepatocyte cell-surface LDLR is greatly enhanced, resulting in an ∼50% drop in total circulating cholesterol (24Rashid S.

Quantitation was performed on a Storm imager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant Version 5.2 software.Protein Solubilization, Western Blotting, and Immunodetection—Cells in 35-mm plates were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed, incubated for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with proteinase inhibitors on ice, and homogenized, and the lysates were clarified (32Yoshimura A. Yoshida T. Seguchi T. Waki M. Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13299-13308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was assayed with Bradford reagent. Fifty micrograms of proteins (or 10 μl of medium) were analyzed on 8% Tricine gels, followed by Western blotting for LDLR (160 kDa), α-actin (42 kDa), and PCSK9-V5. The membranes were successively incubated with primary antibodies (anti-human LDLR-(184–196), 1:2000; anti-V5-horse radish peroxidase and anti-α-actin, 1:5000; and Ab1-hPC9, 1:3000) and an appropriate secondary antibody if required and revealed using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). For experiments with human plasma, 30 μl of the latter were immunoprecipitated with Ab1-hPC9 (1:200) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% glycine gels. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, PCSK9 was detected with the same antibody (1:3000), followed by rabbit TrueBlot (eBioscience) as a secondary antibody. Affinity removal of IgGs and albumin from plasma was performed using a ProteoSeek removal kit (Pierce).Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HuH7 cells were seeded on chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected the following day. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5% normal goat serum containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer), followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-V5 mAb (1:1000), rabbit anti-V5 pAb (1:1000) (Sigma), or Ab1-hPC9 in blocking buffer with or without the endosomal marker antibody (anti-MPR300, Abcam). The cells were then incubated for 60 min with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) and mounted in glycerol and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). Immunofluorescence analyses were performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Version 9.0).RESULTSPost-translational Modifications of PCSK9, trans-Golgi Network (TGN)/Recycling Endosome Localization, and Activity toward the LDLR—One of the major aims of this work was to unravel the mechanism(s) behind the gain- or loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 (23Attie A.D. Seidah N.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 290-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first concentrated on the post-translational modifications of PCSK9 and their relationship to the ability of PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of the LDLR. We had reported previously that human PCSK9 is N-glycosylated at Asn533 (4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and Tyr-sulfated at an unspecified site(s) (7Benjannet S. Rhainds D. Essalmani R. Mayne J. Wickham L. Jin W. Asselin M.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48865-48875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We now present data on the exact sites of these modifications. Biosynthetic labeling of HEK293 cells overexpressing human PCSK9 using Na2 35SO4 revealed that two Tyr sulfation sites exist, a major one in the prosegment and a minor one in the catalytic subunit (Fig. 1A). In agreement, treatment of the cells with tunicamycin, which inhibits N-glycosylation, or using the unglycosylated N533Q mutant (4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B.

A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) did not affect such labeling compared with sodium chlorate, which completely inhibited it (Fig. 1A). Thus, sulfation does not occur on the carbohydrate chain within the catalytic subunit. Interestingly, the calcium ionophore A23187, which depletes luminal calcium but does not affect the processing or secretion of PCSK9 (7Benjannet S. Rhainds D. Essalmani R. Mayne J. Wickham L. Jin W. Asselin M.C. Hamelin J. Varret M. Allard D. Trillard M. Abifadel M. Tebon A. Attie A.D. Rader D.J. Boileau C. Brissette L. Chretien M. Prat A. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48865-48875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), markedly diminished Tyr sulfation, suggesting that the Golgi-associated sulfotransferase(s) is calcium-dependent. Finally, our data show that Tyr38 is the sulfated amino acid in the prosegment because the Y38F mutant is no longer sulfated and yet the catalytic subunit still is (Fig. 1A). We believe that Tyr sulfation is not an artifact of overexpression of PCSK9 because we could detect sulfated PCSK9 endogenously in HepG2 cells and in the furin-negative LoVo-C5 cells using Ab1-hPC9 (an in-house pAb directed against human pro-PCSK9 (aa 31–454)) (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1Post-translational sulfation of secreted PCSK9 influences its sorting index. HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with cDNA encoding V5-tagged WT PCSK9 or the Y38F tyrosine sulfation or N533Q N-glycosylation mutant. Forty hours post-transfection, the cells were pulsed with Na2 35SO4 for 2 h or with [35S]Met/Cys for 3 h in the presence of NaClO3 (30 mm), tunicamycin (Tun; 5 μg/ml), or the ionophore A23187 (2 μm) as indicated. Cell media were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 mAb (A and C) or in-house Ab1-hPC9 (C) and analyzed on 8% Tricine gels. A, the PCSK9 Y38F mutant prevented sulfation of the prosegment, which was also blocked by NaClO3 treatment, but not by inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin. CTL, control. B, Ab1-hPC9 was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous PCSK9 in HepG2 and furin-negative LoVo-C5 cell culture media. PI, preimmune rabbit serum. C, inhibition of sulfation did not impair PCSK9 secretion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)What would be the function of Tyr sulfation and Asn glycosylation? Removal of Tyr sulfation or Asn glycosylation by chlorate or tunicamycin treatment, respectively, or using the N533Q mutant revealed no effect on the processing or secretion of PCSK9 (Fig. 1, A and C). We next tested whether sulfation or glycosylation alters the ability of PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of the endogenous LDLR found in the human hepatocyte cell line HuH7. Transient expression of wild-type (WT) PCSK9 or its sulfation (Y38F and Y38E), glycosylation (N533Q), or double (Y38F/N533Q) mutants did not substantially alter the ability of PCSK9 to enhance the degradation of the endogenous LDLR (∼70–80% loss of total LDLR immunoreactivity as quantified by Storm imaging, representative of three independent experiments) (Fig. 2), suggesting that, in HuH7 cells endogenously expressing substantial amounts of LDLR, these modifications are not critical for overexpressed PCSK9 activity in this receptor.FIGURE 2PCSK9 post-translational modification mutants retain activity toward the LDLR. HuH7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding V5-tagged WT PCSK9, the sulfation mutants Y38F and Y38E, the glycosylation mutant N533Q, the double mutant Y38F/N533Q (Y,N-F,Q), or the catalytically inactive mutant H226A. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were lysed, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% glycine gels. Immunoblo"
https://openalex.org/W2046232891,"We previously identified SIRT2, an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent tubulin deacetylase, as a protein downregulated in gliomas and glioma cell lines, which are characterized by aneuploidy. Other studies reported SIRT2 to be involved in mitotic progression in the normal cell cycle. We herein investigated whether SIRT2 functions in the mitotic checkpoint in response to mitotic stress caused by microtubule poisons. By monitoring chromosome condensation, the exogenously expressed SIRT2 was found to block the entry to chromosome condensation and subsequent hyperploid cell formation in glioma cell lines with a persistence of the cyclin B/cdc2 activity in response to mitotic stress. SIRT2 is thus a novel mitotic checkpoint protein that functions in the early metaphase to prevent chromosomal instability (CIN), characteristics previously reported for the CHFR protein. We further found that histone deacetylation, but not the aberrant DNA methylation of SIRT2 5′untranslated region is involved in the downregulation of SIRT2. Although SIRT2 is normally exclusively located in the cytoplasm, the rapid accumulation of SIRT2 in the nucleus was observed after treatment with a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B and ionizing radiation in normal human fibroblasts, suggesting that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling regulates the SIRT2 function. Collectively, our results suggest that the further study of SIRT2 may thus provide new insights into the relationships among CIN, epigenetic regulation and tumorigenesis."

This KATP channel-dependent pathway has been suggested to be especially important for the acute first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).

Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, is highly active in β-cells and accounts for ∼40–50% of pyruvate entry into mitochondrial metabolism at stimulatory glucose concentrations (14Khan A.

The high PC activity in β-cells is remarkable in light of the absence of gluconeogenesis (18MacDonald M.J. McKenzie D.I. Walker T.M. Kaysen J.H. Horm. Metab.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in these cells. Furthermore, it has been estimated that only 25% of the glucose-derived carbons entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle via PC are channeled into protein synthesis (17Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S.

These findings suggest that PC-catalyzed entry of metabolites into mitochondrial metabolic pathways (anaplerosis) may play other roles in β-cell function. Previously, we examined glucose flux in a set of INS-derived cell lines with varying capacities for GSIS. These studies demonstrated a critical link between PC-mediated pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (“pyruvate cycling”) and GSIS (15Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C.

Moreover, in lipid-cultured cells, the normal glucose-induced increment in pyruvate cycling is diminished in concert with inhibition of GSIS (21Boucher A. Lu D. Burgess S.C. Telemaque-Potts S.

The 13C NMR-based isotopomer analysis used in these studies quantifies flux through the combined carboxylation (PC) and decarboxylation (malic enzyme (ME)) reactions associated with pyruvate cycling but does not precisely identify the pathways that contribute to this cycle. Pyruvate cycling can occur via the “pyruvate/malate cycle” involving PC-catalyzed conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, reduction of oxaloacetate to malate, and decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate via the NADP-dependent cytosolic malic enzyme (MEc) or NAD-dependent mitochondrial malic enzyme (MEm). Alternatively, pyruvate cycling can take place via the “pyruvate/citrate” or “pyruvate/isocitrate” cycles, wherein the first and last steps are the same as in the pyruvate/malate cycle, but oxaloacetate formed in the PC reaction is converted to citrate or isocitrate, which then leave the mitochondria, after which malate is regenerated via cytosolic aconitase, citrate lyase, and malate dehydrogenase reactions. Furthermore, cytosolic isocitrate can be oxidized to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) via the cytosolic, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc), opening the possibility for a pyruvate cycling pathway involving re-entry of αKG into the mitochondria and reconversion to malate via enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Interestingly, a predicted by-product of all of these pyruvate cycling pathways is NADPH, produced via MEc- or ICDc-catalyzed reactions. In this study, we continue our investigation of the role of pyruvate cycling in the control of GSIS, and we specifically examine the potential involvement of ICDc in this process. We show that whole cell NADPH levels are closely correlated to insulin secretion when INS-1-derived 832/13 cells are stimulated with increasing concentrations of glucose. We also demonstrate that suppression of ICDc activity by adenovirus-mediated expression of ICDc-specific siRNAs strongly impairs GSIS in two INS-1-derived cell lines and primary rat islets, without affecting glycolytic flux or glucose oxidation in these cells. Moreover, suppression of ICDc impairs the glucose-induced increment in pyruvate cycling flux and NADPH levels and results in increases in lactate production in both INS-1-derived cell lines and primary islets, consistent with suppressed pyruvate cycling. Based on these observations, we propose that a pyruvate cycling pathway involving ICDc contributes to regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. Reagents—All reagents and solutions were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Lines—Two clonal cell lines, 832/3 and 832/13, were derived from parental INS-1-cells (22Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) via a transfection-selection strategy (23Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and exhibit robust GSIS. Cells were cultured as described previously (23Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). siRNA Duplex-mediated Gene Suppression—Expression of rat ICDc was suppressed by introducing siRNA duplexes (IDT, Coralville, IA) into 832/13 cells using the Amaxa nucleofection system (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 2 μg per 3 million cells using program 20 with T solution. siRNA duplexes were targeted to 19-bp regions of the rat ICDc cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_031510), beginning at nucleotides 290, 552, 600, 654, and 1100 relative to the start codon. A duplex with no known target (GAG ACC CTA TCC GTG ATT A) was used as control (siControl). Following nucleofection, cells were cultured for 72 h in 24-well plates prior to analysis of GSIS and ICDc mRNA levels. Recombinant Adenovirus Construction—Adenoviruses containing siRNA sequences specific for ICDc (Ad-siICDc) or a sequence with no known gene homology as described above (Ad-siControl) were constructed using vectors EH006 and pJM17 as described recently (24Bain J.R. Schisler J.C. Takeuchi K. Newgard C.B. Becker T.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Schisler J.C. Jensen P.B. Taylor D.G. Becker T.C. Knop F.K. Takekawa S.

The ICDc siRNA target sequence was GTA TGA TGG ACG CTT CAA AGA (same sequence as the 654 siRNA duplex). Viruses were purified using a BD Biosciences Adeno-X purification kit (Clontech), and virus titer was calculated by end point dilution assay according to manufacturer's guidelines. Adenovirus-mediated Gene Manipulation—For cell fractionation, organic acid profiling, GSIS, NMR, and oxygen consumption studies, insulinoma cells were cultured in 15-cm dishes. For NADPH assays, cells were cultured in 6-well plates. For glucose usage, glucose oxidation, and glucose incorporation into fatty acids, cells were cultured in 12-well plates. After reaching 30% confluency, cells were transduced with a viral dose of 60 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h and subsequently cultured for 72 h. The media were changed every 24 h. Real Time PCR—RNA was isolated from islets and cells using the Qiagen RNeasy micro and mini kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), respectively, and reverse-transcribed with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Real time PCR analysis of ICDc mRNA levels was performed by using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) and 900 nm of primers AAA ATA TCC CCC GGC TAG TGA (sense) and TCA TCA TTG GCC GAC ACG (antisense); prevalidated primers and probes against 18 S RNA were included as controls (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Measurements were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Cell Fractionation and Immunoblot Analysis—Virus-treated cells were rinsed in cold PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet (∼80 million cells) was resuspended in 1.0 ml of cold MSH buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 5 mm potassium/HEPES and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. Following a 10-min, 2700 × g centrifugation, the pellet was washed and rehomogenized in 400 μl of MSH. Supernatants from the homogenizations were pooled, and 50 μl was removed as a total cell lysate sample. Supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet fractions of this centrifugation step constituted the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. The total cell lysate, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were resolved on a 10% BisTris NuPAGE NOVEX gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were incubated with anti-ICD antibody (26Minich T. Yokota S. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibody treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:15,000 dilution. As a cytosolic fraction marker, the blots were reprobed with anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a 1:4,000 dilution, followed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a 1:20,000 dilution. As a mitochondrial fraction marker, the blots were also treated with anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV antibody (Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) at a 1:10,000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a 1:30,000 dilution. Membranes were washed for at least 30 min in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) between antibody treatments. ICD Enzyme Activity—ICD enzyme activity was measured in the total cell lysate, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions prepared as described above. For each reaction, 10 μl of total cell lysate, mitochondrial, or cytosolic fractions was added to 180 μl of 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm NADP, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. ICD activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following NADPH formation at 340 nm, before and after addition of 1.5 mm isocitrate, in a total volume of 210 μl and normalized to protein concentration. 13C NMR Mass Isotopomer Analysis and GSIS—For GSIS assays, cells were preincubated in secretion buffer (114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) containing 3 mm glucose for 1 h followed by incubation in secretion buffer containing 3 or 12 mm U-13C-labeled glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) for 4 h. Samples of assay buffer were removed for insulin radioimmunoassay with the Coat-A-Count kit (DPC, Los Angeles, CA). Insulin content was measured as described previously (20Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W.

For NMR isotopomer analysis, cells were washed once with cold PBS and extracted with cold 3.5% perchloric acid. Extracts from three dishes per condition were pooled, neutralized, and lyophilized. The extract was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2H2O for measurement of pyruvate cycling activity relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux by 13C NMR as described previously (15Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P.

Following incubation for 1 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 8 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.05 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen), islets were left untreated or transduced with either Ad-siControl or Ad-siICDc for 16 h at 2,000 plaque-forming units/islet. Islets were cultured for 72 h with media changes every 24 h, and GSIS was measured with 20 islets for each condition. Islets were preincubated in 500 μl of secretion buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose for 1 h and then incubated in 500 μl of secretion buffer containing either 2.8 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose for 2 h, with or without addition of 40 mm KCl. Islet DNA was harvested by addition of buffer containing 75% ethanol, 23.5% water, and 1.5% 6 n HCl. Samples were concentrated using a Savant SpeedVac SC110 (GMI, Ramsey, MN) and reconstituted with 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer, and DNA content was estimated by measurement absorbance of the solution at 260 nm. Islet Lactate Assay—Islets treated with Ad-siControl or Ad-siICDc as described above were divided into groups of 30 and cultured in 500 μl of media containing 16.7 mm glucose for 16 h. For each reaction, 40 μl of media or of lactate standards (0–10 mm; Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) from each group was combined with 200 μl of lactate assay reagent containing 175 mm hydrazine, 68 mm glycine, 11.3 mm NAD, and 2.9 mm EDTA. Lactate content was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring NADH formation at 340 nm, before and 1 h after addition of 10 μl of 500 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. NADPH Assay—NADP and NADPH were measured with a previously described procedure (29Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 85-97Crossref Google Scholar), with modifications (20Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S. Lu D. Ronnebaum S.M. Odegaard M. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D.

Glycolytic Flux, Glucose Oxidation, and Glucose Incorporation into Lipids—832/13 cells were treated as described for NADPH studies, except that 5-3H-labeled glucose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the secretion buffer at a specific activity of 0.02 Ci/mol to allow assay of glycolytic flux as described previously (30Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of glucose oxidation, 832/13 cells were treated as described above, except that U-14C-labeled glucose (Amersham Biosciences) was included as tracer at a specific activity 0.5 Ci/mol as described previously (31Kim J.Y.

Cells from these plates were used for measurements of U-14C-labeled glucose incorporation into lipids. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and processed by organic extraction as described previously (11Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Measurement of Organic Acids by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)—For quantitative analysis of organic acids, cells were incubated for 2 h in secretion buffer containing 3 mm glucose followed by 2 h of incubation at either 3 or 12 mm glucose. Subsequently, cells were washed in 30 ml of ice-cold PBS, lysed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m HCl, and subjected to GC/MS analysis as described previously (20Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W. Ilkayeva O.

Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by two-sample equal variance Student's t test for all assays. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Cellular NADPH Levels Correlate with GSIS—An enzymatic cycling assay was employed to quantify NADPH and NADP in whole cell extracts. Cells were incubated with a range of 3–20 mm glucose, and insulin secretion, NADPH, and NADP was measured for each condition. Fig. 1 demonstrates that increases in glucose concentration over this range caused proportional increases in insulin secretion and NADPH:NADP ratio in 832/13 cells, consistent with a recent study in MIN6 cells and primary rat islets (32Ivarsson R. Quintens R. Dejonghe S. Tsukamoto K. In't Veld P. Renstrom E. Schuit F.C. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ICDc Suppression Impairs GSIS—Three genetically distinct ICD isoforms are expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells (3MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Brown L.J. Hasan N.M. Buss J.D. Kendrick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1-E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). First, β-cells contain the mitochondrial NAD-dependent ICD (EC 1.1.1.41), which participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The additional two enzymes are NADP-dependent (EC 1.1.1.42) and are localized in cytosolic (ICDc) and mitochondrial compartments (ICDm), respectively. We treated 832/13 cells with five siRNA duplexes targeting ICDc mRNA, and we measured the extent of suppression of ICDc mRNA levels by real time PCR as well as the effect on GSIS. As shown in Fig. 2, duplexes 290 and 1100 decreased ICDc expression by 66 ± 6% and 28 ± 10%, respectively, and had no significant effect on insulin secretion at 12 mm glucose compared with cells treated with a control siRNA with no known target. In contrast, duplexes 552, 600, and 654 all decreased ICDc expression by more than 80%, and all significantly reduced insulin secretion at 12 mm glucose (p < 0.03). Because duplex 654 caused the most pronounced reduction in ICDc mRNA levels (92 ± 4%), this siRNA was cloned into an adenovirus (Ad-siICDc) for use in all subsequent experiments. Cells exposed to the nucleofection procedure in the absence of any siRNA demonstrated similar GSIS and ICDc RNA levels to cells treated with the control siRNA duplex (data not shown). ICDc Is Effectively Silenced by a Recombinant Adenovirus Containing an ICDc-specific siRNA—As shown in Fig. 3A, cells treated with Ad-siICDc exhibited a 78 ± 5% reduction in ICDc mRNA compared with cells treated with Ad-siControl. ICDm mRNA levels were unchanged in Ad-siICDc-treated cells (data not shown). The decrease in ICDc mRNA in response to Ad-siICDc treatment was accompanied by a 39 ± 9% decrease in NADP-dependent ICD activity in the cytosolic fraction and no significant change in activity in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3B). Moreover, immunoblot analysis of fractionated cell lysates using an antibody that detects both ICDc and ICDm demonstrated 40 ± 14% and 60 ± 12% decreases in ICD immunoreactivity in the total extract and cytosolic fractions, respectively, with no change in ICD protein level in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3C shows a representative blot from among four used for quantitative analysis). The relative enrichment of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions is indicated by the low levels of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c oxidase IV and the cytosolic marker GAPDH in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, respectively. Similar suppression of ICD mRNA, protein, and activity levels were observed in an independent robustly glucose responsive cell line, 832/3 (23Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 25Schisler J.C. Jensen P.B. Taylor D.G. Becker T.C. Knop F.K. Takekawa S. German M. Weir G.C. Lu D. Mirmira R.G. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7297-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), in response to Ad-siICDc treatment (data not shown). In sum, these data demonstrate effective silencing of ICDc mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in Ad-siICDc-treated cells. The lesser decrease in NADP-dependent ICD enzyme activity compared with ICDc mRNA or protein levels is probably because of some contaminating ICDm activity in the extract fractions. siRNA Adenovirus-mediated Suppression of ICDc Impairs GSIS in INS-1-derived Cell Lines and Primary Rat Islets—AdsiControl-treated 832/13 cells exhibited an 11.1 ± 2.1-fold increase in insulin secretion as glucose was raised from 3 to 12 mm. In contrast, Ad-siICDc treatment caused a 59 ± 7% decrease in insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose concentrations (p < 0.005), accompanied by a 2.6 ± 0.5-fold increase in basal insulin secretion (p < 0.005, Fig. 4A). Thus, Ad-siICDc treatment reduced GSIS to a 1.8 ± 0.2-fold response. Similar experiments in an independent INS-1-derived cell line, 832/3, resulted in a decline from a 9.7 ± 2.7-fold response in AdsiControl-treated cells to a 3.9 ± 0.9-fold response in Ad-siICDc-treated cells (data not shown).

Normally, the accumulation of β-amyloid is prevented in part by the activities of several degradative enzymes, including the endothelin-converting enzymes, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and plasmin. Recent reports indicate that another metalloprotease, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), can degrade β-amyloid in vitro and in cellular overexpression experiments. In addition, ACE gene variants are linked to AD risk in several populations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme function as vasopeptidases and are the targets of drugs designed to treat cardiovascular disorders, and ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed. We investigated the potential physiological role of ACE in regulating endogenous brain β-amyloid levels for two reasons: first, to determine whether β-amyloid degradation might be the mechanism by which ACE is associated with AD, and second, to determine whether ACE inhibitor drugs might block β-amyloid degradation in the brain and potentially increase the risk for AD. We analyzed β-amyloid accumulation in brains from ACE-deficient mice and in mice treated with ACE inhibitors and found that ACE deficiency did not alter steady-state β-amyloid concentration. In contrast, β-amyloid levels are significantly elevated in endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin knock-out mice, and inhibitors of these enzymes cause a rapid increase in β-amyloid concentration in the brain. The results of these studies do not support a physiological role for ACE in the degradation of β-amyloid in the brain but confirm roles for endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin and indicate that reductions in these enzymes result in additive increases in brain amyloid β-peptide levels.

The accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; AD, Alzheimer disease; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; NEP, neprilysin; ECE, endothelin-converting enzyme; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; icv, intracerebroventricular(ly); DEA, diethylamine; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in the brain occurs in all forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), but increased production of the peptide due to trisomy 21 or mutations in the amyloid β protein precursor (APP) or the presenilins accounts for only a very small fraction of AD cases (1Golde T.E. Brain Pathol. 2005; 15: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of late-onset AD cases there is no evidence of increased production. The underlying cause of Aβ accumulation in these patients remains unknown, and this has sparked intense investigation by geneticists, biochemists, and epidemiologists to identify risk factors contributing to the development of AD in the elderly population. Many genetic loci have been reported to be linked to late-onset AD in certain populations, but the only widely accepted genetic risk factor for late-onset AD across many populations is APOE genotype (2Laws S.M. Hone E. Gandy S. Martins R.N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1215-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). ApoE complexes with Aβ and appears to facilitate its clearance through the low density lipoprotein receptor. The strong association of APOE genotype with AD demonstrates the significance of Aβ clearance in the development of the disease and underscores the importance of elucidating the multiple enzymes and pathways responsible for removing the peptide from the brain. Recently, considerable data have emerged indicating that neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (ECE-1 and ECE-2), insulin-degrading enzyme, and plasmin each play a role in regulating the accumulation of Aβ in the brain (3Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Experimental deletion of each of these enzymes in mice perturbs Aβ degradation, and steady-state Aβ levels are elevated in the brains of mice deficient in NEP, the ECEs, and insulin-degrading enzyme (4Iwata N.

Genet. 2005; 14: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is also capable of degrading Aβ in in vitro assays and in cellular overexpression experiments, but its physiological role in the brain has not yet been explored (11Hu J. Igarashi A. Kamata M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47863-47868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Oba R. Igarashi A. Kamata M. Nagata K. Takano S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). ACE, NEP, and ECE can be categorized as vasopeptidases based on their ability to generate or inactivate vasoactive peptides (14Molinaro G. Rouleau J.L. Adam A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ACE generates angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin, NEP degrades the natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and endothelin, and ECE generates endothelin and potentially degrades bradykinin. Because of these functions, the vasopeptidases are attractive targets for drugs designed to treat hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiovascular disorders. The first vasopeptidase inhibitors put into clinical use were pure ACE inhibitors, and many of these are now FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure (15Menard J. Patchett A.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 56: 13-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Dual ACE-NEP inhibitors were later developed to potentiate the effect of ACE inhibition on bradykinin, as well as to promote the vasodilatory effects of the natriuretic peptides. In pre-clinical and clinical studies, the antihypertensive, cardioprotective, and renal effects of dual inhibitors have been shown to be superior to pure ACE inhibitors (14Molinaro G. Rouleau J.L. Adam A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Weber M.A. Lancet. 2001; 358: 1525-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because NEP degrades and inactivates endothelins, the vasorelaxant effects of dual ACE-NEP inhibitors may be reduced by the accumulation of these vasoconstrictive peptides, suggesting that triple inhibition of NEP, ACE, and ECE may produce even more potent antihypertensive effects. A recent study of chronic heart failure in rats indicated that triple ACE-ECE-NEP inhibition was superior to ACE inhibition or ECE-NEP inhibition with respect to left ventricular hemodynamics and remodeling (17Mellin V. Jeng A.Y. Monteil C. Renet S. Henry J.P. Thuillez C. Mulder P. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2005; 46: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The common prescription of ACE inhibitors, and the development of NEP and ECE inhibitors, is concerning particularly if ACE activity regulates the steady-state concentration of Aβ in the brain. Although in vivo evidence of Aβ degradation by ACE has not been reported, a common insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene has been found to be associated with AD in several populations (18Lehmann D.J. Cortina-Borja M. Warden D.R. Smith A.D. Sleegers K. Prince J.A. van Duijn C.M. Kehoe P.G. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind this association is not yet clear. In the present study we examined the ability of ACE to regulate Aβ concentration in vivo by analyzing Aβ levels in mice genetically engineered to lack ACE expression in the brain and in mice treated with clinically relevant ACE inhibitors. We also further investigated the roles of NEP and ECE by generating dual knock-out mice and by treating mice with ECE and ECE-NEP inhibitors that are being developed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

The metalloprotease inhibitors and their appropriate vehicles were injected in a total volume of 2 μl, with 1 μl injected into each lateral ventricle at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. The mice were sacrificed 2 h after the second injection, and brains were removed, hemispheres divided, and quickly frozen on dry ice. Injection into the ventricle was verified post mortem by visualizing the needle track. Aβ analysis was performed on one hemisphere, and ACE activity measurement was performed on the other hemisphere, where indicated. Doses used were enalaprilat (6 nmol), CGS 35066 (3 nmol), CGS 26303 (40 nmol), and phosphoramidon (118 nmol). Because the maximum volume for the icv injections was 2 μl, these doses were determined in part by the availability of concentrated stock solutions. The dose of phosphoramidon employed was similar to that used in reports of the physiological effects of neprilysin inhibition in the brain (27Rupreht J. Ukponmwan O.E. Admiraal P.V. Dzoljic M.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1983; 41: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Riviere P.J. Liberge M. Murillo-Lopez D. Bueno L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Oral Administration of Metalloprotease Inhibitors—The metalloprotease inhibitors were administered to CD-1 mice by oral gavage in a volume of 0.2 ml. The doses of the ACE inhibitors used were captopril (2 mg/kg), enalapril (0.6 mg/kg), and perindopril (0.2 mg/kg) in saline. These doses are similar to the maximum human dose for each drug. CGS 26393 (prodrug of CGS 26303) was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in 3% cornstarch (final concentration of Me2SO was 8%). The compound was administered at 30 mg/kg, a dose reported to significantly lower mean arterial pressure in the DOCA-salt rat (25De Lombaert S. Blanchard L. Berry C. Ghai R.D. Trapani A.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 151-154Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CGS 35339 (prodrug of CGS 35066) was administered as a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose. Although CGS 35066 is selective for ECE-1 over NEP (IC50 NEP/IC50 ECE = 104), the drug will inhibit both enzymes if given at a high enough dose (26De Lombaert S. Blanchard L. Stamford L.B. Tan J. Wallace E.M. Satoh Y. Fitt J. Hoyer D. Simonsbergen D. Moliterni J. Marcopolous N. Savage P. Chou M. Trapani A.J. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 488-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we dosed mice with 0.45, 4.5, and 45 mg/kg to evaluate the effect of selective ECE inhibition versus dual ECE/NEP inhibition. Studies of intravenous CGS 35066 administration in rats suggest that NEP is not inhibited at the lowest dose, partially inhibited at the 4.5 mg/kg dose equivalent, and significantly inhibited at the 45 mg/kg dose equivalent (29Trapani A.J. Beil M.E. Bruseo C.W. De Lombaert S. Jeng A.Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S40-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Except for mice treated with captopril, all mice were sacrificed 4 h after dosing. Because captopril does not require prodrug conversion and has a shorter duration of action, mice dosed with this compound were sacrificed after 3 h. Following sacrifice, blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture and collected in EDTA-coated tubes for plasma preparation (for Aβ analysis), or standard tubes for serum preparation (for analysis of ACE activity). The mice were perfused with saline to eliminate residual plasma Aβ in the brain. Brains were then removed, quickly frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C prior to Aβ analysis. Aβ concentration did not differ in saline control mice sacrificed after 3 or 4 h, and the data were combined in Fig. 2. Analysis of Aβ Concentration—Brains from mice expressing endogenous Aβ were extracted with 0.2% diethylamine (DEA) as previously described (5Eckman E.A. Watson M. Marlow L. Sambamurti K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2081-2084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). DEA extracts were neutralized and stored at –80 °C prior to analysis of Aβ40 using either the BNT77/BA27 or 32.4.1/13.1.1 sandwich ELISA system, and Aβ42 using the BNT77/BC05 sandwich ELISA system (30Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The BNT77 antibody (Takeda) was raised against amino acids 11–28 and thus may recognize N-terminally modified or truncated peptides (31Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The 32.4.1 antibody (generated at Mayo Clinic) is directed against the N-terminal region of rodent Aβ and fails to capture the Aβ8–40 putative ACE cleavage product. Brains from Tg2576 mice were extracted with 70% formic acid, and Aβ was analyzed using the BAN50/BA27 and BAN50/BC05 sandwich ELISA systems (19Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). BAN50 is directed against the N terminus of human Aβ, requiring position 1. Plasma Aβ was analyzed without further extraction using the BNT77/BA27 and BNT77/BC05 sandwich ELISA systems. In all figures the data were normalized to the mean of the control group and analyzed using the unpaired t test. Analysis of ACE Activity—ACE activity was measured in serum and in brain homogenates as previously described (32Cole J. Quach du L. Sundaram K. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using the ACE-REA kit from American Laboratory Products Co. (Windham, NH). Combined Inhibition of Multiple Metalloproteases Causes a Rapid Increase in the Accumulation of Aβ in the Brain—We have previously shown that phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of metalloproteases including NEP and the ECEs, causes a rapid increase in the accumulation of Aβ in the medium of cultured cells (33Eckman E.A. Reed D.K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24540-24548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). When the inhibitor was injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) into the brains of mice, simultaneous inactivation of multiple metalloproteases led to a large, rapid increase in the levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, with Aβ40 levels increasing greater than 5-fold in wild type mouse brains within 2 h (Fig. 1). ACE Inhibition Fails to Elevate Aβ Concentration in Brain or Plasma—Phosphoramidon is capable of inhibiting ACE only at high concentrations, but more potent and selective ACE inhibitors are available and commonly prescribed. To further investigate the role of ACE in the brain and to determine whether ACE inhibition was partly responsible for the elevation in Aβ following phosphoramidon treatment, we next injected mice icv with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. Two hours following injection ACE activity was completely inhibited in the brain, but Aβ levels were unchanged (Fig. 1). Oral administration of three different FDA-approved ACE inhibitors also failed to result in elevations of either plasma or brain Aβ levels (Fig. 2). Interestingly, perindopril, an inhibitor capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, actually resulted in a small decrease in Aβ concentration. To verify that the enzyme was inhibited at the dose employed, ACE activity was measured in the serum and brain of perindopril-treated mice. Serum ACE activity was inhibited >90% at this dose and time point, and brain ACE was only slightly inhibited by ∼11% (Fig. 3). Steady-state Aβ Levels Are Not Altered in Brain ACE-deficient Mice—To investigate the effects of chronic ACE deficiency on Aβ accumulation we next determined the concentration of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in brain ACE-deficient mice. In ACE 8/8 mice, the endogenous ACE gene is under control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter, resulting in cardiac-restricted expression and undetectable expression of ACE in the brain (20Xiao H.D. Fuchs S. Campbell D.J. Lewis W. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kasi V.S. Hoit B.D. Keshelava G. Zhao H. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ACE 8/8 mice have nearly normal blood pressure and lack most of the phenotypic abnormalities of ACE null mice, allowing for the analysis of ACE deficiency in the brain without the added variables of very low blood pressure, impaired renal function, and anemia. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured in brain extracts from ACE 8/8 mice and age-matched heterozygous and wild-type controls using the well characterized BNT77/BA27 and BNT77/BC05 sandwich ELISA systems (30Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). These systems have been previously used by our group and others to demonstrate significant elevations in Aβ concentration in mice deficient in the ECEs, NEP, and insulin-degrading enzyme (4Iwata N.

Consistent with the results of our studies with ACE inhibitors, no difference in steady-state Aβ concentration was found in mice lacking ACE expression in the brain (Fig. 4). The major cleavage site of human Aβ by ACE is reported to be between amino acids Asp7 and Ser8 (11Hu J. Igarashi A. Kamata M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47863-47868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Oba R. Igarashi A. Kamata M. Nagata K. Takano S. Nakagawa H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). If Aβ8–40 were a major species of the peptide in wild-type, but not ACE-deficient mice, it is possible that differences in Aβ concentration could be obscured by the use of the BNT77 capture antibody, which was raised against amino acids 11–28 (31Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although we feel that this is unlikely, because Aβ8–40 is a potential substrate of other Aβ-degrading enzymes, we re-analyzed Aβ40 concentration in the ACE 8/8 brains using a rodent Aβ40 sandwich ELISA system that fails to recognize Aβ8–40. The results obtained with this antibody system were consistent with the results of the BNT77/BA27 assay, indicating no difference in steady-state Aβ concentration between wild-type and brain ACE-deficient mice (Fig. 4C). ACE Inhibition Does Not Alter Aβ Levels in Young Tg2576 APP Transgenic Mice—Because mouse Aβ differs from the human sequence at amino acid positions 5, 10, and 13, and the major cleavage site of human Aβ by ACE is reported to be between amino acids Asp7 and Ser8, there is a possibility that mouse Aβ may not be an equally effective substrate for ACE. If this were true, it could account for the fact that Aβ levels are unchanged in ACE-deficient mice and in wild-type mice treated with ACE inhibitors. To determine whether ACE regulates steady-state Aβ concentration in the brains of mice expressing human Aβ, we injected young Tg2576 APP transgenic mice icv with enalaprilat and, for comparison, with phosphoramidon. As expected, there was a significant elevation in Aβ levels in Tg2576 mice treated with phosphoramidon. However, consistent with the results in wild-type mice, Aβ levels were unchanged in Tg2576 mice treated with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (Fig. 5). Dual NEP/ECE Knock-out Mice Show Additive Effects on Aβ Accumulation—Unlike brain ACE-deficient mice, mice deficient in NEP, ECE-1, or ECE-2 have increased accumulation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the brain (4Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Hama E. Lee H.J. Saido T.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 5Eckman E.A. Watson M. Marlow L. Sambamurti K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2081-2084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The increases in these mice are relatively modest when compared with the effect of inhibiting multiple metalloproteases with phosphoramidon. Given that NEP and the ECEs are members of the same protease family with overlapping substrates, it is possible that in the knock-out models these enzymes are able to partially compensate for the loss of one Aβ degrading pathway. However, NEP, ECE-1, and ECE-2 differ in regional and subcellular localization in the brain and their activities may be complementary rather than redundant with respect to Aβ degradation. To investigate the effect of removing two pathways of Aβ degradation in the brain, we generated crosses of NEP and either ECE-1- or ECE-2-deficient mice. The elevations in Aβ concentration in the brains of the dual NEP/ECE-1 and NEP/ECE-2 knockouts were approximately additive of the effects of the single knockouts, suggesting that NEP and the ECEs do not compensate for one another with respect to Aβ degradation (Fig. 6). Vasopeptidase Inhibitors That Target NEP and ECE Cause Rapid Increases in Aβ Concentration—We have shown that treatment with commonly prescribed ACE inhibitors is unlikely to directly affect Aβ levels (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4). However, vasopeptidase inhibitors that target ACE-NEP, ECE, NEP-ECE, and even triple inhibitors of NEP-ECE-ACE, are currently in development for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure (14Molinaro G.

https://openalex.org/W2004325862,"Radiotherapy is an important treatment for patients suffering from high-grade malignant gliomas. Non-targeted (bystander) effects may influence these cells' response to radiation and the investigation of these effects may therefore provide new insights into mechanisms of radiosensitivity and responses to radiotherapy as well as define new targets for therapeutic approaches. Normal primary human astrocytes (NHA) and T98G glioma cells were irradiated with helium ions using the Gray Cancer Institute microbeam facility targeting individual cells. Irradiated NHA and T98G glioma cells generated signals that induced gammaH2AX foci in neighbouring non-targeted bystander cells up to 48 h after irradiation. gammaH2AX bystander foci were also observed in co-cultures targeting either NHA or T98G cells and in medium transfer experiments. Dimethyl sulphoxide, Filipin and anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 could suppress gammaH2AX foci in bystander cells, confirming that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane-mediated signals are involved in the bystander signalling pathways. Also, TGF-beta 1 induced gammaH2AX in an ROS-dependent manner similar to bystander foci. ROS and membrane signalling-dependent differences in bystander foci induction between T98G glioma cells and normal human astrocytes have been observed. Inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and DNA-PK could not suppress the induction of bystander gammaH2AX foci whereas the mutation of ATM- and rad3-related (ATR) abrogated bystander foci induction. Furthermore, ATR-dependent bystander foci induction was restricted to S-phase cells. These observations may provide additional therapeutic targets for the exploitation of the bystander effect."

In this study, we analyzed the responses of macrophages derived from wild-type (IFN-β+/+) mice or mice with a targeted mutation in IFN-β (IFN-β-/-) to the prototype TLR4 agonist, Escherichia coli LPS. A comparison of basal and LPS-induced gene expression (by reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR, and Affymetrix microarray analyses) resulted in the identification of four distinct patterns of gene expression affected by IFN-β deficiency. Analysis of a subset of each group of differentially regulated genes by computer-assisted promoter analysis revealed putative IFN-responsive elements in all genes examined. LPS-induced activation of intracellular signaling molecules, STAT1 Tyr-701, STAT1 Ser-727, and Akt, but not p38, JNK, and ERK MAPK proteins, was significantly diminished in IFN-β-/- versus IFN-β+/+ macrophages. “Priming” of IFN-β-/- macrophages with exogenous recombinant IFN-β significantly increased levels of LPS-induced gene expression for induction of monocyte chemotactic protein 5, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, IP-10, and IL-12 p40 mRNA, whereas no increase or relatively small increases were observed for IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and MyD88 mRNA. Finally, IFN-β-/- mice challenged in vivo with LPS exhibited increased survival when compared with wild-type IFN-β+/+ controls, indicating that IFN-β contributes to LPS-induced lethality; however, not to the extent that one observes in mice with more complete pathway deficiencies (e.g. TLR4-/- or TRIF-/- mice).

The TLRs represent an evolutionarily conserved family of signal transducing receptors (>10 TLRs have been identified in humans) that interact with conserved microbial structures through their N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains and initiate signaling through the interactions of TLR “Toll-IL-1 resistance” (TIR) domains with one or more intracellular adapter proteins: MyD88, TIRAP/Mal, TRIF/TICAM-1, or TRAM/TIRP/TICAM-2. The adapter molecules enable recruitment of downstream kinases and substrates to the receptor complex, thus initiating intracellular signaling leading to alterations in gene expression. Not all TLRs activate the pro-inflammatory response to the same extent. Hirschfeld et al. (1Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that engagement of different TLRs results in distinct patterns of gene expression. Specifically, Escherichia coli LPS signaling through TLR4 resulted in a much broader pattern of gene expression in murine macrophages than was observed in cells stimulated with the TLR2 agonist, Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS. Toshchakov et al. (2Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) later showed that TLR4 signaling could be distinguished from TLR2 signaling by the production of IFN-β, which in turn, results in the autocrine/paracrine activation of macrophages, leading to STAT1 activation (and the subsequent induction of STAT1-dependent genes, e.g. MCP-5, IP-10 (CXCL10), and iNOS). Both IFN-β gene expression and STAT1 activation were found to be MyD88-independent (2Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J.

It is now widely held that differential utilization of the four adapter molecules by distinct TLRs gives rise to the two major TLR-specific signaling cascades and the corresponding repertoires of gene expression that have been reported (reviewed in Ref. 8Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For example, although TLR4 utilizes MyD88 and TIRAP for induction of Tnfa and similarly regulated genes, both TRIF and TRAM are required to stimulate IFN-β production via IRF-3 after LPS stimulation. In contrast, TLR2 appears to be limited to interaction with MyD88 and TIRAP, and therefore, fails to activate genes that are downstream of the MyD88-independent pathway. Conversely, TLR3 appears to be limited to the utilization of TRIF only for induction of IFN-β via the MyD88-independent pathway and does not appear to utilize the other three adapters. Recent microarray analysis has revealed that LPS stimulation of murine macrophages resulted in the induction of a greater proportion of genes induced via the MyD88-independent than the “MyD88-dependent” pathway: of 1055 genes that were statistically induced or repressed by LPS treatment, 74.7% of genes are MyD88-independent as compared with 21.8% that are MyD88-dependent (9Bjorkbacka H. Fitzgerald K.A. Huet F. Li X. Gregory J.A. Lee M.A. Ordija C.M. Dowley N.E. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 19: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A comparison of LPS and CpG DNA stimulation of murine macrophages revealed that CpG DNA induced or repressed 31.6% of those modulated by LPS (10Gao J.J. Diesl V. Wittmann T. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Vogel S.N. Follettie M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 1234-1245PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the TLRs evolved not only to recognize distinct pathogens, but also to initiate responses specific to each pathogen. Moreover, recent studies have shown that signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor is required for LPS- and CpG-induced “cross-priming” of ovalbumin-specific cytotoxic T cells (11Durand V. Wong S.Y. Tough D.F. Le Bon A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, LPS-induced type I IFN contributes to both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Because IFN-β is one of the “signature” cytokines induced via the MyD88-independent pathway in response to LPS (2Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the extent to which IFN-β contributes to LPS-induced signaling. To this end, we compared the capacity of E. coli LPS to induce gene expression, cytokine secretion, and activation of intermediate kinases and transacting factors in macrophages from wild-type, IFN-β+/+ mice and mice with a targeted mutation in the IFN-β gene (12Deonarain R. Alcami A. Alexiou M. Dallman M.J. Gewert D.R. Porter A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We found that IFN-β has a broader impact on TLR4-mediated signaling than would have been predicted based on the simple paradigm of MyD88-dependent versus MyD88-independent signaling pathways. In this report, we have identified previously unappreciated regulatory roles for IFN-β in LPS signaling by comparing not only the induction of gene expression (by real-time PCR and Affymetrix microarray analysis), but also the activation of intracellular signaling molecules in wild-type versus IFN-β-/- macrophages, as well as by studying the response of such cells to LPS after induction “priming” with exogenous IFN-β. In vivo challenge of wild-type and IFN-β-/- mice also revealed that IFN-β contributes significantly to LPS-induced lethality, although not to the extent that one observes in mice with more complete pathway deficiencies (e.g. TLR4 or TRIF knock-out mice). Reagents—Protein-free (<0.008%) E. coli K235 LPS was prepared by two cycles of hot phenol-water extraction as described previously (13McIntire F.C. Sievert H.W. Barlow G.H. Finley R.A. Lee A.Y. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2363-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phosphorylated Akt, ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and STAT1 (Ser-727), along with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant murine IFN-β was obtained from Toray Industries (Japan). Mice—Control C57BL/6J (wild-type IFN-β+/+) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). IFN-β knock-out (IFN-β-/-) mice (backcrossed ≥N8 onto a C57BL/6 background) (12Deonarain R. Alcami A. Alexiou M. Dallman M.J. Gewert D.R. Porter A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were bred homozygously both at the University of Maryland, Baltimore and the Toronto General Research Institute. All animal work was carried out with institutional approval. Macrophage Cultures—Peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained from 5- to 6-week old mice by lavage 5 days after intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml of sterile 3% thioglycollate broth. Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI containing 2% fetal calf serum and standard supplements (14Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2770-2777PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (2 × 106 cells/well) for supernatant collection or 6-well tissue culture dishes (4 × 106 cells/well) for RNA extraction. After overnight incubation to allow for adherence of macrophages, monolayers were washed to remove nonadherent cells and incubated with medium or LPS at the indicated concentrations in final volumes of 1 ml for 24-well cultures or 2 ml for 6-well cultures. Supernatants were harvested 24 h after treatment and stored at -70 °C. Cells were harvested 1, 3, 5, or 8 h after LPS treatment for mRNA isolation, after 24 h treatment for cytokine production, or after 0.5, 1, or 2 h post-treatment for whole cell lysate preparation. All samples were stored at -70 °C. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were obtained from mice by flushing the marrow from tibia and femurs into 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and maintained in culture for 6 days in the presence of 10 ng/ml murine colony stimulating factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 1 or 3 h then harvested using 2.4 units/ml Dispase (Sigma), and total RNA isolation was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol for use in Affymetrix GeneChip® Microarray analyses (described below). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Murine IL-12 p70, IP-10, RANTES, and TNF-α were detected in macrophage culture supernatants using the antibody pairs and standards provided in the Quantikine M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems). mRNA Detection by RT-PCR and Southern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from macrophage cultures and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed, as described previously (15Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was performed under the following conditions. The primers and probe combinations for detection of IRF-3 mRNA were as follows: sense, 5′-AAC AAT GGG AGT TCG AGG TG; antisense, 5′-TCC TTG TGG ACC TCT CCA TC (annealing temperature, 60 °C); and probe, 5′-TGA CGG ACA AGC TTG TGA AG. The primers and probe combinations for detection of IRF-7 mRNA were as follows: sense, 5′-CCA GTT GAT CCG CAT AAG GT; antisense, 5′-GAT GGT CAC ATC CAG GGA CC (annealing temperature, 60 °C); and probe, 5′-CAA GAG AAA ATG CTG GGC TC. All other primer and probe combinations have been published previously (15Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar, 16Barber S.A.

The number of cycles used for amplification of each gene product was as follows: Gapdh, 21; Ifnb, 33; Mcp5, 34; NOS, 30; IP-10, 24; Rantes, 30; Tnfa, 27; Il1b, 33; Il6, 30; Il12p35, 32; Il12p40, 27; Irf1, 24; Irf3, 32; and Irf7, 32. Amplified products were electrophoresed and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 10× SSC by standard Southern blotting techniques. DNA was cross-linked by exposure to UV light, baked onto the nylon membrane, and hybridized with an internal oligonucleotide probe. Labeling of the probe and subsequent detection of bound probe were carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA Quantification Using Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was carried out as described elsewhere (22Cuesta N. Salkowski C.A. Thomas K.E. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5739-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Lentschat A. Karahashi H. Michelsen K.S. Thomas L.S. Zhang W. Vogel S.N. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) on additional sets of macrophage mRNAs to confirm results obtained by RTPCR and Southern blotting. The “-fold increase,” the relative increase in gene expression in LPS-treated versus medium-treated control cells, was calculated using the ΔΔCT method as previously described (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Affymetrix GeneChip® Microarray Analyses—The preparation of cDNA from RNA derived from BMMs, sample hybridization, and scanning of the MOE430A oligonucleotide microarray GeneChip® Arrays (Affymetrix) was performed at the Centre for Applied Genomics Microarray Facility (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) in accordance with the procedures established by Affymetrix. The Affymetrix MOE430A chip contains 11 replicate probe sets per chip (i.e. 11 distinct oligonucleotide probes spanning each gene) that are used to address specifically the issue of reliability of the data generated and to determine a p value for probe set binding using MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Data were further analyzed using ArrayAssist (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) software. GC content-robust multiarray average analysis was performed, and an intensity cutoff value of 50 was utilized. Hybridization experimental data for each LPS-treated sample were normalized to the data from the medium-treated IFN-β+/+, control sample, which was assigned a value of 1. A positive number indicates the -fold increase in gene expression, whereas a negative number indicates the -fold decrease in gene expression compared with the basal levels of wild-type, untreated controls. Genes exhibiting a 3-fold or greater change in expression compared with the untreated IFN-β+/+ BMM cells were considered to be significant. Computer-assisted Promoter Analysis—Sequences were obtained from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (genome.ucsc.edu). Gene promoters were assessed for potential STAT-binding sites using Gene2Promoter and MatInspector from Genomatix (www.genomatix.de). Sequences 5′ upstream from the Gene2Promoter-predicted transcriptional start site of each gene were analyzed using MatInspector, a software tool that uses the Matrix Family Library Version 5.0 (February, 2005) library of matrix definitions for transcription factor binding sites to locate matches in target sequences (25Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). The output matrix positions correspond to sense strand numbering, and all sequences were provided in the 5′-3′ direction. The NCBI Gene identification numbers of select genes that were analyzed are as follows: Mx1 (17857), Ifit1 (15957), Ccl12 (Mcp5) (20293), Il6 (16193), Cxcl10 (IP-10) (15945), Rpgrip1 (77945), Ogn (18295), Gzme (14942), and Trim34 (94094). These genes were selected as being representative of the four groups of genes differentially regulated in wild-type and IFN-β-/- macrophages. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis to detect proteins from whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE was performed as previously described (26Medvedev A.E. Henneke P. Schromm A. Lien E. Ingalls R. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To detect specific antibodies bound to immobilized proteins, blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Lethality Study—C57BL/6 (IFN-β+/+) and IFN-β-/- mice, 8-10 weeks old, were injected intraperitoneal with 35 mg/kg LPS and observed daily for 6 days for mortality. Results were accumulated from three separate experiments. LPS-induced, IFN-β-dependent Gene Expression—Previous studies have demonstrated that LPS stimulates two distinct signal transduction pathways, MyD88-dependent and MyD88-in-dependent, that induce gene expression (27Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8612) Google Scholar). The induction of IFN-β by LPS is dependent upon the MyD88-independent pathway. Moreover, the autocrine/paracrine action of IFN-β has been shown to enable the expression of other genes within this pathway, including Mcp5 (Ccl12), IP-10 (Cxcl10), and NOS through activation of STAT1 (2Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of IFN-β to the pro-inflammatory response to LPS, we analyzed the expression of a panel of well characterized, LPS-inducible genes in peritoneal exudate macrophages derived from wild-type C57BL/6 (IFN-β+/+) and IFN-β-/- mice. Fig. 1A illustrates the results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR with Southern blot analysis for mRNA derived from wild-type, IFN-β+/+ C57BL/6 macrophages (left lanes), and IFN-β-/- macrophages (right lanes). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a “housekeeping” gene and was comparably expressed in all samples. As would be expected, IFN-β mRNA was expressed only in wild-type macrophages and not in the IFN-β-/- macrophages. Our previous studies had demonstrated LPS-induced MCP-5 (CCL12), iNOS, and IP-10 (CXCL10) gene expression to be IFN-β-dependent (via induction of activated STAT1) and poorly induced by TLR2 agonists (2Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, LPS-induced MCP-5 mRNA expression was abrogated in IFN-β-/- macrophages, whereas iNOS and IP-10 mRNA expression were both significantly diminished when compared with the response of control IFN-β+/+ macrophages (Fig. 1A). Basal levels of iNOS were undetectable (Fig. 1A), whereas LPS-induced iNOS mRNA message in IFN-β-/- macrophages peaked at 5 h and exhibited a subsequent decline in mRNA levels, in contrast to the sustained signal produced by control macrophages. Similarly, basal levels of steady-state IP-10 mRNA were diminished in IFN-β-/- macrophages, yet in response to LPS, there was a suboptimal peak at 3 h that declined over 5 and 8 h, in contrast to the sustained mRNA levels seen in C57BL/6 macrophages (Fig. 1A). Like IFN-β, RANTES (CCL5) has also been shown to be an immediate early gene that is dependent upon LPS-induced activation of the MyD88-independent pathway (28Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). However, it is evident from our data that basal levels of RANTES gene expression in IFN-β-/- macrophages are much lower than in control macrophages, whereas levels of RANTES steady-state mRNA appear to be fairly comparably inducible to those seen in wild-type C57BL/6 macrophages at 3, 5, and 8 h after stimulation of macrophages with LPS. Because RT-PCR with Southern blot analysis is only semiquantitative, we sought to quantify these differences by performing real-time PCR for some of the genes shown in Fig. 1A. As would be expected, there was no detectable mRNA for IFN-β in the IFN-β-/- macrophages. In multiple experiments, the basal levels of all genes examined in this panel (with the exception of the housekeeping gene) were consistently lower in IFN-β-/- macrophages than in control macrophages (not visible on most graphs in Fig. 1B). Fig. 1B confirms significant differences in LPS-inducible levels of iNOS, IP-10, and to a lesser extent, RANTES mRNA, in control versus IFN-β-/- macrophages. Thus, the failure to produce IFN-β also greatly impacts expression of a number of genes induced by LPS shown previously to be dependent upon the MyD88-independent pathway. Role of IFN-β on MyD88-dependent Gene Expression—To date, examination of gene expression in macrophages obtained from mice with targeted mutations in TRIF or TRAM, the two adapters required for initiation of LPS-induced MyD88-independent pathway, have suggested that the MyD88-dependent pathway is fully intact (reviewed in Ref. 8Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To assess the potential contribution of IFN-β to the expression of LPS-inducible genes that have been characterized as MyD88-dependent, similar analyses were performed on the same RNA samples described above. RT-PCR with Southern blot analysis revealed diminished constitutive expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 p35, and IL-12 p40 mRNA in IFN-β-/- macrophages, as well as a contribution of IFN-β to LPS-induced IL-6, IL-12 p35, and IL-12 p40 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Again, we utilized real-time PCR to obtain more quantitative results for selected genes (Fig. 1B). Although TNF-α mRNA expression was comparable at early time points following LPS, a significant decrease in steadystate mRNA was observed in the IFN-β-/- macrophages at 5 h after LPS stimulation. Induction of IL-12 p40 and MCP-1 mRNA was also markedly decreased in IFN-β-/- macrophages. MyD88 gene expression itself was also shown to be IFN-β-dependent as seen in Fig. 1B; by 5 h after LPS stimulation, there was a 5-fold difference in the levels of MyD88 mRNA in wild-type versus IFN-β-/- macrophages. These findings were confirmed at the level of cytokine secretion. Specifically, LPS-induced secretion of IL-12 p70 and IP-10 were markedly suppressed in IFN-β-/- macrophages, whereas RANTES and TNF-α secretion were only modestly inhibited (Table 1). Taken collectively, these data suggest that not only does IFN-β contribute to the constitutive and LPS-induced expression of genes normally associated with the MyD88-independent pathway but also those associated with the MyD88-dependent pathway.TABLE 1Cytokine production in C57BL/6 versus IFN-β−/− macrophages following LPS stimulationTreatmentC57BL/6IFN-β−/−MediaLPSMediaLPSpg/mlIL-12 p70<7.865 ± 14<7.813 ± 9ap < 0.01.IP-10<31.34,406 ± 786<31.3631 ± 146ap < 0.01.RANTES<7.877,301 ± 13,063<7.856,313 ± 11,117TNF-α<23.47,927 ± 1,427<23.44,689 ± 1,591a p < 0.01.

https://openalex.org/W2041460867,"Bcr-Abl is the oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinase responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recently, we observed that inhibition of myeloid Src family kinase activity (e.g. Hck, Lyn, and Fyn) induces growth arrest and apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, suggesting that cell transformation by Bcr-Abl involves Src family kinases (Wilson, M. B., Schreiner, S. J., Choi, H. J., Kamens, J., and Smithgall, T. E. (2002) Oncogene 21, 8075-8088). Here, we report the unexpected observation that Hck, Lyn, and Fyn strongly phosphorylate the SH3-SH2 region of Bcr-Abl. Seven phosphorylation sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: Tyr89 and Tyr134 in the Abl-derived SH3 domain; Tyr147 in the SH3-SH2 connector; and Tyr158, Tyr191, Tyr204, and Tyr234 in the SH2 domain. SH3 domain Tyr89, the most prominent phosphorylation site in vitro, was strongly phosphorylated in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. Substitution of the SH3-SH2 tyrosine phosphorylation sites with phenylalanine substantially reduced Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation of TF-1 myeloid cells to cytokine independence. The positions of these tyrosines in the crystal structure of the c-Abl core and the transformation defect of the corresponding Bcr-Abl mutants together suggest that phosphorylation of the SH3-SH2 region by Src family kinases impacts Bcr-Abl protein conformation and signaling.

All of these signaling pathways involve components with SH2 and SH3 domains and are dependent upon interactions with phosphotyrosine or polyproline docking sites, respectively.

Interestingly, Hck activation does not require Bcr-Abl kinase activity (19Warmuth M. Bergmann M. Priess A. Hauslmann K. Emmerich B. Hallek M. J. Biol.

Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by subsequent work showing that the SH3 and SH2 domains of Hck directly associate with Bcr-Abl (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinase-defective Hck blocks transformation of myeloid leukemia cells to cytokine independence by Bcr-Abl (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas pharmacological inhibitors selective for Src family kinases induce apoptosis in the CML cell lines Meg-01 and K-562 (18Wilson M.B. Schreiner S.J. Choi H.J. Kamens J. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8075-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The effects of these compounds correlate with down-regulation of both Stat5 and Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation, suggesting that Src family kinases may couple Bcr-Abl to certain downstream signaling pathways (18Wilson M.B. Schreiner S.J. Choi H.J. Kamens J. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8075-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although Bcr-Abl interacts directly with Hck, Lyn, and other Src family kinases, the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of binding in terms of Bcr-Abl signaling and oncogenesis are not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Bcr-Abl binds multiple members of the Src family through the Abl-derived SH3-SH2 regulatory region. Unexpectedly, Hck, Lyn, and Fyn phosphorylated the Bcr-Abl SH3-SH2 region at multiple tyrosine residues. The most prominent of these is SH3 domain Tyr89, which was also phosphorylated in CML cells in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. Substitution of Tyr89 and other SH3-SH2 phosphorylation sites with phenylalanine reduced Bcr-Abl transforming activity without altering phosphorylation of the Abl kinase domain activation loop. These data show that Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the SH3-SH2 region is critical for Bcr-Abl function, offering a possible mechanistic explanation for the remarkable efficacy of Src-selective and dual Src/Abl inhibitors against CML (18Wilson M.B.

Binding Assays—Interaction of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused human c-Abl proteins with Src family kinases was conducted in Sf9 insect cells as described previously (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For binding assays, Sf9 cells (2.5 × 106) were co-infected with each of the GST-Abl baculoviruses (or GST as a negative control) and wild-type Hck, Lyn, or Fyn baculovirus. Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were lysed in Hck lysis buffer (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads. The precipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and associated Hck, Lyn, and Fyn were visualized by immunoblotting with kinase isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The amount of precipitated GST-Abl fusion protein present in each reaction was determined by immuno-blotting with anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Equivalent expression of each Src family kinase was verified by immunoblotting the clarified cell lysates. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as colorimetric substrate (SouthernBiotech). GST-Bcr-Abl Fusion Protein Purification and in Vitro Kinase Assay—The Bcr-Abl SH3 domain (Gly57-Ser126), SH2 domain (Ser121-Thr224), and SH3-SH2 coding regions were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T, and the corresponding GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-agarose beads (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protein concentrations were determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. Each purified GST fusion protein or GST alone (380 pmol) was incubated with recombinant purified Hck-YEEI (24Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), Lyn (Upstate), or Fyn (Upstate). The molar ratio of substrate to kinase was at least 20:1 in each case. Phosphorylation reactions (50 μl) were conducted in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C and quenched by freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST or anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Hexahistidine-Bcr-Abl Fusion Protein Purification—The Bcr-Abl SH3-SH2 coding region (Gly57-Thr224; human c-Abl numbering) was subcloned into the pET-14b expression vector (Novagen) to allow addition of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, yielding His6-Abl3+2. BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial cells were transformed with the vector, and His6-Abl3+2 protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. His6-Abl3+2 was purified from clarified cell extracts using a HiTrap metal-chelating column charged with Ni2+ (GE Healthcare), and phosphorylated with recombinant Hck, Lyn, and Fyn as described above for the GST-Abl3+2 protein. Full-length kinase-dead p210 Bcr-Abl was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as follows. A hexahistidine tag was added to the C-terminal coding region of a kinase-defective mutant of Bcr-Abl (15Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1097-1103PubMed Google Scholar) using a PCR-based approach and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (BD Biosciences). A recombinant baculovirus was created using the transfer vector and BaculoGold DNA according to the supplier's protocol. Spinner cultures of Sf9 cells (1 liter, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with 100 ml of high titer virus and harvested 72 h later. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl. The protein was purified in one step using a HiTrap metal-chelating column. The Bcr-Abl-positive fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled, and the concentration of Bcr-Abl was quantitated by densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Phosphorylation reactions with Src family kinases were conducted as described above for the GST-Abl fusion proteins and contained ∼8 pmol of recombinant Bcr-Abl p210-KR. Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Recombinant His6-Abl3+2 and full-length kinase-dead Bcr-Abl (p210-KR) were phosphorylated in vitro with purified Src kinases, and aliquots of the phosphorylation reactions were digested overnight with trypsin at a 1:25 trypsin/protein ratio. The His6-Abl3+2 peptides were mixed with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), spotted onto a MALDI target, and analyzed directly by MALDI-TOF-MS (Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer). The area under the isotope distribution for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of each tryptic peptide was determined and used to estimate the relative extent of phosphorylation. Tryptic fragments derived from full-length Bcr-Abl p210-KR were separated by reverse-phase capillary high pressure liquid chromatography (Dionex Ultimate Nano-LC system). Column fractions were mixed on-line with MALDI matrix and automatically spotted onto a MALDI plate at 20-s intervals with a Dionex Probot robot (144 spots total). Peaks for phosphopeptides and their unphosphorylated counterparts were identified in the MALDI-TOF spectra based on their m/z ratios, and the sequence of each peptide was verified by tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis when possible. The accuracy of the m/z measurements was ±0.1 Da. An internal calibrant consisting of a mixture of des-Arg-bradykinin, angiotensin I, Glu-fibrinopeptide B, and ACTH-(18-39) was added to each MALDI spot prior to analysis. Coexpression of Src Family Kinases and Bcr-Abl in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with full-length kinase-dead Bcr-Abl and Hck, Lyn, or Fyn baculovirus as described previously (25Schreiner S.J. Schiavone A.P. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45680-45687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 48 h later in 1.0 ml of ice-cold radio-immune precipitation assay buffer, and Bcr-Abl was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-c-Abl monoclonal antibody 8E9 (Pharmingen) and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50:50 (w/v) slurry; GE Healthcare) by rotation overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Bcr phospho-Tyr177 (Cellular Signaling Technology), c-Abl phospho-Tyr245 (Cellular Signaling Technology), c-Abl phospho-Tyr412 (Cellular Signaling and BIOSOURCE), and c-Abl protein (Pharmingen). Generation of Phospho-specific Antibodies to Abl Phospho-Tyr89—Phospho-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits against a phosphopeptide corresponding to the Abl Tyr89 phosphorylation site. The sequence of the peptide antigen was LFVALpYDFVASGDN. The antiserum was first purified by protein A chromatography, and nonspecific antibodies were removed by passing the protein A eluate through a second column on which the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide was immobilized. The eluate from this column was further purified on a column containing the original phosphopeptide. To test antibody specificity, recombinant His6-Abl3+2 protein was phosphorylated with Hck as described above, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the anti-Abl phospho-Tyr89 antibody at 1:1000 dilution. This experiment was repeated with purified His6-Abl3+2 protein in which Tyr89 was changed to Phe. The antibody was also used to probe Bcr-Abl Tyr89 phosphorylation in the CML cell lines Meg-01 and K-562 by immunoblotting as described previously (18Wilson M.B. Schreiner S.J. Choi H.J. Kamens J. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8075-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the requirement for Src family kinases in the phosphorylation event, cell lines were treated with the Src family kinase-selective inhibitor A-419259 overnight prior to lysis and immunoblotting as described (18Wilson M.B.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Src family kinase activity was determined by immunoblotting with the anti-Src phospho-Tyr418 antibody (BIOSOURCE), which reacts with the phosphorylated activation loop of all members of the Src kinase family (26Meyn III, M.A. Schreiner S.J. Dumitrescu T.P. Nau G.J. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Bcr-Abl SH3-SH2 Phosphorylation Sites—A 1121-bp oligonucleotide spanning the SH3-SH2 region of Bcr-Abl containing seven tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions corresponding to the phosphorylation sites shown in Fig. 2 (7YF mutant) and flanked by unique restriction sites was commercially synthesized (DNA 2.0 Inc.). The SH3-SH2 7YF oligonucleotide was swapped for the corresponding region of wild-type Bcr-Abl, and the resulting full-length Bcr-Abl 7YF coding region was subcloned into the retroviral vector pMSCV-neo (Clontech). The Y89F single mutant and a 6YF add-back mutant were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To create the 6YF mutant, the Bcr-Abl 7YF mutant was used as the template, and oligonucleotides encoding Tyr89 were used to revert this site from Phe to Tyr. These mutants and wild-type Bcr-Abl were also subcloned into the pMSCV-neo retroviral vector. Transformation of TF-1 Cells with Bcr-Abl Retroviruses—The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line TF-1 (27Kitamura T. Tange T.

To make retroviral stocks, 293T cells were cotransfected with each retroviral construct and an amphotropic packaging vector as described (28Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.-M. Swingler S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51688-51696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TF-1 cells (106) were incubated with 5 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene and centrifuged at 2400 rpm for 3 h at room temperature to enhance infection (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.-M. Swingler S. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25605-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cell populations were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 for 10-14 days. To analyze wild-type and mutant Bcr-Abl protein expression and phosphorylation status, 107 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitors aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (10 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm). Clarified lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted with antibodies specific for Abl protein and site-specific phosphorylation as described above. GM-CSF-independent cell proliferation was assessed using the CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay (Promega Corp.). Cells were washed and seeded in 5-ml cultures at 105/ml in the absence of GM-CSF. For each time point, 100 μl of each culture was withdrawn, mixed with 20 μl of the assay reagent in a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 °C for 120 min prior to reading the fluorescence (excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm) on a Molecular Dynamics SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorometric plate reader. All time points were assayed in triplicate, and the entire experiment was repeated three times. Src Family Kinases Phosphorylate the Bcr-Abl SH3-SH2 Region at Multiple Tyrosines—Previously, we found that the Src family kinase Hck binds directly to the SH3-SH2 region, kinase domain, and C-terminal region of Bcr-Abl in vitro (17Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended these findings to include Lyn and Fyn, which are also present in Bcr-Abl-transformed myeloid progenitor cells. Each Src family member was coexpressed in Sf9 insect cells along with a series of GST fusion proteins encompassing the Abl-derived portion of Bcr-Abl (Fig. 1A). The fusion proteins were precipitated and analyzed for bound Src family kinases by immunoblotting. Hck, Lyn, and Fyn exhibited a nearly identical pattern of binding involving the SH3-SH2, kinase, and C-terminal regions of Abl (Fig. 1B). No association was observed with GST alone. This result shows that Src family kinases expressed in myeloid cells associate with Bcr-Abl by a common mechanism. The immunoblots from the binding assays shown in Fig. 1 were then reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Very strong phosphorylation of the Abl SH3-SH2 region was observed upon coexpression with Hck, Lyn, and Fyn (data not shown). To confirm this finding, we purified the GST-Abl3+2 fusion protein and tested it as a substrate for recombinant Hck, Lyn, and Fyn in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1C, catalytic amounts of all three Src family kinases strongly phosphorylated the Bcr-Abl SH3-SH2 region under these conditions. Lower levels of phosphorylation were observed with equimolar amounts of GST-Abl SH2 and GST-Abl SH3 domain fusion proteins, suggesting that tethering of the domains is required for proper recognition and phosphotransfer by Src family kinases. No phosphorylation of GST was observed, indicating that the phosphorylation sites localize to the Abl-derived portion of each fusion protein. We next identified the sites of Src family kinase-mediated Abl SH3-SH2 phosphorylation by MALDI-TOF-MS. To eliminate interference from the GST moiety, the SH3-SH2 region was re-expressed with a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus (His6-Abl3+2), purified, and incubated in vitro with a catalytic amount of recombinant Hck, Lyn, or Fyn. As shown in Fig. 2A, all three Src kinases strongly phosphorylated the purified His6-Abl3+2 protein. Each phosphorylation reaction was digested overnight with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Of 10 possible tyrosines in the His6-Abl3+2 protein, seven were reproducibly phosphorylated: Tyr89 and Tyr134 in the SH3 domain; Tyr147 in the SH3-SH2 connector; and Tyr158, Tyr191, Tyr204, and Tyr234 in the SH2 domain. The extent of phosphorylation of each peptide (estimated from the ratios of the peak intensities for the phosphopeptides and their unphosphorylated counterparts) is presented in Fig. 2A. Tyr89 was phosphorylated to very high stoichiometry by all three Src family members. Interestingly, Hck phosphorylated several other sites to higher stoichiometry relative to Lyn or Fyn. Whether this represents true differences in substrate specificity among the Src kinase isoforms or simply differences in the specific activities of the purified kinase preparations will require further investigation. Note that Tyr112 in the Abl SH3 domain and Tyr186 and Tyr193 in the SH2 domain were not detectably phosphorylated, indicative of selectivity for specific Tyr sites (data not shown). The positions of these novel Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the crystal structure of the c-Abl core region (30Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 2B. Intriguingly, four of these tyrosine residues (Tyr89 and Tyr134 in the SH3 domain and Tyr158 and Tyr191 in the SH2 domain) lie along the interface between the SH3-SH2 region and the kinase domain. Because c-Abl kinase activity is down-regulated in part through tight docking of the SH3-SH2 “clamp” onto the back of the kinase domain, phosphorylation of residues along this interface could influence kinase activity, even in the context of Bcr-Abl (see “Discussion”). Hck Phosphorylates Full-length Bcr-Abl in the SH3-SH2 Region—We next investigated whether Src family kinases phosphorylate the Abl SH3-SH2 region within the context of the full-length Bcr-Abl protein. Full-length kinase-dead p210 Bcr-Abl was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by virtue of a hexahistidine tag on its C terminus. This form of Bcr-Abl cannot undergo auto-phosphorylation, allowing for clear characterization of Src family kinase-dependent phosphorylation events. Purifie"

However, some structural differences between the two isoforms exist in their N- and C-terminal regions, and a number of reports suggest that the regulation and functions of both GSK-3 isoforms are not always identical. For example, GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, is regulated by protein kinase C isozymes (10Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GSK-3β is more potent than GSK-3α in phosphorylating phosphatase inhibitor 2 (11Wang Q.M. Park I.K. Fiol C.J. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The disruption of the GSK-3β isoform in mice results in embryonic lethality, and the GSK-3α isoform is unable to compensate for the loss of GSK-3β (12Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Additionally, transfection and small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies suggest that GSK-3α is involved in the processing of β-amyloid precursor protein to form Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides, whereas the role of GSK-3β is unclear (13Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 14Su Y. Ryder J. Li B. Wu X. Fox N. Solenberg P. Brune K. Paul S. Zhou Y. Liu F. Ni B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6899-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Moreover, differential transcriptional and translational regulation for these two isoforms might be due to variable expression of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in different mammalian tissues (7Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation regulates the expression of many downstream genes of signaling pathways directly by GSK-3 through phosphorylation or indirectly as a consequence of GSK-3 activity changes. Although differential regulations of transcription factors by the two isoforms of GSK-3 were proposed (11Wang Q.M. Park I.K. Fiol C.J. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 13Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), the distinct mechanisms and endogenous targets of such regulations remain to be investigated. In the present study, we employed transfection of GSK-3 isoform-specific siRNA, wild-type GSK-3α and -3β, and their dominant negative mutants to address their differential regulation of transactivation in cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons. The efficacies of both GSK-3 isoforms in regulating various transcription factors were compared, and new GSK-3-targeted transcription factors oppositely regulated by these two isoforms were identified. Rat Primary Cerebral Cortical Culture and Cell Culture for Human SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells—Cerebral cortical neurons prepared from 18-day-old embryonic rats were cultured as described previously (15Hashimoto R. Hough C. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Chuang D.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, dissociated cortical cells were collected by centrifugation at 80 × g and seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated culture plates. Cortical neurons were used for siRNA transfection after 9 days in vitro (DIV) unless otherwise indicated. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. Cells with a passage number ranging from 102 to 105 were used in the studies. Plasmid DNA—Reporter plasmids pEgr1-Luc and pSmad3/4-Luc were obtained from Panomics (Redwood city, CA). Reporter construct pRL-TK was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). TCF reporter plasmid and mutant Tcf reporter plasmid (TOPflash and FOPflash, respectively) were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Mercury Pathway Profiling Luciferase System 1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) including reporter constructs pAP-1-Luc, pCRE-Luc, pGRE-Luc, pNF-κB-Luc, and pHSE-Luc was used in conjunction with the silencing of GSK-3 isoform in studies of transcriptional regulation. Wild-type GSK-3α and its dominant negative mutant (hGSK3α/pMT2 and hGSK3α/pMT2-KR, respectively) were obtained from Dr. Peter S. Klein (University of Pennsylvania) with the kind permission of Dr. James R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). Wild-type GSK-3β (pAdTrack-CMV-GSK-3β) was supplied by Dr. Ratan V. Bhat (AstraZeneca R&D, Södertälje, Sweden). Two dominant negative mutants (pAdTrack-CMV-GSK-3β-K85R and pAdTrack-CMV-GSK-3β-R96A) for GSK-3β were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GSK-3β wild-type and two dominant negative mutants were subsequently subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to obtain the three plasmids used in this study, pEGFP-GSK-3β, pEGFP-GSK-3β-K85R, and pEGFP-GSK-3β-R96A. siRNA Preparation and GSK-3 Inhibitors—Several siRNAs targeting either isoform of GSK-3 were designed according to GenBank™ accession numbers (NM_017344 for rat GSK-3α and NM_032080 for rat GSK-3β; NM_019884 for human GSK-3α and NM_002093 for human GSK-3β) and chemically synthesized (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). The target sequences for the rat-specific GSK-3 siRNAs are as follows: αP747, TCACTTTACCAAGGCCAAG; αP1269, CTTCAGTCCTGGTGAACTT; αP1375, GCTTTAACTGAGACTCAGA; βP555, CCTCTTGCTGGATCCTGAT; βP514, GGTCTACCTTAACCTGGTG; βP1093, GAACTGTCAAGTAACCCAC. The siRNA mixture specific to either GSK-3 isoform consists of the three species of siRNAs described above and was used in all silencing experiments. An siRNA control (CONTROL non-targeting siRNA 1; Dharmacon) was used as an RNA interference control for all siRNA transfection experiments in both rat neurons and human neuroblastoma cells. Two structurally similar ATP-competitive GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and SB41286, were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Transfection Assays and Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—Rat primary cortical cultures were evenly plated and cultured for 9 DIV before transfection for 48 h with 80 nm siRNA using 8 μl of siPORT Amine transfection reagent (Ambion) in one ml of the transfection mixture. Transfection of luciferase reporter constructs and co-transfections of reporter plasmids with GSK-3 expression vectors (wild-type or dominant negative mutants) into primary cortical neurons were established using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) in conjunction with a rat neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa) at the time of cell plating. Co-transfections of luciferase reporter plasmids and GSK-3 expression vectors or siRNAs into SH-SY5Y cells were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Dual luciferase assay was performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Routinely, dual reporter-transfected cortical neurons were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to the detection of firefly luciferase activity and, subsequently, Renilla luciferase activity, which serves as an internal control. Luciferase activities were determined by using a plate-reading luminometer (Packard Bioscience Company, Downers Grove, IL), and the activities of the experimental reporter were normalized to the activities of the background Renilla luciferase. Transcription Factor-DNA Array I Analysis—Cortical neurons at 9 DIV were transfected with siRNA for GSK-3α or GSK-3β for 48 h. Cells were collected and nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Panomics) for analysis with the TranSignal™ protein-DNA array I (Panomics). The procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modification in the horseradish peroxidase detection process in which DNA Thunder™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) was used. Quantitative array results showing more than 2-fold alterations in transcription factor-DNA binding were selected as positive for further confirmation using the reporter activity assay. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cortical neurons were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Antibodies against PAI-1, β-actin, β-catenin, and Bcl-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against GSK-3α was obtained from Upstate. Antibodies against GSK-3α, pCREB(Ser133), and CREB were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to obtain Western blot signals, and autoradiographs were scanned. Intensity of immunoblot signals was analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Image for Windows, NIH). Statistical Analysis—All results presented are mean ± S.E. from three to four independent experiments, with three or four replicates for each data point. The results were analyzed for statistical significance in GraphPad InStat (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. In analysis of variance, a Q-Q plot was adopted for normal distribution tests. We investigated whether the GSK-3 isoforms are differentially involved in the regulation of transcription factors known to be modulated by GSK-3. Isoform-specific rat GSK-3 siRNAs were designed and synthesized. Western blotting was performed to assess the silencing effects of siRNA for GSK-3α or GSK-3β. Transfection of cortical neurons with different amounts of siRNA cocktails for either GSK-3α or GSK-3β resulted in knockdown of their respective proteins 48 h after transfection, whereas protein levels of the non-targeted GSK-3 isoforms were unaffected (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cortical neurons with 80 nm siRNA cocktails for GSK-3α and GSK-3β caused 76 ± 14% (n = 5) and 81 ± 11% (n = 5) protein depletion of 3α and 3β isoforms, respectively. Thus, the magnitudes of protein reduction by specific siRNA treatments are similar for these two GSK-3 isoforms. As measured by luciferase reporter assay, silencing GSK-3α and GSK-3β with their specific siRNAs was found to cause 7.5- and 3-fold activation of CRE-responsive transcription, respectively (Fig. 1B). NF-κB-responsive transcription was also more robustly activated by GSK-3α silencing than by GSK-3β silencing (6-fold versus 2-fold). Transcription of other responsive cis-element-containing reporter constructs, including TCF, AP-1, GRE, and HSE, was activated to various extents by GSK-3 silencing. Their degrees of activation were similar between the two isoforms using siRNA for either GSK-3α or GSK-3β. By using dominant negative mutants of GSK-3α and GSK-3β, the differential activation of CRE- and NF-κB-dependent transcription by isoform-specific GSK-3 gene silencing was confirmed (Fig. 1C). Thus, a GSK-3α dominant negative mutant produced a greater transcriptional activation of CREB and NF-κB than two GSK-3β dominant negative mutants (GSK-3β K85R and GSK-3β R96A) (Fig. 1C). Conversely, transfection with either wild-type GSK-3α or wild-type GSK-3β resulted in the reduction of both CRE- and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activities. Transfection of cortical neurons with isoform-specific siRNAs for 48 h caused a modest increase in protein levels of pCREB(Ser133) and Bcl-2, a target gene of CRE-dependent transcription, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the increase of protein levels of both pCREB-(Ser133) and Bcl-2 was slightly greater in cortical neurons transfected with 80 nm GSK-3α siRNA compared with transfection with GSK-3β siRNA. These results are thus compatible with our observations indicating a higher magnitude of CRE-dependent transactivation resulting from GSK-3α gene silencing. On the other hand, a similar magnitude of a dose-dependent increase in the levels of β-catenin, a transcription factor associated with TCF or lymphoid enhancer factor 1 to regulate TCF-dependent transactivation, was observed in cortical neurons transfected with siRNA for either GSK-3 isoform (Fig. 1D). These results further support our observations that showed similar effects of protein depletion of either GSK-3 isoform on TCF-dependent transactivation (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of both GSK-3 isoforms by two ATP-competitive GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and SB415286, at various concentrations was carried out to examine the up-regulating effects of inhibitors on CRE- and NF-κB-dependent transactivation. As shown in Fig. 2A, we observed increased CRE-dependent transcription with a similar magnitude in a concentration-dependent manner. Comparable results were obtained for NF-κB-dependent transactivation (Fig. 2B). Treatment with GSK-3 inhibitors (3 μm SB216763 and 10 μm SB415286) resulted in modest activation of TCF-, AP-1-, GRE-, and HSE-responsive transcription in cortical neurons, supporting a regulatory role for GSK-3 in these four signaling pathways (Fig. 2C). Treatment with these two GKS-3 inhibitors resulted in an increase in β-catenin protein levels, suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3 kinase activity did occur (Fig. 2D). Transfection of cortical neurons with dominant negative mutants of either GSK-3 isoform also enhanced GRE-responsive transcription (data not shown), confirming the inhibitory effect of GSK-3 in GRE-responsive signaling regulation. Next, in an effort to search for novel targets of GSK-3, cortical neurons were transfected with siRNA specific for GSK-3α or GSK-3β, and the nuclear extracts were analyzed for protein-DNA binding activities. Changes of DNA binding activity with transcription factors EGR-1 (also known as nerve growth factor, NGF-1A) and Smad3/4 were noted (Fig. 3). Binding activity of EGR-1-responsive element with EGR-1 was down-regulated by transfection with siRNA for GSK-3α but up-regulated by siRNA for GSK-3β compared with the non-targeting siRNA control. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the transcriptional activity of EGR-1 was decreased by GSK-3α siRNA and its dominant negative mutant but increased by GSK-3β siRNA and its dominant negative mutants (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the DNA binding activity of Smad3/4 was up-regulated by GSK-3α siRNA and appeared to be unaffected by GSK-3β siRNA. Moreover, the activity of Smad3/4-responsive transcription was enhanced by GSK-3α siRNA and its dominant negative mutant but slightly reduced by GSK-3β siRNA and its R96A mutant (Fig. 4B). Of interest, treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitors SB216763 and SB415286 resulted in an increase in Smad3/4 transcriptional activities, similar to the effects of GSK-3α. Differential transcriptional regulation of EGR-1 and Smad3/4 by GSK-3 isoforms was also confirmed using isoform-specific siRNA and dominant negative mutants in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4C) and further suggests that the opposite effects of these two isoforms in regulating transcription factors are not unique to cortical neurons.FIGURE 4Confirmation of differential regulation of EGR-1 and Smad3/4 transcriptional activities. A, confirmation of EGR-1 transcriptional activation with luciferase reporter assay. Cortical neurons at the time of plating were co-transfected with either 4 μg of pEGR-1-Luc reporter construct and GSK-3 expression vectors (wild-type or mutant) or with 4 μg of a pEGR-1-Luc reporter construct followed by transfection with 80 nm siRNA mixture for GSK-3α or GSK-3β at 9 DIV. The luciferase activities of cell lysates were determined at 11 DIV. B, confirmation of Smad3/4 transcriptional activation with luciferase reporter assay. Cortical neurons were either co-transfected with 4 μg of pSmad3/4-Luc reporter construct and GSK-3 expression vectors and then treated with GSK-3 inhibitors (3 μm SB216763 or 10 μm SB415286) at 6 DIV for 5 days or transfected with 80 nm siRNA mixture for GSK-3α or GSK-3β at 9 DIV. The luciferase activities of cell lysates were determined at 11 DIV. C, confirmation of EGR-1 and Smad3/4 transcriptional regulation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Cells were either co-transfected with reporter construct and GSK-3 expression vectors or co-transfected with reporter construct and human siRNA cocktails specific to either GSK-3 isoform at 9 DIV. The target sequences for those human-specific siRNA are: αP468, GTGGCTTACACGGACATCA; αP617, GCTGGACCACTGCAATATT; αP1132, CACCAACCCGGGAACAAAT; βP158, GTCAGCTATACAGACACTA; βP385, TCTGGTGCTGGACTATGTT; βP975, CTGCCCGACTAACACCACT. Luciferase activities of cell lysates were determined 48 h after transfection. Values shown represent means ± S.E. of % of control from three independent experiments. D, representative Western blotting analysis of protein levels of PAI-1 expression 48 h after siRNA transfection in cultured cortical neurons. β-actin was used as a protein-loading control. The immunoblot shown is representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The protein levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a Smad3/4-dependent TGF-β-regulated gene (16Buisson A. Lesne S. Docagne F. Ali C. Nicole O. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2003; 23: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was also differentially affected in cultured cortical neurons by GSK-3 isoform-specific siRNA gene silencing, similar to the effects on Smad3/4 signaling (Fig. 4D). Thus, PAI-1 protein levels were up-regulated by GSK-3α siRNA but down-regulated by GSK-3β siRNA (Fig. 4D), even though the effect of transactivation by GSK-3β protein depletion was small in cortical cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, the transcription factor serum-responsive element was detected to be differentially up-regulated by GSK-3α siRNA and GSK-3β siRNA (Fig. 3). Experiments are in progress to verify this effect by reporter analysis. The present study showed that inhibition of GSK-3α was more effective than that of GSK-3β in stimulating CREB- and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation. Moreover, we demonstrated differential changes in the transcriptional activation of two transcription factors, EGR-1 and Smad3/4, in response to either GSK-3α or GSK-3β silencing using simultaneous multiple transcription factor/DNA array technology. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence demonstrating the transcriptional modulation of EGR-1 and Smad3/4 by GSK-3. CREB has an important neurophysiological role, as it regulates the expression of proteins critically involved in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and cell fate (reviewed in Refs. 17Silva A.J. Kogan J.H. Frankland P.W. Kida S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 18Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 568: 821-861Crossref Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). CREB is transcriptionally activated by phosphorylation at Ser-133, a process catalyzed by a number of protein kinases and necessary for GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-129 (19Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that GSK-3β negatively regulates CREB activity (20Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 22Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our study not only supports this notion but also suggests that GSK-3α is more robust than GSK-3β in inhibiting CRE-responsive transcriptional regulation. There are conflicting results regarding the functional effects of GSK-3 on the phosphorylation of NF-κB, with some showing activation (12Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 23Deng J. Xia W. Miller S.A. Wen Y. Wang H.Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and others reporting inhibition (24Bournat J.C. Brown A.M. Soler A.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It also should be noted that NF-κB activation is not always associated with survival proteins. A number of studies have demonstrated that NF-κB activation is linked to neuronal death induced by insults such as quinolinic acid excitotoxicity in the rat striatum (25Qin J.Z. Chaturvedi V. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37957-37964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or cerebral ischemia in rodents (26Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that NF-κB is the only target known to be differentially regulated by two GSK-3 isoforms in a transgenic mouse model (12Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The diversity of the cellular functions of NF-κB and the complexity of the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity by GSK-3 underscore the need for further studies to clarify the roles for GSK-3 isoforms in NF-κB regulation. Our results suggest transcription factors Smad3 and EGR-1 as prospective substrates for GSK-3. Detection of potential phosphorylation sites by GSK-3 on EGR-1 and Smad3 using NetPhosK 1.0 server (27Blom N. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) further suggests possible direct regulation of these two transcription factors by GSK-3 (data not shown). Nine potential GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites of EGR-1 were found to reside on two main domains that are highly rich in serine/threonine residues. These sites are conserved among human, rat, mouse, and frog and constitute substrate recognition sites for GSK-3β. With Smad3, we found one tyrosine and three serine phosphorylation sites conserved among human, rat, mouse, frog, and fruit fly. Whether these two transcription factors are direct GSK-3 substrates and how they are regulated differentially by GSK-3 are currently being explored in our laboratory. EGR-1, a zinc finger transcription factor, has been implicated in diverse biological functions, including cell growth, differentiation (28Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 29Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (30Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar, 31Levkovitz Y. Baraban J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pignatelli M. Luna-Medina R. Perez-Rendon A. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule cells, the EGR-1 family of transcription factors plays a critical role in apoptosis by facilitating c-Jun activation (31Levkovitz Y. Baraban J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGR-1 was also reported to promote p73-mediated apoptosis in N2A cells (32Pignatelli M. Luna-Medina R. Perez-Rendon A. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide-induced death of SH-SY5Y cells (33Cibelli G. Policastro V. Rossler O.G. Thiel G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, it also has been suggested that EGR-1 confers resistance to apoptotic stimuli in vivo and in vitro (34Hallahan D.E. Dunphy E. Virudachalam S. Sukhatme V.P. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Huang R.P. Fan Y. deBelle I. Ni Z. Matheny W. Adamson E.D.

Neurol. 2004; 185: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly, in the case of ischemia, EGR-1 is first up-regulated followed by a decline to a level below basal (36Carmel J.B. Kakinohana O. Mestril R. Young W. Marsala M. Hart R.P. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GSK-3 activation has been implicated in the pathology of cerebral stroke (37Sasaki C. Hayashi T. Zhang W.R. Warita H. Manabe Y. Sakai K. Abe K. Neurol. Res. 2001; 23: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that GSK-3α and GSK-3β isoforms may be involved in the fine-tuning of EGR-1 to maintain its homeostasis after cerebral ischemia. It has been reported that binding of TGF-β to its serine/threonine kinase receptors causes Smad2 and Smad3 to become phosphorylated. These phosphorylated Smad proteins then form a complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors to activate gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 38Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 675-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4836) Google Scholar, 39Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4297) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that GSK-3β-specific siRNA treatment did not significantly lower Smad3/4-dependent transcriptional activity in cortical culture (Fig. 4B), whereas a modest inhibition of Smad3/4 transactivation in SH-SY5Y cells treated with GSK-3β siRNA mixture was observed (Fig. 4C). Despite this variation, substantially suppressed Smad3/4 transactivation was detected in both cell types transfected with GSK-3β R96A dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4, B and C) and thus supports the divergent effects of these two isoforms in regulating Smad3/4-dependent transcription. The differential role of GSK-3 isoforms in TGF-mediated Smad3/4 signaling is further supported by the opposite effects of GSK-3α siRNA and GSK-3β siRNA on the protein levels of PAI-1, which binds and inactivates tissue-type plasminogen activators (tPA). Cytoprotective and harmful effects of the tPA-plasmin system in neurological conditions have been reported (40Tsirka S.E. Rogove A.D. Strickland S.

Moreover, a recent study suggests that tPA in the amygdala is involved in the anxiety-like behavior induced by stress (46Pawlak R. Magarinos A.M. Melchor J. McEwen B. Strickland S. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The divergent effects of GSK-3 isoforms on Smad3/4 transcriptional activity may suggest a critical role in neuropathophysiology and neuroprotection, as well as mood and anxiety regulation. In conclusion, our study shows that selective silencing or inhibiting of two GSK-3 isoforms results in differential effectiveness or even opposite effects in regulating certain transcription factors including novel GSK-3 targets. Given that aberrant GSK-3 activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, the development of isoform-specific inhibition or gene silencing seems to be essential for therapeutic intervention and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these categories of diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2034373123,"Amplification and overexpression of the E2F3 gene at 6p22 in human bladder cancer is associated with increased tumour stage, grade and proliferation index, and in prostate cancer E2F3 overexpression is linked to tumour aggressiveness. We first used small interfering RNA technology to confirm the potential importance of E2F3 overexpression in bladder cancer development. Knockdown of E2F3 expression in bladder cells containing the 6p22 amplicon strongly reduced the extent of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and the rate of cellular proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of CDKAL1/FLJ20342, another proposed oncogene, from this amplicon had no effect. Expression cDNA microarray analysis on bladder cancer cells following E2F3 knockdown was then used to identify genes regulated by E2F3, leading to the identification of known E2F3 targets such as Cyclin A and CDC2 and novel targets including pituitary tumour transforming gene 1, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and Caveolin-2. For both bladder and prostate cancer, we have proposed that E2F3 protein overexpression may cooperate with removal of the E2F inhibitor retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) to drive cellular proliferation. In support of this model, we found that ectopic expression of E2F3a enhanced the BrdU incorporation, a marker of cellular proliferation rate, of prostate cancer DU145 cells, which lack pRB, but had no effect on the proliferation rate of PC3 prostate cancer cells that express wild-type pRB. BrdU incorporation in PC3 cells could, however, be increased by overexpressing E2F3a in cells depleted of pRB. When taken together, these observations indicate that E2F3 levels have a critical role in modifying cellular proliferation rate in human bladder and prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2089623849,"Sleep is commonly considered to support immune defense. The underlying sleep-immune interaction appears to rely critically on cytokines, like interleukin-6 (IL-6), that combine effects on immune and neuronal functions. The IL-6 signal is conveyed in two ways: it stimulates a restricted group of (mostly immune) cells via membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (mIL-6R) by forming a complex with soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), and it stimulates (via membrane-bound gp130) a great variety of other cell types--a process termed trans-signaling. Focusing on the receptor side of IL-6 signaling, we examined the effect of sleep on sIL-6R plasma concentrations, mIL-6R expression, plasma sgp130, and numbers of IL-6-producing monocytes in healthy humans who were tested during a regular sleep-wake cycle and 24 h of wakefulness while blood was sampled repeatedly. Sleep strongly enhanced concentrations of sIL-6R, exceeding wake levels by 70% at the end of sleep. This rise was due to an increase in the PC (proteolytic cleavage) rather than the DS (differentially spliced) variant of sIL-6R. Sleep did not affect IL-6-producing monocytes, mIL-6R density, or sgp130 concentrations. The selective increase in sIL-6R implicates an enhanced trans-signaling capacity whereby sleep distinctly widens the profile of IL-6 actions, enabling an integrated influence on brain and peripheral organs."

https://openalex.org/W2033896109,"Glucose is the main sugar transport form in animals, whereas plants use sucrose to supply non-photosynthetic organs with carbon skeletons and energy. Many aspects of sucrose transport, metabolism, and signaling are not well understood, including the route of sucrose efflux from leaf mesophyll cells and transport across vacuolar membranes. Tools that can detect sucrose with high spatial and temporal resolution in intact organs may help elucidate the players involved. Here, FRET sensors were generated by fusing putative sucrose-binding proteins to green fluorescent protein variants. Plant-associated bacteria such as Rhizobium and Agrobacterium can use sucrose as a nutrient source; sugar-binding proteins were, thus, used as scaffolds for developing sucrose nanosensors. Among a set of putative sucrose-binding protein genes cloned in between eCFP and eYFP and tested for sugar-dependent FRET changes, an Agrobacterium sugar-binding protein bound sucrose with 4 μm affinity. This FLIPsuc-4μ protein also recognized other sugars including maltose, trehalose, and turanose and, with lower efficiency, glucose and palatinose. Homology modeling enabled the prediction of binding pocket mutations to modulate the relative affinity of FLIPsuc-4μ for sucrose, maltose, and glucose. Mutant nanosensors showed up to 50- and 11-fold increases in specificity for sucrose over maltose and glucose, respectively, and the sucrose binding affinity was simultaneously decreased to allow detection in the physiological range. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the sucrose nanosensor was improved by linker engineering. This novel reagent complements FLIPs for glucose, maltose, ribose, glutamate, and phosphate and will be used for analysis of sucrose-derived carbon flux in bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal cells.

This novel reagent complements FLIPs for glucose, maltose, ribose, glutamate, and phosphate and will be used for analysis of sucrose-derived carbon flux in bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal cells. Sucrose is the major transported form of carbohydrates in plants. Also, many microorganisms including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae use plant-derived sucrose as a carbon and energy source. Yeast uses both secreted and cytosolic invertases to hydrolyze sucrose and take up the resulting hexoses. In the mammalian intestine sucrose is cleaved extracellularly and taken up in the form of hexoses as well. The transport mechanism of sucrose in plants has been studied, and H+-sucrose co-transporters have been cloned and characterized (1Lalonde S. Wipf D. Frommer W.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 341-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Even though much has been discovered about phloem import of sucrose, essentially nothing is known about the export from photosynthetic mesophyll cells. Although it is conceivable that the H+-coupled transporters can work in reverse for exporting sucrose from the phloem in “sink” tissues, direct evidence of this as the major export route is lacking (2Carpaneto A. Geiger D. Bamberg E. Sauer N. Fromm J. Hedrich R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21437-21443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Kühn C. Hajirezaei M.R. Fernie A.R. Roessner-Tunali U. Czechowski T. Hirner B. Frommer W.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, the microscopic distribution of sucrose within cellular compartments is largely unknown. Many components of complex sugar signaling networks have been discovered in yeast, but little progress has been made in identifying the corresponding players in plants. Proteomics has identified candidates for sugar transport across tonoplast membranes, but direct proof for a function in sugar transport across the tonoplast membrane is still lacking (4Endler A. Meyer S. Schelbert S. Schneider T. Weschke W. Peters S.W. Keller F. Baginsky S. Martinoia E. Schmidt U.G. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that sucrose is transported across the plastid membranes, but the transporters are not known (5Gerrits N. Turk S.C. van Dun K.P. Hulleman S.H. Visser R.G. Weisbeek P.J. Smeekens S.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus multiple transporters still await identification and characterization, and the regulation of sucrose transport both across the plasma membrane and among compartments is not well understood. Methods and reagents for real-time tracking of sucrose and its metabolites in living tissue with subcellular resolution would facilitate analysis of these fundamental questions; unfortunately, no currently available technology addresses these issues in a satisfactory manner. Non-aqueous fractionation is static and invasive, has no cellular resolution, and is sensitive to artifacts (6Fehr M. Okumoto S. Deuschle K. Lager I. Looger L.L. Persson J. Kozhukh L. Lalonde S. Frommer W.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography provide dynamic data but have poor spatial resolution and sensitivity. The development of genetically encoded molecular FLIPs (fluorescent indicator proteins; also termed nanosensors as distinct from endogenous “sensor” proteins, which regulate response to environmental factors), which transduce the interaction of a target molecule with a recognition element into a macroscopic observable via allosteric regulation of one or more reporter elements, offers potential solutions to all of the above issues. Recognition elements are taken from the set of all binding proteins, including receptors and enzymes and protein or peptide ligands and substrates of other proteins, as in the use of a specific target sequence in the construction of a sensor for protease activity (7Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sterically separated donor-acceptor FRET pairs of fluorescent proteins (green fluorescent protein spectral variants or otherwise) can be used as spectroscopic reporter elements (8Fehr M. Frommer W.B. Lalonde S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9846-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We have recently constructed a family of genetically encoded FRET sensors (all without conformational actuator) and demonstrated the generalizability of the method to a variety of analytes. Members of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein (PBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PBP, periplasmic-binding protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpho-linepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: PBP, periplasmic-binding protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpho-linepropanesulfonic acid. superfamily recognize hundreds of ligands with high affinity (atto- to low micromolar) and specificity (9Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBPs have been shown by a variety of experimental techniques to undergo a significant conformational change upon ligand binding; direct linear fusion of an individual sugar binding PBP with a pair of green fluorescent protein variants has produced FLIPs for maltose, glucose, and ribose (8Fehr M. Frommer W.B. Lalonde S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9846-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Fehr M. Lalonde S. Lager I. Wolff M.W. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The expression of the sensors has been shown to be sufficient for good signal-to-noise in yeast, animal, and plant cells (8Fehr M. Frommer W.B. Lalonde S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9846-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Fehr M. Takanaga H. Ehrhardt D.W. Frommer W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11102-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Deuschle K. Chaudhuri B. Okumoto S. Lager I. Lalonde S. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, expression has not been high enough to grossly perturb metabolism, as deduced from normal growth characteristics and indistinguishable phenotype. The nanosensors were used to measure sugar uptake and homeostasis in living animal cells, to determine subcellular analyte levels with nuclear-targeted versions (14Fehr M. Lalonde S. Ehrhardt D.W. Frommer W.B. J. Fluoresc. 2004; 14: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and to elucidate the presence of a high capacity bi-directional glucose transport system across the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (12Fehr M. Takanaga H. Ehrhardt D.W. Frommer W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11102-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, using transgene-silencing mutants the glucose nanosensors were successfully expressed in plants and used to determine steady-state glucose levels in leaf epidermis and intact roots (13Deuschle K. Chaudhuri B. Okumoto S. Lager I. Lalonde S. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In roots, sensors with affinities of 170 nm, 2 μm, and 600 μm responded to perfusion of the organs with glucose. Interestingly, steady-state levels in roots dropped below 100 nm; thus at least 100,000-fold lower than expected based on other studies. The availability of FRET-based sucrose nanosensors would complement this set of tools by facilitating the determination of steady-state sucrose levels and the kinetics of sucrose uptake, metabolism, and compartmentation. Plant-associated bacteria can take up α-glucosides such as sucrose and α-galactosides such as raffinose via ABC transporters with the help of periplasmic-binding proteins (15Barra L. Pica N. Gouffi K. Walker G.C. Blanco C. Trautwetter A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 229: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Gage D.J. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5739-5748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sugars may serve as nutrient sources or as osmo-protectants for bacteria growing in the rhizosphere of their host plants. Disaccharide uptake seems to be critical for bacterial colonization of plant roots (17Jensen J.B. Peters N.K. Bhuvaneswari T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of the putative α-galactoside-binding protein AgpA from Rhizobium meliloti is induced by α-galactosides (16Gage D.J. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5739-5748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aglEFGAK operon from Sinorhizobium meliloti encodes an α-glucosidase and a PBP-dependent transport system for α-glucosides, particularly sucrose, trehalose, and maltose (18Willis L.B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4176-4184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is inducible by sucrose and trehalose (17Jensen J.B. Peters N.K. Bhuvaneswari T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Willis L.B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4176-4184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ThuEFGK operon of S. meliloti encodes a similar set of genes, including a binding protein SmThuE and a transporter of sucrose, trehalose, and maltose (17Jensen J.B. Peters N.K. Bhuvaneswari T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A mutant defective in thuE was impaired in growth on trehalose and maltose, whereas growth on sucrose and glucose appeared unaffected. Cosmid-borne Agl genes mediate uptake of radio-labeled sucrose into Ralstonia eutropha cells (18Willis L.B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4176-4184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no direct evidence has been provided yet, it is likely that the binding proteins AgpA, AglE, and ThuE recognize sucrose. Because plants contain high levels of sucrose but lower levels of maltose, trehalose, or other glucosides, the Thu and Agl systems may have overlapping specificities for disaccharides, and it is suspected that the Thu system recognizes trehalose with highest affinity, whereas the Agl system may be more important in sucrose transport (17Jensen J.B. Peters N.K. Bhuvaneswari T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Willis L.B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4176-4184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A redundant set of sugar-transport operons may allow for optimal import of carbohydrates from the environment, with the relative affinities tuned to sugar abundance. Therefore, SmAglE, SmThuE, and its homologues were tested by linear fusion to eCFP and eYFP for their suitability as scaffolds for the development of a FLIP nanosensor for sucrose. This system provides a reliable assay for specificity and was used to identify a chimera able to bind sucrose. As suggested by the potential functional overlap of the Thu and Agl operons, the nanosensor recognizes a spectrum of α-glucosides. Rational design on the basis of a homology model was used to improve the selectivity of the nanosensor for sucrose. FLIPsuc Constructs and Plasmids—A PCR product from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1) genomic DNA encoding mature AtThuE without a stop codon was cloned into the KpnI site between eCFP and eYFP genes replacing EcmglB in the FLIPglu-600μ cassette (10Fehr M. Lalonde S. Lager I. Wolff M.W. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19127-19133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The chimeric gene was inserted into pRSET (Invitrogen) and transferred to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold (Stratagene). The AtThuE sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and was found to carry a N192D substitution relative to the published sequence. Because N192D is outside the binding pocket in the modeled structure and since AtThuE carrying the mutation is functional as a sugar nanosensor (see Tab. 1), all further experiments were carried out with the FLIPsuc carrying the mutation N192D, dubbed FLIPsuc-4μ. Mutants with F113A, D115A, D115E, D115N, W244A, Y246A, and W283A substitutions were generated using Kunkel mutagenesis (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) in the FLIPsuc-4μ background. Constructs with shortened linkers between the green fluorescent protein variants and ThuE were created from FLIPsuc-90μ. FLIPsuc-90μΔ1 was created by sub-cloning AtThuE into FLIPglu-600μΔ5 (20Deuschle K. Okumoto S. Fehr M. Looger L.L. Kozhukh L. Frommer W.B. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with KpnI, which created a construct with 13 amino acids deleted from the linkers. FLIPsuc-90μΔ2 was created by shortening the linkers to the same length as in FLIPglu-600μΔ13, yielding a nanosensor with linkers 25 amino acids shorter (20Deuschle K. Okumoto S. Fehr M. Looger L.L. Kozhukh L. Frommer W.B. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). FLIPsuc proteins were extracted from BL21(DE3) Gold and purified as described (8Fehr M.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Characterization of FLIPsuc—Ligand titration curves and ligand specificity analysis were performed on a Safire (Tecan) fluorimeter. eCFP was excited at 433 nm, with emission maxima of 485 and 528 nm for eCFP and eYFP, respectively (bandwidth 12 nm). FRET was determined as eYFP/eCFP emission intensity ratio. Using the change in ratio upon ligand binding, the Kd of each FLIP was determined by fitting ligand titration curves to a single-site binding isotherm: S = (r - rapo)/(rsat - rapo) = [L]/(Kd + [L]), where S is saturation, [L] is ligand concentration, r is ratio, rapo is ratio in the absence of ligand, and rsat is ratio at saturation with ligand. Analyses were carried out with at least two independent protein preparations; for each protein at least two titrations were performed. Homology Modeling—In the absence of structural information for AtThuE, a homology model was created based on the sequence similarity with the maltose/trehalose-binding protein of Thermococcus litoralis (TlMalE; solved in complex with trehalose; PDB code 1EU8; sequence alignment, Fig. 1; binding pocket model, Fig. 4). Protein side chains in the binding pocket were modeled using a backbone-independent rotamer library (23Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and a semi-empirical force field (24Heineke D. Wildenberger K. Sonnewald U. Willmitzer L. Heldt H.W. Planta. 1994; 194: 29-33Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar); modeling was performed in the presence of the trehalose conformer from the 1EU8 structure. Structural models were made for maltose and sucrose by taking coordinates from the E. coli maltose-binding protein (PDB code 1ANF) and a sucrose-specific porin (PDB code 1A0T), respectively, and generating a small ensemble of ligand conformers by uniform sampling around the two rotatable disaccharide bonds. These ligand ensembles together with a model of glucose taken from the non-anomeric glucosyl moiety of the trehalose ligand of the 1EU8 structure were superimposed onto trehalose using the non-anomeric glucosyl as a template. For each ligand, poses sterically clashing with the modeled binding pocket were removed, leaving a single best conformer for each sugar (Fig. 4). All modeling was performed with in-house software (to be published).FIGURE 4Homology model of AtThuE in complex with maltose, sucrose, and glucose.

The isolated fusion protein exhibited no discernible FRET, suggesting that protein stability may have been compromised. We have previously observed that within a binding protein family, only a subset may be facilely converted to working FRET sensors by simple linear fusion of chromophore variants 3H. Gu, S. Lalonde, S. Okumoto, L. L. Looger, A. M. Scharff-Poulsen, A. R. Grossman, J. Kossmann, I. Jakobsen, and W. B. Frommer, submitted for publication. ; putative nanosensors may fail to show detectable FRET or show FRET but no ligand-dependent FRET change. SmAglE was fused in a similar manner but provided a FLIP with an extremely low starting ratio of ∼0.7 and a sucrose-induced ratio change of only 0.05 (data not shown). Data base searches identified an A. tumefaciens protein closely related to SmThuE (GenBank™ NP_533835) (Fig. 1). AtThuE and SmThuE are 81% identical over the predicted open reading frames. SignalP 3.0 was used to predict the secretion signal sequences. AtThuE is also homologous to the malE maltose-binding proteins from E. coli and T. litoralis (E. coli, 21% identical; T. litoralis, 34% identical; both structures are known; Fig. 1). AtThuE was converted into a linearly fused FRET sensor by expression as a fusion between N-terminal eCFP and C-terminal eYFP fluorophores as before (Fig. 2A). The resulting chimera (designated FLIPsuc-4μ) functioned as a viable sucrose nanosensor, showing a sucrose-dependent decrease in eYFP/eCFP FRET ratio of 0.2 (Fig. 2, B and C; Table 1: apo-, 1.9; sucrose-saturated, 1.7), a Hill coefficient of 1.04, and a sucrose binding affinity of 4 μm. Due to the sequence homology with the E. coli maltose-binding protein, one might naively expect that the AtThuE nanosensor would behave similarly to the previous maltose nanosensor, which showed a maltose-dependent increase in FRET efficiency, consistent with the model of the fluorophore closer proximity in the closed, relative to the open conformation (8Fehr M. Frommer W.B. Lalonde S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9846-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Point mutations and single amino acid deletions in the binding protein-fluorophore linker sequences can alter both the sign and magnitude of the signal change (20Deuschle K. Okumoto S. Fehr M.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); it thus appears that more subtle effects than the macroscopic change in fluorophore separation contribute to the observed signal change. Ligand Binding Specificity of FLIPsuc—The determination of ligand concentrations in complex mixtures, e.g. the cytoplasm of living cells, requires nanosensors with high specificity for their target ligand. The AtThuE-based FLIPsuc nanosensor was screened on the basis of its sucrose binding affinity; subsequently, a panel of related sugars was used to determine the specificity of the nanosensor. When incubated with 20 μm sugar, the FLIPsuc-4μ nanosensor showed a similar signal change for sucrose, maltose, trehalose, and turanose (Fig. 3). The nanosensor responded to glucose and palatinose but with a lower ratio change, indicating a lower binding affinity or altered ligand-bound closed conformation. Galactose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, and cellobiose did not give rise to ligand-dependent FRET changes even at concentrations of 50 times the sucrose affinity. Of the potentially interfering ligands, maltose and glucose were estimated to be present in the greatest concentration inside plant cells and, thus, were submitted to more careful analysis; trehalose levels in leaves are below the detection level under normal conditions (22Müller J. Aeschbacher R.A. Wingler A. Boller T. Wiemken A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Trehalose was, therefore, not tested further. Full ligand binding titrations were performed for sucrose, maltose, and glucose (Fig. 2C, Table 1); maltose bound an order of magnitude more tightly than sucrose (230 nm), whereas glucose bound an order of magnitude more weakly (27 μm). These results are consistent with the predicted role of ThuE in maltose uptake and with the lower affinity of a disaccharide-binding protein for a monosaccharide. FLIPsuc Mutants with Altered Ligand Binding Affinity and Specificity—Rational protein engineering was employed to increase the specificity of the FLIPsuc nanosensor for sucrose over the competing sugars maltose and glucose by altering the side chains directly interacting with the carbohydrate ligands. A homology model of AtThuE was generated based on sequence similarity to a protein of known structure. Interacting side chains were identified by visual inspection of the model, and mutations were proposed to alter binding to the three sugars (cf. “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4). Of the 16 residues directly contacting trehalose in TlMalE (thus, presumably involved in sugar recognition in AtThuE), 9 are conserved between TlMalE and AtThuE (Fig. 1). Of these, seven interact primarily with the non-anomeric, non-reducing glucosyl moiety of trehalose, consistent with the observed specificity of AtThuE for α-glucosides (Fig. 4). Five amino acid positions (113, 115, 244, 246, and 283; three contacting exclusively the reducing glucosyl moiety, two contacting both glucose rings; four conserved between AtThuE and TlMalE, one conservatively mutated) were selected for mutation to improve specificity for sucrose over maltose and glucose. Protein positions that can contribute side chains near areas of the “difference map” between the modeled poses of sucrose and maltose were selected for mutagenesis based on the assumption that mutants at these positions would be likely to alter binding specificity. Particular emphasis was placed on protein side chains that appeared to interfere with the docked sucrose pose, e.g. tryptophan 283. First, the five selected side chains were retracted to alanine to analyze the overall contribution of side-chain atoms to binding specificity. Four significantly altered the sugar binding specificity of AtThuE; for the fifth position (115) mutations to two other side chains (asparagine and glutamate) were constructed as well, for a total of seven AtThuE mutants in addition to the wild-type nanosensor. All eight proteins were purified from E. coli and tested for binding to sucrose, maltose, and glucose using the FRET assay (Fig. 5, Tables 1, 2). All seven mutants decreased affinity for all three sugars relative to the wild-type affinities, with the exception of a 2-fold increase in affinity of a single mutant (F113A) for maltose. A single mutant (D115N) abolished signaling for all three ligands, although whether binding affinity or the FRET signal transduction mechanism has been affected is unknown; this is the only protein position of the five in the “hinge” region of the binding pocket (23Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the open-to-closed conformational change of this mutant nanosensor has been perturbed, as other less sterically conservative mutations at this position do not abolish binding and signaling.TABLE 2Change in specificity of PLIPsuc mutantsNanosensorMutationSuc/MalSuc/GluFLIPsuc-10μF113A0.21.5FLIPsuc-90μW283A5011FLIPsuc-1mD115A0.61.6FLIPsuc-3mD115E8.60.4FLIPsuc-15mY246A0.060.005FLIPsuc-46mW244A9 Open table in a new tab The aspartate side-chain Asp115 is predicted to make good-geometry bidentate hydrogen bonds with both the HO2-hydroxyl of the non-anomeric glucosyl, and the HO3′-hydroxyl of the anomeric glucosyl of maltose; it is modeled to make a similar hydrogen bond with the HO1′ hydroxyl of sucrose (supplemental Fig. 1A). Mutation of this side chain to alanine has a modest 220-fold effect on maltose binding, suggesting solvent compensation for these hydrogen bonds; little effect on specificity is seen (less than 3-fold in all cases), consistent with the modeled equivalency of the hydrogen bonds. Mutation to glutamate has a more significant effect on maltose binding (6600-fold) and dramatically alters specificity. Specificity for glucose over sucrose is increased 2-fold and sucrose over maltose by 9-fold (Table 2). This is consistent with the modeled clash of the lengthened glutamate side chain on maltose binding (supplemental Fig. 1B), with less of an effect on sucrose, whose fructosyl group is modeled"

Here, we have investigated the molecular basis of BPDE-induced S-phase arrest. Chk1-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis in BPDE-treated cells occurred without detectable changes in Cdc25A levels, Cdk2 activity, or Cdc7/Dbf4 interaction. Overexpression studies showed that Cdc25A, cyclin A/Cdk2, and Cdc7/Dbf4 were not rate-limiting for DNA synthesis when the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint was active. To investigate other potential targets of the S-phase checkpoint, we tested the effects of BPDE on the chromatin association of DNA replication factors. The levels of chromatin-associated Cdc45 (but not soluble Cdc45) were reduced concomitantly with BPDE-induced Chk1 activation and inhibition of DNA synthesis. The chromatin association of Mcm7, Mcm10, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was unaffected by BPDE treatment. However, the association between Mcm7 and Cdc45 in the chromatin fraction was inhibited in BPDE-treated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated reduced association of Cdc45 with the β-globin origin of replication in BPDE-treated cells. The inhibitory effects of BPDE on DNA synthesis, Cdc45/Mcm7 associations, and interactions between Cdc45 and the β-globin locus were abrogated by the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01. Taken together, our results show that the association between Cdc45 and Mcm7 at origins of replication is negatively regulated by Chk1 in a Cdk2-independent manner. Therefore, Cdc45 is likely to be an important target of the Chk1-mediated S-phase checkpoint.

Therefore, Cdc45 is likely to be an important target of the Chk1-mediated S-phase checkpoint. Cells are continuously exposed to endogenous and exogenous sources of DNA damage. Unrepaired DNA damage can cause mutations and therefore poses a serious threat to genomic stability. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to minimize the detrimental effects of DNA damage. Cell cycle checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that respond to DNA damage by eliciting transient delays in the cell cycle (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). The resulting delays integrate DNA repair with cell cycle progression and are thought to be important for maintaining genomic stability. In response to genotoxins, the DNA damage response pathways prevent entry into S-phase (the G1/S checkpoint), slow progression through S-phase (the intra-S-phase or S-phase checkpoint), and block entry into mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint) (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Components of checkpoint signaling pathways are highly conserved in eukaryotes. DNA damage is detected by sensors (e.g. ATR/ATRIP, 9-1-1 complex, and ATM) with the aid of mediators (e.g. BRCA1, 53BP1, and Claspin). Sensors act upstream of transducers (e.g. Chk1 and Chk2), which in turn activate effectors (p53 and Cdc25A) that interact with cell cycle machinery to inhibit cell cycle progression (2Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). The S-phase checkpoint down-regulates initiation of DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage acquired during S-phase (3Larner J.M. Lee H. Little R.D. Dijkwel P.A. Schildkraut C.L. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We characterized previously an intra-S-phase checkpoint elicited by the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (4Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Benzo[a]pyrene undergoes intracellular metabolism to generate the reactive species benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide (BPDE) 2The abbreviations used are: BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide; DSB, double-strand break; IR, ionizing radiation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; HSR, homogeneously staining region; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Rb, retinoblastoma; RC, replication complex. 2The abbreviations used are: BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide; DSB, double-strand break; IR, ionizing radiation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; HSR, homogeneously staining region; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Rb, retinoblastoma; RC, replication complex. (5Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). BPDE reacts covalently with DNA to generate bulky adducts, mainly at N-2 of deoxyguanosine residues (6Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 7Dipple A. Khan Q.A. Page J.E. Ponten I. Szeliga J. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14: 103-111PubMed Google Scholar). Different doses of BPDE inhibit DNA synthesis via distinct mechanisms. Low concentrations of BPDE (<100 nm) inhibit initiation of DNA synthesis transiently, yet do not affect elongation of existing replicons (8Cordeiro-Stone M. Boyer J.C. Smith B.A. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the transient inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by <100 nm BPDE is an S-phase checkpoint that inhibits firing of origins of replication in response to DNA damage acquired during S-phase. We have shown that the checkpoint induced by low concentrations of BPDE is mediated via the Chk1 and 9-1-1 pathways (4Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weiss R.S. Leder P. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells eventually recover from the S-phase checkpoint, and low doses of BPDE do not affect cell viability (9Weiss R.S. Leder P. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, higher concentrations of BPDE (200–600 nm) inhibit initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication, resulting in an irreversible block to DNA synthesis and loss of viability (8Cordeiro-Stone M. Boyer J.C. Smith B.A. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 9-1-1, Chk1, and Chk2 pathways are strongly activated in response to 600 nm BPDE. However, the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by 600 nm BPDE is not due to checkpoint signaling, but instead results from global blocks to the progression of DNA polymerases by BPDE adducts (8Cordeiro-Stone M. Boyer J.C. Smith B.A. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent effects of BPDE on initiation and elongation are not unique to this agent. For instance, UVC doses of <2.6 J/m2 inhibit initiation of DNA synthesis without global effects on elongation (10Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 145: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar), whereas higher doses inhibit both initiation and elongation. The inhibition of replicon initiation by low doses of UVC light requires ATR and Chk1 (11Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because many checkpoint studies using UVC light are conducted with high doses (5–100 J/m2), it is not clear whether all the DNA damage signaling responses identified in such experiments are relevant to the S-phase checkpoint (i.e. inhibition of initiation) or whether they represent responses to replication blocks (inhibition of elongation). Downstream effectors of the Chk1-mediated S-phase checkpoint induced by bulky adducts (such as BPDE and UV light-induced thymine dimers) have not been identified. However, the mechanism of the DNA double-strand break (DSB)-responsive S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation (IR) has been described in detail. There is considerable evidence that Cdc25A, a tyrosine phosphatase that contributes to activation of Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) (12Busino L. Chiesa M. Draetta G.F. Donzelli M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), is targeted for degradation by IR-induced S-phase checkpoint signaling. IR-induced degradation of Cdc25A is thought to require the effector checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Basal turnover of Cdc25A requires ATR, Claspin, and Chk1 signaling (13Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Lukas J. Bartek J. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 941-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C-terminal phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Chk1 (together with N-terminal phosphorylation by an unknown kinase) targets Cdc25A to an SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex containing β-TrCP (15Busino L. Donzelli M. Chiesa M. Guardavaccaro D. Ganoth D. Dorrello N.V. Hershko A. Pagano M. Draetta G.F. Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L.

A. 2005; 102: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is thought that the DSB-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint targets Cdc25A through Chk2-mediated amplification of Chk1-dependent systems (13Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 18Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of Chk1 results in accumulation of hypophosphorylated Cdc25A and failure to degrade Cdc25A after IR (19Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The decrease in Cdk2 activity resulting from IR-induced Cdc25A degradation is likely to contribute to the S-phase checkpoint. Consistent with a Cdc25A/Cdk2-mediated mechanism for the S-phase checkpoint, the association of the Cdc45 replication factor with origins of replication (a late Cdk2-dependent event in initiation of DNA replication) is inhibited in response to IR concomitantly with Cdc25A degradation (20Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have demonstrated that Cdc25A is degraded in response to IR-induced DSBs (19Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether Cdc25A is degraded in response to other forms of DNA damage such as bulky adducts or whether it represents a universal target of S-phase checkpoint signaling pathways. Moreover, as noted above, BPDE and other genotoxins elicit dose-dependent inhibition of initiation (i.e. the S-phase checkpoint) and inhibition of elongation (i.e. replication blocks), yet it is unclear if Chk1-mediated Cdc25A degradation is involved in one or both responses. Another possible target of the S-phase checkpoint is the essential protein kinase Cdc7 (21Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cdc7 and its activating subunits (Dbf4 and Drf1) are required for DNA synthesis and appear to regulate initiation of replication at individual origins during S-phase (22Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which Cdc7 promotes initiation is not known. However, the Mcm2-7 complex is a substrate of Cdc7 in vitro and in intact cells (23Montagnoli A. Valsasina B. Brotherton D. Troiani S. Rainoldi S. Tenca P. Molinari A. Santocanale C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and is likely to be involved in Cdc7-mediated initiation of DNA synthesis. Several studies have suggested that Cdc7 is a target of S-phase checkpoint signaling. For example, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbf4 orthologs (Dfp1 and Dbf4, respectively) interact with checkpoint kinases, and yeast Dbf4 and Cdc7 mutants are sensitive to genotoxic agents (25Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Duncker B.P. Brown G.W. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Gautier and co-workers (27Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showed that Dbf4, the activating partner of the Cdc7 kinase, is targeted by DNA damage signaling in replication-competent Xenopus egg extracts. In those experiments, etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor) inhibited the association of Dbf4 with chromatin-bound Cdc7 concomitantly with inhibition of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, addition of exogenous Dbf4 allowed replication of etoposide-treated nuclei, demonstrating that Dbf4 is rate-limiting for DNA synthesis after etoposide treatment. Using Xenopus extracts, Dunphy and co-workers (28Yanow S.K. Gold D.A. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41083-41092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that Drf1 associates with chromatin in response to DNA damage and replication stress. Therefore, these workers have suggested that Drf1 might be involved in S-phase checkpoint responses and that its association with chromatin could provide a mechanism for S-phase inhibition. However, it is not yet clear whether Cdc7/Dbf4 is targeted by S-phase checkpoint signaling in response to all genotoxins or whether Cdc7 is involved in inhibition of initiation, replication blocks, or both responses. A recent study has suggested that Dbf4 is dispensable for DNA synthesis in Xenopus egg extracts (29Takahashi T.S. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), possibly indicating a requirement for alternative Dbf4-independent mechanisms for S-phase checkpoint control. Therefore, in the experiments described here, we investigated the possible roles of Cdc25A, Cdk2, and Cdc7/Dbf4 in the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint. We show that Cdc25A/Cdk2 and Cdc7/Dbf4 are affected by high doses of BPDE that inhibit elongation, but not by low doses of BPDE that induce Chk1-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis. Consistent with these results, we show that Cdc25A/Cdk2 and Cdc7/Dbf4 are not rate-limiting for DNA synthesis in cells treated with low doses of BPDE. To identify relevant targets of the S-phase checkpoint, we tested the effects of low dose BPDE treatment on the replication factors. Our results indicate that the association between the initiation factor Cdc45 and Mcm7 is targeted by the BPDE-induced S-phase checkpoint. Cell Culture—H1299, A549, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The Chinese hamster ovary-derived cell line A03_1 was maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.3 μm methotrexate (Calbiochem). Adenovirus Construction and Infection—Adenovirus construction and infections were performed as described previously (4Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNAs encoding cyclin A, Cdk2, and p21 were subcloned into pAC-CMV to generate shuttle vectors. The resulting constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells with the pJM17 plasmid to generate recombinant adenovirus as described previously (4Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). H1299 cells were routinely infected with 5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml adenovirus. As a control for adenovirus infection, cells received an empty adenovirus vector or an adenovirus vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Genotoxin Treatments—BPDE (NCI Carcinogen Repository) was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and added directly to the growth medium as a 1000-fold stock solution to give the final concentrations as indicated. In some experiments, cells were incubated in medium containing 5 mm caffeine (Sigma) or 150 nm UCN-01 for 1 h before genotoxin treatment. UVC treatments were performed using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene) as described previously (31Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The UVC dose delivered to the cells was confirmed with a UV radiometer (UVP Inc.). RNA Interference—The non-targeting control small interfering RNA (siRNA; catalog no. D-001210-01) and human Chk1 siRNA (CHEK1, SMARTpool, catalog no. M-003255-02) oligonucleotides were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfection experiments were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according the manufacturer's instructions. H1299 cells were transfected with 100 nm (final concentration) non-targeting control siRNA or Chk1 siRNA. 48 h following transfection, the cells were treated with genotoxin BPDE for 2 h, and the resulting cultures were used to analyze the expression levels of Cdc45 and Chk1. DNA Synthesis Assays—Cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes and grown to 60% confluence. Genotoxin treatments were performed as described above. To measure DNA synthesis at different time points after genotoxin treatment, replicate wells received [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min. At the end of the labeling period, the [3H]thymidine-containing medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were fixed by addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The fixed cells were washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [3H]thymidine. The trichloroacetic acid-fixed cells were solubilized in 0.3 n NaOH. A 300-μl aliquot of the NaOH-solubilized material was transferred to a scintillation vial and neutralized by addition of 100 μl of glacial acetic acid. After addition of 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid, incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by scintillation counting. Velocity Sedimentation Analysis—Velocity sedimentation analysis was performed as described previously by CordeiroStone et al. (32Cordeiro-Stone M. Frank A. Bryant M. Oguejiofor I. Hatch S.B. McDaniel L.D. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, H1299 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/60-mm plate with two plates per condition. Following a 30-h incubation with 10 nCi/ml [14C]thymidine (to provide an internal reference for the sucrose gradient centrifugation), the radiolabeled medium was replaced with unlabeled medium for 24 h. Cells were treated with either BPDE at the indicated concentrations or Me2SO for 1 h before pulsing with [3H]thymidine at 10 μCi/ml for 15 min. Cells were scraped into a solution of 0.1 m NaCl and 0.01 m EDTA (pH 8.0). 1 volume of 500 μl of buffer containing 0.5 m NaOH and 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0) was layered on top of a linear sucrose gradient (5–20%) and 500 μl of the cell suspension was added to this layer. Gradients were kept at 4 °C for 15 h under fluorescent lights and subsequently centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 4 h at 20°C. Approximately 28 equal fractions were collected and acid-precipitated on glass microfiber filters. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, cells were fractionated to generate soluble fractions and whole nuclei exactly as described by Izumi et al. (33Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, monolayers of cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1% Triton X-100) freshly supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Cytoskeleton lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were removed and further clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain Triton X-100-soluble fractions. The Triton X-100-extracted insoluble nuclear fractions were washed once with 1 ml of cytoskeleton buffer and then resuspended in a minimal volume of cytoskeleton buffer. In some experiments, chromatin-bound proteins were released by digestion of nuclei in cytoskeleton buffer with 1000 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 30 min. After digestion, soluble and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Total cell extracts and soluble or nuclear protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: anti-Cdc7 (MBL International Corp.); anti-Cdc25A, anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), anti-Mcm7, and anti-Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-phospho-Chk1 and anti-phospho-Chk2 (Ser317 and Thr68, respectively; Cell Signaling Technology); anti-Mcm10 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.); and anti-Cdc45 (34Pollok S. Stoepel J. Bauerschmidt C. Kremmer E. Nasheuer H.-P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Cdk2 Assays—These experiments were performed exactly as described by Rosenblatt et al. (35Rosenblatt J. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2824-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In brief, Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the washed immune complexes were incubated with histone H1 and [32P]ATP. Phosphorylated histone was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. To quantify Cdk2 activity, histone bands were excised from dried gels, and the amount of incorporated 32P was measured by Cerenkov counting. Chromatin Decondensation Assay—Chromatin decondensation analyses were performed exactly as described by Alexandrow and Hamlin (36Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using A03_1 cells. A03_1 cells contain a 90-megabase homogeneously staining region (HSR) consisting of 60 amplicons, each containing ∼400 kb of tandemly arrayed 14-kb lac operator/dihydrofolate reductase vector (37Li G. Sudlow G. Belmont A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The HSR can be visualized by providing the LacI protein. When visualized microscopically using an anti-Lac antibody, the HSR assumes a dot-like structure and is heterochromatic. The recruitment of Cdc45 to the HSR (using a LacI-Cdc45 fusion protein) induces a dramatic decondensation of the HSR (36Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of checkpoint signaling on Cdc45-induced chromatin decondensation, A03_1 cells were plated on glass slides, grown to 50% confluence, and then transfected with pRcLacI or pRcLacI-Cdc45 (5 μg/slide) for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000. In some experiments, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-Chk1 (or an empty vector as a control) was cotransfected at a 3:1 ratio with LacI-Cdc45. After 20 h of transfection, cells were treated with BPDE for 4 h and then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, the slides were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and incubated with anti-LacI monoclonal antibody (Upstate clone 9A5) at 1:2000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibody, the slides were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing VECTASHIELD medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To determine the relative numbers of cells containing condensed and decondensed chromatin structures, 200 cells were scored visually for each experimental condition according to the classification used by Alexandrow and Hamlin (36Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The HSR was considered to be condensed if the fluorescent image occupied 2–5% of the nuclear area, decondensed if it occupied >10% of the nuclear area, and indeterminate if it occupied 5–10% of the nuclear area. Representative cells showing condensed and decondensed HSRs were photographed using a DeltaVision image restoration microscopy system (Applied Precision, LLC). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—A 150-cm2 dish of H1299 cells was used for each ChIP. Subconfluent H1299 cells were treated with or without BPDE, caffeine, and UCN-01 as indicated in the figure legends. Genotoxin-treated cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to generate cross-linked DNA-protein complexes. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm for 10 min. The glycine-containing medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were scraped into a conical tube and collected by brief centrifugation. The resulting cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.4) and 0.1 m dithiothreitol, placed on ice for 5 min, and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and washed sequentially with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS; 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm EGTA; and finally 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 200 mm NaCl. The resulting cells were resuspended in 0.35 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture and incubated on ice for 15 min. The resulting lysates were sonicated on ice to shear the DNA into 1–2-kb fragments. Sonicated lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The clarified supernatants containing chromatin fragments were transferred to new tubes and normalized for protein content. 5% of each sheared chromatin sample was saved to provide an “input” control. The remainder of each chromatin solution was diluted to 1 ml with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl freshly supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Each sample was supplemented with 400 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Upstate) and 1% bovine serum albumin. Samples were then precleared with 40 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry for 4 h at 4 °C. Precleared samples were immunoprecipitated with 2–5 μg of rabbit anti-histone H4 antibody (Upstate) as a positive control for the immunoprecipitations, rabbit preimmune serum a"

https://openalex.org/W2030563820,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an intractable malignancy of CD4+ T cells that is etiologically associated with infection by human T-cell leukemia virus-type I. Most individuals in the chronic stage of ATL eventually undergo progression to a highly aggressive acute stage. To clarify the mechanism responsible for this stage progression, we isolated CD4+ cells from individuals in the chronic (n=19) or acute (n=22) stages of ATL and subjected them to profiling of gene expression with DNA microarrays containing >44,000 probe sets. Changes in chromosome copy number were also examined for 24 cell specimens with the use of microarrays harboring approximately 50,000 probe sets. Stage-dependent changes in gene expression profile and chromosome copy number were apparent. Furthermore, expression of the gene for MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), was shown to be specific to the acute stage of ATL, and the plasma concentration of HGF was increased in individuals in either the acute or chronic stage. HGF induced proliferation of a MET-positive ATL cell line, and this effect was blocked by antibodies to HGF. The HGF-MET signaling pathway is thus a potential therapeutic target for ATL."
https://openalex.org/W2080371053,"We have examined whether rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug, may exert part of its antifibrotic activity by directly targeting fibroblast extracellular matrix deposition. Incubation of human lung fibroblast (WI-26) cultures with rapamycin led to dose- and time-dependent reduction in the expression of types I and III collagens, both at the protein and mRNA levels. Rapamycin had no effect on collagen promoter activity but accelerated mRNA decay, indicating post-transcriptional control of collagen gene expression. In contrast, rapamycin significantly enhanced the expression of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) at the protein and mRNA levels and transcriptionally. We determined that rapamycin efficiently activates AP-1-driven transcription by rapidly inducing c-jun/AP-1 phosphorylation with activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, resulting in enhanced binding of AP-1·DNA complex formation and AP-1-dependent gene transactivation. Conversely, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited rapamycin-induced MMP-1 gene transactivation and AP-1/DNA interactions. A c-jun antisense expression vector efficiently prevented rapamycin-induced MMP-1 gene transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of either ERK or p38 MAPK pathways was without effect on rapamycin-induced MMP-1 gene expression. It thus appears that rapamycin may exert direct antifibrotic activities independent from its immunosuppressive action.

Fibrosis is a reactive process involving different pathophysiological events such as attraction of blood-born cells (e.g. leukocytes, platelets, activated lymphocytes), alteration of the microvasculature, and activation of resident mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes) leading to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. deposition (1Uitto J.

Possible explanations for the excessive deposition of collagen observed during the fibrotic process include both an increased biosynthesis or reduced degradation of ECM components, particularly that of fibrillar collagens, by fibroblasts. An accumulation of collagen may originate from accelerated production of collagen resulting from enhanced collagen gene transcription and/or mRNA stabilization in response to soluble factors present in the microenvironment. Alternatively, reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and subsequent inhibition of collagen degradation may also contribute to the fibrotic process (1Uitto J. Kouba D. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2000; 24: S60-S69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying molecules that may either affect collagen production negatively or MMP expression positively is of utmost importance to define novel therapeutic means against fibrosis. In this context, rapamycin (sirolimus), a Streptomyces fungus macrolide antibiotic with potent immunosuppressive properties, is currently used for the prevention of graft rejection in kidney transplant recipients (5Kahan B.D.

Several experimental studies have shown that rapamycin is also effective in preventing liver or pulmonary fibrogenesis in animal models (8Zhu J. Wu J. Frizell E. Liu S.L. Bashey R. Rubin R. Norton P.

Liver Int. 2004; 24: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At the cell membrane, rapamycin binds to the immunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP12). This rapamycin·FKBP12 complex interacts with the rapamycin binding domain of mTOR, a serine-threonine kinase, and thus inactivates mTOR known to control proteins that regulate mRNA translation initiation and G1 progression in T cells (11Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). mTOR is a transducer that may be initiated by insulin, growth factors, and amino acids to activate downstream targets and regulate cell growth and proliferation as well as metabolic homeostasis (12Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 13Jaeschke A. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 283-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 and 2 (S6K-1 and S6K-2) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) are downstream targets of mTOR. Rapamycin induces translational arrest by preventing phosphorylation of S6K-1 and 4E-BP1 by mTOR (14Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Investigations have demonstrated some anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppressive drugs, including rapamycin, suggesting that they may be considered as antifibrogenic (15Cardenas M.E. Zhu D. Heitman J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Sehgal S.N. Camardo J.S. Scarola J.A. Maida B.T. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of rapamycin on ECM gene expression remain poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the direct effects of rapamycin on fibrosis-associated genes in fibroblasts and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the modulation of ECM gene expression by rapamycin. We identify distinct mechanisms by which rapamycin modulates both the expression of fibrillar collagen genes and that of interstitial collagenase/MMP-1. Cell Cultures—Human lung fibroblasts (WI-26) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone™) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell Viability Assessment—Equal numbers of WI-26 fibroblasts were cultured in 96-well cell culture clusters and treated with various concentrations of rapamycin for 12, 24, and 48 h. Cell viability was measured using an MTS assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNase I treatment (25 units, 15 min) of total RNA was performed to eliminate genomic contamination of the RNA samples. One microgram of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using a RT-for-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBRGreen PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 min at 50 °C followed by 10 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, 1.5 min at 68 °C, and finally 15 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 63 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C. For each sample, gene expression was corrected against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level.

CAT activity was measured using [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate followed by thin layer chromatography and quantitation with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase activity was determined with a commercial assay kit (Promega). For high transfection efficiency of the pRSV-AS-c-jun expression vector, cells were electroporated with a Nucleofector™ (Amaxa GmbH, Köln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was estimated to be 80% by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of a cotransfected green, fluorescent protein expression vector (data not shown).

Western Bot Analyses—Total protein cell extract (30 μg) in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min before resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences), immunoblotted with either anti-type I collagen (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), anti-phospho-c-Jun, -c-Jun, -phospho-JNK, -JNK, -phospho-ERK, -ERK, -phospho-p38, -p38, or -actin (Sigma) antibodies, all at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline/5% nonfat milk for 1 h. Anti-phospho-c-Jun, -phospho-JNK, -phospho-ERK, -phospho-p38, -ERK, and -p38 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-c-Jun and -JNK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). After incubation, filters were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 h. Filters were then washed, developed according to chemiluminescence protocols (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and revealed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantative Determination of MMP-1 Production—The MMP-1 production in cell supernates was determined using the Quantikine Human pro-MMP-1 Immunoassay kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—A consensus AP-1 binding oligonucleotide (Promega) was used as a probe to detect AP-1/DNA interactions. Nuclear extracts were isolated using a small-scale preparation (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts (5–7 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Binding mixtures were separated electrophoretically on native 4% acrylamide gels. Reagents—Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma. The p38 and ERK inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was from Calbiochem. Rapamycin Inhibits Type I Collagen Production in Human Lung Fibroblasts—We first wanted to determine whether rapamycin had a direct effect on collagen production by fibroblasts. To address this point, WI-26 human lung fibroblast cultures were incubated with various concentrations of rapamycin, and type I collagen production was measured by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, total type I collagen production was reduced by rapamycin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Specifically, a decrease of 10 and 45% with a rapamycin concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and a decrease of 37 and 60% with a concentration of 1 μg/ml were respectively observed after 24 h (upper panel) and 48 h (lower panel) of treatment. Interestingly, even the smallest concentration of rapamycin (0.01 μg/ml) had a significant inhibitory activity after 48 h of incubation, suppressing collagen production by as much as 30%. To ensure that the inhibition of collagen production was not because of a cytotoxic effect of rapamycin, WI-26 fibroblasts were incubated for 6, 24, and 48 h with rapamycin concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml, and cell viability was determined at various time points. As shown in Fig. 1B, no significant cell mortality was observed at any of the concentrations tested over a 48-h period. Rapamycin Decreases COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA Steady-state Levels by Decreasing mRNA Stability and without Affecting Gene Transcription—To determine whether the reduction of fibrillar collagen production by rapamycin occurred via modulation of the corresponding genes, we first measured COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA steady-state levels following rapamycin treatment by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, rapamycin at a concentration of 1 μg/ml decreased COL1A1 (Fig. 2A), COL1A2 (Fig. 2B), and COL3A1 (Fig. 2C) mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner, the extent of inhibition reaching 48, 56, and 70%, respectively, after 48 h. To determine whether the effect of rapamycin on COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 expression takes place at the transcriptional level, transient cell transfections were performed with the collagen promoter/gene reporter constructs–2300COL1A1/CAT, –3500COL1A2/CAT, and –400COL3A1/CAT. As shown in Fig. 2, COL1A1 (Fig. 2D), COL1A2 (Fig. 2E), and COL3A1 (Fig. 2F), gene promoter activities were not altered by rapamycin, suggesting that the effect of rapamycin observed at the mRNA levels (see above) does not occur via transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes. We thus investigated whether rapamycin may affect the stability of COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNAs. For this purpose, fibroblasts were incubated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D for one hour prior to addition of rapamycin. mRNA decay was then measured in the absence or presence of rapamycin. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with rapamycin accelerated COL1A1 (Fig. 3A), COL1A2 (Fig. 3B), and COL3A1 (Fig. 3C) mRNA decay, thus significantly reducing their half-lives. COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA half-lives were estimated to be about 16 h in the absence of rapamycin and dropped to around or slightly below 6 h with rapamycin. Together, these results indicate that rapamycin inhibits fibroblast collagen production via post-transcriptional mechanisms that affect COL1A1, COL1A2 and COL3A1 mRNAs stability. Rapamycin Increases MMP-1 Gene Expression and Protein Synthesis—We first wanted to determine whether rapamycin had direct effect on MMP-1 synthesis. To address this point, MMP-1 protein production was measured using MMP-1 immunoassay approach. As shown in Fig. 4A, rapamycin treatment of WI-26 fibroblasts led to increase in MMP-1 protein production, up to 2.2- and 4.5-fold, respectively, after 48 and 72 h at the concentration of 1 μg/ml. We next determined whether rapamycin modulates MMP-1 and/or TIMP-1 gene expression. To address this point, the effects of rapamycin on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 mRNA steady-state levels were studied by quantitative RT-PCR. Rapamycin treatment of WI-26 fibroblasts led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in MMP-1 mRNA levels, up to 3.5-fold after 48 h at the concentration of 1 μg/ml (Fig. 4, B and C). On the other hand, TIMP-1 gene expression remained unaltered over the same incubation period (not shown). c-Jun Mediates Rapamycin-driven MMP-1 Gene Transcription—Most MMP genes exhibit promoter regions that are characterized by a functional AP-1 binding site around position –70 relative to the transcription initiation site that is critical for transcriptional regulation by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines (22Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The effect of rapamycin on MMP-1 promoter transactivation was examined in parallel transient cell transfection experiments using either a wild-type MMP-1 reporter construct–517MMP-1-lux or an AP-1 mutant not able to bind AP-1 proteins (23Schorpp M. Mattei M.G. Herr I. Gack S. Schaper J. Angel P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 5A demonstrate that the effect of rapamycin on MMP-1 gene expression was transcriptional, as rapamycin induced a 2.5-fold transactivation of the MMP-1 promoter. Furthermore, we determined that the integrity of MMP-1 promoter AP-1 binding site is necessary for transactivation by rapamycin that fails to transactivate the AP-1 mutant construct. Next, the effect of rapamycin on AP-1-driven transcription was examined in transient cell transfection experiments with an artificial, multimerized AP-1 reporter construct, pAP1-TA-lux. As shown in Fig. 5B, rapamycin enhanced pAP1-TA-lux activity ∼2.6-fold above control levels, attesting for the capacity of rapamycin to transactivate AP-1-dependent promoters. To determine whether rapamycin modulates AP-1/DNA interactions, EMSA experiments were carried out with a radio-labeled consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide as a probe. As shown in Fig. 5C, AP-1·DNA complexes were detected with nuclear extracts from unstimulated control WI-26 fibroblast cultures (lane 1). Rapamycin induced a 1.5-, 4.2-, and 6.5-fold elevation of AP-1·DNA binding complexes after 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h of treatment, respectively (lanes 2–4). To identify whether c-Jun, the main component of AP-1 complexes (24Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar), was present in the protein·DNA complex identified with the AP-1 probe, supershift experiments were performed with an anti-c-Jun antibody. Results presented in Fig. 5D indicate that the retarded band obtained with nuclear extracts from control extracts (lane 1) and elevated in nuclear extracts from rapamycin-treated fibroblasts (lane 3) is significantly reduced by the anti-c-Jun antibody (lanes 2 and 4), attesting for the presence of c-Jun in the complexes. To verify the implication of c-Jun in the activation of MMP-1 gene expression by rapamycin, an antisense c-jun expression vector, which specifically targets c-jun expression and no other Jun family member (19Mauviel A. Qiu Chen Y. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), was transfected into WI-26 fibroblasts prior to rapamycin treatment. Inhibition of c-Jun expression in antisense-transfected cells, treated or not with rapamycin, was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 6, inset). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of MMP-1 mRNA steady-state levels indicated a 95% reduction in rapamycin effect on MMP-1 gene expression when cells received the antisense c-jun vector prior to incubation with rapamycin (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in mediating rapamycin-dependent MMP-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. JNK Mediates Rapamycin-driven AP-1 Transcriptional Activity and Subsequent Modulation of MMP-1 Gene Expression—MAPKs act as signal transducers originating from numerous extracellular stimuli. MAPKs of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase family are critical determinants of the strength of AP-1-dependent transcription, as JNK phosphorylation of Jun protein members confers them maximal transcriptional potential (26Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schuck S. Soloaga A. Schratt G. Arthur J.S. Nordheim A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2003; 4: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Likewise, p38 and ERK contribute to potentiate Fos-mediated transcription (27Schuck S. Soloaga A. Schratt G. Arthur J.S. Nordheim A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2003; 4: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about their possible role downstream of rapamycin. Given the effects of rapamycin on AP-1-dependent transcription and the implication of the MMP-1 promoter AP-1 binding site in mediating rapamycin effect on MMP-1 gene expression, we investigated the capacity of rapamycin to induce c-Jun phosphorylation and JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 7A, rapamycin addition to WI-26 fibroblast cultures induced a rapid and prolonged phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63, detectable as early as 15 min following stimulation and persisting at least 2 h. Likewise, rapamycin efficiently and rapidly induced JNK phosphorylation with a very similar kinetic (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, rapamycin had no effect on p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 7C), whereas ERK phosphorylation was stimulated as early as 15 min, peaked at 30 min, and slowly came down to basal level over the 2-h period following rapamycin addition (Fig. 7D). To assess the role played by MAPKs in mediating rapamycin-driven induction of MMP-1 gene expression, we investigated the ability of specific inhibitors of the JNK, p38, and ERK pathways to alter rapamycin-driven MMP-1 gene expression. Results shown in Fig. 8A indicated that pretreatment of fibroblast cultures with the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 totally inhibited the effect of rapamycin on MMP-1 mRNA level. In contrast, the ERK and p38 inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 failed to suppress rapamycin effect. Next, in a similar experimental approach, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevented rapamycin-driven AP-1 transcriptional activity, as measured in transient cell transfection experiments with pAP-1-TA-lux (Fig. 8B), whereas the ERK and p38 inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 did not. Finally, EMSA experiments with a radiolabeled consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide demonstrated that a 1-h pretreatment with SP600125 abolished rapamycin-driven elevation of AP-1·DNA complexes (Fig. 8C, lane 4 versus lane 2). Together, these experiments demonstrate the critical and specific role played by the JNK pathway in mediating rapamycin effects on both AP-1-dependent transcription and MMP-1 gene expression in human lung fibroblasts. In this report, we provide evidence that the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, may exert direct antifibrotic activities both by down-regulating type I and type III collagen synthesis and by up-regulating MMP-1 synthesis. In accordance with a previous report showing that a mTOR-specific interfering RNA and a kinase dead mTOR decrease type I collagen steady-state mRNA levels (28Shegogue D. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23166-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that rapamycin inhibits COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 gene expression by decreasing their mRNA stability. Many reports demonstrated that collagen deposition is precisely controlled by collagen mRNA stabilization. For example, Krupsky et al. (29Krupsky M. Kuang P.P. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13864-13868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that COL1A1 mRNA stability is reduced by amino acid deprivation in lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, retinoic acid and prostaglandin E2, which decrease the uptake of amino acids transported, decrease the steady-state levels of COL1A1 mRNA by decreasing its stability (30Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J.L. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Varga J. Diaz-Perez A. Rosenbloom J. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the context of mTOR inhibition, Peng et al. (32Peng T. Golub T.R. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) have shown that deprivation of amino acids induces a cellular stress response similar to that elicited by rapamycin, supporting the conjecture that mTOR acts as a nutritional sensor, and that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, in some respects, mimics the signal induced by amino acid deprivation. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that FK506 significantly reduces the basal expression of the human COL1A2 mRNA levels in scleroderma fibroblasts by reducing their stability (33Asano Y. Ihn H. Yamane K. Jinnin M. Mimura Y. Tamaki K. Arthritis. Rheum. 2005; 52: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that rapamycin may be an interesting candidate drug for the treatment of fibrotic conditions because an increase in collagen mRNA stability contributes to elevated collagen levels in scleroderma fibroblasts (34Eckes B. Mauch C. Huppe G. Krieg T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that rapamycin increases MMP-1 gene expression. We provide definitive evidence for a direct role for the JNK/c-Jun pathway in mediating rapamycin effect at the transcriptional level through enhanced AP-1-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with our findings, it has been shown that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin induces rapid and sustained activation of JNK and consequently elevation of c-Jun phosphorylation in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines via 4E-BP1-dependent activation of the MKK4/7-JNK-c-Jun cascade (35Huang S. Shu L. Dilling M.B. Easton J. Harwood F.C. Ichijo H. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). With regard to JNK function in the context of antifibrotic properties, our findings are complementary to our recent works indicating that JNK, which is critical in conferring transcriptional activity to Jun proteins, is also instrumental in allowing these proteins to interfere with Smad-dependent gene transcription downstream of TGF-β, a major player in the development of tissue fibrosis (2Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2002; 4: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 211-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We specifically demonstrated that activators of the JNK pathway, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (36Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 5-FU (39Wendling J. Marchand A. Mauviel A. Verrecchia F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), antagonize TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression by preventing Smad/DNA interaction and related gene expression (2Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2002; 4: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 211-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be speculated that JNK activation by rapamycin may have a similar inhibiting effect on TGF-β-driven collagen production. In conclusion, we have identified that rapamycin may exert direct antifibrotic activities by molecular mechanisms that affect both matrix production and degradation by fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1977865817,"Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) belongs to a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate many aspects of metazoan life. Here we demonstrate that RXRα is a target substrate of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-specific protease, SUSP1, which is capable of controlling the transcriptional activity of RXRα. RXRα was modified by SUMO-1 in vivo as well as in vitro, and the Lys-108 residue within the IKPP sequence of RXRα AF-1 domain was identified as the major SUMO-1 acceptor site. Prevention of SUMO modification by Lys-to-Arg mutation led to an increase not only in the transcriptional activity of RXRα but also in the activity of its heterodimeric complex with retinoic acid receptor-α or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). SUSP1 co-localized with RXRα in the nucleus and removed SUMO-1 from RXRα but not from androgen receptor or PPARγ. Moreover, overexpression of SUSP1 caused an increase in the transcriptional activity of RXRα, whereas small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous SUSP1 led to a decrease in RXRα activity. These results suggest that SUSP1 plays an important role in the control of the transcriptional activity of RXRα and thus in the RXRα-mediated cellular processes.

RA exerts its effects through two classes of nuclear receptors acting as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators: the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which bind either all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-RA (9cRA); and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which bind 9cRA only. There are three RAR isotypes (α, β, and γ) and three RXR isotypes (α, β, and γ) encoded by distinct genes, and for each isotype there are at least two main isoforms, which differ in their N-terminal region. Each receptor has an N-terminal A/B region that harbors the ligand-independent activation function-1 (AF-1), a central C region containing a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal E region containing a ligand-binding domain and a ligand-dependent AF-2.RXRs play important roles in numerous nuclear receptor-dependent signaling pathways (3Szanto A. Benko S. Szatmari I. Balint B.L. Furtos I. Ruhl R. Molnar S. Csiba L. Garuti R. Calandra S. Larsson H. Diczfalusy U. Nagy L. Mol. Cell.

Not only can an RXR function as a homodimer but also as an obligate heterodimeric partner for many other receptors, including those for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, prostanoids, oxysterols, bile acids, and xenobiotics, as well as several orphan receptors. The homo- and heterodimeric complexes of RXR target specific DNA sequences known as hormone response elements. Correct receptor dimerization on target DNA is required for the recruitment of necessary co-activator or co-repressor proteins to the transcription complex (2Bastien J. Rochette-Egly C.

Mammalian cells contain at least three SUMO family members, SUMO-1/Smt3C, SUMO-2/Smt3A, and SUMO-3/Smt3B. Similar to ubiquitination, SUMO modification occurs through a three-step process involving SUMO activation by the E1 enzymes SAE1/SAE2, SUMO conjugation by the E2 enzyme UBC9, and SUMO ligation by E3-like ligases, including the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 (14Kirsh O.

Of these, many of the identified SUMO substrates are transcription factors or transcriptional co-regulators, and in numerous cases, modification with SUMO leads to attenuation of transcriptional activation.

Sequence analyses have suggested the presence of seven SUMO protease genes in mammals, which encode proteins with diverse N-terminal domain and conserved catalytic C-terminal domain. These enzymes include SENP3 (SMT3IP1), which localizes to the nucleolus (33Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); SUSP1 (SENP6), found primarily in the cytoplasm when GFP is fused to its N terminus (34Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); SENP1, which localizes to foci in the nucleus and the nuclear rim (35Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 692-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); and SENP2, found in at least in three different isoforms derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs (Axam, SMT3IP2/Axam2, SuPr-1). Axam localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (36Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and Axam2 and SuPr-1 have been detected in the cytosol and PML bodies, respectively (38Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Best J.L. Ganiatsas S. Agarwal S. Changou A. Salomoni P.

Substrate specificity between different SUMO-specific proteases has been suggested based on the observed differences in subcellular localization (12Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar).In the present studies we show that RXRα is covalently modified by SUMO-1 in vivo as well as in vitro and that this SUMO-1 modification negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the receptor. We further show that SUSP1 specifically removes SUMO-1 from RXRα and thereby enhances the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor. Thus, it appears that reversible SUMO modification serves as an important mechanism for regulation of RXRα-mediated transcriptional activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—pcDNA3-FLAG-RXRα was constructed by amplification of the RXRα coding sequence by PCR using a 5′ primer containing BglII site and a 3′ primer containing NotI site. The PCR fragment was ligated into BamHI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG. To eliminate the SUMO-1 acceptor site(s) in RXRα, Lys residues were replaced by Arg upon site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA3-FLAG-RXRα as the template. To generate RXRα deletion mutants (amino acid sequences 1–100, 1–200, 1–300, 1–400, 101–462, 201–462, 301–462 and 401–462), the PCR fragments corresponding to the sequences were ligated into BamHI and NotI sites in pcDNA3-FLAG. To obtain vectors expressing SUMO-1, the coding region for the mature form of SUMO-1 was amplified by PCR using primers containing BamHI and XhoI sites. The PCR fragments were ligated into pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and pcDNA4-HisMax/C (Invitrogen), and the resulting vectors were referred to as pGEX-SUMO-1 and pcDNA4-HisMax-SUMO-1, respectively. Expression vectors for GAL4-fused RXRα deletion mutants were constructed by ligating the PCR fragments for the corresponding regions into pM vector (Clontech). pcDNA3.1-SUSP1-V5 expressing SUSP1 fused to the N terminus of V5 tag was prepared by TA cloning of its coding sequence into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. pcDNA3.1-SUSP1/C1030S-V5 was generated by replacement of active site Cys-1030 by Ser upon site-directed mutagenesis. pEGFP-C1-SUSP1 was prepared as described previously (34Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Protein Purification—GST-SUMO-1, GST-SAE2/SAE1, and GST-RXRα were overproduced in BL21-CodonPlus bacteria (Stratagene). Each protein was then purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Purified GST-SUMO-1 was treated with thrombin and applied again onto the GST-affinity column. SUMO-1 was then recovered as the unbound protein. Partially purified SUSP1 and SUSP1/C1030S were prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with pcDNA3.1-SUSP1-V5 or pcDNA3.1-SUSP1/C1030S-V5. Cell lysates were loaded on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose columns, and bound proteins were obtained by following the standard procedure supplied by the manufacturer (Qiagen). His-UBC9 was also overproduced in BL21-CodonPlus bacteria and isolated by using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose.GST Pulldown Assay—GST (10 μg) or GST-RXRα (10 μg) was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were further incubated with 1 μg of His-UBC9 in the presence or absence of 1 μm 9cRA for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of the pulldown buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Proteins bound to the beads were released by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sampling buffer and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen).Cell Culture and Transfections—All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the appropriate vectors using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The total amounts of transfected vectors in each experiment were equalized by supplementing empty vector DNA.In Vitro Sumoylation and Desumoylation Assays—For the in vitro sumoylation assay, RXRα or its mutant forms were radiolabeled using an in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met. The labeled proteins were then subjected to SUMO modification by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h with 10 μg of SUMO-1, 10 μg of His-UBC9, 3 μgof GST-SAE2/SAE1, and an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, and 0.6 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sampling buffer followed by boiling. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.For in vitro desumoylation assay, purified GST-RXRα was sumoylated as described above followed by incubation at 37 °C with partially purified SUSP1 or SUSP1/C1030S in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sampling buffer and boiling. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-RXRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the appropriate vectors. After incubation for 36 h, cells were fixed by incubation with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. They were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% gelatin. Cells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-SUSP1 antibody (Abgent) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated for 1 h with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing, cells were observed under a Carl Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope.Knockdown of SUSP1 mRNA—pSM2c-SUSP1 expressing SUSP1-specific short hairpin RNAs (nucleotides 2679–2698 from NM_015571), referred to as shRNA, was purchased from Open Biosystems. To knock down SUSP1 mRNA, HEK293T cells were transfected with shRNA or a negative control vector (shControl). Total RNAs were prepared from cells by extracting them with Trizol (Invitrogen) and were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer by following the manufacturer's instruction. SUSP1 mRNA was amplified with primers (5′-GCT GTA ATT GAT TCC AAT CC-3′ and 5′-AGT CAA TCT GAG ATA CTA TTG ACA C-3′), and β-actin mRNA was amplified as an expression control.RESULTSSUMO Modification of RXRα—To identify novel proteins that interact with RXRα, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening by using RXRα as bait from a Xenopus embryo cDNA library. Among 5 independently identified clones, 2 clones encoded sequences identical to a SUMO-specific protease, SUSP1. Both clones contained the N-terminal regions of Xenopus SUSP1 spanning the amino acid sequence 5–826, which corresponds to that of the human SUSP1 sequence 5–813 containing a part of catalytic domain called the His box (34Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because SUSP1 interacted with RXRα (see below), we hypothesized that RXRα could be a target for SUMO modification. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether RXRα could interact with UBC9, a SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme. Purified GST-RXRα was incubated with His-UBC9 in the absence or presence of 9cRA. A pulldown assay using glutathione-conjugated Sepharose resin revealed that GST-RXRα could co-precipitate with UBC9 whether or not 9cRA was present (Fig. 1A), indicating that RXRα directly interacts with UBC9 and 9cRA does not influence their interaction. These results also suggest that RXRα is a target of SUMO modification.To determine whether RXRα can be sumoylated, 35S-labeled RXRα was prepared and incubated with purified SUMO-1, E1 (SAE1/SAE2), and E2 (UBC9). Fig. 1B shows that RXRα can be modified by SUMO-1 in vitro. We also examined whether RXRα could be sumoylated in vivo. FLAG-RXRα was expressed in HEK293T cells with HisMax-SUMO-1, FLAG-UBC9, or both. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot with anti-RXRα antibody. A slow migrating band could be seen in the lysates from the cells expressing SUMO-1 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, co-expression of UBC9 led to an increase in the intensity of the slow migrating band as well as of SUMO-conjugated cellular proteins, suggesting that RXRα can be modified by SUMO-1. We then examined whether endogenous RXRα could be modified by SUMO-1. Lysates obtained from HEK293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RXRα antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-SUMO-1 antibody. A SUMO-conjugated band could be seen in the lysates precipitated by anti-RXRα antibody but not in those precipitated by control IgG (Fig. 1D, left panel), suggesting that endogenous RXRα can be sumoylated. As a confirmation, the same cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SUMO-1 antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-RXRα antibody. A SUMO-conjugated band again appeared in the lysates that had been precipitated by anti-SUMO-1 antibody but not in those precipitated by control IgG (Fig. 1D, right panel). These results indicate that RXRα is a natural substrate for SUMO modification.Determination of SUMO Acceptor Site in RXRα—SUMO modification to target proteins occurs at specific Lys residues, which are commonly embedded in a consensus sequence, ψ-Lys-X-Glu (20Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 40Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). RXRα contains two similar sequences, MK201RE and PK245TE in the hinge region and ligand-binding domain, respectively. Therefore, we first examined whether the Lys residues might serve as the SUMO acceptor sites upon substitution of each residue with Arg by site-directed mutagenesis. In vitro sumoylation assay revealed that neither the K201R nor the K245R mutation affected the SUMO modification of RXRα (data not shown). Neither did the double mutation (K210R/K245R) show any effect on RXRα sumoylation, indicating that Lys-210 and Lys-245 in the putative consensus sequences are not the SUMO acceptor sites in RXRα.The Lys residues in non-consensus sequences have also been shown to serve as the SUMO acceptor sites (41Desterro J.M. Keegan L.P. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. O'Connell M.A. Carmo-Fonseca M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5115-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 42Rui H.L. Fan E. Zhou H.M. Xu Z. Zhang Y. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42981-42986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To identify the SUMO acceptor site(s) in RXRα, we constructed serial deletion mutants (Fig. 2A) and subjected them to an in vitro sumoylation assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, slow migrating, sumoylated bands were not detected with the RXRα mutant proteins lacking the amino acid sequence from 101 to 200. These results suggest that the SUMO acceptor site is located in the RXRα sequence 101–200, which contains 10 Lys residues. To identify the SUMO acceptor Lys residue(s) in the 101–200 sequence, each of 10 Lys residues was replaced by Arg, and the resulting mutant proteins were subjected to in vitro sumoylation assay. Among the Lys-to-Arg mutations, only the K108R mutation blocked the sumoylation of RXRα (Fig. 2C), indicating that Lys-108 is the major acceptor site for SUMO under in vitro conditions. To determine whether the K108R mutation could prevent in vivo sumoylation of RXRα, HisMax-SUMO-1 was expressed in HEK293T cells with FLAG-RXRα or FLAG-RXRα/K108R. Immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated that wild-type RXRα (wt), but not RXRα/K108R (mt), can be sumoylated (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Lys-108 serves as the major SUMO acceptor site in RXRα under both in vivo and in vitro conditions.FIGURE 2Determination of SUMO-1 conjugation site in RXRα. A, various deletion constructs of RXRα were generated as shown. A summary of the results from B is shown on the right: +, constructs that were SUMO-conjugated; –, those that were not SUMO-conjugated. B, 35S-labeled RXRα and its deletion mutants were subjected to a sumoylation assay in the absence or presence of SUMO-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The arrowheads indicate the sumoylated proteins. C, each of 10 Lys residues in the RXRα sequence 101–200 was replaced by Arg, and the resulting mutant proteins were subjected to a sumoylation assay as described in B. The numerals shown above the gels indicate the position of each Lys residue in the sequence. D, pcDNA3-FLAG-RXRα (wt) or pcDNA3-FLAG-RXRα/K108R (mt) was transfected to HEK293T cells with or without pc-DNA4-HisMax-SUMO-1. After incubation for 36 h, cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-Xpress antibody. Cell lysates were also directly probed with anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of K108R Mutation on Transcriptional Activity of RXRα—SUMO modification has been shown to influence the activity of many transcription factors. To determine whether the K108R mutation might affect the transcriptional activity of RXRα, the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 was fused to various deletions of RXRα or RXRα/K108R (Fig. 3A). HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing the GAL4-fused RXRα mutants and a luciferase reporter vector. They were then cultured in the absence or presence of 9cRA. The transcriptional activity of GAL4-AF1/K108R was more than 1.5-fold higher than that of GAL4-AF1; this effect of the K108R mutation was independent of 9cRA, as the constructs do not contain the ligand-binding domain (Fig. 3B, lower panel)."
https://openalex.org/W2053699021,"Members of the DegP/HtrA (or Deg) family of proteases are found widely in nature and play an important role in the proteolysis of misfolded and damaged proteins. As yet, their physiological role in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is unclear, although it has been widely speculated that they participate in the degradation of the photodamaged D1 subunit in the photosystem two complex (PSII) repair cycle, which is needed to maintain PSII activity in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. We have examined the role of the three Deg proteases found in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 through analysis of double and triple insertion mutants. We have discovered that these proteases show overlap in function and are involved in a number of key physiological responses ranging from protection against light and heat stresses to phototaxis. In previous work, we concluded that the Deg proteases played either a direct or an indirect role in PSII repair in a glucose-tolerant version of Synechocystis 6803 (Silva, P., Choi, Y. J., Hassan, H. A., and Nixon, P. J. (2002) Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 357, 1461–1467). In this work, we have now been able to demonstrate unambiguously, using a triple deg mutant created in the wild type strain of Synechocystis 6803, that the Deg proteases are not obligatory for PSII repair and D1 degradation. We therefore conclude that although the Deg proteases are needed for photoprotection of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, they do not play an essential role in D1 turnover and PSII repair in vivo.

An inevitable consequence of the light reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis is the formation of highly reactive molecules, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) 5The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PSII, photosystem two complex; WT, wild type; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; TFP, type IV pili; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-amino}ethanesulfonic acid. and amino acid free radicals, which can cause irreversible damage to a variety of cellular components including nucleic acids, lipids, pigments, and proteins (1Asada K.

Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The photosystem two complex (PSII), which functions as the light-driven water:plastoquinone oxidoreductase in oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport, is particularly prone to light-induced damage (3Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Of the more than 25 protein subunits found in PSII, the D1 reaction center subunit appears to be the major target for photodamage (4Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kyle D.J. Ohad I. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adir N. Zer H. Shochat S. Ohad I. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To maintain activity, a damaged PSII complex is repaired through the specific replacement of the damaged subunit (usually D1) by a newly synthesized subunit (3Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the PSII repair cycle for maintaining optimal photosynthetic rates in vivo, the molecular details of this repair process remain unclear. Recently, attention has focused on the identity of the proteases that are involved in removing damaged D1 from the PSII complex. In the case of chloroplasts, in vitro experiments suggest that D1 degradation occurs in a two-step process involving the participation of two classes of protease (7Haussuhl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). First, a member of the DegP/HtrA family of proteases (or Deg proteases), originally designated DegP2 but now renamed Deg2 (8Huesgen P.F. Schuhmann H. Adamska I. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 413-420Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is thought to cleave damaged D1 between trans-membrane helices four and five on the stromal side of the membrane to generate N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of ∼23 and 10 kDa, respectively. Subsequently, the 23-kDa fragment, and possibly the 10-kDa fragment, is removed from the membrane by one or more members of the FtsH protease family (9Lindahl M. Spetea C. Hundal T. Oppenheim A.B. Adam Z. Andersson B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Selective D1 degradation also occurs in cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (10Nixon P.J. Komenda J. Barber J. Deak Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14919-14927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has identified three members of the Deg proteases and four members of the FtsH family of proteases (11Sokolenko A. Pojidaeva E. Zinchenko V. Panichkin V. Glaser V.M. Herrmann R.G. Shestakov S.V. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments have so far demonstrated a role for one of the FtsH proteases (slr0228) in PSII repair at an early stage in D1 degradation (12Silva P. Thompson E. Bailey S. Kruse O. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. Nixon P.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2152-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear to what extent the Deg proteases are important for D1 degradation in vivo. This is a crucial question to address since recent biochemical experiments have suggested that a homologue of Deg2 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 extracts could be involved in cleaving D1 during PSII repair (8Huesgen P.F. Schuhmann H. Adamska I. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 413-420Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Kanervo E. Spetea C. Nishiyama Y. Murata N. Andersson B. Aro E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The DegP/HtrA family of proteases was initially characterized in Escherichia coli and is composed of DegP (also known as HtrA), DegQ (or HhoA), and DegS (or HhoB) (reviewed in Ref. 14Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). They are serine-type proteases and are found in the periplasm (DegQ), attached to the periplasmic surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (DegP), or embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane facing the periplasm (DegS). DegS is involved in activating the σE-dependent transcription of stress genes and is the only member absolutely required for cell viability (14Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 15Alba B.M. Zhong H.J. Pelayo J.C. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). E. coli DegP has a dual function: acting as a molecular chaper-one at low temperatures and acting as a protease at higher temperatures (16Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The major role for DegP is thought to be the degradation of misfolded proteins (17Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and denatured proteins formed, for example, during heat shock (18Kolmar H. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. J.

Genet. 1999; 262: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that DegP and DegQ, but not DegS, have overlapping functions (18Kolmar H. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5925-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Likewise, Deg homologues in other bacteria also show overlap in function (21Boucher J.C. Martinez-Salazar J. Schurr M.J. Mudd M.H. Yu H. Deretic V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 511-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Noone D. Howell A. Collery R. Devine K.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the three Deg homologues identified in the genome data base (CyanoBase, Kazusa Research Institute, Japan) are annotated HtrA (CyanoBase designation slr1204), HhoA (sll1679), and HhoB (sll1427). However, these gene products cannot be assumed to play an equivalent role to the E. coli homologues of the same name (23Kieselbach T. Funk C. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 337-346Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Structural predictions indicate that all three members possess the serine protease domain and one of the C-terminal PDZ domains typical of this class of protease (23Kieselbach T. Funk C. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 337-346Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The deg transcript levels increase upon light but not heat stress (24Jansen T. Kidron H. Taipaleenmaki H. Salminen T. Maenpaa P. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This has reinforced the speculation that the primary role of the Deg proteases in cyanobacteria is related to photoprotection and PSII repair rather than heat stress (8Huesgen P.F. Schuhmann H. Adamska I. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 413-420Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the location of the Deg proteases in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has not yet been established definitively, proteomics data suggest that HhoA is in the periplasm (25Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and HtrA is in the outer membrane (26Huang F. Hedman E. Funk C. Kieselbach T. Schroder W.P. Norling B. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 586-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At first sight, such a location would appear to exclude a role in PSII repair since functional PSII is found in the thylakoid membrane. However, PSII subcomplexes containing D1 have been found in the cytoplasmic membrane (27Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Keren N. Liberton M. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6548-6553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), so it remains feasible that proteases found in the extracytoplasmic compartment might play a role in D1 degradation (29Smith D. Howe C.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 341-347Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To address the physiological importance of the Deg proteases, we previously constructed a triple mutant in which each of the Deg proteases was insertionally inactivated in the widely used glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (30Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). We found that growth of the triple mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to high irradiances of visible light and that the PSII repair cycle was impaired (31Silva P. Choi Y.J. Hassan H.A. Nixon P.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, our data did not allow us to differentiate between a direct involvement of the Deg proteases in D1 degradation or an indirect role in optimizing PSII repair within the cell (31Silva P. Choi Y.J. Hassan H.A. Nixon P.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To exclude possible effects of the glucose-tolerant genetic background, we have analyzed in this report the PSII repair cycle in a deg triple mutant made in the original PCC 6803 strain of Synechocystis. Our results now unambiguously demonstrate that the Deg proteases are not essential for selective D1 degradation during PSII repair in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In addition, we have examined the phenotype of deg triple and double mutants and provide evidence that the Deg proteases show overlap in function with regard to heat stress, light stress, and phototaxis. Cyanobacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The glucose-tolerant and wild type PCC 6803 strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, hereafter referred to as WT-G and WT, respectively, were utilized in this study (30Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, all strains were grown at a light intensity of 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white fluorescent light and at 29 (± 0.5) °C in BG-11 mineral medium containing 5 mm TES-KOH, pH 8.2 (30Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the medium was supplemented with 5 mm glucose and the antibiotics chloramphenicol (10 μg ml–1), erythromycin (10 μgml–1), and kanamycin (25 μgml–1). Construction of Mutants—Interposon disruption of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 deg genes encoding DegP/HtrA (slr1204), DegQ/HhoA (sll1679), and DegS/HhoB (sll1427) was performed using plasmids constructed previously (31Silva P. Choi Y.J. Hassan H.A. Nixon P.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The three double deg mutants termed htrA–hhoA– (slr1204–sll1679–), htrA–hhoB– (slr1204–sll1427–), and hhoA–hhoB– (sll1679–sll1427–) were generated in the WT strain, and all three genes were inactivated in both WT and WT-G strains to produce htrA–hhoA–hhoB– triple mutants (hereafter designated ΔDeg and ΔDeg-G strains, respectively). The genotypes of the mutant strains were verified by PCR using the following internal gene-specific primers: slr1204F, 5′-CTTAAGGATGGTCGTTCCTTTCC-3′, and slr1204R, 5′-TCCACAGGAATGTTCATACCCGT-3′; sll1427F, 5′-GTCTTCAGGCCAAAACCATTCCT-3′, and sll1427R, 5′-CCGTTTGAATAGGAATGGCAAATC-3′; sll1679F, 5′-ACAGTGGTAACCCGTCGCACT-3′, and sll1679R, 5′-GCAGCGAGGGTATTTTGAATTGC-3′. To generate a sigF mutant (ΔSigF) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (WT background), the sigF gene (slr1564) was inactivated by insertion of an aphI kanamycin antibiotic resistance cassette at the StuI site, 604 bp downstream of the sigF start codon. Transcription of the resistance cassette was in reverse orientation to that of sigF. Protein Assays and Immunoblotting—Crude Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 thylakoid membranes were prepared by glass bead breakage of cells as described in Ref. 32Komenda J. Barker M. Kuvikova S. de Vries R. Mullineaux C.W. Tichy M. Nixon P.J. J. Biol.

Chlorophyll a content was assessed by extraction into methanol and measurement of the absorbance at 666 nm (33Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a DC protein kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Thylakoid membrane proteins were separated on 12% denaturing SDS-PAGE gels according to Ref. 32Komenda J. Barker M. Kuvikova S. de Vries R. Mullineaux C.W. Tichy M. Nixon P.J. J. Biol.

Gels were loaded on either chlorophyll a or total protein content where indicated in the legends for Figs. 2C, 5B, 6, and 7B. Gels were then either stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (0.2-μm pore size, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with specific antibodies before being probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescent kit (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Primary antibodies used in this study were: (i) a C-terminal D1-specific anti-peptide antiserum (34Nixon P.J. Metz J.G. Roegner M. Diner B.A. Baltscheffsky M Current Research in Photosynthesis. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 471-474Google Scholar); (ii) an anti-peptide antibody specific for E. coli FtsH, which is potentially cross-reactive with all Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 FtsH homologues, kindly provided by Professor T. Ogura (University of Kumamoto, Japan); and (iii) a PsaD-specific antiserum donated by Professor J.-D. Rochaix (University of Geneva, Switzerland). The general oxidation state of membrane proteins was analyzed by the immunochemical detection of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-derivatized carbonyl groups (OxyBlot™, Chemicon International). Derivatization was performed on 15 μg of total membrane proteins for each sample.FIGURE 5The effect of high light on PSII activity and D1 degradation in ΔDeg.

PCC 6803 cells were grown in liquid BG11 medium at 29 °C with a white light intensity of 20 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 to an OD730 of 0.4–0.5. Undiluted cell samples were negatively stained via the droplet method (35Harris J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 117: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar), with 2% uranyl acetate, and imaged on Kodak SO-163 film at room temperature using a Phillips CM100 electron microscope. Micrographs were taken at 100 kV, ×15,500 magnification, and a typical defocus of 2 μm. Micrographs displaying no discernible astigmatism or drift were scanned with a Nikon LS9000 Super Coolscan densitometer with an initial step size of 6.35 μm. Growth Assays—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown in liquid or on solid BG-11 medium and subjected to: low light growth, 29 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light; high light, 29 °C with 120 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light; low temperature, 18 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light; high temperature, 37 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light; hydrogen peroxide, 29 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light and 10–250 μm hydrogen peroxide; cumene hydroperoxide, 29 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light and 50–250 μm cumene hydroperoxide; high salt, 29 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light and 0.5 m NaCl. Solid medium growth assays were performed by streaking liquid grown cells diluted to an OD730 of 0.1 onto BG-11 plates with incubation for the time indicated in the legend for Fig. 2. For the rescue of photosensitivity, cells were inoculated onto BG-11 solid medium containing 5 mm glucose with or without 10 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) or 10 μm atrazine and subjected to high light stress for the time indicated in the legend for Fig. 2. These concentrations of DCMU and atrazine were sufficient to block PSII activity as assessed by inhibition of growth on BG-11 agar plates and by inhibition of QA-to-QB electron transfer in cells in chlorophyll flash fluorescence experiments. For phototaxis experiments, BG-11 agar plates (1.5% agar) were spot inoculated with 5 μl of cells at an OD730 of 0.1. Plates were then exposed to a unidirectional fluorescent white light at 15 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 and incubated at 29 °C for the time indicated in the legend for Fig. 4 (41Bhaya D. Bianco N.R. Bryant D. Grossman A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Photosystem II Activity Measurements and Photoinhibition Experiments—The activity of PSII was assessed by measuring the light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution from whole cells using 1 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and 2 mm potassium ferricyanide as artificial electron acceptors (10Nixon P.J.

For photoinhibition experiments, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown without glucose and bubbled with air at 29 °C with 10 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 white light to an OD730 of ∼0.5–0.8. Cells were harvested and resuspended in BG-11 medium to a concentration of 10 μg of chlorophyll a ml–1 and subjected to a white light intensity of 100 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 for 1 h and then 1,200 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 for up to 8 h either at normal growth temperature (29 °C) or at low temperature (23 °C), with or without spectinomycin (200 μgml–1), a protein synthesis inhibitor. Pulse-Chase Radiolabeling Experiments—Cells of WT and ΔDeg were radiolabeled using a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN) as described in Ref. 36Tichy M. Lupinkova L. Sicora C. Vass I.

Construction of Triple and Double deg Mutants and Their Growth Characteristics in High Light—A triple mutant (ΔDeg), in which all three members of the Deg protease family were disrupted, was generated in WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by the stepwise inactivation of each gene (Fig. 1A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). All the genes were interrupted in a way to prevent expression of an intact serine protease domain. PCR analyses confirmed that ΔDeg had fully segregated (Fig. 1B). In addition, three double mutants were constructed, htrA–hhoA–, htrA–hhoB–, and hhoA–hhoB–, to test the physiological importance of each member of the family in isolation (Fig. 1, A and B). In agreement with earlier work on a triple mutant constructed in the glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis 6803, growth of ΔDeg on solid agar was inhibited at high but not low light intensities (Fig. 2A) (31Silva P. Choi Y.J. Hassan H.A. Nixon P.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Importantly, each of the double mutants was able to grow at the high light intensity, suggesting overlap in function among the three members with respect to providing resistance to light stress (Fig. 2A). That a dramatic growth defect was only observed in ΔDeg argues against the possibility that the light-sensitive phenotype was due to polar effects on the expression of genes downstream of htrA, hhoA, and hhoB. If this had been the case, the phenotype would also have been observed in single and double mutants. Northern blotting has suggested that htrA and hhoB are monocistronically transcribed (24Jansen T. Kidron H. Taipaleenmaki H. Salminen T. Maenpaa P. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and that hhoA might possibly be co-transcribed with a downstream open reading frame (sll1680), which shows similarity to a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrB). In a control experiment, a mutant was constructed in which sll1680 was inactivated in an htrA–hhoB– genetic background. The phenotype of the resulting mutant was similar to the htrA–hhoB– mutant with respect to light and heat stress, thus excluding the possibility that polar effects on the expression of sll1680 had caused the light-sensitive phenotype of the ΔDeg mutant (data not shown). To test whether the growth inhibition observed at high light was related to the effects of photosynthetic electron transport, the growth of a newly constructed triple mutant (ΔDeg-G), made in the glucose-tolerant WT background (WT-G), was assessed. Unlike WT, the WT-G strain is able to grow photoheterotrophically on glucose in the absence of linear photosynthetic electron transport. In the presence of 5 mm glucose, growth of ΔDeg-G on solid agar was again inhibited at high light intensities (Fig. 2B). However, the addition of either 10 μm DCMU or 10 μm atrazine, which are both potent inhibitors of PSII activity and thus linear photosynthetic electron flow, was now able to rescue ΔDeg-G under these experimental conditions (Fig. 2B, atrazine data not shown). These data suggested that the ΔDeg strains might be more susceptible to oxidative damage induced by ROS produced by photosynthetic electron transport (2Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). To test this, total membranes were isolated from cells of WT and ΔDeg that had been exposed to 1 h of white light of intensity 100 μmol of photons m–2 s–1, and the degree of protein carbonylation was assessed immunochemically following derivatization of the proteins with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. This assay is widely used to measure the degree of ROS-mediated damage to proteins (37Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Finn P."
https://openalex.org/W2012246741,"The vacuolar ATPase has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Bafilomycin and concanamycin, highly potent and specific inhibitors of the vacuolar ATPase, have been widely used to investigate the enzyme. Derivatives have been developed as possible therapeutic drugs. We have used random mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis to identify 23 residues in the c subunit involved in binding these drugs. We generated a model for the structure of the ring of c subunits in Neurospora crassa by using data from the crystal structure of the homologous subunits of the bacterium Enterococcus hirae (Murata, T., Yamato, I., Kakinuma, Y., Leslie, A. G., and Walker, J. E. (2005) Science 308, 654-659). In the model 10 of the 11 mutation sites that confer the highest degree of resistance are closely clustered. They form a putative drug-binding pocket at the interface between helices 1 and 2 on one c subunit and helix 4 of the adjacent c subunit. The excellent fit of the N. crassa sequence to the E. hirae structure and the degree to which the structural model predicts the clustering of these residues suggest that the folding of the bacterial and eukaryotic polypeptides is very similar."

Cantor C. R Bioorganic Chemistry, a Chemical Approach to Enzyme Action. Springer, New York1996: 560-573Google Scholar). TPP is produced in Bacteria, Archaea, as well as Eukaryotes belonging to the Fungi and Plantae groups. The entire animal kingdom does not synthesize thiamine but obtains it through dietary uptake. In humans, its deficiency may result in Beriberi and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, severe conditions that involve damage to the cardiovascular, muscular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems (2Singleton C.K. Martin P.R. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The TPP biosynthesis occurs by the condensation of two intermediate precursors, generally referred to as the thiazole (4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole phosphate) and pyrimidine (2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate) moieties. In Bacteria, the chemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin are better understood, requiring the combined action of many gene products. Six genes (thiF, thiS, thiG, thiH, or thiO, iscS, or NifS and dxs) are required for the biosynthesis of 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole phosphate (3Park J.H. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. Kinsland C. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12430-12438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two genes (thiC and another yet unidentified gene) are required for the biosynthesis of 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (4Lawhorn B.G. Mehl R.A. Begley T.P. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and thiamin phosphate synthase (thiE) is required for the condensation reaction of both moieties to form thiamin phosphate. The remaining genes are kinases, which are responsible for the phosphorylation of precursors (thiD, thiM, and pdxK) and to convert thiamin phosphate to its active form, thiamin pyrophosphate (thiL). In bacteria, the thiazole moiety is synthesized sequentially (Fig. 1). The precursors are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), pyruvate, cysteine and glycine (Bacillus subtilis), or tyrosine (Escherichia coli). G3P and pyruvate are converted to deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme DXP synthase (dxs). DXP contributes to the 4-methyl-5-hydroxyethyl group and the C-4 atom of thiazole. The sulfur atom originates from cysteine, but, in fact, the sulfur incorporation to the thiazole ring depends on the combined action of ThiF, ATP, IscS (a cysteine desulfurase), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, cysteine, and ThiS resulting in the formation of an intermediate carrier protein, ThiS-thiocarboxylase (5Xi J.

Thiazole synthase (ThiG), a key enzyme for this pathway, catalyzes the final thiazole ring formation though an imine intermediate with DXP, interacting with ThiS-thiocarboxylate to assist the sulfur transfer to the DXP carbon-3 (6Settembre E.C.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as many other Eukaryotes, only one gene has been identified for the thiazole moiety biosynthesis (thi4 (7Praekelt U.M. Byrne K.L. Meacock P.A.

Acta. 1987; 924: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) are also considered precursors. THI4 is a conserved protein, with orthologues found in plants as well as in Archaea. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the orthologue to this protein was named THI1, since it was the first enzyme of the pathway to be identified in plants. Despite this, thi1 was initially identified by its ability to complement bacterial mutant strains defective in DNA damage repair mechanisms (13Machado C.R. de Oliveira R.C. Boiteux S. Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Menck C.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), while further experiments confirmed its ability to complement the thiamin auxotrophy in S. cerevisiae thi4 null mutant strain. Using the same model, it was noticed that THI1 complementation does not change the cell survival rate under DNA-damaging conditions, but it is able to restore its mitochondrial DNA stability (14Machado C.R. Praekelt U.M. de Oliveira R.C. Barbosa A.C. Byme K.L. Meacock P.A. Menck C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, thi1 and thi4 are credited for a dual role in the thiazole biosynthesis and mitochondrial DNA damage tolerance. Herein, we describe the crystal structure of THI1 after heterologous expression in E. coli. The structure reveals that this protein assembles as an octamer and combines with a previously undescribed ligand, modeled to 2-carboxylate-4-methyl-5-β-(ethyl adenosine 5′-diphosphate) thiazole (AHZ), most likely an intermediate of the thiazole biosynthesis in Eukaryotes. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments and in vivo functional assays were also performed and support some features disclosed by the THI1 structure, including details of the dinucleotide binding domain and octamer formation for the thiazole biosynthesis. Protein Preparation—The thi1 gene was subcloned in pET-28a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) between BamHI and EcoRI sites. The resulting plasmid was used for the transformation of BL21(DE3), after selection with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were cultured in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until A600 nm of about 0.8. Promoter induction occurred by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and stored at -20 °C. Cells from 1l cultures were resuspended in 40 ml of buffer 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin-A, and 1 μm leupeptin (buffer A). To promote the cell lysis, 1 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and this mixture was kept on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied into a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelate column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), previously equilibrated in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The contaminating proteins were removed in a linear gradient of 50 ml of buffer A containing 20-100 mm imidazole, while the elution was carried out in a linear gradient of 50 ml of buffer A containing 100-250 mm imidazole. The amino acid sequence added to the N terminus, including the His6-tag, was found to be inhibitory to the crystallization process (data not shown). Therefore, to prepare samples for crystallization, samples purified in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid were dialyzed against 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2 (buffer B), further concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Centriprep 10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and papain digested in a reaction containing 1 ml of THI1 concentrated to 10 mg/ml, 10 μl of 500 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 μl of 300 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μl of 10 mg/ml papain (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) for 30 min at 37 °C. The limited proteolysis reaction resulted in the elimination of the first 31 amino acids, as confirmed by Edman sequencing (data not shown), including the histidine tag and other amino acids added by the plasmid construct. The THI1-digested protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 XK16 column (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) previously equilibrated in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Samples were dialyzed against 20 mm TES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Centriprep 10 prior to the crystallization experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection—THI1 crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion against a well solution of 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 40% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 1.5% (v/v) heptane-1,2,3-triol. Crystals were seen after 2 weeks at 291 K as small plates of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.01 mm. A two-wavelength data collection was measured at beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, using a Rontec Silicon Drift Diode fluorescence detector for the absorption edge scan and an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD area detector. One crystal diffracting to 2.35 Å was used to collect data for phasing by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) at the zinc peak wavelength (λ = 1.28269 Å), revealed after a broad fluorescence scan. A second crystal was measured to further extend the resolution to 1.6 Å. Both crystals were perfectly isomorphous, collected in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. Crystals belong to space group F222 with unit cell dimensions of a = 102.356 Å, b = 133.147 Å, and c = 142.301 Å. Two molecules are found in the asymmetric unit, as seen by the self-rotation function calculated by GLRF (15Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) revealing a twoorder non-crystallographic symmetry axis in Φ = 0°, ψ = 45°, and κ = 180° (data not shown). The Mattews coefficient (16Mattews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) was calculated to 1.9 Å3/Da with a solvent content of 34.5%. The data set used in SAD phasing was indexed and integrated by DENZO (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) and further reduced by SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The native data set was processed using the HKL suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Phasing and Refinement—The structure was determined by SAD phasing using the zinc peak wavelength. Two zinc ions were found by SOLVE using the anomalous data from 40 to 3.0 Åat x1 = 0.5611, y1 = 0.1526, z1 = 0.1937, occ1 = 0.36, B1 = 24.1 Å2 and x2 = 0.8269, y2 = 0.1525, z2 = 0.4148, occ2 = 0.41, B2 = 33.8 Å2 (in fractional coordinates; occ is occupancy; B is the thermal factor). Initial phases to 3.0 Å were extended to 2.35 Å and improved by maximum-likelihood density modification and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging using RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The phases were further extended in ARP/wARP (20Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar) using amplitudes measured to 1.6 Å resolution. The model was largely built by ARP/wARP. Missing parts were manually rebuilt using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) after successive rounds of rigid-body refinement, simulated annealing and temperature factor refinement as implemented in CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The ligand molecule AHZ was clearly found early during the rebuilding in σA-weighted Fobs - Fcalc maps. Water molecules were added by CNS at peaks above 4 σ and sorted according to their hydrogen binding distance to each monomer using the CCP4 suite (23CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The final refinement stage was carried out by maximum-likelihood targeting and TLS refinement to account for overall anisotropic motion of the monomers A and B and their waterassociated molecules, as implemented by REFMAC (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) and CCP4. New water molecules were manually added by visual inspection of difference Fourier maps using CCP4 and the program O, resulting in an Rfactor of 13.9% and Rfree of 17.1%. For cross-validation, 5% of the data were excluded from refinement. The results of refinement are summarized in Table 1. In our final model, 92.8% of residues are found in the most favored region and the remaining 7.2% are in the additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The figures were prepared with PyMol, Topdraw (25Bond C.S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and Ligplot (26Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M.

Byrne K.L. Meacock P.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). Selection of transformants with pG1 constructs was performed in yeast nitrogen base (BD Biosciences) lacking tryptophan. For the thiamin auxotrophy experiment, cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) until saturation, centrifuged, and resuspended in 3 volumes of sterile water. One aliquot was spread in minimal medium plates with the required supplements, including or not thiamin, and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. The determination of respiratory mutant induction was performed with cells grown in Difco minimal medium containing thiamin. Analysis of MMS-induced respiratory mutants was performed in cells grown in minimal medium to 107 cells/ml, centrifuged, and resuspended in sterile water and either treated with 0.2% MMS or mock-treated for 1 h at 30 °C under shaking. After dilution in sterile water, cells were plated in YPD and incubated at 30 °C for 2-3 days. After colony formation, a 3-ml layer of 0.05% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride in soft agar was poured onto the plates, which were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Respiratory mutants (full white or sectored colonies (27Ogur M. St. John R. Nagai S. Science. 1957; 125: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar)) were scored, and the percentage relative to the total number of colonies was calculated. The induction of respiratory mutants was also measured after cell growth at 37 °C. In these experiments, the yeast cells were cultivated in minimal medium until the stationary phase and then inoculated in minimal medium with 1/100 dilutions. Cells were then grown to A600 nm = 1.0 both at 30 and 37 °C, diluted in sterile water, and plated on YPD. After colony formation, respiratory mutants were detected as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis of thi1—We performed PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the thi1 cDNA using primers with the desired mutations. The introduced mutations led to single amino acid substitutions in the encoded protein. Two complementary mutagenic primers were used with external primers to amplify fragments of thi1 containing the desired mutations. Both fragments were used in a further reaction with only the external primers to generate full-length cDNAs containing the introduced mutation. All PCR reactions were carried out with the high fidelity Pfx enzyme (Invitrogen), using the cloned thi1 cDNA as a template. After production of full-length mutant cDNAs, they were subcloned in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced to ensure that the correct mutation was introduced and that no additional mutations were generated during amplification. The selected cDNAs were transferred to the pG1 yeast expression vector (28Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) into BamHI and SalI sites. The wild-type thi1 and the Ala184 → Val mutant isolated from the A. thaliana tz-201 lineage (29Papini-Terzi F.S. Galhardo R.S. Farias L.P. Menck C.F. Van Sluys M.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were also transferred to a pG1 vector (Ala140 → Val in this work). THI1 Numbering Convention—The numbering convention used here differs from the deposited amino acid numbering in Swiss-Prot (accession number Q38814). The three-dimensional structure of THI1 deposited in the Protein Data Bank follows the sequence present in our plasmid construct, lacking the N-terminal sequence targeted at chloroplasts. Thus, amino acid Tyr7 in the Protein Data Bank is the same as Tyr51 on Swiss-Prot. Residues prior to Tyr7 and after Leu284 were missing from our electron density maps. Overall Monomeric Structure of THI1—The monomeric THI1 protein presents a long α-helix (residues 18-38) followed by a globular αβ domain with a three-layer (ααβ) sandwich architecture and a topology similar to FAD/NAD(P) binding domain (residues 39 to 284, Fig. 2). The globular domain is made up of a central six-stranded β-sheet with β5-β2-β1-β9-β11-β10 topology, β10 being the only antiparallel strand. The central β-sheet is flanked on one side by a twisted antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet formed by β6-β7-β8 and helix α5 and by a four α-helix bundle containing α4-α2-α9-α7 on the other side. Helix α6 is connecting β9 to α7, and α8 is connecting β11 to α9. This fold resembles a FAD binding domain with the classical two-halves β1-α1-β2-α2-β3 topology, containing a variation of the Rossmann fold and a substitution to the αC-helix crossover usually found in the classical dinucleotide binding motif and the glutathione reductase structural family (30Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the first half, THI1 possesses an additional variation due to the insertion of the sheet β3-β4 and α3 (B-subdomain) connecting β2 to α4. The connection between the halves, formed by the twisted sheet β6-β7-β8, is homologous to the β-meander found in the glutathione reductase family but also includes the helix α5 and the loop between α5 and β8 (L-loop) that, in turn, make contact with a symmetry-related ligand binding site. The second half topology is less similar to the Rossmann fold. It presents an inversion of strands (β1-β3-β2) with a cross-connection between α1-β3 and β2-α2, resulting in a β1-α1-β3-β2-α2 topology. The helices α1 and α2, in turn, are split to become α6-α7 and α8-α9, respectively. A three-dimensional structure search over DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), CE (32Shindyalov J-F. Bourne P. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), and CATH (33Pearl F. Todd A. Sillitoe I. Dibley M. Redfern O. Lewis T. Bennett C. Marsden R. Grant A. Lee D. Akpor A. Maibaum M. Harrison A. Dallman T. Reeves G. Diboun I. Addou S. Lise S. Johnston C. Sillero A. Thornton J. Orengo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) data bases suggest that THI1 is homologous to many dinucleotide-binding proteins with a higher similarity to FAD-binding proteins such as flavocytochome-c3, fumarate reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and glycine oxidase (see supplemental Table 1). The highest scoring flavocytochome-c3 from Shewanella frigidimarina has 40 identical residues in 182 matching residues with a root mean square deviation of 1.48 Å, as calculated by LSQMAN (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, a significant similarity is found to the glycine oxidase from B. subtilis, an enzyme responsible for the incorporation of the thiazole ring nitrogen-3 atom. The glycine oxidase from B. subtilis (ThiO (35Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) catalyzes the FAD-dependent oxidation of glycine to imine. THI1 and ThiO possess similar FAD binding domains. Based on the THI1 and ThiO structural alignment, 20 identical residues are found out of a total 111 matching residues with a root mean square deviation of 1.34 Å, involving residues in the central six-stranded β-sheet, the β-meander and four of the six-helix bundle in ThiO (helices 7, 1, 8 and 11; see the supplemental data). The mechanism of binding adenine, ribose, and the α-phosphate oxygen atoms are similar, but the β-phosphate oxygen atoms establish additional interactions with the THI1 helix-8, absent in ThiO. The most probable active site region, where the group 2-carboxylate-4-methyl thiazole is found, is distinct from ThiO. It is also clear that THI1 cannot bind FAD due to a limited space to accommodate its isoalloxazine extremity, while recent evidence has shown that the yeast orthologue Thi4 protein possesses a NAD-binding site (36Faou P. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a result that we also have recently confirmed for THI1. 4D. D. Luche, P. H. C. Godoi, S. M. Chabregas, M. C. Silva-Filho, G. Oliva, and C. F. M. Menck, manuscript in preparation. Ligand Binding Site—The structure of THI1 reveals the presence of a ligand not previously described, observed in the region where a bound dinucleotide was expected. This ligand has a clear electron density that was modeled to 2-carboxylate-4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole covalently bound to adenosine diphosphate by its 5-(β-hydroxyethyl) group (AHZ, Fig. 3). The AHZ molecule adopts an elongated conformation with the adenine moiety in a reverse chain direction motif (37Denessiouk K.A. Rantanen V.-V. Johnson M.S. Proteins. 2001; 44: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As expected for the members of general dinucleotide binding proteins, THI1 contains the characteristic GxGxxG signature (Gly46-Ala47-Gly48-Ser49-Ala50-Gly51) in the A1-loop between the first β-strand (β1) and the next α-helix (α2), as well as a glutamic acid at the end of the second β-strand (β2, Glu70), bound to the ribose diol group through a bidentate hydrogen bond. Additionally, Gln71 establishes a second hydrogen bond to the diol group (O2*). On the adenine end, the N-1 and N-6 atoms form hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH and the CO group of Ala143, respectively. Hydrophobic interactions are also found between the adenine delocalized π-electrons and- the residues Phe193, atoms Cβ and Cγ of Gln71 (A face), Val45, and Cys187 (B face). Thus, THI1 follows the pattern-2 interaction (38Carugo O. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 28: 10-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with the adenine AHZ. The diphosphate binding site is formed through the interactions across the loops β1-α2 (A1-loop), β2-β3 (A2-loop), β9-α6 (zinc-loop), and helices α2 and α8. The α-phosphate oxygen atoms are mostly attached by indirect interactions through three water molecules and the amine NH atom of Gly78, while the β-phosphate oxygen atoms orient themselves in-line with the dipolar momentum of helices α2 and α8, interacting with two amine nitrogen atom of Ala50 (α2) and Met241 (α8) and two other water molecules. The 2-carboxylate-4-methyl-5-β-hydroxyethylthiazole moiety of AHZ is oriented to accommodate its sulfur atom closer to a hydrophobic pocket containing three methionine residues, Met241 (4.3 Å), Met252 (3.8 Å), and Met259 (5.15 Å). The carboxylate group at C-2 interacts via hydrogen bonds to Arg251 NE1 (3.15 Å), NH (2.71 Å), and to a zinc ion (2.07 Å). This zinc ion is strongly attached to the loop between α8-α9 (zinc-loop), closer to the surface, through bonds with the N2 thiazole atom (2.10 Å), His189 Nϵ2 (2.09 Å), Asp190 Oδ1 (2.05 Å, monodentate) and two water molecules completing the coordination sphere in a distorted octahedral geometry. Quaternary Structure—The THI1 protein is found as an octamer in solution as observed by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown) and by dynamic light scattering, with a hydrodynamic radius of 6.24 nm and a calculated molecular mass of 244 kDa. The crystal reveals an asymmetric unit containing two monomers related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis, where a 222-point symmetry generates the octamer. The octamer is tightly packed as a two-layer ring torus structure with approximate dimensions of 98 × 98 × 70 Å, enclosing a 23-Å pore diameter (Fig. 4). Each ring torus contains four molecules formed by the globular domains, while the N-terminal loop (residues 7-18) and the α1 helix are found distal to the geometric center of the torus, interconnecting both rings. Each monomer contacts another four molecules, two neighbor molecules on its own ring and another two molecules on the next ring torus layer. Such interface involves a total buried area of 6,439 Å2 per monomer. Interactions across molecules on the same ring are almost exclusively established by residues distributed on the β-meander but also include residues from the N-terminal loop and the α1-helix from the neighbor layer, while interactions across rings involve a larger contact area that represents 53.5% over the total buried area.

https://openalex.org/W2033283529,"Reg I (regenerating gene product I) is a growth factor that plays a central role in the generation and regeneration of the gastric mucosal architecture. On the other hand, mouse Reg I mRNA is expressed at the highest levels in the small intestine among the gastrointestinal tissues. In the current study, with the aim to clarify the role of Reg I protein in the small intestine, the temporal and spatial pattern of Reg I expression and the phenotype of Reg I-knockout mice in the tissue were examined. In the wild-type mice, immunohistochemistry localized Reg I protein expression in absorptive cells located in the lower half of the intestinal villi. Reg I expression was undetectable until embryonic day 13 (E13), when the fetal intestine still lacks villous structure; however, it dramatically increased at E17 along with the formation and maturation of the fetal intestinal villi. In the small intestine of the adult Reg I-knockout mice, less densely packed, round-shaped aberrant morphology of the absorptive cells was observed light microscopically, and electron microscopical examination revealed a strikingly loose connection of these cells to the basement membrane. Antiproliferating cell nuclear antigen staining and anti-Ki67 staining demonstrated the marked decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the small intestinal mucosa of the knockout mice. The cell migration speed visualized by one shot labeling of 5-bromodeoxyuridine was significantly slower in the knockout mice. These phenotypes of Reg I-knockout mice emerged, in accordance with the temporal pattern of Reg I expression described above, from E17. Reg I was considered to be a regulator of cell growth that is required to generate and maintain the villous structure of the small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2013683375,"The 3′ end of mammalian histone mRNAs consisting of a conserved stem-loop and a terminal ACCCA interacts with a recently identified human 3′ exonuclease designated 3′hExo. The sequence-specific interaction suggests that 3′hExo may participate in the degradation of histone mRNAs. ERI-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of 3′hExo, has been implicated in degradation of small interfering RNAs. We introduced a number of mutations to 3′hExo to identify residues required for RNA binding and catalysis. To assure that the introduced mutations specifically target one of these two activities of 3′hExo rather than cause global structural defects, the mutant proteins were tested in parallel for the ability both to bind the stem-loop RNA and to degrade RNA substrates. Our analysis confirms that 3′hExo is a member of the DEDDh family of 3′ exonucleases. Specific binding to the RNA requires the SAP domain and two lysines located immediately to its C terminus. 3′hExo binds with the highest affinity to the wild-type 3′ end of histone mRNA, and any changes to this sequence reduce efficiency of binding. 3′hExo has only residual, if any, 3′ exonuclease activity on DNA substrates and localizes mostly to the cytoplasm, suggesting that in vivo it performs exclusively RNA-specific functions. Efficient degradation of RNA substrates by 3′hExo requires 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups at the last nucleotide. 3′hExo removes 3′ overhangs of small interfering RNAs, whereas the double-stranded region is resistant to the enzymatic activity. The 3′ end of mammalian histone mRNAs consisting of a conserved stem-loop and a terminal ACCCA interacts with a recently identified human 3′ exonuclease designated 3′hExo. The sequence-specific interaction suggests that 3′hExo may participate in the degradation of histone mRNAs.

Specific binding to the RNA requires the SAP domain and two lysines located immediately to its C terminus. 3′hExo binds with the highest affinity to the wild-type 3′ end of histone mRNA, and any changes to this sequence reduce efficiency of binding. 3′hExo has only residual, if any, 3′ exonuclease activity on DNA substrates and localizes mostly to the cytoplasm, suggesting that in vivo it performs exclusively RNA-specific functions. Efficient degradation of RNA substrates by 3′hExo requires 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups at the last nucleotide. 3′hExo removes 3′ overhangs of small interfering RNAs, whereas the double-stranded region is resistant to the enzymatic activity. Mammalian histone mRNAs end with a highly conserved and unique stem-loop structure followed by a single-stranded ACCCA sequence (1Marzluff W.F. Duronio R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of histone mRNAs is specifically recognized by two proteins, the stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP) and 3′hExo (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Binding of SLBP requires the nucleotides at the 5′ side of the stem-loop, whereas binding of 3′hExo requires the single-stranded ACCCA at the 3′ end. In addition, binding of each protein requires specific nucleotides in the stem and the loop. SLBP and 3′hExo can bind the 3′ end of histone mRNA either individually or simultaneously, forming a ternary complex (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). SLBP stimulates binding of 3′hExo to the stem-loop and allows 3′hExo to form a complex with suboptimal RNA targets, raising the possibility that the two proteins make direct contact with each other in the ternary complex (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Binding of SLBP to the stem-loop in histone mRNA precursors is required for formation of the correct 3′ end of histone mRNAs in the nucleus (3Dominski Z. Marzluff W.F. Gene. 1999; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). SLBP bound to the stem-loop accompanies mature histone mRNA to the cytoplasm, where it stimulates histone mRNA translation (4Sanchez R. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7093-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The half-life of histone mRNAs is greatly reduced in response to completion or inhibition of DNA replication, resulting in rapid disappearance of histone mRNAs from the cytoplasm and cessation of histone production (5Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The stem-loop structure is both necessary and sufficient for the selective degradation of histone mRNA and confers the same type of regulation on other mRNAs when introduced at their 3′ end (6Pandey N.B. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4557-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific and tight binding of 3′hExo to the 3′ end of histone mRNAs simultaneously with SLBP makes this protein a primary candidate for an exonuclease that participates in the rapid degradation of histone mRNAs. However, it has been recently suggested that 3′hExo (7Buhler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and its putative Caenorhabditis elegans homologue, ERI-1 (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), might play a role in down-regulation of RNA interference by degrading small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; SL, stem-loop. Crystallographic studies of the 3′ exonuclease domain of 3′hExo in complex with rAMP demonstrated that 3′hExo is a member of a DEDD superfamily of 3′ exonucleases (9Cheng Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that includes both RNases and DNases (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Among the most prominent members of the family are RNase T, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease, the exosome component PM-Scl 100-kDa autoantigen, and the proofreading subunits of DNA polymerases (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Interestingly, based on data base searches 3′hExo and ERI-1 appear to be part of a group of closely related but uncharacterized putative exonucleases present in a number of eukaryotes. To get some insight into the molecular function of 3′hExo and its homologues, we carried out experiments to further define the specificity of this enzyme and the regions required for its activity. Expression and Mutagenesis of 3′hExo—The 35S-labeled 3′hExo was synthesized in rabbit reticulocytes using the transcription and translation-coupled system (TNT), as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega). SLBP and the wild-type and mutant forms of 3′hExo were overexpressed using the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cDNAs for each protein were cloned into a pFastBac plasmid and used to generate the recombinant viruses. For preparative purification, a 200-ml culture of Sf9 insect cells was infected with each virus and the His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on nickel-agarose. Point mutations and internal deletions within the 3′hExo coding region were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RNAs—The 31-nucleotide stem-loop (SL) RNA and its derivative containing biotin at the 5′ end (SLbi) were synthesized by Dharmacon. The sequence of these RNAs is shown in Fig. 1A. The sequences of the 48-nucleotide H2a and 86-nucleotide pre-H2a RNAs, both generated by T7 transcription, were published previously (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). H2a mutant RNAs containing various deletions or mutations at the 3′ end were generated by T7 transcription using appropriately modified DNA templates. The following single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were ordered from Dharmacon and used as substrates for 3′hExo (written in 5′-3′ orientation): CGUCACUUACGGAUCCGAAGCUUGCCAdC (2′H), CGUCACUUACGGAUCCGAAGCUUGCCAddC (2′3′H), AUUGUUUAAUGGUGGACUGUU (siRNA-S), CAGUCCACCAUUAAACAAUUU (siRNA-A). RNA Labeling—RNA substrates were labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. RNAs generated by T7 transcription prior to labeling were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′ phosphate. The pre-H2a RNA (50 ng) was labeled at the 3′ end with [5′-32P]pCp (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 RNA ligase (Ambion) as suggested by the manufacturer. Partial KOH Hydrolysis of the Pre-H2a RNA—1 ng of the 5′ labeled pre-H2a RNA (50,000 counts/min) was dissolved in 200 μl of 40 mm KOH and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The solution was neutralized with 5 μl of 3 m potassium acetate, pH 5.5, and 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 10 μl of water. 3′hExo Binding Assays—Mobility shift assay was carried out using 25 pmol of baculovirus-expressed 3′hExo and/or SLBP and 50 fmol of 5′ labeled SL RNA in a total volume of 10 μl. In the pulldown binding assay, 35S-labeled 3′hExo was bound to either the SLbi RNA or to various H2a RNA mutants pre-annealed to a biotinylated oligonucleotide complementary to the first 17 nucleotides of the RNA. Both assays were carried out as previously described (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 3′hExo Enzymatic Assay—The exonuclease activity of 3′hExo was tested using 1, 5, or 25 pmol of baculovirus-expressed protein as indicated for each experiment and 50 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA substrates in a total volume of 10μl containing of 135 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. In some reactions, 10 mm EDTA was used to inhibit the enzymatic activity of 3′hExo. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the RNA was separated in 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. 3′hExo Prefers the ACCCA at the 3′ End—We have previously shown that in the presence of EDTA 3′hExo can bind to the 3′ end of histone mRNAs both alone and simultaneously with SLBP (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A presents a simplified model of how SLBP and 3′hExo bind to the target sequence consisting of a highly conserved SL followed by ACCCA. SLBP recognizes primarily the 5′ side of the SL with an important role played by two adenosines located 2 and 3 nucleotides upstream of the stem, whereas 3′hExo binds to the 3′ side of the structure with an important role played by the ACCCA terminus. We analyzed the role of the ACCCA terminus in the binding of 3′hExo in more detail using a pulldown assay as previously described (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this assay, 35S-labeled 3′hExo was incubated in the presence of EDTA with 25 pmol of 48-nucleotide wild-type H2a RNA (Fig. 1B) or its various derivatives pre-annealed to a 2′O-methyl adaptor oligonucleotide containing biotin at the 3′ end. The RNA-protein complexes were absorbed on streptavidin beads, and the amount of the radioactive protein associated with the RNA determined using SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. The 48-nucleotide wild-type RNA ending with the ACCCA bound 20–25% of the input 3′hExo (Fig. 1C, lane 2), whereas in the absence of RNA no protein was absorbed on the beads (lane 1). Progressive shortening of the ACCCA region resulted in a strong reduction of binding of 3′hExo to the RNA (lanes 3–5). A significant reduction in the efficiency of binding was also caused by extending the 3′ end with CUAG (+4) or 38 nucleotides (+38), as in the pre-H2a RNA (lanes 7–8). In addition to changing the length of the 3′ single-stranded tail, we replaced the entire ACCCA sequence with AUUUU. Binding of 3′hExo to this RNA was reduced compared with the wild-type RNA by a factor of 20 (lane 10). Therefore, in agreement with our previous results (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the ACCCA sequence at the end of histone mRNA is optimal for 3′hExo binding. Role of the SAP Domain and the Interdomain Spacer in RNA Binding—The interaction between 3′hExo and the 3′ end of histone mRNA was surprising because 3′hExo lacks any known RNA binding domain (Fig. 2A). The SAP domain (Fig. 2D) has been defined as a 35-residue motif containing an invariant glycine and a conserved distribution of hydrophobic, polar, and bulky amino acids (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The SAP domain is present in a number of eukaryotic proteins in conjunction with other domains that link these proteins with RNA or DNA metabolism (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The functional role of the SAP domain is unknown, although it has been suggested that it facilitates binding of proteins to double-stranded DNA (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In 3′hExo, the SAP domain exists together with the 3′ exonuclease domain (Fig. 2A). This organization is typical of orthologues of 3′hExo in other vertebrates and is also found in C. elegans ERI-1 (T02441), the only known invertebrate protein that contains both the SAP domain and the 3′ exonuclease domain (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We synthesized a 35S-labeled ΔSAP mutant lacking the SAP domain (amino acids 76–110) and analyzed its ability to bind 25 or 100 pmol of the SLbi RNA containing biotin at the 5′ end (Fig. 1B). No detectable amount of mutant protein was collected on streptavidin beads, demonstrating that deletion of the SAP domain abolished binding of 3′hExo to the SLbi RNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7). To determine whether deletion of the SAP domain resulted in global misfolding of 3′hExo rather than specifically affecting RNA binding, we expressed the ΔSAP protein in the baculovirus system and tested the ability of the mutant protein to degrade the 5′ labeled pre-H2a RNA. This 86-nucleotide RNA contains the internally located stem-loop, which prevents complete degradation of the RNA by 3′hExo, resulting instead in the formation of a 43-nucleotide product terminating with the stem. This product is 5 nucleotides shorter than the H2a RNA generated in a mouse nuclear extract from the pre-H2a RNA, which contains the ACCCA following the stem-loop (Fig. 2C, lane 5). The ΔSAP mutant protein at both 5 pmol (Fig. 2C, lane 3) and 1 pmol (not shown) efficiently degraded the RNA substrate to the stem and exhibited enzymatic activity comparable with that of the wild-type 3′hExo. This result demonstrates that removal of the SAP domain does not cause gross structural changes in 3′hExo and is also consistent with the fact that most nucleases of the DEDD family do not contain the SAP domain and yet display enzymatic activity. To identify amino acids of the SAP domain critical for RNA binding, we substituted selected amino acids with alanines. The SAP domain of 3′hExo contains two positively charged amino acids, Lys92 and Lys104, and two tyrosines, Tyr109 and Tyr110, that are conserved in ERI-1 but not present in other SAP domain proteins (Fig. 2D), suggesting that these residues may participate in sequence-specific RNA binding. Mutant proteins containing alanine at position 92 (K92) or 104 (K104) retained the wild-type efficiency to bind the SLbi RNA in the pulldown assay (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 9). No effect on binding was observed when the two mutations were combined in one K92+K104 protein (Fig. 2D, lane 11). Alanine substitution of Lys99, which is present in nearly all known SAP domains, reduced the ability of 3′hExo to bind the SLbi RNA only slightly (Fig. 2D, lane 7). Simultaneous substitution of two tyrosines at positions 109 and 110 with alanines (2Y mutant) had a similar small effect on binding (Fig. 2D, lane 13). Overall, these initial experiments failed to identify residues of the SAP domain that are involved in RNA binding, suggesting that the critical specificity determinants are provided by other amino acids of the domain and/or that simultaneous change of many amino acids may be required to adversely affect RNA binding ability of 3′hExo. Recently, the crystal structure of 3′hExo in complex with the SL RNA was solved, and it demonstrated that the SAP domain is indispensable for binding to the RNA and that a crucial role is played by arginine at position 105. 3Y. Cheng and D. Patel, personal communication. Guided by these studies, we substituted this residue with alanine. This single change was sufficient to abolish binding of 3′hExo to the SL RNA (Fig. 2E, lanes 6 and 7), whereas substitution of another arginine in position 96, which according to the crystal structure is not involved in RNA binding, had no effect (not shown). We next replaced the Lys111 and Lys112 with alanines, thus generating the 2K mutant protein. These two lysines are located in the interdomain spacer that separates the SAP domain from the 3′ exonuclease domain. The 35S-labeled 2K protein when tested in the pulldown assay did not detectably interact with 25 pmol of the SLbi RNA (Fig. 2D, lane 15). The baculovirus-expressed 2K protein in a wide range of concentrations retained normal enzymatic activity, indicating that the 2K mutation did not affect global folding of the exonuclease (Fig. 2F, lane 4, and not shown). We also mutated the YYDYI and ELRINEK sequences flanking the exonuclease domain (Fig. 2A). Mutations within these sequences, including alanine substitutions and partial or complete deletions, significantly reduced or abolished binding to the SLbi RNA (not shown). However, these mutations had also a negative effect on the enzymatic activity of 3′hExo (not shown), suggesting that they may partially disrupt the overall structure of the protein rather than specifically affect RNA binding. Residues of 3′hExo Required for the Enzymatic Activity—The 3′ exonuclease domain of 3′hExo is located between amino acids 133 and 311. Based on the amino acid sequence of this domain, we tentatively classified 3′hExo as a member of the DEDD family of 3′ exonucleases (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All members of this family are characterized by the presence of the four invariant acidic residues required for catalysis (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The DEDD family has been divided in two subfamilies depending on the presence of either a conserved histidine (DEDDh subfamily) or tyrosine (DEDDy subfamily). Structural studies of the exonuclease domain of 3′hExo complexed with rAMP in the presence of Mg2+ classified 3′hExo as a member of the DEDDh subfamily and identified the following invariant residues of the signature sequence: Asp134, Glu136, Asp234, Asp298, and His293 (9Cheng Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The four acidic residues coordinate two magnesium cations and together with histidine at position 293 provide a platform for hydrolytic cleavage of RNA substrates in the 3′–5′ direction (9Cheng Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To confirm that the aspartic acids at positions 234 and 298 are required for the exonuclease activity of 3′hExo, we substituted each of the two residues with an alanine. This approach was previously used to identify catalytic residues in two other 3′ exonucleases of the DEDD family (12Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two mutant proteins, D234 and D298, were expressed in the baculovirus system and tested for the ability to degrade the 5′ labeled 86-nucleotide pre-H2a RNA. The wild-type 3′hExo (25 pmol) converted all the input RNA into the 43-nucleotide intermediate (Fig. 3A, lane 3), whereas the two mutant proteins at this high protein concentration were inactive, thus confirming the importance of aspartic acids in positions 234 and 298 for catalysis (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 7). Human 3′hExo and its vertebrate orthologues as well as C. elegans ERI-1 contain another conserved aspartic acid, located in 3′hExo at position 198. Mutation of this residue to alanine did not abolish the enzymatic activity of 3′hExo, and at 25 pmol the D198 mutant protein displayed a comparable activity to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). At lower protein concentrations, the D198 mutant was less active than the wild-type 3′hExo (Fig. 4E, lanes 2 and 3). Substitution of a methionine 235 with alanine eliminated the exonuclease activity of 3′hExo (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Based on the presence of this methionine, the vertebrate orthologues of 3′hExo and C. elegans ERI-1 have been tentatively classified as members of a new DEMD subfamily rather than the DEDD subfamily (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4RNAs with modified 3′ ends as substrates for 3′hExo. A, the ability of 25 pmol of the baculovirus-expressed 3′hExo to degrade RNA intermediates (total 50 fmol) generated by partial S1 digestion (lane 4) or partial KOH hydrolysis (lane 6) of the 5′ labeled 86-nucleotide pre-H2a RNA. Degradation of the untreated pre-H2a RNA (Untreat) by 3′hExo is shown in lane 2. The input RNA substrates are shown in lanes 1, 3, and 5. B, the ability of 25 pmol of the baculovirus-expressed 3′hExo to degrade 50 fmol of the pre-H2a RNA labeled at the 3′ end by [5′-32P]pCp. The RNA was incubated in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ with 3′hExo alone (lane 2), with 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase alone (lane 3), or simultaneously with both enzymes (lane 4). The samples were prepared in a total volume of 10 μl and processed as described for Fig. 2C. The input RNA substrate is shown in lane 1. C, the ability of 25 pmol (left panel) or 1 pmol (right panel) of the baculovirus-expressed variants of 3′hExo to degrade 50 fmol of the 5′ labeled 28-nucleotide RNA/2′H terminating with a 2′ deoxycytidine. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 μl containing 2.5 mm Mg2+. D, the ability of 25 pmol of the baculovirus-expressed WT 3′hExo to degrade 50 fmol of the 5′ labeled 28-nucleotide RNA/2′3′H terminating with a dideoxycytidine. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 μl with either 2.5 mm Mg2+ (lane 2) or 10 mm EDTA (lane 3). E, the ability of 1 pmol of the baculovirus-expressed variants of 3′hExo to degrade 50 fmol of the 5′ labeled pre-H2a RNA in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether the baculovirus-expressed mutant proteins enzymatically inactive because of mutations within the conserved residues retain normal ability to bind the 31-nucleotide SL RNA in the mobility shift assay. The SL RNA was identical to the SLbi but was lacking biotin, thus allowing labeling at the 5′ end (Fig. 1, A and B). In the presence of 10 mm EDTA both 3′hExo and SLBP form a binary complex with the SL RNA, although the interaction of the RNA with 3′hExo is not as strong as with SLBP (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). A ternary complex with the SL RNA is formed in the presence of SLBP and 3′hExo (Fig. 3B, lane 4). The same ability to form a binary and a ternary complex in the presence of EDTA was observed for the D234 protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) and D298 protein (not shown, see also Fig. 3C), demonstrating that these two 3′hExo mutants retain normal ability to interact with the SL RNA and SLBP. Surprisingly, the M235 protein was unable to interact with the SL RNA or to efficiently form a ternary complex containing SLBP (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that mutation of Met235 leads to global changes in the 3′hExo structure that abolish both binding and catalytic functions of the protein. A significant amount of the SL probe incubated with the M235 was trapped in the well during electrophoresis (not shown), suggesting protein aggregation and further supporting the notion that mutation of methionine 235 results in protein misfolding. We also tested the ability of the ΔSAP mutant expressed in the baculovirus system to form the binary and ternary complexes. In agreement with the results of the pull-down assay (Fig. 2, B and E), this mutant was unable to interact with the SL RNA and to efficiently form the ternary complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10). SLBP also forms a stable complex with the SL RNA in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3C, lane 2). As previously shown (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), under these conditions 3′hExo degrades the SL RNA, precluding detection of a binary complex (Fig. 3C, lane 3). SLBP prevents degradation of the SL RNA by 3′hExo in the presence of Mg2+, thus allowing detection of a stable ternary complex containing the two proteins (Fig. 3C, lane 4) (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As expected, the enzymatically inactive D298 protein formed a stable binary complex with the SL RNA also in the presence of magnesium ions and efficiently cooperated with SLBP in forming a ternary complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6). A 3′OH Is Required for Efficient Degradation of RNA Substrates by 3′hExo—To determine whether 3′hExo is sensitive to the nature of the 3′ end of the substrate, we tested a number of RNAs containing various groups at the 3′ terminal nucleotide. We generated a ladder of degradation products by treating the 5′ labeled pre-H2a RNA with either KOH, which leaves a cyclic 2′–3′ phosphate, or nuclease S1, which leaves a 3′ hydroxyl (14Sollner-Webb B. Cruz-Reyes J. Rusche L.N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The products of alkaline hydrolysis were resistant to 3′hExo, whereas the full-length RNA present in the same reaction mixture was shortened to the 43-nucleotide intermediate by the enzyme, indicating that the presence of the cyclic phosphate inhibits the 3′hExo activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). As expected, the RNA partially degraded by S1 nuclease was efficiently shortened to the 43-nucleotide intermediate (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). To further demonstrate that a phosphate group at the 3′ end prevents enzymatic degradation, we ligated [5′-32P]pCp to the 3′ end of the pre-H2a RNA, thus generating an 87-nucleotide RNA substrate labeled near the 3′ end and terminating with a 3′ phosphate. This RNA was resistant to 25 pmol of 3′hExo alone and became degraded by this amount of the enzyme only after simultaneous addition of calf intestinal phosphatase that removes the terminal phosphate (Fig. 4B). We next tested whether 3′hExo can degrade a 5′ labeled RNA terminating with a 2′ deoxynucleotide. We used an unstructured 28-mer consisting of 27 ribonucleotides extended at the 3′ end by a 2′ deoxycytidine (RNA/2′H). The wild-type enzyme at 25 pmol efficiently degraded this substrate, whereas the D298 mutant protein was inactive (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 4). In the presence of 1 pmol of the wild-type 3′hExo, the degradation of the RNA/2′H was very inefficient (Fig. 4C, lane 6), and only a portion of the input was converted to a 23-nucleotide intermediate as determined by using high resolution gel electrophoresis (not shown). The same amount of 3′hExo degraded the majority of the pre-H2a RNA to the 43-nucleotide product (Fig. 4E, lane 2), indicating that the presence of 2′ hydrogen at the last nucleotide slows down RNA degradation. The reason for the accumulation of the 23-nucleotide RNA is unclear. The presence of two uridines at the 3′ end of this RNA may indicate that 3′hExo at lower concentrations is inefficient in degrading short RNAs when it encounters a tract of uridines. We have previously observed generation of an intermediate ending with uridines during degradation of the stem-loop RNA (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition to the wild-type 3′hExo and the D298 mutant protein we tested the D198 protein. At 1 pmol, this mutant protein compared with the wild-type 3′hExo displayed moderately reduced activity on both the RNA/2′H and the pre-H2a substrates (Fig. 4C, lane 7; Fig. 4E, lane 3). We next tested an RNA oligonucleotide identical to the RNA/2′H but terminating with a dideoxycytidine (RNA/2′3′H). This substrate compared with the RNA/2′H was more resistant to the wild-type 3′hExo, and in the presence of the highest concentration of the enzyme (25 pmol) and 2.5 mm Mg2+ only ∼30% of the input was completely degraded (Fig. 4D, lane 3). No degradation was observed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA inhibiting the enzyme (Fig. 4E, lane 2). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the nature of the chemical modification at the 2′ and 3′ ribose of the last nucleotide greatly affects the ability of 3′hExo to degrade RNA substrates and a phosphate exerts a particularly inhibitory effect. Our earlier studies failed to demonstrate that 3′hExo is active on substrates consisting entirely of deoxynucleotides and thus suggested that 3′hExo is an RNA-specific exonuclease (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have tested a number of additional single-stranded DNA substrates and detected a very limited 3′ exonuclease activity with some longer oligonucleotides only in the presence of high enzyme concentrations (25 pmol and more). Further studies are required to determine whether 3′hExo under certain circumstances can indeed function as DNase. 3′hExo Can Remove the 2-Nucleotide Overhangs from siRNAs—Recent genome-wide screening for proteins potentially involved in RNA interference suggested that ERI-1, a C. elegans homologue of 3′hExo, may be involved in degrading siRNAs (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both 3′hExo and ERI-1, when expressed in rabbit reticulocytes, were reported to efficiently degrade double-stranded RNAs and to be inactive on 21-nucleotide single-stranded RNA substrates (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the baculovirus-expressed 3′hExo to degrade siRNAs, we carried out a number of experiments using two 21-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, siRNA-S and siRNA-A, which upon annealing formed a 19-nucleotide double-stranded region extended on each side by 2-nucleotide 3′ overhangs. As expected, each 21-mer labeled at the 5′ end was completely degraded by 25 pmol of 3′hExo in the presence of magnesium ions (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 6), and no degradation was observed in the presence of EDTA inhibiting the enzyme (lanes 2 and 5). To determine whether formation of the double-stranded RNA prevents degradation by 3′hExo, 25 pmol of the enzyme were incubated with 50 fmol of the 5′ end-labeled siRNA-S either alone, with increasing amounts of the same unlabeled siRNA-S (cold-S), or the complementary siRNA-A (cold-A). The radioactive RNA used in the reaction alone or in the presence of 1 to 10-fold molar excess of the same unlabeled RNA was completely degraded by 3′hExo (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–5, degradation products not shown). However, the presence of the siRNA-A efficiently protected the labeled RNA against the activity of 3′hExo, leading to accumulation of products 18–20 nucleotides in length (Fig. 5B, lanes 6–8). Increasing the amount of the complementary RNA resulted in more labeled substrate being protected, likely because of increased efficiency in formation of the double-stranded RNA. Generation of an 18-nucleotide product indicates that 3′hExo, in addition to removing the 2-nucleotide overhangs, can also remove the first nucleotide of the double-stranded regions. In the presence of 1 pmol of 3′hExo the pre-annealed RNA was stable, indicating that the enzyme at this low concentration is unable to remove 3′ overhangs (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6), although it can partially degrade the single-stranded RNA under these conditions (Fig. 5C, lanes 2–4). The Intracellular Localization of 3′hExo—To determine the intracellular localization of 3′hExo, we cloned 3′hExo in-frame with C-terminal green fluorescent protein and analyzed the distribution of the fusion protein in HeLa cells using fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 6). The 3′hExo-green fluorescent protein fusion protein predominantly accumulated in the cytoplasm and the nucleoli. Localization of the 3′hExo-green fluorescent protein to these two compartments was observed in all transfected cells and was independent of the overall level of expression of the fusion protein. This localization is consistent with our fractionation studies, which demonstrated the presence of the endogenous 3′hExo both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (not shown). The highly conserved 26-nucleotide sequence at the 3′ end of mammalian replication-dependent histone mRNAs containing a 6-base pair stem and a 4-nucleotide loop followed by ACCCA is specifically recognized by two proteins, the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and a protein with 3′ exonuclease activity designated 3′hExo (2Dominski Z. Yang X. Kaygun H. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whereas SLBP is known to play multiple roles in biogenesis and metabolism of histone mRNAs (1Marzluff W.F. Duronio R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the role of 3′hExo remains unknown. Here we carried out a number of experiments to further characterize this exonuclease. Crystallographic studies of the 3′ exonuclease domain of 3′hExo indicate that 3′hExo belongs to the DEDDh subfamily of exonucleases and that the invariant residues involved in catalysis include Asp134, Glu136, Asp234, Asp298, and His293 (9Cheng Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This classification has been confirmed by our mutational analysis demonstrating that alanine substitution of either Asp234 or Asp298 eliminates enzymatic activity of 3′hExo. The residues of the DEDDh core identified in 3′hExo by the crystallographic studies are highly conserved in all vertebrate orthologues of 3′hExo and in other putative exonucleases that share significant similarity with 3′hExo, including ERI-1 and three other homologues of this protein in C. elegans (not shown). Interestingly, all these proteins contain a highly conserved aspartate (position 198 in human 3′hExo) that is not part of the DEDDh core. Mutation of this residue to alanine did not abolish the enzymatic activity of 3′hExo but moderately reduced its ability to degrade RNA substrates. A structure-based comparison with other known 3′ exonucleases of the DEDD family revealed that 3′hExo is more similar to DNA-specific exonucleases, including a proofreading domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III, than to RNases (9Cheng Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At least one enzyme of the DEDD family, E. coli RNase T, is both DNase and RNase (10Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Zuo Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fact, RNase T is more active on DNA than on RNA substrates (15Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4077-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and can complement defects in DNA repair in cells lacking other DNases normally involved in excising damaged nucleotides from DNA (18Viswanathan M. Lanjuin A. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 929-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that participation in some aspects of DNA metabolism may be a natural function of RNase T in addition to its role in RNA metabolism. We demonstrated that 3′hExo is primarily an exoribonuclease. Single-stranded DNAs are very poor substrates, if at all, for 3′hExo and therefore unlikely to be degraded by this enzyme under physiological conditions. Efficient degradation of RNA substrates by 3′hExo requires 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups at the last nucleotide. The activity of two other DEDD exonucleases, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (19Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and RNase T (16Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29654-29661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), has been previously shown to depend on the presence of the 3′ hydroxyl at the last nucleotide of their substrates. The most characteristic feature of 3′hExo is its ability to specifically and tightly bind the stem-loop at the 3′ end of histone mRNAs. Binding of 3′hExo to the stem-loop is facilitated by simultaneous binding of SLBP, which recognizes the opposite platform of the same RNA target. A detailed picture of how 3′hExo interacts with the SL RNA and how SLBP facilitates binding of 3′hExo to its RNA target will become available through structural studies of the binary and ternary complexes. Deletion of amino acids immediately flanking the 3′ exonuclease domain had a strong negative effect on RNA binding but at the same time reduced catalytic activity of 3′hExo, suggesting that these mutations at least partially affect global folding of the protein rather than target amino acids specifically involved in RNA binding. The strong inhibitory effect on RNA binding ability of 3′hExo was caused by deletion of the SAP domain or an alanine substitution of Lys111 and Lys112 located immediately to its C terminus. These two mutations did not affect enzymatic activity of 3′hExo, suggesting that both the SAP domain and the two lysines are specifically required for interaction with the SL RNA. Indeed, recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the 3′hExo-SL RNA complex demonstrated that the SAP domain is involved in binding to the RNA with the crucial role being played by arginine at position 105.3 Substitution of this residue with alanine was sufficient to abolish binding of 3′hExo to the SL RNA. The sequence-specific interaction of 3′hExo with the 3′ end of histone mRNAs either alone or together with SLBP strongly suggests that 3′hExo may play a role in the rapid decay of histone mRNA at the end of S-phase. This function is consistent with the high concentration of 3′hExo in the cytoplasm, the site of histone mRNA degradation. ERI-1 has been identified by genome-wide scanning for mutants of C. elegans with enhanced RNA interference, leading to the hypothesis that one function of this exonuclease may be to degrade siRNAs (8Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). However, as demonstrated recently, ERI-1 exists in a complex with Dicer and, in addition to down-regulating the response to exogenous double-stranded RNAs, is required for accumulation of several endogenous siRNAs (20Duchaine T.F. Wohlschlegel J.A. Kennedy S. Bei Y. Conte Jr., D. Pang K. Brownell D.R. Harding S. Mitani S. Ruvkun G. Yates III, J.R. Mello C.C. Cell. 2006; 124: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Based on these studies a new model for the molecular function of ERI-1 has been proposed. In this model, inspired by the unique features of 3′hExo, ERI-1 binds to short stem-loops in a group of endogenous RNAs and removes unpaired 3′ nucleotides, thus generating a structure suitable for synthesis of double-stranded RNA species subsequently cleaved by Dicer and involved in RNA interference (20Duchaine T.F. Wohlschlegel J.A. Kennedy S. Bei Y. Conte Jr., D. Pang K. Brownell D.R. Harding S. Mitani S. Ruvkun G. Yates III, J.R. Mello C.C. Cell. 2006; 124: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Future studies should provide more information on molecular functions of ERI-1 and 3′hExo and help to determine whether these two proteins are related functionally in addition to sharing significant sequence similarity.

https://openalex.org/W2041107761,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), the gastrin-release peptide (GRP) and its cognate receptor (GRP-R) are overexpressed in a significant percentage of colorectal carcinomas and are associated with cell growth, invasiveness and tumor progression. However, a molecular link between all of them in adenocarcinomas has not been established. Here, we show that bombesin (BBS), a GRP homolog, stimulates the expression of Cox-2 mRNA and protein in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, resulting in enhanced release of prostaglandin E2. These effects were markedly inhibited by the specific BBS antagonist RC-3940-II. BBS promotes the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) through a Ca2+/calcineurin (Cn)-linked pathway. Upon BBS stimulation, the NFATc1 isoform translocates into the nucleus with a concomitant increase in NFATc1 binding to two specific recognition sites in the promoter region of the Cox-2 gene. Furthermore, inhibition of Cn activity by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A impaired NFAT activation and diminished Cox-2 expression in BBS-stimulated cells. Interestingly, BBS pretreatment strongly enhances the invasive capacity of carcinoma cells, effect which was inhibited by a Cox-2-specific inhibitor. These findings provide the first evidence for the involvement of the Ca2+/Cn/NFAT pathway in BBS-mediated induction of genes involved in colon carcinoma invasiveness such as Cox-2."
https://openalex.org/W2093380519,"The E2F family of transcription factors regulates a diverse array of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that E2F can also regulate transcription of upstream components of signal transduction pathways. We show here that E2F1 modulates the activity of the p38 MAPK pathway via E2F1-induced transient up-regulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The mechanism by which E2F1 modulates p38 MAPK phosphorylation involves transcriptional induction of the kinase ASK1, a member of the MAPKKK family that phosphorylates p38 MKKs. Subsequent E2F-dependent down-regulation of the p38 signaling pathway is achieved through E2F-induced up-regulation of Wip1, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates p38. Both ASK1 and Wip1 are essential mediators of the E2F-p38 connection: knock down of ASK1 inhibits E2F1-induced phosphorylation of p38, whereas knock down of Wip1 prolongs E2F1-induced p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Wip1 knock down enhances E2F1-induced apoptosis. Therefore, our data reveal a novel link between a central signaling pathway and the transcription factor E2F and identify Wip1 as a modulator of E2F1-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970357815,"Multiple chromosome 3p tumor suppressor genes (TSG) have been proposed in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer based on complex patterns of 3p loss. To attain functional evidence in support of TSGs and identify candidate regions, we applied a chromosome transfer method involving cell fusions of the tumorigenic OV90 human ovarian cancer cell line, monoallelic for 3p and an irradiated mouse cell line containing a human chromosome 3 in order to derive OV90 hybrids containing normal 3p fragments. The resulting hybrids showed complete or incomplete suppression of tumorigenicity in nude mouse xenograft assays, and varied in their ability to form colonies in soft agarose and three-dimensional spheroids in a manner consistent with alteration of their in vivo tumorigenic phenotypes. Expression microarray analysis identified a set of common differentially expressed genes, such as SPARC, DAB2 and VEGF, some of which have been shown implicated in ovarian cancer. Genotyping assays revealed that they harbored normal 3p fragments, some of which overlapped candidate TSG regions (3p25–p26, 3p24 and 3p14-pcen) identified previously in loss of heterozygosity analyses of ovarian cancers. However, only the 3p12-pcen region was acquired in common by all hybrids where expression microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes. The correlation of 3p12-pcen transfer and tumor suppression with a concerted re-programming of the cellular transcriptome suggest that the putative TSG may have affected key underlying events in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987559776,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers ectopically express multiple splice variants of the cholecystokinin-2 (CCK(2))/gastrin receptor; however, their relative contributions to the cancer phenotype are unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CCK(2) receptor (CCK(2)R) and CCK(2i4sv)R expression on cell growth both in vitro and in vivo using a human epithelial cell model, HEK239. In vitro, receptor variant expression did not affect cell proliferation either in the absence or presence of agonist. However, in vivo, the expression of CCK(2i4sv)R, but not CCK(2)R, increases HEK293 tumor growth in a constitutive, Src-dependent manner. Enhanced tumorigenicity of CCK(2i4sv)R is associated with an Src-dependent increase in the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, its downstream target, vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor micro-vessel density, suggesting that CCK(2i4sv)R may contribute to the growth and spread of GI cancers through agonist-independent mechanisms that enhance tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016160282,"p21 plays a dual role in keratinocyte growth and differentiation control. It restricts the number of keratinocyte stem cell populations while inhibiting the later stages of differentiation independently of the cell cycle. The molecular/biochemical mechanism for the differentiation suppressive function of p21 is unknown. Here we show that elevated p21 expression leads to activation of MAPK family members in a keratinocyte-specific and cell cycle-independent manner, and up-regulation of MAPK activity can explain the inhibitory effects of p21 on differentiation. p21 induces transcription of several genes with MAPK activation potential. Although several of these genes are induced by p21 in a MAPK-dependent manner, expression of IGF-I is induced upstream of MAPK activation. IGF-I stimulation is by itself sufficient to cause MAPK activation and inhibit differentiation and suppression of IGF-I signaling by knock down of the cognate receptor (IGF-R1), diminishing the ability of p21 to activate MAPK and suppress differentiation. Thus, in keratinocytes, the ability of p21 to suppress differentiation can be explained by cell type-specific activation of the MAPK cascade by transcriptional up-regulation of the IGF-I gene."

DSBs can be caused by exogenous and endogenous agents such as ionizing radiation and chemical mutagens and by endogenously produced radicals or as a result of replication arrest and/or collapse of the replication fork (1Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 2Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). DSBs are lethal if unrepaired and if repaired improperly may result in genome instability such as mutations, genomic rearrangements, and chromosome loss. Therefore, the repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival and for maintaining the integrity of the genome.In Escherichia coli, the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination is responsible for the repair of DSBs. RecBCD initially processes broken ends into 3′ single-stranded DNA tails by its helicase nuclease activities (2Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These single-stranded DNA tails then invade homologous duplex DNA via a RecA-mediated mechanism. However, the RecF pathway, which is another RecA-dependent recombination pathway, can also promote DSB repair when the RecBCD pathway is inactivated by mutations (e.g. recBC sbcBC). E. coli recN has two SOS boxes in the promoter region of recN that confer inducibility on recN in response to SOS signaling (3Lloyd R.G. Picksley S.M. Prescott C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Finch P.W. Chambers P. Emmerson P.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 653-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of recN reduces conjugational recombination in recBC sbcBC strains (3Lloyd R.G. Picksley S.M. Prescott C. Mol. Gen.

Res. 1983; 93: 461-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that RecN is part of the RecF pathway of recombination. However, in contrast to the other genes of the RecF pathway, mutations in recN do not restore resistance to thymineless death (6Picksley S.M. Attfield P.V. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and there is evidence suggesting that the RecN protein is also required for RecBCD-dependent repair of DSBs (6Picksley S.M. Attfield P.V. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Wang T.C. Smith K.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that RecN is required to repair chromosomal breaks at a specific location by I-SceI endonuclease (8Meddows T.R. Savory A.P. Grove J.I. Moore T. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recN mutants are sensitive to ionizing radiation and mitomycin C but not to UV irradiation (5Sargentini N.J. Smith K.C. Radiat. Res. 1983; 93: 461-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, RecN does not fall clearly into either pathway of recombination, but rather it may be involved in the repair of DNA DSBs by homologous recombination.RecN contains an extensive centrally located coiled-coil domain and globular N- and C-terminal domains containing nucleotide binding Walker A and Walker B motifs, respectively, which are characteristic of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) family (9Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 10Hirano T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SMC proteins play fundamental roles in DNA replication and/or chromosomal segregation by maintaining and modulating chromosome structure in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Recent studies show that SMC proteins also play roles in global gene regulation, cell cycle checkpoints, and DNA repair and that the functions of SMC proteins and their non-SMC subunits are regulated by post-translational modification (11Nasmyth K.

Furthermore, we also show that in ΔclpX cells, DNA damage-inducible RecN formed visible aggregates in the cytoplasm that persisted after release from DNA damage and were deleterious to cell survival. These data demonstrate that proteolytic removal of toxic RecN aggregates plays an important role in efficient recovery after release from DNA damage and is therefore crucial for cell homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia and General Methods—Standard methods for E. coli genetics and recombinant DNA techniques were as described by Miller (16Miller J.H.

Arabinose-inducible recN (pTF270) or GFP-recN (pTF271) was constructed by cloning the recN or GFP-recN gene into pTF200 (21Shibata T. Hishida T. Kubota Y. Han Y.W. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All recN mutants were generated by PCR and replaced with the wild-type recN gene of pRecN. The structure of recombinant plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Sensitivity to Mitomycin C (MMC)—For quantitative assays, cells were grown to early log phase in Luria Bertani (LB) (or LB containing ampicillin where appropriate) at 37 °C. MMC (1 μg/ml) was added, and aliquots were taken at the indicated times. The percent survival was determined by plating dilutions of the culture on LB or LB containing ampicillin. Colonies were counted after 20 h. The results are the mean of at least five independent experiments.In Vivo Degradation and Western Blot Analysis—In vivo degradation assays were carried out as described previously (22Neher S.B. Flynn J.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cultures (A600 ∼ 0.3) were treated with 0.5 μg/ml MMC for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 μg/ml of chloramphenicol was added to stop protein synthesis. Aliquots (1 × 108 cells) were taken at the indicated times and centrifuged. Cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 0.1 m NaCl, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol), and lysed by boiling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (23Hishida T. Han Y.W. Shibata T. Kubota Y. Ishino Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1886-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with the ECL Advance Western blotting kit (GE Healthcare) using anti-RecN antibody. Antibody against RecN was raised against purified His-tagged full-length RecN.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with methanol and then stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The results of GFP fluorescence analysis were not affected by fixation. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan2 (23Hishida T. Han Y.W. Shibata T. Kubota Y. Ishino Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1886-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Scale bars of 5 or 10 μm are shown in the figures.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecN Is Unstable in Vivo—We examined the translational and post-translational regulation of RecN in stressed and unstressed cells. Cells were transiently exposed to γ-irradiation to generate DNA DSBs, and RecN stability was monitored using anti-RecN antibody. In wild-type cells exposed to ionizing radiation, RecN protein was dramatically induced within 20 min (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the fact that E. coli recN is a member of the SOS regulon (3Lloyd R.G. Picksley S.M. Prescott C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Finch P.W. Chambers P. Emmerson P.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 653-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, RecN rapidly declined to near basal levels within 160 min after exposure to ionizing radiation (Fig. 1A). The fact that RecN is transiently induced in irradiated cells suggests that RecN is unstable or that its stability is regulated in stressed cells. To directly examine the stability of RecN in vivo, we quantified its level in cells exposed to MMC followed by protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol. The level of RecN protein increased rapidly for 60 min in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml MMC at 37 °C; however, after addition of chloramphenicol, RecN was rapidly degraded with a half-life of ∼8 min (Fig. 1B). Thus, RecN is unstable and has a short half-life under these conditions.RecN Is a Substrate for ClpXP Protease—In E. coli, targeted intracellular proteolysis is largely carried out by energy-dependent proteases encoded by lon, hslV, clpP, and ftsH (24Porankiewicz J. Wang J. Clarke A.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because RecN might be a substrate for one or more of these proteases, RecN stability was examined in lon, hslV, clpP, and ftsH mutant strains. FtsH is essential for viability (26Qu J.N. Makino S.I. Adachi H. Koyama Y. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Tomoyasu T. Ogura T. Matsuzawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), so the ftsH null strain also carried the suppressor mutation sfhC. The results indicated that the stability of RecN was significantly greater in the clpP deletion strain, but not in other protease-deficient strains (Fig. 1C), suggesting that RecN is a substrate for a ClpP-dependent protease. ClpP protein associates with either of two ATPases, ClpA or ClpX, to form two distinct proteolytic complexes, ClpAP and ClpXP, that are remarkably similar to the 26S proteasome in eukaryotic cells (27Katayama Y. Gottesman S. Pumphrey J. Rudikoff S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15226-15236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V.

Biol. 1998; 124: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether RecN is degraded by ClpXP, ClpAP, or both, the stability of RecN was measured in clpX and clpA mutants. The experiments showed that RecN was rapidly degraded in the ΔclpA strain, but not in the ΔclpX strain (Fig. 1C). Recently, Neher et al. (30Neher S.B. Villen J. Oakes E.C. Bakalarski C.E. Sauer R.T. Gygi S.P. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that proteomic profiling of ClpXPtrap substrates after DNA damage revealed extensive instability within the SOS regulon and identified RecN as one of the proteins targeted for ClpXP degradation. Thus, our results, taken together with those of previous studies, support the conclusion that RecN is a substrate for ClpXP protease.The C Terminus of RecN Is Required for Its Degradation—The stability of RecN was also measured in strains expressing truncated forms of RecN composed of N-terminal (DI or DI-II), C-terminal (DII-III), or central (DII) fragments of RecN. Cells were treated with MMC to induce the truncated forms of RecN and then treated with chloramphenicol, and the level of RecN was measured by Western blotting. The C-terminal fragment (DII-III) was rapidly degraded after addition of chloramphenicol (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the N-terminal or central fragments (DI, DII, or DI-II) were much more stable (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the C-terminal fragment of RecN is essential for ClpXP-mediated degradation of RecN.Previous studies showed that ClpX recognizes short signals called degradation tags near the N or C terminus of its protein substrates (31Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 33Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). One of the better characterized degradation tags is SsrA, an 11-amino acid peptide (AANDENYALAA) that is attached co-translationally to the C terminus of nascent polypeptides when ribosomes stall (34Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Notably, the C-terminal sequence of RecN is very similar to the SsrA degradation tag (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the C-terminal residues of RecN might be a signal for ClpXP-mediated degradation. This idea was tested by carrying out site-directed mutagenesis on alanine residues in the C-terminal sequence of RecN. Thus, both alanines 552 and 553 in RecN were substituted with aspartic acid, generating RecND552A-D553A (RecNDD). Wild-type RecN and RecNDD were cloned into a low copy plasmid and expressed from its native promoter. As shown in Fig. 1F, RecNDD was induced by MMC and was extremely stable in the presence of chloramphenicol, indicating that the C-terminal sequence of RecN is essential for ClpXP-mediated degradation of RecN.Intracellular Localization of RecN in Cells with DNA Damage—The expression and stability of RecN were examined in vivo using an SOS-regulated N-terminal fusion between GFP and RecN. GFP-RecN was expressed from a low copy plasmid under its native promoter, and its localization was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. Control experiments established that GFP-RecN fully complemented the repair deficiency of a recN deletion strain (Fig. 2A) and that the level of GFP-RecN was comparable with that of RecN expressed from its native promoter on the chromosome (data not shown). Thus, wild-type RecN and GFP-RecN appear to function similarly in vivo.FIGURE 2RecN foci in cells with or without DNA damage. A, GFP-RecN functions in vivo. Three serial dilutions of the indicated strains were spotted on LB plates with or without MMC (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h.

The upper and lower panels show DAPI and GFP images, respectively. C, subcellular localization of a GFP-RecN focus formed in response to MMC-induced DNA damage.

Cells were observed with fluorescent microscopy. An anucleate cell containing a RecN focus is indicated by a white arrow. E, localization of the GFP-RecN focus in the absence or presence of DNA damage. Cells containing an arabinose-inducible GFP-recN gene (pTF271) were exposed to γ-rays (200 grays) followed by the addition of arabinose (0.04%) to induce GFP-recN. The panels show GFP, DAPI, and GFP/DAPI-merged images of cells at 30 min after incubation in the presence of arabinose. Glucose control is shown at the right. F, quantitative analysis of GFP-RecN foci. For cells with or without γ-rays, ∼300 cells were examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During the exponential phase of growth, no GFP-RecN focus formation was observed. After exposure to MMC for 60 min, ∼85% of treated cells contained GFP-RecN foci (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with previous results indicating that Bacillus subtilis RecN-YFP forms foci in cells with DNA DSBs (35Kidane D. Sanchez H. Alonso J.C. Graumann P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Notably, the merged image between the DAPI and GFP images revealed that GFP-RecN was localized not only as a discrete focus on the nucleoid but also at the cell poles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). These foci are not detected in cells expressing GFP as a control (data not shown). In addition, RecN foci were also observed in anucleoid cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that cytoplasmic GFP-RecN foci represent nonspecific RecN aggregates. This is also supported by the facts that E. coli RecN protein readily forms large protein aggregates (8Meddows T.R. Savory A.P. Grove J.I. Moore T. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and protein aggregates are generally likely to accumulate at cell poles in the cytoplasm in bacteria.The results described above indicate that the expression of recN is temporally restricted and tightly regulated in cells with DNA damage. The subcellular localization of RecN foci in vivo was examined in greater detail using cells expressing GFP-RecN from the inducible araC promoter. Cells were grown to mid-log phase, exposed to γ-rays, and immediately transferred to arabinose-containing medium to induce GFP-RecN. Control cells were not irradiated and/or not exposed to arabinose. The results showed that cytoplasmic (95% of total cells), but not nucleoid-associated (<5%), GFP-RecN foci formed in unirradiated cells exposed to arabinose, whereas both cytoplasmic (91%) and nucleoid-associated (83%) GFP-RecN foci formed in irradiated cells exposed to arabinose (Fig. 2, E and F). GFP foci were not observed in glucose-containing medium (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained in cells with MMC-induced DNA damage (data not shown). These results suggest that DNA DSBs trigger formation of nucleoid-associated GFP-RecN foci.ClpXP-degraded Cytoplasmic RecN Aggregates after Release from MMC Treatment—GFP-RecN foci were also characterized in ΔclpX cells. Wild-type and mutant cells expressing SOS-inducible GFP-RecN were treated with MMC (0.5 μg/ml) for 60 min, transferred to medium lacking MMC, and allowed to recover for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment with MMC for 60 min, cells were filamented and >80% of cells contained GFP-RecN foci (Fig. 3A, at time zero). Western analysis revealed that MMC-induced GFP-RecN is degraded after transfer to medium lacking MMC in wild-type cells, but not in ΔclpX cells (Fig. 3A). Consistently, in wild-type cells, nucleoid-associated and cytoplasmic GFP-RecN foci disappeared rapidly (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, in ΔclpX cells, whereas nucleoid-associated GFP-RecN foci disappeared after transfer to medium lacking MMC, cytoplasmic GFP-RecN foci persisted for 2 h and were transmitted to daughter cells when cell division resumed in MMC-free medium (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, GFP-Rec-NDD also persisted in the form of cytoplasmic RecN aggregates after release from DNA damage (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that ClpXP degrades cytoplasmic RecN foci in cells with DNA damage.FIGURE 3ClpXP degraded cytoplasmic RecN aggregates after release from MMC treatment. A, cells containing pSG101 (SOS-inducible GFP-recN) were treated with 0.5 mg/ml MMC for 60 min, released into fresh LB medium without MMC, and further incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times after release from MMC treatment, cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy. At the same time points, aliquots of whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RecN antibody. B, quantitative analysis of GFP-RecN after release from MMC treatment. Filled squares and filled circles indicate the percentage of cells with RecN foci and cytoplasmic RecN foci, respectively. For each of the strains, ∼300 cells were examined.

The panel shows DAPI and GFP images of cells 100 min after removal of MMC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Degradation of Cytoplasmic RecN Aggregates by ClpXP Is Important for Cell Viability—Non-native polypeptides that tend to form protein aggregates can have toxic effects and ultimately cause human disease (36Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar, 37Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of RecN aggregates in promoting survival and/or DNA repair in cells with DNA damage was examined by measuring cell survival in wild-type, ΔrecN, and ΔclpX cells treated with MMC. When cells were treated with MMC for 1 h, cell survival was lower in ΔrecN cells than in wild-type cells, but similar in ΔclpX and wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). However, when cells were treated with MMC for relatively long periods of time (∼10 h), cell survival was lower in ΔclpX cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether excess levels of cytoplasmic RecN aggregates are responsible for low cell viability, we examined the MMC sensitivity of ΔrecN cells harboring a low copy number plasmid that expresses RecN or RecNDD. The cell survival of ΔrecN cells expressing RecNDD was similar to the survival of those expressing wild-type RecN after 1 h of exposure to MMC (Fig. 4C) but was lower than the survival of those expressing wild-type RecN after 10 h of exposure to MMC (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that cytoplasmic RecN aggregates may negatively affect cell survival in stressed cells with chronic DNA damage, thus confirming the functional roles of the targeting of RecN for degradation by ClpXP. One possible explanation for these results is that the accumulated RecN aggregates in ΔclpX or recNDD cells might lead to sequestration of de novo RecN protein and/or other DNA repair proteins and specifically interfere with DNA repair pathways. Indeed, this toxic effect caused by RecN aggregates is specific to cells with DNA damage, because wild-type and ΔclpX cells had similar viability (>90%) in the absence of DNA damage even if RecN aggregates were induced in wild-type or ΔclpX cells harboring the arabinose-inducible recN plasmid (data not shown). It should be noted that MMC-treated ΔclpX cells had lower survival than MMC-treated recNDD cells (Fig. 4, B and D). This probably reflects the fact that ClpXP carries out targeted degradation of multiple cellular proteins (22Neher S.B. Flynn J.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Neher S.B. Villen J. Oakes E.C. Bakalarski C.E. Sauer R.T. Gygi S.P. Baker T.A. Mol.

Targeted intracellular proteolysis by energy-dependent proteases is an essential component of many response pathways. This study showed that RecN protein is degraded by the ClpXP protease in a manner dependent upon the signaling residues at the C terminus of RecN. In addition, DNA damage-induced RecN forms both nucleoid-associated and cytoplasmic foci.

https://openalex.org/W1968132967,"Myotubularins (MTM) are a large subfamily of lipid phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate at the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) in PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. We recently found that MTMR6 specifically inhibits the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, KCa3.1, by dephosphorylating PI(3)P. We now show that inhibition is specific for MTMR6 and other MTMs do not inhibit KCa3.1. By replacing either or both of the coiled-coil (CC) and pleckstrin homology/GRAM (PH/G) domains of MTMs that failed to inhibit KCa3.1 with the CC and PH/G domains of MTMR6, we found that chimeric MTMs containing both the MTMR6 CC and PH/G domains functioned like MTMR6 to inhibit KCa3.1 channel activity, whereas chimeric MTMs containing either domain alone did not. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that both the MTMR6 CC and PH/G domains are required to co-localize MTMR6 to the plasma membrane with KCa3.1. These findings support a model in which two specific low affinity interactions are required to co-localize MTMR6 with KCa3.1: 1) between the CC domains on MTMR6 and KCa3.1 and (2) between the PH/G domain and a component of the plasma membrane. Our inability to detect significant interaction of the MTMR6 G/PH domain with phosphoinositides suggests that this domain may bind a protein. Identifying the specific binding partners of the CC and PH/G domains on other MTMs will provide important clues to the specific functions regulated by other MTMs as well as the mechanism(s) whereby loss of some MTMs lead to disease."

The Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins is overexpressed in a large number of chemoresistant tumors. Downregulation or inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins might result in the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we took advantage of the peptide aptamer strategy to target Nr-13, a Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein involved in neoplastic transformation by the Rous sarcoma virus. We isolated peptide aptamers that behave as Nr-13 regulators, in vitro and in mammalian cells in culture. Some of these aptamers have potential proapoptotic activities. These data suggest that peptide aptamers targeting the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis inhibitors may be useful for the development of anticancer molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1969236533,"We recently identified a novel family of oxidized choline glycerophospholipid (oxPC) molecular species enriched in atheroma that serve as endogenous ligands for the scavenger receptor CD36 (oxPCCD36), facilitating macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation (Podrez, E. A., Poliakov, E., Shen, Z., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 38517–38523). A high affinity CD36 recognition motif was defined within oxPCCD36, an oxidatively truncated sn-2 acyl group with a terminal γ-hydroxy (or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. The fate of these species once formed in vivo is unknown. Here we show that a subset of oxPCCD36, a phosphatidylcholine molecular species possessing sn-2 esterified fatty acyl hydroxyalkenal groups, can undergo a slow intramolecular cyclization and dehydration reaction to form novel oxPC species possessing a sn-2 acyl group that incorporates a terminal furyl moiety (oxPC-furan). Using high performance liquid chromatography with on-line tandem mass spectrometry in combination with unambiguous organic synthesis, we confirm that oxPC-furans, ultimately derived from phospholipids with sn-2 esterified docosahexaenoic, arachidonic, or linoleic acids, are formed during exposure of model membranes and isolated lipoproteins to physiological oxidant systems. In vivo generation of oxPC-furans at sites of enhanced oxidant stress is also demonstrated, such as within brain tissues following cerebral ischemia. Cell binding studies reveal that in contrast to their oxPCCD36 precursors, oxPC-furans lack CD36 binding activity. Taken together, the present studies identify oxPC-furans as a novel family of oxidized phospholipids that are formed in vivo from phospholipid hydroxyalkenals but that lack CD36 binding activity."

We have used the TOXCAT assay (a reporter assay for transmembrane segment homodimerization) to identify residues within the transmembrane segments of ENaC that may participate in important structural interactions within ENaC, with which we identified a candidate site within αM1. We performed site-directed mutagenesis at this site and found that, although the mutants reduced channel activity, ENaC protein expression at the plasma membrane was unaffected. To deduce the role of αM1 in the pore structure of ENaC, we performed tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis throughout αM1 (residues 110–130). We found that mutations within the amino-terminal part of αM1 had effects on activity and selectivity with a periodicity consistent with a helical structure but no effect on channel surface expression. We also observed that mutations within the carboxyl-terminal part of αM1 had effects on activity and selectivity but with no apparent periodicity. Additionally, these mutants reduced channel surface expression. Our data support a model in which the amino-terminal half of αM1 is α-helical and packs against structural element(s) that contribute to the ENaC pore.

ENaCs are members of the Degenerin/ENaC family of cation-selective channels that have roles in mechanosensation and nociception.The structure of the ENaC pore has been the subject of several studies. The pore has been shown to be composed of the M2 segments along with the residues immediately extracellular to these segments from all three subunits (6Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44091-44098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the tetrameric α2βγ model, the two α subunits are posited to be on opposite sides of the pore (2Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Given that the pore-forming components of all three subunits are highly homologous (see Fig. 1), the pore is thought to have 4-fold pseudosymmetry such that all three subunits fold and contribute similarly to the pore. Previous studies showing that specific M2 residues are solvent-accessible are consistent with helical M2 segments that have one side facing the pore lumen (7Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M.

Studies of M1 domains within members of the Degenerin/ENaC family are limited but suggest that some part of M1 may be solvent-accessible (8Langloh A.L. Berdiev B. Ji H.L. Keyser K.

A proposed model for the structure of the ENaC pore describes the pore as a double funnel, with the narrowest point at the selectivity filter and M2 lining a pore that widens toward the inner leaflet of the membrane (6Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 11Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

In the absence of experimental evidence, M1 has been suggested to be helical and pack against M2 distal to the pore lumen by homology to the role of M1 in K+ channels (12Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).In this study, we have used the TOXCAT assay to identify residues within the ENaC transmembrane domains that may participate in important structural interactions within the channel complex. This assay employs the cytoplasmic domain of ToxR to initiate transcription of a gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance to the host bacterium upon dimerization of this domain driven by a test transmembrane sequence. Using this assay, we identified a candidate site within αM1. We performed site-directed mutagenesis at this site and found that, although the mutants reduced channel activity, ENaC protein expression at the plasma membrane was unaffected. In an effort to deduce the role of αM1 in the pore structure of ENaC, we next performed tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis throughout αM1 (residues 110–130) with the intention of perturbing helix-helix interactions. Where endogenous tryptophans are found, we mutated them to alanine (Fig. 1). We found that mutations within the amino-terminal part of αM1 affected activity and selectivity with a periodicity consistent with this region having a helical structure. Changes in activity were not due to changes in surface expression but rather were caused by changes in the single channel properties of the mutant channels. In addition, we also observed a break in the putative helix structure so that the carboxyl-terminal half of αM1 had different properties than the amino-terminal half. These differences include no clear evidence of helicity and large effects on channel surface expression. Our data support a model in which the amino-terminal half of αM1 is α-helical and packs against structural element(s) that contribute to the ENaC pore. Our data also suggest that the carboxyl-terminal half of αM1 may be either helical or assume a different structure and may interact with structural elements distinct from those interacting with the amino-terminal part of αM1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTOXCAT Constructs—Plasmid pccKAN was obtained from Dr. Donald Engelman (Biochemistry, Yale) and Bluescript plasmids encoding the human α, β, and γ subunits of the epithelial sodium channel from Dr. Anil Menon (Molecular Genetics, University of Cincinnati). pccKAN encodes the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase under the control of the cholera toxin (ctx) promoter (13Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), as well a truncated version of the toxR protein (toxR′) lacking its membrane-spanning domain. pccKAN also includes unique NheI and BamHI sites suitable for creating in-frame chimeric proteins having the general structure toxR′·test transmembrane segment·maltose-binding protein. To create chimeras in which the test transmembrane segment is derived from an epithelial sodium channel, primers were synthesized to amplify the coding sequences for the membrane-spanning segments of the human α, β, and γ subunits while simultaneously adding the required 5′- and 3′-flanking restriction endonuclease sites. Amplification products were gel-purified and cloned into pccKAN to yield the plasmids pKB52, -54, and -56. An analogous set of expression plasmids, selectable on kanamycin instead of ampicillin, was created in the pSU18 background to enable replication and maintenance of two plasmids in the same host. The sequences of all constructs were verified to guard against cloning artifacts.TOXCAT Random Mutagenesis and Screening—The sequence encoding human ENaC αM1 was mutagenized using error-prone PCR. Primers were designed to anneal to regions of pKB52 immediately upstream of the NheI site and downstream of the site for BamHI. Amplifications were done in the presence of 0.5–2 mm MnCl2 and with one pyrimidine nucleotide held at a limiting concentration (typically 10 μm). Following 30 cycles of amplification, PCR products were precipitated, cleaved with NheI and BamHI, and cloned into pccKAN. Ligation reactions were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells and then replica-plated to screen in parallel for growth on ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Typically, about half of the ampicillin-resistant colonies were able to grow on chloramphenicol. Colonies that displayed an ampicillin-resistant/chloramphenicol-sensitive phenotype were selected for sequence analysis of their membrane-spanning domain inserts. ∼10% of the clones analyzed were found to contain single point mutations within this region, whereas the remaining sequences were dominated by frameshifts. >90% of the catR clones sequenced were wild type, but a small proportion contained single point mutations within the regions coding the membrane-spanning domains. Presumably, this latter set of mutants occurs at sites that are not essential for dimerization.Site-directed Mutagenesis and ENaC Expression—All ENaC clones used for functional studies were mouse ENaC subunits whose cDNAs were inserted into pBluescript SK–(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (14Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated using a PCR-based method as previously described (15Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Target mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the University of Pittsburgh DNA-sequencing facility. Capped cRNAs for mutant and wild-type mouse ENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) from linearized DNA templates. Stage V and VI oocytes free of follicle cell layers were injected with 1–4 ng of cRNA for each mouse ENaC subunit/oocyte and incubated at 18 °C for 20–30 h in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4).Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using a DigiData 1320A interface and a GeneClamp 500B voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp, version 8.2, software (Axon Instruments) on a 1.5-GHz Pentium 4 PC (Gateway 2000 Inc., N. Sioux City, SD). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) with a Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and had a resistance of 0.5–5 megohms when filled with 3 m KCl and inserted into the bath solution. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber (Automate Scientific, San Francisco, CA) with 20 μl of bath solution and continuously perfused with bath solution at a flow rate of 4–5 ml/min. The bath solution contained either 110 mm NaCl or LiCl, and 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In experiments using [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada), the compound was dissolved in bath solution <1 min before application to the oocyte. Oocytes were continuously perfused in 1 mm MTSET for 4 min prior to measurements assessing ENaC activity. All experiments were performed at the ambient temperature (20–24 °C).Measurements of ENaC Surface Expression—Experiments were performed essentially as described previously (16Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2 ng/subunit of αβγ or wild-type or mutant α subunits along with FLAG epitope-tagged β and wild-type γ subunits. Oocytes were blocked for 30 min in MBS supplement with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (MBS/BSA) and then incubated for 1 h with MBS/BSA supplement with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Sigma) at 4 °C. Oocytes were then washed at 4 °C for 1 h in MBS/BSA and incubated with MBS/BSA supplemented with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h at 4°C (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′2) fragment goat anti-mouse IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The cells were extensively washed (12 times over 2 h) at 4 °C and transferred to MBS without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of SuperSignal Elisa Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA).Patch Clamp—Vitelline membranes of oocytes were removed manually following incubation of the oocytes at room temperature in MBS supplemented with 200 mm sucrose. Oocytes were then transferred to a recording chamber with bath solution and allowed to recover for 10 min before clamping. The bath and pipette solutions contained 110 mm LiCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Glass pipettes with tip resistances of 5–20 megohms were used. For single channel measurements, single channel currents were recorded in an excised inside-out configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments) connected to a Pentium 4 PC (Gateway). Single channel recordings were acquired using pClamp, version 9.0 (Axon Instruments), at 20 kHz, filtered at 1000 Hz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter built in the amplifier, and stored on the hard disk. Single channel currents were further filtered at 100 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display and analysis. The number of channels × open probability (NPo) measurements were made using recordings of duration ≥5 min using Clampfit, version 9.2, software (Axon Instruments).Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t test. Curve fittings were performed with Clampfit, version 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) and Igor Pro, version 4.0.9.1 (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR).RESULTSTOXCAT Screen of ENaC Transmembrane Segments—To assess the ability of each of the human ENaC membrane-spanning segments to homodimerize within the context of a biological membrane, we employed a TOXCAT assay (13Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this assay, the transmembrane and periplasmic domains of ToxR are replaced by test transmembrane sequences and the maltose-binding protein periplasmic domain, respectively. In such constructs, dimerization driven by putative membrane-spanning sequences subsequent to insertion into the membrane allows the cytoplasmic transcriptional activation domains (toxR′) to interact with the ctx promoter, initiating transcription of a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The resulting chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity can be measured by the resistance of bacterial cells hosting the plasmid to a chloramphenicol concentration gradient.We created constructs suitable for the TOXCAT assay for each of the transmembrane segments (M1 and M2) for human ENaC subunits α, β, and γ. Upon transformation into DH5α cells, only the construct containing αM1 (pKB52) conferred chloramphenicol resistance up to 150 μg/ml. The remaining constructs did not confer chloramphenicol resistance, even at antibiotic concentrations as low as 10 μg/ml. This result indicates that human ENaC αM1 has the unique ability to drive homodimerization of the chimera when inserted into a bacterial inner membrane.To determine which residues within αM1 were essential for the dimerization resulting in chloramphenicol resistance, we performed mutagenesis within αM1 using error-prone PCR and screened the resulting populations of mutants by TOXCAT (Fig. 2). Replica plating of ampicillin-resistant clones onto chloramphenicol enabled us to quickly identify a set of mutants that had been converted to a chloramphenicol-sensitive phenotype. As depicted in Fig. 2, mutations L90Q, L92H, L104H, and L105Q, each of which were obtained in our first mutagenesis experiment, all substantially reduced chloramphenicol resistance. L90Q was unable to grow in 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, whereas the remainder were sensitive at 35–50 μg/ml. In a second experiment, these same mutants were obtained plus an L90R mutant that was chloramphenicol-resistant at 25 μg/ml.FIGURE 2TOXCAT analysis of human ENaCαM1. The wild-type sequence is shown in the top line, and mutations that increase chloramphenicol sensitivity (camS) and those that allow retention of full resistance (camR) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also analyzed 100 randomly selected clones that remained resistant to high chloramphenicol concentrations (125–150 μg/ml). The vast majority of these clones retained the wild-type sequence, but five contained mutations within the αM1 coding region, W91G, F95G, M97T, F100S, and L104P. We suggest that these positions are not important for the ability of αM1 to form dimers within the membrane, except for Leu-104. The mutants that weakened chloramphenicol resistance and therefore weakened the ability of αM1 to dimerize were L90Q, L92H, L104H, and L105Q. Of these, only L90Q was found in >1 clone. As both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant mutants were isolated at Leu-104, we assumed that phenotypic changes were related to the specific nature of the substitution.Effect of Mutation at αLeu-115—αL90Q had the strongest effect on αM1 dimerization, as measured by the TOXCAT assay. We therefore examined the effect of mutations at the corresponding site of mouse ENaC expressed in oocytes (αLeu-115) (Fig. 1). cRNAs encoding either wild-type α subunit, αL115A, or αL115F were co-injected with cRNAs encoding wild-type mouse β and γ subunits into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Twenty-four hours after injection, we measured amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents for the wild-type and mutant channels by two-electrode voltage clamp. We found that both mutations reduced ENaC-mediated Na+ currents so that the relative activities of αL115Aβγ and αL115Fβγ were 0.47 ± 0.06 (n = 21, p < 0.001) and 0.08 ± 0.02 (n = 12, p < 0.001), respectively.To determine whether the reduction in Na+ current observed for each of these mutants was because of a reduction in the number of channels expressed at the cell surface or a change in the single channel properties of these mutants, we examined the surface expression for these two mutants. Surface expression was measured using a FLAG epitope-tagged β subunit (βF) and a chemiluminescence-based assay originally described by Zerangue et al. (16Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) and modified by Carattino et al. (17Carattino M.D. Hill W.G. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36202-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The assay background measured with untagged αβγ-injected oocytes was 0.07 ± 0.02 relative light units/min. The surface expression of αβFγ (1.6 ± 0.2 relative light units/min) was similar to that of the αL115AβFγ (2.1 ± 0.2 relative light units/min, n = 12, p = not significant) and αL115FβFγ (1.6 ± 0.2 relative light units/min, n = 12, p = not significant) mutants.Effect of M1 Tryptophan Mutations on ENaC Activity—The above data suggest that mutations in αM1 that disrupt αM1 dimerization, as measured by TOXCAT, reduce channel activity but do not significantly reduce channel surface expression. We hypothesized that αM1 is an α-helix (as has previously been predicted (18Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 19Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), which presents a face onto which another helix may bind. In the TOXCAT assay, the second helix must be αM1, but in fully assembled ENaC, the second helix may be αM2 or either M1 or M2 from the β or γ subunits. In this context, we note that when β or γ M1 constructs were co-transformed with pKB52 (αM1), there was a small but reproducible reduction in chloramphenicol resistance. To define and probe the interaction surface, we performed scanning tryptophan mutagenesis throughout αM1 (residues 110–130). Where tryptophans naturally occurred (αTrp-112, -116, and -125) we have instead mutated these residues to alanine to maximize the change in volume. Both tryptophan and alanine are well tolerated in α-helices (20Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Because tryptophan has a large bulky hydrophobic side chain, it should be better accommodated at positions that interact with lipid than at those involved in interactions with other residues within the protein. Likewise, the large loss in residue volume resulting from tryptophan → alanine substitution should be better accommodated at positions that interact with lipid than positions that interact with other residues. If αM1 is α-helical, then positions that interact with other residues, or positions that interact with lipid for that matter, should have a periodicity near 3.6.As above, cRNAs encoding wild-type or mutant α subunits of ENaC were mixed with those encoding wild-type β and γ subunits and injected into X. laevis oocytes. After 20–30 h, amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were determined by perfusing expressing oocytes with a buffer containing 110 mm NaCl in the absence and presence of 100 μm amiloride and measuring the resulting currents by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (Fig. 3A). All currents were normalized to the current measured for wild-type ENaC on the same day. The effect of mutation at each position varied from a 70% increase to a 98% decrease in Na+ currents, relative to wild-type ENaC (Fig. 1). For mutations at residues 110–121, there was a marked periodicity in the relative Na+ currents, such that mutations at positions 110, 113, 117, and 120 had similar or larger Na+ currents compared with wild-type ENaC, whereas mutations at 112, 115, and 119 had <10% of the wild-type activity of ENaC. To measure the periodicity, we fit this data to a simple sine function (Equation 1), y=A·sin(2θXν+Φ)+y0(Eq.1) where A is a scaling factor, x is the residue number, ϕ and y0 are horizontal and vertical offsets, respectively, and ν is the periodicity. The best fit value for ν for mutations at residues 110–121 was 3.4 ± 0.1, similar to a predicted periodicity of 3.6 for an α-helix. Omitting tryptophan→alanine mutants αW112A and αW116A (Fig. 3A, filled circles) from the analysis yielded a similar fit with an identical ν value (fit not shown). For mutations at residues 122–130, little periodicity remained evident, although the effect of mutation at residues 124–129 on relative Na+ currents were to moderately lower the activity (25–70%).FIGURE 3Tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis of αM1. Each position was mutated to tryptophan, except positions 112, 116, and 125 with endogenous tryptophans, which were mutated to alanine. A, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current for tryptophan (○) and alanine (•) mutants was measured at –100 mV using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique and normalized to the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current measured for wild-type ENaC on the same day. Each data point represents the mean from 12–25 measurements ± S.E. Data for residues 110–121 were fit to Equation 1 giving a periodicity value of 3.4 ± 0.1. Omitting alanine mutant data from the fitting yielded an identical periodicity value (fit not shown). B, Li+/Na+ selectivity was determined by measuring the amiloride-sensitive Na+ and Li+ currents sequentially at –100 mV using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The Li+/Na+ selectivity of the αL130W mutant could not be determined accurately, given the low levels of current expression. Each data point represents the mean from 6–15 measurements ± S.E. C, correlation plot of Li+/Na+ selectivity versus relative current for Na+ (left) or Li+ (right). Data were fit to a line for residues 110–121 (•, solid line) and 122–129 (○, dashed line).

To determine the selectivity of these mutants for K+ and Li+, we perfused oocytes injected with each mutant with buffers containing 110 mm KCl or 110 LiCl in the absence and presence of 100 μm amiloride and measured the resulting currents by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Although there was no measurable K+ permeation (data not shown), all channels had measurable Li+ currents. However Li+ and Na+ currents for αL130Wβγ were too low to reliably determine a value for Li+:Na+ selectivity. Compared with wild-type ENaC, whose Li+:Na+ selectivity was 1.75 ± 0.07, the Li+:Na+ selectivity of the αM1 mutants varied from 1.1 ± 0.2 to 3.4 ± 0.6.

https://openalex.org/W1973010579,"The E2A proteins are basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation in many cell types. In muscle cells, the E2A proteins form heterodimers with muscle regulatory factors such as MyoD, which then bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of target genes essential for muscle differentiation. We now demonstrate that E2A proteins are primarily localized in the nucleus in both C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, and are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system evidenced by stabilization following treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. During the differentiation from myoblast to myotube, the cellular abundance of E2A proteins is relatively unaltered, despite significant changes (each ∼5-fold) in the relative rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The rate of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated E2A protein degradation depends on the myogenic differentiation state (t½∼2 h in proliferating myoblasts versus t½>10 h in differentiated myotubes), and is also associated with cell cycle in non-muscle cells. Our findings reveal an important role for both translational and post-translational regulatory mechanisms in mediating the complex program of muscle differentiation determined by the E2A proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1975072238,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A adopts a polytopic conformation within the mitochondrial outer membrane, having both the N- and C-terminal segments on the cytosolic aspect of the membrane and a loop region connecting the two transmembrane (TM) segments protruding into the inter membrane space. In this study we demonstrate that the loop exerts major effects on the sensitivity of the enzyme to its inhibitor, malonyl-CoA. Insertion of a 16-residue spacer between the C-terminal part of the loop sequence (i.e. between residues 100 and 101) and TM2 (which is predicted to start at residue 102) increased the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition of the resultant mutant protein by more than 10-fold. By contrast, the same insertion made between TM1 and the loop had no effects on the kinetic properties of the enzyme, indicating that effects on the catalytic C-terminal segment were specifically induced by loop-TM2 interactions. Enhanced sensitivity was also observed in all mutants in which the native TM2-loop pairing was disrupted either by making chimeras in which the loops and TM2 segments of CPT 1A and CPT 1B were exchanged or by deleting successive 9-residue segments from the loop sequence. The data suggest that the sequence spanning the loop-TM2 boundary determines the disposition of this TM in the membrane so as to alter the conformation of the C-terminal segment and thus affect its interaction with malonyl-CoA."

Chem. 1998; 273: 20764-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rho is hexameric with identical subunits and binds to exposed regions of mRNA that are rich in cytidine (see Fig. 1). The affinity of Rho to poly(rC) is ∼10-fold higher than to poly(rU) (4Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and ∼100-fold higher than to poly(rA) (5McSwiggen J.A. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rho contains two distinct classes of binding sites for nucleic acid. The primary site can bind either single-stranded DNA or RNA with similar specificity and affinity, whereas the secondary site binds only RNA. There are six binding sites of each type in the Rho hexamer (6Chen X. Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16301-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is one primary and one secondary site on each subunit. The binding of RNA to the primary site, with its subsequent binding to the secondary site, leads to the activation of Rho as a helicase. Although the binding of DNA to the primary site is insufficient for the activation of Rho, it does reduce the concentration of RNA required for activation (7Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13947-13955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13940-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, Rho couples ATP hydrolysis to its movement in the 5′ → 3′ direction on the mRNA. When the transcriptional complex is reached, Rho causes release of RNA polymerase from the DNA by an unknown mechanism. A number of termination sites require accessory proteins such as NusG for efficient termination (10Nudler E. Gottesman M.E. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Rho protein can be divided into two structural domains, each of which provides one of the nucleotide binding sites. The amino-terminal 130 residues comprise the primary RNA-binding domain (11Modrak D. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas residues 131-419 contain the secondary RNA binding site as well as the site for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of Rho along the RNA. The primary RNA-binding domain consists of a three-helix bundle (residues 1-50) followed by a β-domain that is a member of the OB-fold family (12Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the primary RNA-binding domain (13Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as well as intact hexameric Rho (14Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) complexed with nucleic acid, have provided considerable insight into the interaction of Rho with RNA bound at the primary site. In the case of the isolated RNA-binding domain, the reported structure was obtained using rC9 as the ligand. The reported structures of intact Rho were obtained by using either DNA (AACCAAGAACCCAA) or RNA ([CU]4) as the ligand. Although studies suggest that the optimal length for nucleotide binding to the primary site appears to be 8-10 cytosine residues (7Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13947-13955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structures of Rho-nucleic acid complexes show interactions with only two adjacent cytidines. The first cytidine base fits tightly within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe62 and Tyr80, and it also contacts residues Glu108, Arg109, and Tyr110 in the RNA-binding domain. The second cytidine forms specific hydrogen bonds with Arg66 and Asp78 and stacks on the aromatic side chain of Phe64. In these structures there are no interactions between Rho and the 2′-OH group of the bound RNA, explaining why the primary binding site does not discriminate between RNA and single-stranded DNA. On the basis of these crystal structures, the binding of DNA or RNA does not appear to change the structure of the RNA-binding domain. The crystal structure of intact Rho, complexed with either single-stranded DNA or RNA bound to the primary site, has illuminated a number of features associated with the function of Rho (14Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In these structures the six subunits are related by a pseudo-6-fold screw axis, generating a lock-washer-like topology (see Fig. 1). The primary RNA-binding site is found on the inside surface of the hexamer and oriented in such a manner that the 3′-end of the bound RNA points downward toward the ATPase domain. This model explains how Rho protein can load on a circular nucleic acid template (15Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17106-17110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); after the RNA binds to the primary site, it can associate with the secondary site by sliding through the gap in the lock-washer. This gap then presumably closes, trapping the RNA in the central part of the hexamer as Rho forms the catalytically competent form for helicase activity. The location of the secondary binding site for RNA within the central core of the hexamer is supported by the cross-linking and chemical protection studies reported by Burgess and Richardson (16Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Wei and Richardson (17Wei R.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28380-28387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), respectively. The kinetic pathway for the activation of Rho by poly(rC) has been investigated by stop-flow methods (18Kim D.-E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The initial binding of RNA to the primary site is diffusion-limited, occurring at a rate of 8 × 108 m-1 s-1. The Rho-RNA complex then presumably undergoes ring opening at a rate of 21 s-1, permitting the RNA to enter the center of the hexamer. This intermediate is likely the complex obtained by Skordalakes and Berger (14Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This step is followed by conversion to a third form, with a rate constant of 32 s-1, followed by conversion to the final active form, with a rate constant of 4.1 s-1. Although the crystal structures determined by Berger and colleagues (13Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and studies of the kinetic pathway by Kim and Patel (18Kim D.-E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have resolved a number of questions regarding the function of Rho, there remain a number of unanswered questions. Among these is the nature of the primary RNA-binding site. Crystallographic studies have identified important interactions between Rho and two bound cytidine residues. However, binding data in the literature suggest that more than two cytidine residues are required for the binding of short oligonucleotides. For example, there is an ∼10-fold decrease in the binding affinity of rC8 versus rU3C5, and rU5C3 binds so weakly that it is not possible to measure the binding affinity by gel-shift assays (9Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13940-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that productive interactions only occur between Rho and the cytidine residues, a reduction of the number of cytidine residues will reduce the kinetic on-rate by a factor that is proportional to the number of potential binding sites available in the oligonucleotide. An additional decrease in the association constant (1/KD) will occur if Rho cannot form productive interactions with the nucleotide base, leading to an increase in the off-rate. The 10-fold difference in affinity between rC8 and rU3C5 can be largely accounted for by predicted changes in only the on-rate. In contrast, the low binding of rU5C3 appears to require both a decrease in the on-rate and an increase in the off-rate. This suggests that more than two cytidine residues are involved in binding to the primary nucleic acid binding site of Rho. In this article we have used NMR chemical shift and NMR-derived kinetic binding parameters to probe the binding properties of nucleic acid to the isolated 130 amino-terminal residue of the RNA-binding domain of Rho (rho130). 2The abbreviations used are: rho130, the first 130 amino acids of Rho; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. 2The abbreviations used are: rho130, the first 130 amino acids of Rho; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. In contrast to other studies, we have identified additional residues in rho130 that contact the bound nucleic acid. We further show that alterations of these residues within the intact Rho hexamer have deleterious effects on transcription termination, even in the presence of NusG. rho130 Preparation—Isotopically labeled rho130 was produced as described previously (19Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS) cells containing the expression vector were grown on minimal media with 1 g/liter (15NH4)2SO4 and 4 g/liter [13C]glucose (uniform labeling) or with 50 mg/liter [13C]Phe labeled at the β-carbon (Phe-labeled sample). All stable isotopes were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA). When the cells reached an Aλ = 550 of 0.8, isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. Improved yields were obtained with the addition of guanosine, cytosine, and uridine, each at 50 mg/liter, at the time of induction. After 3-4 h of induction, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 5 °C (20,000 rpm, Beckman Ti70 rotor, 20 min). All subsequent purification steps were performed at room temperature. The lysate was then chromatographed on a CM Sephadex column using a linear gradient of 0.0-0.8 m NaCl in 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Sufficient potassium sulfate was added to the protein-containing fractions to raise the sulfate concentration to 150 mm. The pooled fractions were concentrated with Centricon-10 ultracentrifugation devices (Amicon) and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column. Following extensive dialysis against buffer (2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), the protein was bound to a DEAE-agarose column. The rho130 was eluted with a linear 0.0-0.4 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer used for loading. Purified rho130 was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing either 150 mm potassium sulfate or 100 mm potassium chloride. The samples were then concentrated by ultracentrifugation for NMR experiments. Oligonucleotide Preparation and Purification—DNA oligonucleotides dCn and dACnA were synthesized in-house using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (20Adams S.P. Kavka K.S. Wykes E.J. Holder S.B. Galluppi G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 661-663Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). High-loading CPG and other phosphoramidite reagents were purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Anhydrous acetonitrile was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Because these oligonucleotides are relatively short, the “capping” step was omitted from the synthesis. The dATTTCCA, dACTTCCA, and dATCTCCA nucleotides were purchased as custom syntheses from Synthegen, LLC (Houston). In all cases, the oligonucleotides were purified by binding the crude product to DEAE-agarose followed by elution with a linear 0.01-1.0 m ammonium acetate gradient. Fractions that contained the desired product were lyophilized several times to remove residual ammonium acetate. The desired full-length product was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz using a Bruker DRX spectrometer equipped with a Bruker triple resonance probe with triple axis pulsed-field gradient coils. All NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K as described previously (19Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical shift assignments for rho130 bound to dC6 were determined using methods similar to those used for the unliganded protein (19Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical shift assignments for rho130 when other ligands were bound could generally be obtained by following the change in chemical shifts during titration of nucleotide ligands. In many cases, HNCA spectra (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 201-207Google Scholar) were recorded for rho130 bound to different nucleotide ligands to confirm chemical shift assignments. Nucleotide Titrations—DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring solution absorbance at λ = 260 nm. Extinction coefficients were determined by summing the coefficient for each residue of the oligonucleotide. Prior to DNA titrations, the oligonucleotides were aliquoted and lyophilized. DNA was added to the sample by using the protein solution to dissolve the lyophilized DNA. Protein concentrations were typically 0.25 mm. After each incremental addition of oligonucleotide, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded on the samples. The same glassware was used for a single titration to minimize loss of sample during transfers. For each titration, 10-15 additions of DNA were performed until the binding site was saturated. Binding experiments were typically performed under conditions of low salt (25 mm KCl) to enhance the weak binding of shorter oligonucleotides. Because unliganded rho130 tends to crystallize from solutions of low salt, protein samples were prepared by dilutinga1mm protein solution at high salt with the appropriate buffer to a volume of 280 μl. In this case, the first and subsequent additions of DNA were made as quickly as possible to avoid protein crystallization. In general, rho130 is soluble with a modest amount of ligand present. Kinetic on- and off-rates were determined by fitting the resonance line shapes to the general equation for chemical exchange (22McConnell H.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1958; 28: 430-434Crossref Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 23Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 153-182Google Scholar), G(ω)=(fAωB+fBωA)+i[fA(κB+K1[L])+fB(κA+k2)][ωAωB+k1[L]k2−κAκB]+i[ωAκB+ωBκA](Eq. 1) where k1 is the microscopic kinetic on-rate; k2 is the microscopic kinetic off-rate; fA and fB are the fractions of the nuclear spin in state A (unliganded) and state B (bound), respectively; [L] is the free ligand concentration; ωA=ω−ωA0 and ωB=ω−ωB0 where ωA0 and ωB0 are the resonance frequencies of states A and B, respectively; and kA = k1[L] + 1/T2A, and kB = k2 + 1/T2B where T2A and T2B are the transverse relaxation times for the nuclear spin in states A and B, respectively. In most cases, the resonance line from Phe62 was used for line fitting because this resonance peak is well resolved and the line shape is greatly affected by nucleotide binding. Only the line shape in the proton dimension was used for line shape analysis. To remove any effect of exchange broadening from the nitrogen dimension, all of the one-dimensional proton slices of the HSQC spectrum that contained the signal of interest in the nitrogen dimension were summed together. Preparations of R88E and F89S Rho Proteins—Plasmid pCB111, which contains the E. coli rho gene under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (24Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. Gene. 1992; 118: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was mutated using the Stratagene QuikChange™ mutagenesis technique. The mutated plasmids were recovered as transformants of E. coli DH5αF′, and the presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis. The mutant rho genes were expressed in DH5αF′ using the M13 phage mGP1-2, which contains the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the E. coli lac promoter (25Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Inter-science, New York1991: 16.2.1-16.2.8Google Scholar). The procedures for cultivation, infection and harvesting of the cells were as described by Martinez et al. (26Martinez A. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mutant Rho proteins, isolated by the procedure of Nowatzke et al. (27Nowatzke W. Richardson L. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were greater than 96% pure as judged by polyacrylamide gel analysis. ATPase and RNA Binding Assay Methods for Full Length Rho—Poly(C)-activated ATPase activities of the Rho factors were determined by the colorimetric procedure of Nowatzke et al. (27Nowatzke W. Richardson L. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ATPase activities with λcro RNA were determined as described by Faus and Richardson (29Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with saturating levels of RNA (15 with 4 nm Rho hexamers). The procedure was modified to detect the PI product colorimetrically. RNA binding assays were performed as described by Faus and Richardson (29Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 0.15 m potassium glutamate, 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin/ml, 0.1 nm [32P]cro RNA, and Rho at concentrations that varied from 0.2 to 15 nm (as hexamers). The data were fit to the equation for the binding of Rho as the ligand to RNA using the Grafit program (Erithacus Software) to determine KD,app and retention efficiency (see Ref. 29Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the fraction of the protein that was active in binding, the amount of RNA that could be bound per mole of Rho protein at saturating levels of RNA was determined as described by Witherell and Uhlenbeck (30Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This corrected dissociation binding constant (KD,corr) was determined as the product of the fraction active in binding times KD,app. Transcription termination assays were performed as described in Richardson and Richardson (28Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using λcro gene DNA template made by PCR amplification and purified on an Edge BioSystems QuickStep™ PCR purification column. Nucleic Acid Binding Kinetics—Given that intact Rho and rho130 bind both RNA and single-stranded DNA with equal affinity and specificity, the binding studies with rho130 were carried out using DNA because of its enhanced chemical stability. Our initial studies were directed at observing DNA-induced changes in the structure of rho130, employing dC6 as the ligand. Although HSQC spectra of the amide groups gave spectra of reasonable quality, the spectra obtained for side-chain resonances suggested that considerable chemical exchange was present in the complex. In the absence of bound DNA the HβCβ signals in a carbon-proton-correlated spectrum of [β-13C]Phe-labeled rho130 clearly show resonance peaks from all seven Phe residues in the protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when the complex with dC6 is formed, the spectra show multiple peaks, many of which are broadened by chemical exchange (Fig. 2B). The appearance of the spectrum obtained in the presence of dC6 suggests that the time scale for the interconversion between binding modes is on the slow to intermediate NMR time scale. The exchange rate is ∼100-1000 s-1, based on chemical shift differences between the resonance lines in the bound and free forms of the protein. Exchange broadening in the dC6 complex is due to multiple binding modes, i.e. different chemical shifts are obtained when rho130 binds at the end of the oligonucleotide versus the middle of the oligonucleotide. In principle, exchange broadening could be minimized by simply increasing the length of the oligonucleotide. However, rho130 forms oligomers on longer oligonucleotides (19Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), severely degrading the quality of the NMR spectra. Therefore, multiple binding modes and, consequently, exchange broadening were reduced by the addition of adenosine, a nucleotide that is known to have low affinity to Rho protein, at both ends of the oligonucleotide. In the case of Rho bound to dAC5A, the resultant spectra indicate that a single binding mode is predominant (see Fig. 2D). Presumably the larger purine residue prevents rho130 from binding at the very end of the oligonucleotide. The kinetic on- and off-rates of the binding of dC6 and dACnA, where n = 3, 4, or 5, are presented in Table 1. These data were obtained by fitting the proton resonance line of Phe62 to Equation 1 at different ligand concentrations (see Fig. 3). The on- and off-rates indicate that the binding of dAC5A is essentially equivalent to the binding of dC6; the kinetic on-rates are both near the diffusion limit, and the equilibrium binding constants for these two ligands are similar. A diffusion-limited on-rate was also observed for the binding of poly(rC) to intact Rho (18Kim D.-E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of nucleic acid to both forms of Rho follow a similar mechanism. The measured off-rate of 2600 s-1 suggests that unbinding followed by rebinding, in a different configuration, is responsible for the appearance of the spectra obtained in the presence of dC6.TABLE 1Kinetic on- and off-ratesLigandkon (×10−7)koff (×10−3)KDM−1 S−1S−1μMdAC3A0.8 ± 0.54.7 ± 1.4550dAC4A1.8 ± 0.52.2 ± 1.0120dAC5A6.2 ± 2.52.8 ± 1.245(dC)69.8 ± 0.32.6 ± 2.016 Open table in a new tab The measured binding constants show that reducing the number of C residues results in a systematic decrease in the kinetic on-rate and, at least for dAC3A, a significant increase in the off-rate. The combination of these two factors leads to a 12-fold increase in the dissociation constant (KD) when dAC3A is compared with dAC5A. It is possible that this decrease in binding affinity is simply due to a decrease in the length of the oligonucleotides. However, experiments that measured the binding of oligonucleotides of constant length show a large decrease in binding affinity between U3C5 and U5C3 (7Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13947-13955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the primary RNA binding site of Rho interacts with more than the two cytidines identified in crystallographic studies. To define which cytidine position within dAC5A interacts with rho130, we obtained proton-nitrogen-correlated HSQC spectra in the presence of dATTTCCA, dATCTCCA, and dACTTCCA (see Fig. 4A). In these oligonucleotides, the 3′ pair of cytidines was designed to interact with the dicytidine binding site identified in the crystallographic studies. The spectra obtained with dATTTCCA and dATCTCCA are essentially identical (not shown), indicating that rho130 does not distinguish between a T or a C at the second position within the C5 stretch. In marked contrast, the HSQC spectrum obtained with dACTTCCA showed chemical shift changes (relative to dATTTCCA) for a number of residues, suggesting that rho130 interacts selectively with the first cytidine within the C5 stretch of AC5A. These residues included Val81, Ser82, Ser84, Gln85, Ile86, Arg87, Phe89, Lys100, Leu114, Lys115, and Asn117 (see Fig. 4A). Arg88, although located between Arg87 and Phe89 in the primary sequence, showed a similar chemical shift change in the presence of either dACTTCCA or dATTTCCA. On the basis of the preceding observation, one would predict that spectral changes due to the binding of dAC5A should be similar to the changes that occur when dACTTCCA binds. This is indeed the case for 9 of the 11 residues that show different chemical shifts in the dACTTCCA complex versus the dATTTCCA complex. The chemical shift changes of these residues that result from the binding of dACTTCCA and dAC5A are similar in direction and magnitude for both the amide proton and nitrogen atoms (see Fig. 4B). These residues map to a single region of rho130, as shown in Fig. 5. Effect of rho Mutations on Termination—The location of residues with altered amide chemical shifts in the dACTTCCA complex suggests a region of rho130 that could potentially interact with the additional 5′-cytidine (see Fig. 5). Two residues within this region, Arg88 and Phe89, were selected for mutagenesis studies because their side chains project into the putative RNA-binding region, and residues of these types are often involved in protein-nucleic acid interactions. Arg88 and Phe89 were converted to glutamic acid and serine, respectively. Although both mutants were readily expressed in soluble form, the fraction of each that was active in binding RNA (0.2) was significantly lower than that for the wild-type Rho (0.68, Table 2), suggesting that these mutants were not as stable as the wild-type protein. When corrected for these differences, the KD values of F89S and R88E Rhos for binding to λcro RNA were increased 4- and 10-fold, respectively.TABLE 2ATPase and RNA-binding properties of Rho factors with R88E and F89S mutationsRhoATPase activity with poly(rC)ATPase with λcro RNAKD,appaThe values from the fit of the binding data to the equation for binding of a single Rho molecule to λcro RNA with the concentration of Rho determined from the total weight of the protein.Fraction activebThe values of the fraction of the Rho proteins that were active in binding to λcro RNA.KD,corrcThe corrected KD values were determined by multiplying the KD,app values by the fraction active in binding.nmol μg−1 min−1nmol μg−1 min−1nMnMWild-type108270.5 ± 0.150.680.34 ± 0.1R88E16119.0 ± 10.00.203.8 ± 2.0F89S1826.2 ± 1.50.201.2 ± 0.3a The values from the fit of the binding data to the equation for binding of a single Rho molecule to λcro RNA with the concentration of Rho determined from the total weight of the protein.b The values of the fraction of the Rho proteins that were active in binding to λcro RNA.c The corrected KD values were determined by multiplying the KD,app values by the fraction active in binding. Open table in a new tab The effects of these mutations on the termination of λcro RNA is shown in Fig. 6. Even in great excess, R88E Rho was inactive in termination and had only slight activity when the NusG termination enhancer protein was added. F89S Rho, however, was only partially defective in termination function, as expected from its partial loss of RNA binding affinity and intermediate level of ATPase with λcro RNA (Table 2). On the basis of binding affinities and chemical shift changes, we have identified another region of the primary RNA binding site in Rho that interacts with a cytidine residue. This additional binding site is 5′ from the previously identified site that binds two adjacent cytidine residues. This additional interaction was not observed in crystallographic studies of the complex between the RNA-binding domain and rC9 described by Bogden et al. (13Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, because the contribution of the 5′-cytidine to the overall binding affinity is small as suggested by the small change in off-rates, this binding site may not have sufficiently high occupancy to be observed in the crystal structure. In intact Rho protein, the binding pocket for the 5′-cytidine residue is located close to the contact point between adjacent RNA-binding domains as described in the structure by Skordalakes and Berger (14Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5). Consequently, it would be difficult for nucleic acid to occupy this site in the observed structure of Rho. Nevertheless, alteration of the residues within the newly identified 5′-cytidine binding pocket (Arg88, Phe89) has a great effect on the ability of Rho to terminate transcription. This effect could be due to the reduced binding of the RNA to the protein. However, the decreased binding does not appear to be sufficient to explain the deficiency in transcriptional termination of λcro transcripts at high concentrations of Rho protein (Fig. 6). Accordingly, interactions between the bound RNA and the new 5′-cytidine binding site in rho130 may represent an essential, but transient, interaction that is important for subsequent conformational changes in Rho, such as ring closure, that lead to the activation of Rho helicase activity.
