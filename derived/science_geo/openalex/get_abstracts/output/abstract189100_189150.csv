https://openalex.org/W2128552517,"A hybrid blocked and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study decomposed brain activity during task switching into sustained and transient components. Contrasting task-switching blocks against single-task blocks revealed sustained activation in right anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC). Contrasting task-switch trials against task-repeat and single-task trials revealed activation in left lateral PFC and left superior parietal cortex. In both sets of regions, activation dynamics were strongly modulated by trial-by-trial fluctuations in response speed. In addition, right anterior PFC activity selectively covaried with the magnitude of mixing cost (i.e., task-repeat versus single-task trial performance), and left superior parietal activity selectively covaried with the magnitude of the switching cost (i.e., task-switch versus task-repeat trial performance). These results indicate a functional double dissociation in brain regions supporting different components of cognitive control during task switching and suggest that both sustained and transient control processes mediate the behavioral performance costs of task switching."

Docosahexaenoic acid released from membrane phospholipids during brain ischemia is a major source of lipid peroxides. Leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory gene expression also contribute to stroke damage. In this study using lipidomic analysis, we have identified stereospecific messengers from docosahexaenoate-oxygenation pathways in a mouse stroke model. Aspirin, widely used to prevent cerebrovascular disease, activates an additional pathway, which includes the 17R-resolvins. The newly discovered brain messenger 10,17S-docosatriene potently inhibited leukocyte infiltration, NFκB, and cyclooxygenase-2 induction in experimental stroke and elicited neuroprotection. In addition, in neural cells in culture, this lipid messenger also inhibited both interleukin 1-β-induced NFκB activation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Thus, the specific novel bioactive docosanoids generated in vivo counteract leukocyte-mediated injury as well as pro-inflammatory gene induction. These results challenge the view that docosahexaenoate only participates in brain damage and demonstrate that this fatty acid is also the endogenous precursor to a neuroprotective signaling response to ischemia-reperfusion.

These fatty acids are released from membrane phospholipids where they are esterified (3Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Both fatty acids are derived from dietary essential fatty acids; however, only DHA is concentrated in the central nervous system (12Bazan N.G. Wurtman R.J. Wurtman J.J. Nutrition and the Brain. Vol. 8. Raven Press, Ltd., New, York1990: 1-24Google Scholar). It is clear that synaptic membrane and retinal photoreceptor biogenesis is dependent on liver processing of the dietary DHA or of its precursor, linolenic acid, followed by blood lipoprotein transport (13Scott B.L.

Neurochem. 2002; 83: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether DHA itself or a DHA-derived messenger is involved in these events is not known. Moreover, to date, potent bioactive autacoids from DHA acting in nanomolar concentrations have not been identified in the central nervous system. Although certain docosanoids have been identified in the retina (21Bazan N.G. Birkle D.L. Reddy T.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to be neuroprotective (12Bazan N.G. Wurtman R.J. Wurtman J.J. Nutrition and the Brain. Vol. 8. Raven Press, Ltd., New, York1990: 1-24Google Scholar), their physiologic properties have not been explored.To test the ability of the mouse brain to synthesize bioactive docosanoids, we used tandem LC-PDA-ESI-MS-MS-based lipidomic analysis in combination with ischemia-reperfusion. The rationale for use of this design was based upon the fact that brain ischemia releases unesterified DHA (3Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida S. Harik S. Busto R. Santiso M. Martinez E. Ginsberg M.D. J.

Brain Res. 1975; 100: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that during early stages of ischemia-reperfusion, endogenous signals of repair/neuroprotection may be generated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human recombinant IL-1β (14019) was from Sigma, and 10,17-diHDHA was prepared as described previously (22Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 23Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Normal human neural (HN) progenitor cells (CC-2599), neural progenitor maintenance medium, human epidermal and human fibroblast growth factors, gentamicin/amphotericin B (G/A1000), and neural survival factor-1 were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). AP1, HIF-1α, NFκBp50/p65, and STAT-1α gel-shift consensus and mutant oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center core facility or were purchased from Promega Life Science (Madison, WI).Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCA-O) and Reperfusion—Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines for experimental animal use. Mice (20–25 g body weight) were induced with 2% isoflurane in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. Anesthesia was maintained with 1% isoflurane. Temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C (Harvard homeothermic blanket). P-10 polyethylene catheters were placed in the femoral artery and vein, and blood pressure was monitored. Arterial blood was analyzed for PO2, PCO2, and pH after 1 h of ischemia and 30 min after the onset of reperfusion. The common carotid and external carotid arteries were temporarily ligated with a retracting suture, and the external carotid artery was dissected just proximal to its bifurcation. The occluding filament was introduced from the external carotid artery and advanced to the internal carotid artery. The arterial venous microclip was removed, and the filament was advanced so that the blunted tip lay in the anterior cerebral artery and the side of the filament occluded the origin of the MCA. The stump of the external carotid artery was ligated, and tension on the retracting suture to the common carotid artery was gently released, restoring blood flow to the carotid system. The animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia, and 15 min before the start of reperfusion, a neurologic performance test was conducted (24Bederson J.B. Pitts L.H. Tsuji M. Nishimura M.C. Davis R.L. Bartkowski H. Stroke. 1986; 17: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). This neurologic assessment allowed definition of the degree of damage. A rating of Class III or Class IV indicated very severe damage; Class I indicated very mild damage. Thus, to enhance consistency in the group of selected animals, only mice rated as having Class II neurologic performance were included in the study. The variables minimized by this screening are anatomic variants of brain arteries and surgical procedure. About 85% of the mice had Class II neurologic performance. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was maintained for 1 h; reperfusion was then established by delicate retrieval of the occluding suture from the arterial lumen, restoring blood flow to the region of the MCA. The animals were killed by decapitation, and the hippocampi and brain cortices were rapidly dissected and frozen. Samples were kept at -80 °C until analysis. In some experiments, aspirin (7.5 mg/kg) was administered by gavage 15 min before MCA-O.Assessment of Stroke Volume—Forty-eight hours after MCA-O, the mice were killed, and their brains were dissected and immersed in ice-cold saline. The brains were embedded in agar blocks and sectioned into coronal slices 1 mm thick by a vibratome (Vibratome Co., St. Louis, MO). The sections were incubated at room temperature in a 3% buffered solution of 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Once the color had developed (10–15 min), sections were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and kept at 4 °C until images were recorded by a camera (Cool-snap, Nikon) mounted to a dissecting microscope. Digital images were analyzed, and total and stroke areas were calculated and analyzed by Adobe Photoshop software. Serial sections were made for all animals.Human Neural (HN) Progenitor Cells in Primary Culture—HN cells were grown to ∼70% confluence (∼50,000 cells per 3.5-cm diameter well) in 6-well culture plates (Costar) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2, 75% N2 in humidified air at 1 atmosphere (normoxic conditions) in neural progenitor maintenance medium (Clonetics CC-4241) supplemented with human fibroblast growth factor, neural survival factor-1, human epidermal growth factor, and GA-1000 as described by the manufacturer (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). HN cells tested negative for HIV-1, hepatitis B and C, mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast, and fungi and positive for the glial and neuronal markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, mitogen-activated protein 2, and β-tubulin III (Clonetics). After 2 weeks of development, HN cells were exposed to human recombinant IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 3 h in the presence or absence of 0.03, 0.3, 3.0, 30, and 300 nm 10,17S-docosatriene, DHA, or PBS, pH 7.4 (control). RNA and protein were rapidly isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at -81 °C within minutes of isolation.COX-2 RNA Abundance in Hippocampus and HN Cells—Abundance of human-specific COX-1 and COX-2 RNA message was assayed using reverse transcriptase PCR (25Bazan N.G. Lukiw W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30359-30367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay of Human AP1, HIF-1α, NFκBp50/p65, and STAT-1α—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from one to three 3.5-cm diameter wells of HN cells and quantitated. Nuclear protein extracts (5 μg) derived from HN cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol)-end-labeled AP1, HIF-1α, NFκBp50/p65, or STAT-1α consensus and mutant oligonucleotides in 5-μl volumes, reacted for 30 min on ice, analyzed on 5 or 10% acrylamide, 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA gels, dried onto 2-mm Whatman filter paper at 80 °C for 2 h, and phosphorimaged using a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences).Polymorphonuclear (PMN) Leukocyte Infiltration Measurement by the Myeloperoxidase Assay—Inhibition of leukocyte infiltration by 10,17S-docosatriene or by DHA was measured in mouse hippocampi and neocortices after 1 h of MCA-O and 48 h of reperfusion. Lipids were delivered in the indicated quantities for each experiment by perfusion (250 nl/h) through Alzet mini-pumps implanted into the third ventricle. Hippocampi and neocortices from the ipsilateral (MCA-O-reperfusion) and contralateral sides were rapidly dissected. The brain samples were assayed for myeloperoxidase activity (26Huang J. Choudhri T.F. Winfree C.J. McTaggart R.A. Kiss S. Mocco J. Kim L.J. Protopsaltis T.S. Zhang Y. Pinsky D.J. Connolly Jr., E.S. Stroke. 2000; 31: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, the brain tissues were homogenized in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then frozen and thawed with liquid N2 followed by sonication. Samples were precipitated at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and then aliquots of supernatants were added to a 10-mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and a substrate solution containing O-dianisidine (Sigma) and 0.025% hydrogen peroxide and finally incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Spectrophotometric detection was obtained at 460 nm.Immunohistochemistry of Myeloperoxidase to Assess Leukocyte Infiltration—After MCA-O, mice were infused by Alzet mini-pumps with vehicle or 10,17S-docosatriene. After 48 h, the mice were anesthetized and killed by intracardial perfusion of ice-cold saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. The brain tissues were allowed to equilibrate overnight in 4% buffered formalin followed by 30% sucrose in 0.1 m PBS. Frozen sections were made at a thickness of 10 μm and mounted on glass slides. The sections were permeabilized with 0.6% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed in PBS, and blocked in 2% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Incubation with myeloperoxidase/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Dako A/S) was performed at 1:200 dilution for 2 h. The sections were washed in Tween 20 in PBS and then mounted in Vectashield (Vector, CA). Images were recorded by deconvolution microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO).LC-MS-MS Analysis of Docosanoids—Quantitative analysis of docosanoids by LC-MS-MS was performed in hippocampi from mice (C57/BL-6, 20–25 g body weight) killed by head-focused microwave radiation at different time points after the onset of reperfusion. The hippocampi were rapidly dissected (20–70 mg wet tissue weight), homogenized in cold methanol, and kept under nitrogen at -80 °C until purification. Purification was performed by solid-phase extraction technique (27Gronert K. Clish C.B. Romano M. Serhan C.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 120: 119-144PubMed Google Scholar). In short, samples pre-equilibrated at pH 3.0 were loaded onto C18 columns (Varian) and eluted with 10 ml of 1% methanol in ethyl acetate (EM Science). Samples were concentrated by a nitrogen stream evaporator before LC-MS analysis. Samples were loaded into a Surveyor MS pump (Thermo-Finnegan) equipped with a C18 discovery column (Supelco), 10 cm × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 5 μm internal phase. Samples were eluted in a linear gradient (100% solution A (60:40:0.01 methanol/water/acetic acid) to 100% solution B (99.99:0.01 methanol/acetic acid)) and run at a flow rate of 300 μl/min for 45 min. LC effluents were diverted to an electrospray ionization probe (ESI) on a TSQ Quantum (Thermo-Finnegan) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer running on negative ion detection mode. Docosanoid standards were used for calibration and optimization. The instrument was run on full-scan mode to detect parent ions and selected reaction monitoring for quantitative analysis to detect daughter ions simultaneously. The selected parent ions were 327 for DHA and 359 for 10,17S-docosatriene. Moreover, daughter ions were 325.1 and 297, respectively.RESULTSBrain Ischemia-Reperfusion Triggers the Synthesis of Docosahexaenoic Acid-Oxygenation Pathways—We used 1 h of right middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice followed by reperfusion to assess the formation of docosahexaenoic acid-oxygenation derivatives. Under these conditions there is active release of free docosahexaenoic acid from brain membrane phospholipids (2Bazan N.G. Allan G. Ginsberg M.D. Bogousslavsky J. Cerebrovascular Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1998: 532-555Google Scholar, 3Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurochem. 1984; 42: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This model of transient focal ischemia greatly affects the hippocampus, a brain region rich in neurons vulnerable in ischemic stroke and in other neurologic diseases (1Beal M.F. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 6: 661-666Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 2Bazan N.G. Allan G. Ginsberg M.D. Bogousslavsky J. Cerebrovascular Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1998: 532-555Google Scholar).Fig. 1A shows the time course of formation of novel docosanoids in the ipsilateral hippocampus during ischemia-reperfusion. There was generation of 17-hydroperoxy-DHA, the 15-lipoxygenase-like action on DHA (22Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), and a novel 10,17S-docosatriene accumulated up to 8 h of reperfusion. The MS-MS spectrum of 10,17S-docosatriene (Fig. 1, B and C) corresponded to a dihydroxy-containing DHA with prominent fragment ions at m/z 359 (Fig. 1C, [M-H]). There were also fragment ions at m/z 323 ([M-H]-2H2O), 315 ([M-H]-CO2), 297 ([M-H]-H2O-CO2), and 277 ([M-H]-2H2O-CO2-2H). Other diagnostic ions were essentially identical to those recently documented (22Hong S. Gronert K. Devchand P.R. Moussignac R.L. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14677-14687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) in murine brain, human blood, and glial cells. In addition, there was a time-dependent formation of the carbon 22-ω hydroxylation product, 4,17di-HDHA (Fig. 1A) as determined by analysis (at m/z 375) of the MS-MS spectrum (Fig. 1D).Because aspirin is often used prophylactically as well as therapeutically to manage cerebrovascular diseases, we next asked whether brain biosynthesis of DHA messengers is modified in the presence of aspirin in vivo. Moreover, in non-neural tissues, aspirin triggers the biosynthesis of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators (23Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 28Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). We examined the formation of DHA-derived docosanoids in the presence of aspirin during reperfusion after an ischemic stroke (Fig. 1). Fig. 1E shows the time course of docosanoid formation with aspirin treatment. There was a shift away from the products generated from endogenous sources of DHA in the absence of aspirin (Fig. 1A) toward products that include the novel 17R-series resolvins, in particular 7,17R-diHDHA and 7,8,17R-triHDHA, which were formed and were present at the earliest time intervals. There was a marked accumulation in 17R-HDHA, shown recently to be a product of aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2 (28Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar).Fig. 1, F and G, shows a representative LC-MS-MS of the ipsilateral hippocampus following treatment with aspirin and depicts the chromatographic profile of products identified via MS-MS and lipidomic analyses. Here we also confirmed the release of DHA under these conditions (3Bazan N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida S. Harik S. Busto R. Santiso M. Martinez E. Ginsberg M.D. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Aveldano M.I. Bazan N.G. Brain Res. 1975; 100: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1H). To assess that the aspirin dose administered by gavage did reach the brain, the time courses for prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, and lipoxin A4 production were determined in the hippocampi in parallel assays (Fig. 2, PGE 2, LTB 4, and LXA 4). The rapid accumulation of prostaglandin E2 within 8 h of reperfusion was inhibited by aspirin treatment. Maximal leukotriene B4 was generated in aspirin-treated hippocampi by 8 h, as was the case with lipoxin A4, which also peaked within 8 h. Together these results clearly indicate that the dose of aspirin used in vivo did access the central nervous system.Fig. 2Time course of prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, and lipoxin A4 formation in mouse hippocampus after 1 h of MCA-O followed by reperfusion with or without aspirin treatment. Detection was performed by sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in tandem, for prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2), leukotriene B4 (LTB 4), and lipoxins (LXA 4) (Neogen, Lexington, KY). This study showed inhibitory changes in the eicosanoids when animals were pretreated with aspirin (15 min) before MCA-O. C57BL/6 mice were treated by gavages with vehicle (sterile saline) or aspirin (7.52 mg/kg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 depicts the proposed pathway to generate the novel 10,17S-diHDHA ω-oxidation product measured in the absence of aspirin. In our experiments, 4,17S-diHDHA did show bioactivity in PMN infiltration, but these were less than those evoked by equimolar concentrations of 10,17S-docosatriene in a non-neural experimental model (Fig. 4). Fig. 4, therefore, confirms that 4,17S-diHDHA inhibits PMN leukocyte exudate formation in murine peritonitis models (28Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). This ω-oxidation product is the likely inactivation product for 10,17S-diHDHA. Fig. 3 also depicts the resolvin or 17R series pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2092173254,"We used a 2 x 2 factorial design to dissociate regions responding to taste intensity and taste affective valence. Two intensities each of a pleasant and unpleasant taste were presented to subjects during event-related fMRI scanning. The cerebellum, pons, middle insula, and amygdala responded to intensity irrespective of valence. In contrast, valence-specific responses were observed in anterior insula/operculum extending into the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The right caudolateral OFC responded preferentially to pleasant compared to unpleasant taste, irrespective of intensity, and the left dorsal anterior insula/operculuar region responded preferentially to unpleasant compared to pleasant tastes equated for intensity. Responses best characterized as an interaction between intensity and pleasantness were also observed in several limbic regions. These findings demonstrate a functional segregation within the human gustatory system. They also show that amygdala activity may be driven by stimulus intensity irrespective of valence, casting doubt upon the notion that the amygdala responds preferentially to negative stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2146732533,"There is a consensus that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) detect coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity during induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), but their role in timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) is unclear. We examine tLTD in neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal pairs and find that tLTD is expressed presynaptically, implying retrograde signaling. CB1 agonists produce depression that mimics and occludes tLTD. This agonist-induced LTD requires presynaptic activity and NMDAR activation, but not postsynaptic Ca(2+) influx. Further experiments demonstrate the existence of presynaptic NMDARs that underlie the presynaptic activity dependence. Finally, manipulating cannabinoid breakdown alters the temporal window for tLTD. In conclusion, tLTD requires simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA and CB1 receptors. This novel form of coincidence detection may explain the temporal window of tLTD and may also impart synapse specificity to cannabinoid retrograde signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2043321552,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS; MIM 203300) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, prolonged bleeding and pulmonary fibrosis due to abnormal vesicle trafficking to lysosomes and related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. In mice, at least 16 loci are associated with HPS, including sandy (sdy; ref. 7). Here we show that the sdy mutant mouse expresses no dysbindin protein owing to a deletion in the gene Dtnbp1 (encoding dysbindin) and that mutation of the human ortholog DTNBP1 causes a novel form of HPS called HPS-7. Dysbindin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to alpha- and beta-dystrobrevins, components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. We also show that dysbindin is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1; refs. 9-11), which regulates trafficking to lysosome-related organelles and includes the proteins pallidin, muted and cappuccino, which are associated with HPS in mice. These findings show that BLOC-1 is important in producing the HPS phenotype in humans, indicate that dysbindin has a role in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and identify unexpected interactions between components of DPC and BLOC-1."

The element of the LB fibril remained unknown until genetic studies in early onset autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) led to the identification of two mutations in the α-synuclein gene (2Polymeropoulos M.H.

This finding was followed by the identification of α-synuclein as the major component of the LB fibrils in sporadic PD and dementia with LB (DLB) (4Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M-Y.

Formation of α-synuclein fibrils has been studied extensively in in vitro systems using recombinant protein. However, the mechanism by which α-synuclein, a natively unfolded protein, accumulates in neurons to form insoluble fibrils with amyloid characteristics is largely unknown. It is feasible that in vivo post-translational modifications interfere with the function and/or degradation of α-synuclein or alter its biophysical properties in a way to facilitate aggregation. Alternatively, protein modifications may occur in an attempt to prevent aberrant interactions and/or inhibit further aggregation. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the extent to which disease-associated α-synuclein is modified may provide insights into cellular pathways that are activated during fibril formation. In this study, we used differential centrifugation and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to characterize LB-associated α-synuclein. This approach allows the separation of proteins on the basis of their solubility, charge, and molecular mass. By using this method, we show that in sporadic LB disorders, a disease-associated 22–24-kDa α-synuclein species is a substrate for mono-, di-, and trirather than poly-ubiquitination. This 22–24-kDa species gives a characteristic pattern on 2-DE, which is consistent with a highly modified form of the protein, and we identify phosphorylation as one of the modifications. Furthermore, we show that accumulation of ubiquitinated α-synuclein is not invariably associated with significant impairment of proteasome function. These data may help to unravel the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in LB formation. Human Brain Tissue—Brain tissue was obtained from the Neuropathology Department of the University of Indiana School of Medicine. The diagnoses of PD (n = 3, age of death = 70 ± 8 years, duration of disease = 6.3 ± 3 years), DLB (n = 3, age of death = 75 ± 1 years, duration of disease = 7.7 ± 2 years), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 3, age of death = 81 ± 5 years, duration of disease = 12 ± 2 years) was established by standard neuropathological criteria. Immunohistochemistry using anti-α-synuclein and anti-ubiquitin antibodies was performed as described previously (5Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). Four cases with no neurological disease were used as age-matched controls (age of death = 65.8 ± 9 years). Four brain regions were examined from each case: substantia nigra (SN), frontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices. Fractionation of Human Brain Tissue—Subcellular fractionation of human brain was performed based on a modification of a previously published protocol (6Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C.

Approximately 0.5 g of tissue was homogenized on ice in 10 volumes of TBS+ (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, plus complete proteasome inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After 5 min of centrifugation at 1,000 × g, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant represented the TBS+ soluble fraction. All subsequent centrifugation steps were performed at 120,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was rinsed twice with TBS+ and extracted sequentially with 500 μl of TBS+ containing 1% Triton X-100 and TBS+, 1 M sucrose to remove myelin. The pellet was then extracted with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). The extensively washed detergent-insoluble pellet was solubilized either in 8 m urea/5% SDS (and termed the urea-soluble fraction) or buffer A+ (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% amidosulfobetaine-14) for 2-DE. The 1,000 × g pellet from the first step was subsequently extracted in the same way. Immunoblotting—20–30 μg of extract from each fraction was loaded per lane and separated on 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were then incubated with either 3% BSA or 4% milk in TBS to block nonspecific binding. After washing, the membranes were incubated overnight with appropriate primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies Syn-1 (1:600; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), LB509 (1:5000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), polyclonal antisera directed against ubiquitin (1: 800; Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK), carboxy terminus of α-synuclein (PER4; 1:1000), and phosphoserine 129 of α-synuclein (PS129, 1:1000; kind gift of Dr. T. Iwatsubo) were used. Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera (1:2000; Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Deglycosylation Assay—Urea-soluble fractions from human cases with LB disease were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 to remove urea. 30 μl of dialysates were subjected to a deglycosylation assay using N-glycosidase, sialidase A, and endo-O-glycosidase following the manufacturer's instructions (ProZyme, San Leandro, CA). Bovine fetuin (ProZyme) was used as positive control. Deglycosylation in dialysate samples was monitored using 5 μg/ml of biotinylated concanavalin A (a lectin which recognizes glycosylated proteins), which was visualized with avidin-biotin peroxidase and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). 2-DE—For 2-DE, RIPA-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer A+. 30–40 μl were then reconstituted into a final volume of 250 μl with rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% amidosulfobetaine-14, 13 mm dithiothreitol, 1% isopropylideneguanosine; Amersham Biosciences) and loaded onto 13-cm pH 3–10 isopropylideneguanosine strips (Amersham Biosciences) by rehydration loading for 200 V-h over a 10-h time period using an IPGphor™ isoelectric focusing unit (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing on the IPG-phor™ was subsequently performed at 500 V-h for 1 h, 1000 V-h for 1 h, and 40,000 V-h for 5 h. After focusing, strips were equilibrated in SDS buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 30% glycerol, 8 m urea, 1% SDS) for 15 min, loaded onto 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels using a Hoeffer S.E. 600 system and run for 15 min at 20 mA per gel, then for 2.25 h at 40 mA per gel. Gels were then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and processed as for one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteasome Assays in Human Brain—Four brain regions were examined: SN, frontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices. The samples were carefully dissected on dry ice with a dry-ice-cooled blade. From each of the four brain regions examined, three different samples were taken for each patient; they were weighed and homogenized in three volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The crude extract was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 50 μg of each sample was assayed for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome as described previously (8Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) using 20 μm of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amc (Affiniti) as substrate. The enzymatic activities were determined from the linear reaction rates and expressed as fluorescence units/30 min per mg of protein. Immunohistochemistry—PD and DLB cases with mild to moderate cell loss were selected to avoid artifacts related to extensive cell death. Immunohistochemistry with anti-α-synuclein antibodies showed several LB, pale bodies, and Lewy neurites in both DLB and PD (Fig. 1, A and B). In serial sections, anti-ubiquitin antibodies stained only some of the α-synuclein-positive inclusions (Fig. 1C). Fractionation of α-Synuclein from Human Brain—To investigate the extent to which LB-associated α-synuclein is posttranslationally modified, we used a method that is a modification of a previously reported protocol (6Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C. Maher F. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. Am. J.

Li Q.-X. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and that allows the separation of all forms of aggregated α-synuclein from soluble fractions. This method is based upon differential fractionation under conditions that do not solubilize the aggregates but simply separate them from the bulk of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. The main purpose of this approach was to identify conditions which maximize the recovery of all LB-associated forms of α-synuclein (both filamentous and non-filamentous). The different fractions were analyzed by conventional immunoblotting. Similar α-synuclein reactivity was detected in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions from SN and frontal and cingulate cortex of extracts from PD, DLB, and control brains, as shown in Fig. 2A. In these fractions, α-synuclein was detected by using Syn-1 antibody as a single band of 19 kDa in accordance with the apparent molecular mass of full-length protein in both disease cases and controls (5Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 9Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). No higher molecular mass α-synuclein bands were detected. In contrast to control brains, in which urea-soluble extracts were virtually devoid of α-synuclein, strong immunoreactivity was found in urea-soluble extracts from PD and DLB (Fig. 2B). Oligomeric and higher molecular mass aggregates were the predominant species in this fraction. At lower molecular mass, when compared with recombinant protein, three distinct bands were detected with Syn-1 antibody, which recognizes the first 120 residues of the protein. One corresponded to monomeric α-synuclein (19 kDa), a novel 22–24-kDa band, as well as truncated α-synuclein (15 kDa). These bands were examined using a panel of antibodies raised against distinct epitopes (Fig. 2, C and D). The 19-kDa and 22–24-kDa bands but not the 15-kDa truncated protein were detected with LB509 antibody and PER4 antiserum, both directed against the carboxy terminus of the protein (5Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 10Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Lee V.M-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Goedert M. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the 15-kDa band is a carboxyl-terminal truncated protein, whereas the 19 kDa and 22–24 kDa are composed of full-length protein. Because a glycosylated form of α-synuclein with a molecular mass of 22–24 kDa was identified in cases of juvenile-onset Parkinsonism with mutations in the parkin gene (11Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the 22–24-kDa α-synuclein is glycosylated by treating our extracts from sporadic LB disease with the same deglycosylating enzymes as those used by Shimura et al. (11Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). We found that these enzymes, at the conditions used by Shimura et al., did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of the 22–24-kDa α-synuclein band to the 19-kDa position, as detected with LB509 (Fig. 3A). In parallel control experiments, a significant reduction of glycosylated proteins was detected with concanavalin A (Fig. 3B). Deglycosylation of bovine fetuin used as positive control was detected by Coomassie Blue stain as a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein from 75 to 50 kDa (data not shown). Lewy Body-associated α-Synuclein Immunoreactivity Using 2-DE—In an attempt to investigate further the characteristics of disease-associated α-synuclein, urea-soluble fractions from disease cases and controls were subjected to further separation across a pH gradient from 3 to 10 before proteins were separated according to their molecular masses, i.e. by 2-DE. To determine the electrophoretic mobility of monomeric full-length α-synuclein in 2-DE, we loaded recombinant protein, which was found to run at the expected apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa, as in one-dimensional electrophoresis and pI of 4.4 (Fig. 4B). In brain regions with LB, α-synuclein immunoreactivity gave a characteristic pattern upon 2-DE analysis which consisted of serial spots of similar molecular mass but different charge, as well as high molecular mass smears (Fig. 4A). This pattern was never detected in control cases. When extracted α-synuclein was compared with the recombinant protein, we detected the full-length protein at 19 kDa, a truncated form at a lower molecular mass around 15 kDa, and a 22–24-kDa species. The latter most likely represents a modified disease-associated form of α-synuclein because (i) it was not detected in normal controls, and (ii) it consisted of groups of serial spots of similar or slightly increasing molecular mass separated across the pH gradient by an increase in negative charge. This result was consistent with the finding of a 22–24-kDa band using conventional immunoblotting analysis (Figs. 2, B and C and 4A). Modified 22–24-kDa α-Synuclein Is Ubiquitinated—Although the majority of LB are stained with antibodies to ubiquitin, the nature of the ubiquitinated protein(s) in these inclusions is uncertain. Ligation of each molecule of ubiquitin increases the apparent molecular mass of a protein on SDS-PAGE by 6–8 kDa and shifts its pI toward that of ubiquitin (pI 6.8). Urea-soluble extracts from PD and DLB were, therefore, subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with either ubiquitin antiserum or anti-α-synuclein antibodies. This showed that some of the α-synuclein-positive pH-separated spots represent an ubiquitinated form of the protein (Fig. 5, A–D). No ubiquitinated α-synuclein was detected in soluble fractions or control brain regions (data not shown). Three regions of ubiquitin-protein conjugates were noted on 2-DE immunoblots of a molecular mass of ∼29, 36, and, to a lesser extent, 43 kDa with associated pI shift toward 7.0. This pattern of molecular mass and charge shift is consistent with the addition of a single ubiquitin, thus giving groups of mono-, di-, and less abundant tri-ubiquitinated α-synuclein. On two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, monomeric α-synuclein has an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa and is, therefore, unlikely to be the substrate for ubiquitination. On the other hand, we noted that the pattern of ubiquitinated α-synuclein immunoreactivity was almost identical to that of the 22–24-kDa species, which itself was not positive for ubiquitin (Fig. 5, compare A and C with B and D). When compared with mono-ubiquitinated α-synuclein, the 22–24-kDa species had the appropriate size and charge shift, suggesting that this is the α-synuclein substrate for oligo-ubiquitination. These data show that in sporadic LB disease, a modified α-synuclein species of ∼22–24 kDa is a substrate for oligo-ubiquitination. 22–24-kDa α-Synuclein Is Hyperphosphorylated on Serine Residues—The pattern of α-synuclein-immunoreactive spots, which separated across the pH gradient but did not differ in their molecular mass, suggested that these could represent hyperphosphorylated species. Phosphorylation of α-synuclein on Ser-129 was previously shown to strongly label LB-associated α-synuclein with little staining of normal protein (12Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A.

Anti-PS129 antiserum showed that although monomeric protein was strongly labeled (Fig 6C, arrowhead), only some of the 22–24-kDa species and associated ubiquitinated protein were positive (Fig. 6). Proteasome Function in LB Disorders—The 22–24-kDa α-synuclein was present in all brain regions containing LB. Therefore, we sought to determine whether accumulation of modified 22–24-kDa α-synuclein in disease is associated with proteasome dysfunction. For this purpose, we measured proteasome activity in four regions from brain specimens from PD, DLB, AD, and age-matched controls: SN, which is most vulnerable to LB pathology in both PD and DLB, cingulate, frontal cortices, which are affected in DLB, and occipital cortex, which is devoid of LB. We found a 55% significant reduction in proteasome function in the SN of PD and DLB when compared with control cases (Fig. 7D). However, no significant difference was detected in cingulate, frontal and occipital cortices of PD, DLB, and control cases (Fig. 7, A–C). We investigated further the proteolytic activity of the proteasome in cingulate and frontal areas by comparing tissue extracts from DLB and AD cases, because in both diseases there is diffuse cortical involvement. We found that, although there was a reduction in proteasome activity in brain regions with AD pathology, no significant decline was detected in DLB (Fig. 7, E and F). In this study, we have shown the first analysis of LB-associated α-synuclein based on solubility, charge, and molecular mass. By using this approach, we have shown that, in diseased tissue, a modified 22–24-kDa α-synuclein is a substrate for oligo-ubiquitination. Furthermore, the proteolytic activity of the proteasome in areas with LB-associated 22–24-kDa α-synuclein was not invariably impaired. A number of studies have shown that ubiquitin and enzymes of the ubiquitin system are found in LB, but the nature of the substrate for ubiquitination remains unclear. Although we could detect poly-ubiquitinated proteins in all sub-cellular fractions examined, ubiquitinated α-synuclein was extracted biochemically only with disease-associated insoluble aggregates and not in soluble fractions. In 2-DE analysis, ubiquitinated α-synuclein gave a characteristic pattern of serial spots ranging from ∼29 to 43 kDa, separated by ∼7 kDa and shifted toward a pI of 6.8, as expected by the addition of a free ubiquitin molecule. Our data clearly show that mainly one or two and, to a lesser extent, three ubiquitin moieties are conjugated on LB-associated α-synuclein. This pattern is remarkably similar to that of tau in paired helical filaments of neurofibrillary tangles, which is mainly mono-ubiquitinated (13Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is well established that for ubiquitin-dependent degradation to occur, conjugation of at least four ubiquitins on a protein is necessary (14Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that ubiquitination of unmodified α-synuclein does not occur after inhibition of the proteasome in transfected cells (8Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 15Bennett M.C. Bishop J.F. Leng Y. Chock P.B. Chase T.N. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33855-33858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 16Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Ueda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with the present data, which show that the 19-kDa monomeric α-synuclein is not ubiquitinated. Taken together, these data support the notion that ubiquitin-dependent degradation is unlikely to be a major physiological mechanism for α-synuclein degradation. Rather, ubiquitination of LB-associated α-synuclein most likely represents a disease-specific pathway. In this respect, there are two obvious possibilities. Ubiquitination could represent (i) an unsuccessful “last-ditch stand” of cells in their attempt to unfold and/or degrade misfolded proteins either through the proteasome, which requires polyubiquitination, or the lysosome, which requires mono-ubiquitination (19Hochstrasser M. Science. 2002; 298: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could represent (ii) a cytoprotective response to preclude interactions of inappropriately exposed domains (20Gray D.A. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Which one of these possibilities is more likely remains to be seen. In keeping with ubiquitination being a disease-specific pathway is the finding that it is almost invariably associated with further post-translational modifications. Because ligation of each molecule of ubiquitin increases the apparent molecular mass of a protein by 6–8 kDa and shifts its pI toward that of ubiquitin (pI 6.8), electrophoretic resolution of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by both charge and mass can provide insight into the identity of ubiquitinated substrates. Using 2-DE, we show here for the first time that in sporadic LB diseases, a 22–24-kDa α-synuclein species and not monomeric protein is the substrate for oligo-ubiquitination. This finding is in contrast to a recent study by Hasewaga et al. (21Hasegawa M. Fujiwara H. Nonaka T. Wakabayashi K. Takahashi H. Lee V.M-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Mann D. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49071-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) which reported that monomeric α-synuclein is oligo-ubiquitinated. This difference could be explained by the fact that Hasewaga et al. analyzed samples that were prepared using a sarkosyl-based method and, therefore, are enriched mainly in filamentous α-synuclein. In contrast, our samples contained both filamentous and non-filamentous α-synuclein from early stages. Furthermore, we and others (22Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M Otero D.A.C Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 23Irizarry M.C. Kim T.W. McNamara M. Tanzi R.E. George J.M. Clayton D.F. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Hsu L.J. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) found that monomeric full-length α-synuclein runs with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa, whereas Hasewaga et al. shows it at 15 kDa. This discrepancy makes it difficult to predict whether our 22–24-kDa non-ubiquitinated α-synuclein band is the same as what Hasewaga et al. describe as monomeric ubiquitinated α-synuclein. However, it is possible that monomeric α-synuclein becomes ubiquitinated at later stages of disease and is detected in filament preparations. We found that some of the 22–24-kDa α-synuclein is phosphorylated on serine residues, whereas only a few higher molecular mass forms were positive with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (personal observations). Which modifications other than phosphorylation could be responsible for producing a change in pI with a little mass increment is currently unclear, but acetylation, methylation, or amino-terminal clipping are possible. Interestingly, a small shift in pI was also detected in recombinant protein. Our data may also help to explain the absence of extensive ubiquitinated α-synuclein inclusions in transgenic models because ubiquitin-conjugation on α-synuclein seems to occur only in the presence of further post-translational modifications. Therefore, this complex cellular response may represent a disease-specific pathway which is not fully activated in transgenic models. In this respect, identification of the relevant ubiquitin-ligase(s) may provide insights into the cellular response to fibril formation. For example, a 22-kDa glycosylated form of α-synuclein has been reported to be poly-ubiquitinated in vitro by parkin, an ubiquitin-protein ligase (11Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Contrary to the findings of Shimura et al. (11Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), we did not detect glycosylation of disease-associated α-synuclein in extracts from sporadic LB disorders. It remains possible that a different form of glycosylation occurs in LB-associated α-synuclein. Further purification of the 22–24-kDa form of α-synuclein will allow the characterization of this species in more detail. More recently, α-synuclein has been shown to be a substrate for ubiquitination by UCH-L1, which, contrary to the conventional understanding of the ubiquitin system, acts in an ATP-independent manner (25Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Whether α-synuclein is a substrate for the proteasome has been a subject of debate (15Bennett M.C. Bishop J.F. Leng Y. Chock P.B. Chase T.N. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33855-33858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 16Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Ueda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that unmodified full-length α-synuclein is degraded directly by the 20S proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent manner (8Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Because α-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein, it is feasible that in vivo, unfolded α-synuclein could bypass the need for ubiquitination and unfolding and enter the 20S proteasome directly. The above is in accordance with the finding that other small, relatively unfolded proteins can be degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (26Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 27Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An earlier report (28McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) has shown that proteasome activity is reduced in the SN of PD patients. Therefore, it is feasible that accumulation of α-synuclein is associated with proteasome dysfunction. However, LB-associated α-synuclein is also found outside the SN; therefore, all regions should be investigated. We found significant reduction in the proteolytic activity of the proteasome in the SN from PD and DLB cases but not in other regions with LB such as the cingulate and frontal cortices of DLB cases. Furthermore, in the cerebral cortex, AD but not LB pathology was associated with a significant reduction in proteasome function. One possible explanation for the findings in the SN is that this brain region is more uniformly involved in α-synucleinopathies. On the other hand, in cortex the ratio of normal to affected cells is greater, thus possibly masking the reduction of proteasome function in cells with LB. However, the above is unlikely to be the sole explanation, because the tissue was taken from early stages of the disease when there was mild to moderate cell loss. Because the protease-active sites are buried deep in the core of the proteasome, it is possible that in vivo regulatory regions on the outside ring, which cannot be detected with peptidase assays, are primarily damaged. For example, oxidative stress can lead to covalent modification of proteasome subunits (29Grune T. Shringarpure R. Sitte N. Davies K. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 56: B459-B467Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These alterations may prevent the assembly and stabilization of the multi-subunit complex or directly impair the binding of substrates to the 20S proteasome rather than their degradation. On the other hand, abnormal modification of substrates per se may impair their binding and/or recognition by the 20S. In this respect, it is feasible that accumulation of modified and presumably undegradable α-synuclein might overload the proteolytic system leading to aberrant ubiquitination. The latter could, in turn, interfere with the processing of monomeric α–synuclein, thus initiating a vicious circle that could lead to further protein accumulation and inclusion formation. If the proteolytic system is overwhelmed by modified α-synuclein species, then α-synuclein fragments, generated as a result of aberrant proteolysis, could be found specifically in association with LB. Accordingly, we found that truncated α-synuclein is selectively recovered from fractions containing aggregated α-synuclein but not in controls. Characterization of these fragments shows that they represent carboxyl-terminal truncated protein. Because in fibrils both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of α-synuclein extend out in the periphery (5Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 30Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the detection of only carboxyl-terminal-truncated protein is unlikely to be an artifact of extraction. Previous studies have reported the existence of truncated α-synuclein (6Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C. Maher F. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. Am. J.

Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to data presented here, truncated α-synuclein protein was found in both soluble and insoluble fractions and was present equally in soluble fractions from disease and control cases (6Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C. Maher F. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. Am. J.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), and a number of proteolytic digestion fragments are readily generated during purification procedures that involve formic acid extraction (31Baba M.

Therefore, the extraction method might confound previous suggestions that truncated α-synuclein is a normal soluble breakdown product. With our extraction procedure, degradation products are unlikely to form, suggesting that aberrant proteolysis either by the proteasome or other proteases could be a feature of neurodegeneration associated with LB formation. The finding that α-synuclein is degraded by the proteasome at internal peptide bonds without ubiquitination (33Liu C-W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) suggests that the 20S proteasome could contribute to the formation of these fragments. In summary, we have shown that in PD and DLB, a modified 22–24-kDa α-synuclein is a substrate for oligo-ubiquitination, which occurs in the absence of a generalized significant impairment of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. Because unmodified α-synuclein is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (8Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), our data suggest that accumulation of modified 22–24-kDa α-synuclein is a disease-specific event that may overwhelm the proteolytic system, presumably because of impaired recognition and/or flux through the 20S core of the proteasome, leading to aberrant ubiquitination and inclusion formation. Finally, the spatial separation of α-synuclein immunoreactive spots on 2-DE may be helpful in providing insights into novel, yet unknown modifications and, therefore, cellular pathways that may be involved in LB formation.

https://openalex.org/W2141145724,"The responsivity of primary sensory cortical neurons is reduced following prolonged adaptation, but such adaptation has been little studied in higher sensory areas. Adaptation to visual motion has strong perceptual effects, so we studied the effect of prolonged stimulation on neuronal responsivity in the macaque's area MT, a cortical area whose importance to visual motion perception is well established. We adapted MT neurons with sinusoidal gratings drifting in the preferred or null direction. Preferred adaptation reduced the responsiveness of MT cells, primarily by changing their contrast gain, and this effect was spatially specific within the receptive field. Null adaptation reduced the ability of null gratings to inhibit the response to a simultaneously presented preferred stimulus. While both preferred and null adaptation alter MT responses, these effects probably do not occur in MT neurons but are likely to reflect adaptation-induced changes in contrast gain earlier in the visual pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994867142,"In the aorta, diabetes activates an osteogenic program that includes expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and the osteoblast homeoprotein Msx2. To evaluate BMP2-Msx2 signaling in vascular calcification, we studied primary aortic myofibroblasts. These cells express vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) markers, respond to BMP2 by up-regulating <i>Msx2</i>, and undergo osteogenic differentiation with BMP2 treatment or transduction with a virus encoding Msx2. The osteoblast factor osterix (<i>Osx</i>) is up-regulated 10-fold by Msx2, but <i>Runx2</i> mRNA is unchanged; the early osteoblast marker alkaline phosphatase increases 50-fold with mineralized nodule formation enhanced 30-fold. Adipocyte markers are concomitantly suppressed. To better understand Msx2 actions on osteogenesis <i>versus</i> adipogenesis, mechanistic studies were extended to C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. Msx2 enhances osteogenic differentiation in synergy with BMP2. Osteogenic actions depend upon intrinsic Msx2 DNA binding; the gain-of-function variant Msx2(P148H) directs enhanced mineralization, whereas the binding-deficient variant Msx2(T147A) is inactive. Adipogenesis (lipid accumulation, <i>Pparg</i> expression) is inhibited by Msx2. By contrast, suppression of adipogenesis does not require Msx2 DNA binding; inhibition occurs in part via protein-protein interactions with C/EBPα that control <i>Pparg</i> transcription. Thus, Msx2 regulates osteogenic <i>versus</i> adipogenic differentiation of aortic myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts capable of both fates can be diverted to the osteogenic lineage by BMP2-Msx2 signaling and contribute to vascular calcification."

Ophthalmology. 1992; 99: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Due to the aging population, the prevalence of AMD in the United States is predicted to double in the next 25 years (3Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Hageman G.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Macular degeneration is characterized by the breakdown of photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the small central portion of the retina (∼2 mm in diameter) that is responsible for high acuity vision. Specific gene mutations cause early onset, juvenile forms of macular degeneration, and although genetic factors are also associated with late onset macular degeneration, the identity of AMD susceptibility genes remains unclear (3Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Hageman G.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). AMD is a slow, progressive disease with environmental risk factors that have been associated with oxidative damage (4Beatty S. Koh H. Phil M. Henson D. Boulton M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2000; 45: 115-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), for example, cigarette smoking and perhaps diet and lifetime light exposure (1Evans J.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 227-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Presently no cure exists for AMD; however, the progression of the disease can be slowed with antioxidant vitamins and zinc for select individuals (5AREDS Research GroupArch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 1417-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Recently, we provided direct evidence that oxidative protein modifications generated from docosahexaenoate (DHA)-containing lipids, namely carboxyethyl pyrrole (CEP) adducts, are more abundant in AMD than in normal Bruch's membrane/RPE/choroid tissues (6Crabb J.W. Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K. West K.A. Sakaguchi H. Kamei M. Hasan A. Yan L. Rayborn M.E. Salomon R.G. Hollyfield J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1682-14687Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). CEP adducts were also found in extracellular deposits (i.e. drusen) behind the retina considered to be significant risk factors for the development of AMD (6Crabb J.W. Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K. West K.A. Sakaguchi H. Kamei M. Hasan A. Yan L. Rayborn M.E. Salomon R.G. Hollyfield J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1682-14687Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). CEP protein adducts belong to a family of 2-(ω-carboxyalkyl) pyrrole adducts (Fig. 1) generated from the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (7). Thus, oxidative fragmentation of linoleic or arachidonic acid produces 9-hydroxy-12-oxododec-10-enoic acid (HODA) or 5-hydroxy-8-oxooct-6-enoic acid (HOOA), respectively, which react with protein to generate 2-(ω-carboxyheptyl)pyrrole (CHP) or 2-(ω-carboxypropyl)pyrrole (CPP) adducts, respectively. The CHP and CPP adducts have been detected in oxidized low density lipoprotein and human plasma (7). Furthermore, the esters of HODA and HOOA with phosphatidylcholine (HODA-PC and HOOA-PC) are biologically active products of low density lipoprotein oxidation and are present in atherosclerotic plaques (8Sun M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The detection of CPP or CHP does not uniquely indicate the oxidative damage of linoleic or arachidonic acid or their esters, because these protein adducts can also arise from other common PUFAs. In contrast, only DHA gives rise to 2-(ω-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) adducts, by oxidative cleavage to 4-hydroxy-7-oxohept-5-enoic acid (HOHA) and reaction of the latter with protein (Fig. 1). Indeed, we have shown recently (12Gu X. Sun M. Gugiu B. Hazen S. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3749-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that HOHA-PC is a minor oxidative product from DHA-PC and that it can generate peptide-bound CEP adducts. Although rare in most human tissues, DHA is present in ∼80 mol % of the polyunsaturated lipids in photoreceptor outer segments (13Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The abundance of DHA in photoreceptors, the high photooxidative stress in retina, and the fact that DHA is the most oxidizable fatty acid in humans (13Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) suggests that DHA oxidation products may have possible utility as biomarkers for AMD susceptibility. Here we explore further the role of oxidative fragmentation of DHA in AMD. We report methods for preparing CEP-modified proteins and characterization of a rabbit polyclonal antiCEP antibody. In addition, we present evidence that CEP immunoreactivity and autoantibody titers are elevated in human plasma from AMD donors relative to age-matched normal controls. Materials—Chicken egg ovalbumin (grade V), bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V), human serum albumin (HSA, fraction V), and arachidonic acid were purchased from Sigma; the dipeptide Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe was purchased from Bachem, Torrance, CA; and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was purchased from Calbiochem. All organic chemicals were analytical grade and purchased from Aldrich. Pentylpyrrole aminocaproic acid-modified albumin (PP-ACA-BSA), 2-(ω-carboxypropyl) pyrrole-modified albumin (CPP-HSA), a 2-(ω-carboxyheptyl)pyrrole-modified albumin (CHP-HSA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-CPP and anti-CHP antibodies were prepared as described previously (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Human Plasma Preparation—Blood was collected into 7-ml vacutubes containing EDTA (10.5 mg), from AMD and normal healthy donors at the Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm (1300 × g) for 10 min, and the plasma was transferred to plastic vials containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; 1 mg/ml), leupeptin (35 μm), pepstatin (5 μm), and aprotinin (0.1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml). Plasma was then quench-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used. Usually, BHT and protease inhibitors were added to the plasma samples 3–5 h after blood was drawn. Preparation of ω-Carboxyethylpyrrole-modified Peptide and Proteins—Paal-Knorr reactions of γ-dicarbonyl compounds with primary amines provided an efficient route to 2-(ω-carboxyalkyl)pyrroles (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Syntheses of γ-ketoaldehydes, 4,7-dioxoheptanoic acid (DOHA), and its phosphatidylcholine ester (DOHA-PC) were developed as described in the Supplemental Material to allow unambiguous production of 2-(ω-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) and the corresponding PC ester. First, a Grignard reagent was produced from 2-(2-bromoethyl)-1,3-dioxolane, followed by selective acylation of this organomagnesium derivative with 3-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride. Saponification of the resulting ethylene ketal keto ester delivered a carboxylic acid that, when coupled with 2-lysophosphatidylcholine in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N,N-dimethyl-aminopyridine, gave a stable precursor that yielded DOHA-PC upon hydrolysis. Transketalization of the ethylene ketal with acetone provided a mixture containing DOHA, presumably in equilibrium with the corresponding hemiacylal based on the 1H NMR spectrum that exhibits two aldehydic hydrogen singlets (Supplemental Fig. S5). Paal-Knorr condensation of DOHA or DOHA-PC with the dipeptide acetyl-Gly-Lys-O-methyl ester generated the CEP-dipeptides, DOHA-dipeptide, or CEP-PC-dipeptide that were fully characterized by 1H NMR (12Gu X. Sun M. Gugiu B. Hazen S. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3749-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively, and solvents and chromatography conditions for purification of synthetic products were as described elsewhere (12Gu X. Sun M. Gugiu B. Hazen S. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3749-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All reactions in an inert atmosphere were under argon unless otherwise specified. As described in detail in the Supplemental Material, Paal-Knorr condensation with DOHA was used to prepare CEP-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (CEP-KLH), bovine serum albumin (CEP-BSA), human serum albumin (CEP-HSA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CEP-GPDH). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay (14Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar), and pyrrole concentrations were determined using the Ehrlich reagent, 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde (15DeCaprio A.P. Jackowshi S.J. Regan K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar), and the above CEP-dipeptide as a reference standard. Identification of CEP-modified Residues in HSA—CEP-HSA was reduced in 400 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 8 m urea and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature under argon and then thiol groups were alkylated by the addition of iodoacetamide (to 50 mm). Following alkylation the preparation was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and about 260 pmol (17 μg) was digested with 0.2 μg of trypsin (Promega) (16Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y.

CEP-modified tryptic peptides were sought using peptide mass mapping methods (17West K.A. Yan L. Miyagi M. Crabb J.S. Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L. Crabb J.W. Exp.

Putative CEP-modified peptides detected by MALDI-TOF MS were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry using a PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole electrospray instrument fitted with a Protana nanospray interface (17West K.A.

Preparation of Anti-CEP Antibodies—A Pasteurella-free, New Zealand White rabbit was inoculated subcutaneously along the back and rear legs with about 340 μg (∼7.1 nmol) of CEP-KLH (∼1 mol of pyrrole/mol of KLH, 2.7 mg/ml KLH in PBS). Initial injections were administered with Freund's complete adjuvant, and booster injections were given every 21 days with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antibody titers were monitored 10 days after each inoculation by ELISA. The rabbit was exsanguinated after 92 days and a total of 5 inoculations. The IgG fraction of anti-CEP antibodies was purified using immobilized protein G (19Sayre L.M. Sha W. Xu G. Kaur K. Nadkarni D. Subbanagounder G. Salomon R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ELISA—Three ELISA procedures were employed and are termed here as Methods A–C (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Sayre L.M. Sha W. Xu G. Kaur K. Nadkarni D. Subbanagounder G. Salomon R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Method A was used to determine the titer of anti-CEP antisera. Method B was used to characterize cross-reactivities and to quantify carboxyalkyl pyrrole immunoreactivities. Method C was used to titer anti-CEP autoantibodies in human plasma. ELISA Method A—Anti-CEP antibody titer in rabbit serum was measured as for other anti-carboxyalkyl pyrrole antibodies (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Baxter 96-well ELISA plates were coated with CEP-BSA containing 1.5 mol of pyrrole per mol of protein by incubating a 4.3 μg/ml protein solution in PBS (100 μl/well) at 37 °C for 1 h in a moist chamber. The coating solution was washed away with PBS (3 × 300 μl), and the wells were incubated with blocking solution (1.0% chicken egg ovalbumin in PBS, 300 μl) at 37 °C for 1 h. The blocking solution was washed away with 0.1% ovalbumin in PBS (300 μl), and then various dilutions of rabbit serum were added (100 μl) in PBS containing 0.2% ovalbumin. Ovalbumin (0.2%) in PBS without serum and nonimmune rabbit serum, diluted as above, were employed as controls. Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the wells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% ovalbumin and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution). The wells were again washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% ovalbumin, and substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Bio-Rad) (0.9 mg/ml, pH 9.6) was added (100 μl/well) and incubated ≤30 min at room temperature. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined relative to 650 nm with a Bio-Rad 450 automated Microplate reader. ELISA Method B—For competitive binding studies to measure cross-reactivities between anti-CEP and anti-CPP antibodies, CEP-BSA, CEP-GDPH, and CPP-BSA were used as coating agents, CEP-HSA and CPP-HSA were used as reference standards, and ELISAs were performed as described for studies with the anti-CPP antibodies (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To quantify CEP, CPP, and CHP immunoreactivity, samples of DHA, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, or DHA-PC that had been oxidized in the presence of HSA were analyzed by ELISAs using anti-CEP, anti-CPP, and anti-CHP antibodies as described previously (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Sayre L.M. Sha W. Xu G. Kaur K. Nadkarni D. Subbanagounder G. Salomon R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To quantify CEP immunoreactivity in human plasma, ELISA of plasma from AMD patients and healthy volunteers was performed as in the inhibition assays using a plasma dilution factor of 0.2. To compare intra- and inter-assay variability, triplicate assays of plasma from a single AMD patient were run on a single plate, and this experiment was repeated on three different days. ELISA Method C—To determine anti-CEP autoantibody titer in human plasma, a 96-well plate was coated with CEP-BSA (100 μl). As a blank, BSA (2%, 100 μl) was used. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS (10 mm, 300 μl) 3 times, and blocked with ovalbumin (1%, 300 μl)for1hat37 °C. Then the plate was washed once with 0.1% ovalbumin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (300 μl). The plate was loaded with plasma, diluted 20 times with 0.2% ovalbumin plus 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed 3 times with 0.1% ovalbumin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (300 μl). Secondary antibodies were added (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgM, diluted 1:4000 with 1% ovalbumin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (100 μl)), and after 30 min the plate was washed with 0.05% Tween 20 containing 0.1% ovalbumin (3 times, 300 μl), and then substrate was added (p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 μl/well, 0.9 mg/ml, pH 9.6, BioRad). After 60 min, the absorbance was read at 405 nm with reference at 650 nm. The titer was defined as the ratio of plasma binding to antigen (A) versus binding to BSA (Ao). CEP Immunoreactivity from the Reaction of HOHA-PC with HSA— HSA (16.5 mg, 0.25 μmol) and 4-hydroxy-7-oxohept-5-enoic acid ester of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine (HOHA-PC, 5 mg, 7.9 μmol) (12Gu X. Sun M. Gugiu B. Hazen S. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3749-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were dissolved in PBS (5 ml), yielding a final concentration of 1.6 mm HOHA-PC and 0.05 mm HSA. The preparation was incubated at 37 °C under argon, and aliquots were withdrawn with time. A portion of each aliquot was hydrolyzed by 0.2 n KOH at 37 °C for 30 min, neutralized with HCl, and then dialyzed against PBS (2 × 1 liter) at room temperature for 24 h. Levels of CEP immunoreactivity were determined by ELISA Method B using anti-CEP antibodies. In Vitro Oxidation of PUFAs or DHA-PC with HSA—Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 6.1 μmol), arachidonic acid (6.6 μmol), or linoleic acid (7.1 μmol) and HSA (0.5 μmol) were dissolved in PBS (10 ml), and oxidation was initiated by the addition of 20 mm ascorbate (510 μl) and 0.8 mm FeSO4 (510 μl). The preparations were incubated up to 72 h at 37 °C under air and aliquots were removed periodically; afterward the oxidation reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA (to 1 mg/ml) and BHT (to 40 mm) followed by overnight dialysis at room temperature against PBS (2 × 1 liter) containing EDTA (1 mg/ml). Prior to oxidation of DHA-PC, DHA-PC liposomes were prepared (20MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of DHA-PC (6.3 μmol) in chloroform was evaporated in vacuo, and the resulting lipid film was hydrated in PBS (2 ml) at 37 °C and the suspension extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (100-nm pore size, Nuclepore Co., Pleasanton, CA) to produce a clear solution of unilamellar liposomes. The resulting DHA-PC liposomes were combined with HSA in PBS (5 ml), yielding concentrations of about 0.6 mm DHA-PC and 0.05 mm HAS, and oxidation was initiated by addition of 20 mm ascorbate (215 μl) and 0.8 mm FeSO4 (215 μl). The preparation was incubated at 37 °C under air up to 24 h; aliquots were removed periodically, and the oxidation reaction was quenched as described above. A portion of the preparation was hydrolyzed with 0.2 n KOH at 37 °C for 30 min, then neutralized with HCl, and finally dialyzed against PBS (2 × 1 liter) containing EDTA (1 mg/ml) for 24 h at room temperature. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed to localize CEP adducts in mouse and human retina using methods described recently (6Crabb J.W. Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K. West K.A. Sakaguchi H. Kamei M. Hasan A. Yan L. Rayborn M.E. Salomon R.G. Hollyfield J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1682-14687Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Mouse eyes were enucleated from BALB/c mice immediately after sacrifice by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. Normal and AMD human donor eye tissues were obtained through the Eye Donor Program of the Foundation Fighting Blindness (Owings Mills, MD). Human eyes were enucleated 1.5–7 h after death and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After separating the anterior segment, posterior eye cups were fixed overnight in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Retinal tissues sections (3 μm thick) were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-CEP antibody (diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 6% BSA). Control mouse retinal sections were preincubated overnight with the CEP-HSA prior to incubation with anti-CEP. Preimmune rabbit sera served as the immunocytochemical control for analysis of human tissues. After washing extensively with PBS, sections were treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase ABC (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, 1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated in 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in PBS at room temperature. Sections were viewed without counterstaining using differential interference contrast microscopy. The images presented were digitized with a Hamamatsu CCD camera and assembled in Microsoft PowerPoint. Dot-blot Assay—Nitrocellulose membrane (Nitro Plus, 0.45 μm, Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA) was prewet with 10 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (TBS), and CEP-HSA (50 μl/well, 2 μg) was applied by gravity to membrane wells in a dot-blot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blocking solution (1% ovalbumin in TBS, 300 μl) was then applied to each well, followed by 0.5% Tween 20 in TBS (TBST, 2 × 300 μl), and a vacuum was used to pull the solutions through the membrane. Plasma (100 μl of 1:10 dilution in TBS containing 0.2% ovalbumin) was then applied by gravity to each well followed by TBST (3 × 300 μl). Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Ig, 100 μl, 1:1000 dilution TBS containing 1% ovalbumin) was then applied by gravity to each well followed by TBST (3 × 300 μl). The membrane was then removed from the microfiltration apparatus; chemiluminescence reagent was applied (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane was blotted dry with filter paper and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The film was scanned with a densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer), and the signal was quantified using PDQuest image analysis software (Bio-Rad). Statistics—For statistical analysis of plasma levels of CEP immunoreactivity and autoantibodies, p values were calculated by independent t test (two sample assuming equal variances) using Excel 98 for Macintosh. For correlation of CEP immunoreactivity and autoantibody titer with AMD, a logistic regression model was fit with both variables as predictors using SAS/STAT software, Version 8.2 from SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC. A predicted score was calculated for each plasma donor and the c statistic, which is a measure of how well the predictor variables can distinguish AMD cases from controls, was determined. We produced CEP-adducted proteins using Paal-Knorr condensation of DOHA with the ϵ-amino group of lysyl residues. The unambiguous synthesis of DOHA, DOHA-phosphatidylcholine (DOHA-PC), CEP, and CEP-PC adducted dipeptide and verifications by NMR are documented in the Supplemental Material. DOHA was then used to chemically modify KLH, BSA, HSA, and GPDH to yield CEP-adducted antigens and reference proteins. Characterization of DOHA Modified HSA—To probe for the presence of CEP adducts in HSA following modification with DOHA, the protein was digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). Two HSA peptides containing apparent lysyl CEP adducts were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at m/z 1141 and m/z 2021 (Fig. 2A). Tandem nanoelectrospray mass spectrometric analysis of m/z 1141 revealed HSA peptide 234AFK*WAVAR241 and unambiguously confirmed a CEP adduct on lysyl residue Lys236 (Fig. 2B). Electrospray MS/MS analysis of m/z 2021 revealed HSA peptide 170HPYFYAPELLFFAK*R184 and a CEP adduct on lysyl residue Lys183 (Fig. 2C). The pyrrole content in this preparation of CEP-HSA was estimated using the Ehrlich assay to be 1.5–1.6 mol of pyrrole per mol of protein. Complete structural analysis of the DOHA-modified albumin was not pursued, and other residues containing CEP adducts could be present. Anti-CEP Antibody Specificity—To evaluate the binding specificities of anti-CEP rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to DOHA-modified KLH, competitive ELISAs were performed with HSA adducted with CEP, CPP, CHP, or PP-ACA, and the results (Fig. 3 and Table I) were compared with that of anti-CPP antibodies (7Kaur K. Salomon R.G. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CEP and CPP adducts differ by only a single CH2 group; nevertheless, inhibition of anti-CEP antibody binding by CPP-HSA is remarkably weak, i.e. 0.1% crossreactivity. Inhibition of anti-CPP binding by CEP-HSA is somewhat greater; however, anti-CPP also exhibits high structural specificity, i.e. only 1.3% cross-reactivity. Neither antibody exhibits significant cross-reactivity with CHP-HSA, which contains a much larger carboxyalkyl group than the haptens against which anti-CEP or anti-CPP were raised. Another pyrrolated species, PP-6-ACA-HSA, which contains an n-pentyl rather than a carboxyalkyl side chain, showed no cross-reactivity with either of the antibodies. Similar structural selectivity of anti-CEP antibody was observed when a different coating agent, CEP-GP"
https://openalex.org/W2015101897,"A variety of drugs inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 by the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases. Several modes of inhibitor binding in the COX active site have been described including ion pairing of carboxylic acid containing inhibitors with Arg-120 of COX-1 and COX-2 and insertion of arylsulfonamides and sulfones into the COX-2 side pocket. Recent crystallographic evidence suggests that Tyr-385 and Ser-530 chelate polar or negatively charged groups in arachidonic acid and aspirin. We tested the generality of this binding mode by analyzing the action of a series of COX inhibitors against site-directed mutants of COX-2 bearing changes in Arg-120, Tyr-355, Tyr-348, and Ser-530. Interestingly, diclofenac inhibition was unaffected by the mutation of Arg-120 to alanine but was dramatically attenuated by the S530A mutation. Determination of the crystal structure of a complex of diclofenac with murine COX-2 demonstrates that diclofenac binds to COX-2 in an inverted conformation with its carboxylate group hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-385 and Ser-530. This finding represents the first experimental demonstration that the carboxylate group of an acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug can bind to a COX enzyme in an orientation that precludes the formation of a salt bridge with Arg-120. Mutagenesis experiments suggest Ser-530 is also important in time-dependent inhibition by nimesulide and piroxicam.

Biol. 2001; 11: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). COX-1 is generally considered the homeostatic form of the enzyme as it is constitutively expressed in a number of tissues, whereas COX-2 is sensitive to induction in many tissues by a broad range of physiological and pathological stimuli (5Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Inhibition of COX enzymes by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) accounts for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, as well as their gastrointestinal toxicity (6Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar). Development of selective COX-2 inhibitors has reduced the gastrointestinal liability (7Simon L.S. Lanza F.L. Lipsky P.E. Hubbard R.C. Talwalker S. Schwartz B.D. Isakson P.C. Geis G.S.

DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). COX-1 and COX-2 have very similar structures characterized by a membrane-binding domain comprised of amphipathic helices forming the entrance to a long hydrophobic channel (8Picot D. Loll P.J.

Tyr-355, and Glu-524 (see Fig. 1). Arachidonic acid, when bound productively for turnover, is positioned with its carboxylic acid ion-paired to Arg-120, its 13-pro-S-hydrogen adjacent to the catalytically important Tyr-385, and its ω-end projecting into a channel that abuts Gly-533 (11Rowlinson S.W.

Crystal structures of COX enzymes with carboxylic acid-containing NSAIDs show that the inhibitors are positioned in a similar fashion with their carboxylates coordinated to Arg-120 and their aromatic functionality projecting into the cyclooxygenase active site toward Tyr-385 (8Picot D.

Diarylheterocycle inhibitors of COX-2 bind in the cyclooxygenase active site above Arg-120 and insert their sulfonamide or sulfone groups into a side pocket bordered by Val-523 (9Kurumbail R.G.

Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar).Recently, x-ray analysis of a cocrystal of arachidonic acid with apoCOX-2 uncovered a unique conformation of bound substrate in which the arachidonic acid molecule was inverted with its carboxylate coordinated to Ser-530 and Tyr-385 (13Kiefer J.R. Pawlitz J.L. Moreland K.T. Stegeman R.A. Hood W.F. Gierse J.K. Stevens A.M. Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Stallings W.C. Kurumbail R.G. Nature. 2000; 405: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In this conformation, the alkyl chain of arachidonate projected down toward Arg-120 and then bent sharply up so that its ω-end was positioned adjacent to Leu-531 and Met-535. This orientation was proposed to reflect a non-productive or inhibitory conformation of bound substrate although there is no evidence for substrate inhibition in our hands at concentrations of arachidonic acid up to 100 μm. Despite the uncertainty about the physiological relevance of this conformation of arachidonic acid, its unique orientation identified Tyr-385 and Ser-530 as residues that can cooperate in the chelation of negative charges or electron-rich centers. Indeed, we found that such an interaction is a critical determinant of the selectivity of aspirin for covalent modification of Ser-530 as mutagenesis of Tyr-385 to Phe reduces aspirin acetylation of Ser-530 by over 90% (14Hochgesang G.P. Marnett L.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6514-6515Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding by Tyr-385 is proposed to stabilize the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate that develops during Ser-530 acetylation (14Hochgesang G.P. Marnett L.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6514-6515Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The structural and functional evidence for the importance of Tyr-385 and Ser-530 in the chelation of ligands prompted us to ask whether these groups might be important for the interaction of cyclooxygenases with other inhibitors. Because Ser-530 is not essential for cyclooxygenase activity, the S530A mutant represents an enzyme that is catalytically active but unable to participate with Tyr-385 in chelation (15DeWitt D.L.

Thus, we prepared this mutant and probed its sensitivity to inhibition by representatives of all the major structural classes of NSAIDs. The results suggest that Tyr-385/Ser-530 chelation is critical for inhibition of COX-2 by the clinically used NSAIDs, diclofenac, piroxicam, and nimesulide. To test this hypothesis, we undertook structural studies of COX-2-diclofenac complexes that revealed that diclofenac is bound in an orientation in which its carboxylic acid is coordinated to Tyr-385 and Ser-530, analogous to the inverted orientation reported recently (13Kiefer J.R. Pawlitz J.L. Moreland K.T. Stegeman R.A. Hood W.F. Gierse J.K. Stevens A.M. Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Stallings W.C. Kurumbail R.G.

These studies highlight the importance of Tyr-385 and Ser-530 to ligand association with COX-2 and identify a new binding mode that appears to be important for COX inhibition by some classes of NSAIDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Arachidonic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) and [14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from Nu-Chek-Prep (Elysian, MN) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Electrophoresis and chromatography reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Ketorolac was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). All other inhibitors and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.Mutant Construction—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a mouse COX-2 (mCOX-2) pBS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The R120A mutant was subcloned into the mCOX-2 pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (Pharmingen) using the BlpI and EcoRI restriction sites, the Y355F mutant was subcloned using the EcoNI and EcoRI restriction sites, and the S530A was subcloned by use of the StuI restriction site in mCOX-2 and the XmaI restriction site present in both the pBS+ and pVL1393 vectors. The subcloned regions were fully sequenced to ensure no accidental mutations were incorporated.Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in SF-9 cells and purified as described (11Rowlinson S.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Peroxidase Assays—The peroxidase activity of all purified proteins was measured using the guaiacol peroxidase assay as described (16Markey C.M. Alward A. Weller P.E. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

The rate and magnitude of oxygen uptake were determined in the manner described previously (17Odenwaller R. Chen Y.-N.P. Marnett L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using 150 nm purified protein reconstituted with 2 equivalents of hematin and 100 μm arachidonic acid.Cyclooxygenase Inhibition Assays—COX assays were performed with purified protein reconstituted with two equivalents of hematin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 μm phenol, pH 8.0, buffer for the indicated time with [14C]arachidonic acid at 37 °C. All assays were terminated and analyzed by thin layer chromatography in the manner described previously (18Kalgutkar A.S. Marnett A.B. Crews B.C. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2860-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Time-dependent inhibition assays were performed by preincubating the inhibitor and enzyme for 20 min at 25 °C and then at 37 °C for 4 min prior to the addition of [14C]arachidonic acid (100 μm final concentration) for 30 s at 37 °C. High substrate concentration (100 μm) was employed to ensure that assays were performed in a concentration range well above the K m of the mutant enzymes. For competitive inhibition assays, 10 μl of inhibitor and 10 μl of 200 μm [14C]arachidonic acid were added to the reaction vessel followed by 180 μl of enzyme at the indicated concentration. After a 15-s incubation at 37 °C, the assays were terminated, and products were determined in the manner indicated above.Crystallography—Recombinant murine COX-2 was overexpressed in Sf21 cells in a baculovirus expression system as described previously (19Gierse J.K.

The first anion exchange column pool was trypsinized at a ratio of 30:1 (w/w, COX-2: trypsin) for 30 min at room temperature to remove a 3-kDa C-terminal COX-2 fragment and contaminating baculovirus coat proteins 3J.

The proteolyzed material was run through a size exclusion column containing 5 mm glutathione in the buffer to remove any residual heme present (added back in the crystallization experiments). The rest of the purification protocols were as described (19Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Koboldt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem.

Amber-colored plate-like crystals appeared and grew to ∼0.25 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm within 2 weeks. The crystal was flash frozen, and data were collected at the 17-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source on an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector. The crystal diffracted X-rays to 2.9-Å resolution, and the data were reduced with the HKL Suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Adv. Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space group P21212 and with the following cell parameters: a = 181.1 Å, b = 135.1 Å, c = 124.2 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. Overall, 362,090 reflections were measured (67,852 unique), and an R sym of 16.1%. The structure was solved by difference Fourier methods using the COX-2/arachidonic acid complex (Protein Data Bank code 1CVU) as the initial model (13Kiefer J.R. Pawlitz J.L. Moreland K.T.

Two COX-2 dimers are in each asymmetric unit. The coordinates were refined using the program X-PLOR by conjugate gradient and individual temperature factor refinement protocols with bulk solvent correction (22Brunger A.T.

The current R-factors for the model are R free = 30.2% and r = 24.9% for all reflections in the resolution range of 20 to 2.9 Å with excellent stereochemistry (root mean square deviation of 0.008 Å and 1.5° from ideal bond lengths and angles, respectively). The current model includes protein residues 33–583, one heme molecule, five N-acetyl glucosamine sugars, one β-octyl-glucopyranoside, and one diclofenac molecule per monomer. The coordinates have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1PXX.RESULTSInhibition of Mutant COX-2s—A series of site-directed mutations in murine COX-2 were constructed and expressed in insect cells from baculovirus vectors. These included S530A, R120A, Y355F, Y385F, and Y348F. Arg-120 and Tyr-355 are residues at the constriction between the lobby and the active site, and Tyr-385 and Tyr-348 are located within the active site, hydrogen-bonded to each other (Fig. 1). All expressed mutants were purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purity of the Y348F mutant was shown by densitometric scanning of 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to be 70%, whereas all other mutants were equal to or greater than 90% pure (Table I). Table I also lists the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities of the purified proteins. The peroxidase activities of the mutant enzymes were all similar to the activity observed with wild-type mCOX-2, indicating that the introduced mutations did not result in gross structural perturbations of the enzyme. Some of the mutant enzymes exhibited a modest reduction in COX activity, as well as a proportional decrease in the total conversion of arachidonic acid to COX products. The cyclooxygenase activity for Y385F could not be measured as this residue is strictly required for that reaction.Table ICharacterization of mutant cyclooxygenases The purities of wild-type (wt) and mutant COX-2 proteins were determined from Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Peroxidase activities were determined using the guaiacol peroxidase assay. The cyclooxygenase activity initial rates and total product production were determined in the manner described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cyclooxygenase activity of wild-type enzyme was 9.6 μmol arachidonic acid oxidized/min/mg protein.

The choice of compound was made to represent the major classes of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (i.e. arylacetic acids, arylpropionic acids, enolcarboxamides, and anthranilic acids). Each inhibitor was incubated with protein for 24 min prior to the addition of arachidonic acid. The arylcarboxylic acids, indomethacin and meclofenamic acid, were equipotent against wild-type enzyme and S530A but exhibited greatly reduced inhibition of the Y355F enzyme. Indomethacin inhibition was very sensitive to mutation of Arg-120 whereas meclofenamic acid inhibition was reduced ∼4-fold. This is consistent with the results of previous mutagenesis studies and with the crystal structure of a COX-2-indomethacin complex in which the carboxylic acid interacts with Arg-120 and Tyr-355 (bond distances of 2.4 and 3.0 Å, respectively) (9Kurumbail R.G.

The IC50 values for time-dependent inhibition of wild-type, R120A, and Y355F enzymes were comparable, whereas the S530A enzyme appeared completely resistant to inhibition by diclofenac. Y348F, which has been shown to affect acetylation of Ser-530 by aspirin, had no impact on inhibition by diclofenac (Fig. 3). The arylcarboxylic acid, ketorolac, was comparable with indomethacin in that it did not inhibit R120A or Y355F, but its inhibitory potency against S530A was somewhat reduced (23-fold). Interestingly, piroxicam, which does not contain a carboxylic acid, did not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of any the three mutant proteins. Nimesulide was similar to diclofenac in that it was less potent against S530A than wild-type enzyme, but the magnitude of the difference was not as great as with diclofenac (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Time-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity of wild-type mCOX-2 and mCOX-2 mutants by diclofenac.

The mutation caused a modest 2-fold increase in the IC50 of ibuprofen and naproxen and a 3.7-fold increase in IC50 of mefenamic acid (Table III). The R120A and Y355F mutants were not included in this study, because these two side chains are important in binding the carboxylate of arachidonate, making them more sensitive to inhibition by competitive inhibitors (data not shown).Table IIICompetitive Inhibition of Wild-Type COX-2 and S530A COX-2 by NSAIDs Assays were performed, and the total products were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were performed three or more times, with the mean ± S.E. indicated.

Assays were performed to evaluate its ability to act as a competitive or time-dependent inhibitor of wild-type COX-2 and S530A. Diclofenac is a potent time-dependent inhibitor of wild-type enzyme and displays no competitive inhibitory activity, even at concentrations of arachidonic acid (2 μm) near its K m. No competitive inhibition of S530A was detected, and the inhibitory potency of diclofenac for S530A was reduced below the limits of detection of the time-dependent inhibition assay.Fig. 4A displays a series of plots of the rates of arachidonate oxygenation by COX-2 as a function of substrate concentrations at different concentrations of another time-dependent inhibitor, the arylsulfonamide, nimesulide. These experiments were performed by addition of enzyme to a solution containing arachidonate with nimesulide to minimize time-dependent inhibition. However, the plots are not typical of pure competitive inhibition, because increasing concentrations of nimesulide decrease the maximal rate of oxygenation so that V max is not achieved even at high substrate concentrations. This is consistent with mixed inhibition or a combination of the effects of time-dependent inhibition with competitive inhibition. Time-dependent inhibition of COX-2 by nimesulide is rapid and comparable with the rate of oxygenation of arachidonic acid by the enzyme. Thus, time-dependent inhibition can occur to varying extents during the oxygenation assay and is particularly severe at higher concentrations of nimesulide causing the decrease in V max at high substrate concentrations. Fig. 4B displays the results of similar experiments performed with the S530A mutant. Nimesulide is a much weaker inhibitor against this mutant, but even at high nimesulide concentrations all of the V versus [S] plots reach V max. K m increases with increasing nimesulide concentrations consistent with competitive inhibition. Thus, mutation of Ser-530 to Ala eliminates time-dependent inhibition by nimesulide but not competitive inhibition. The approximate K i values for nimesulide are 18 μm against wild-type enzyme and 92 μm against S530A.Crystallography—The dramatic impact of mutation of Ser-530 on inhibition by diclofenac suggests that it binds to COX-2 in such a way as to maximize interaction with the Ser-530 hydroxyl group. To test this hypothesis, crystals of mCOX-2 were grown in the presence of diclofenac. Initial difference electron density maps clearly revealed the presence of diclofenac in the cyclooxygenase active site (Fig. 5a). Diclofenac is bound deep in the active site, which is located at the end of a channel that emanates from the helical, membrane-binding domain of cyclooxygenases (8Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2040952209,"To examine the role of C/EBP-related transcription factors in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage, we have used the tetracycline-regulated system and expressed in the forebrain of mice a broad dominant-negative inhibitor of C/EBP (EGFP-AZIP), which preferentially interacts with several inhibiting isoforms of C/EBP. EGFP-AZIP also reduces the expression of ATF4, a distant member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that is homologous to the Aplysia memory suppressor gene ApCREB-2. Consistent with the removal of inhibitory constraints on transcription, we find an increase in the pattern of gene transcripts in the hippocampus of EGFP-AZIP transgenic mice and both a reversibly enhanced hippocampal-based spatial memory and LTP. These results suggest that several proteins within the C/EBP family including ATF4 (CREB-2) act to constrain long-term synaptic changes and memory formation. Relief of this inhibition lowers the threshold for hippocampal-dependent long-term synaptic potentiation and memory storage in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2124953223,"Eye movements are often influenced by expectation of reward. Using a memory-guided saccade task with an asymmetric reward schedule, we show that visual responses of monkey SC neurons increase when the visual stimulus indicates an upcoming reward. The increase occurred in two distinct manners: (1) reactively, as an increase in the gain of the visual response when the stimulus indicated an upcoming reward; (2) proactively, as an increase in anticipatory activity when reward was expected in the neuron's response field. These effects were observed mostly in saccade-related SC neurons in the deeper layer which would receive inputs from the cortical eye fields and the basal ganglia. These results, together with recent findings, suggest that the gain modulation may be determined by the inputs from both the cortical eye fields and the basal ganglia, whereas the anticipatory bias may be derived mainly from the basal ganglia."

https://openalex.org/W1971697848,"Febrile (fever-induced) seizures are the most common form of childhood seizures, affecting 3%-5% of infants and young children. Here we show that the activity-dependent, retrograde inhibition of GABA release by endogenous cannabinoids is persistently enhanced in the rat hippocampus following a single episode of experimental prolonged febrile seizures during early postnatal development. The potentiation of endocannabinoid signaling results from an increase in the number of presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors associated with cholecystokinin-containing perisomatic inhibitory inputs, without an effect on the endocannabinoid-mediated inhibition of glutamate release. These results demonstrate a selective, long-term increase in the gain of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling at GABAergic synapses in a model of a human neurological disease."

The mechanism of this toxicity is contentious.

Although there is a poor correlation between the density of deposits and the severity of the disease, a correlation is found between the levels of soluble Aβ and synaptic damage and cognitive impairment (3McLean C.A.

The cause of the observed oxidative stress has been debated with a number of possible mechanisms postulated. These include deficits in calcium regulation, brought about by either the formation in cell membranes of calcium channels (11Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A common factor in most proposed mechanisms of Aβ toxicity is the oligomerization of Aβ, whether as dimers or trimers (14Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J.

The generation of ROS usually requires the reaction of O2 with a redox metal ion such as Cu2+ or Fe3+. When Aβ binds Cu2+ and Fe3+ extensive redox chemical reactions take place, reducing the oxidation state of either metal and producing H2O2 from O2 in a catalytic manner (19Huang X. Cuajungco M.P.

Both zinc and copper are released into the synaptic cleft (300 μm for zinc, 30 μm for copper), and markedly elevated levels of copper (400 μm), zinc (1 mm), and iron (1 mm) are found in amyloid deposits in AD-affected brains (23Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D.

The oxidative stress observed in AD may be a consequence of the production of ROS by metal-bound forms of Aβ. The observation that senile plaques isolated from AD brains generated ROS in a manner dependent upon copper and iron (22Opazo C. Huang X. Cherny R.A. Moir R.D. Roher A.E. White A.R. Cappai R.

The ability of Aβ to coordinate and reduce copper in vitro must result in the peptide being oxidized. Indeed, mass spectrometry has shown that copper complexes were able to oxygenate Aβ, with the most likely site of oxidation being the sulfur atom of Met-35 (26Nishino S. Nishida Y. Inorg. Chem. Commun. 2001; 4: 86-89Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides with the sulfur of Met-35 oxidized (hereafter referred to as Met(O)Aβ) have been isolated from AD amyloid brain deposits (27Naslund J. Schierhorn A. Hellman U. Lannfelt L. Roses A.D.

Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) have recently shown in a Raman spectroscopic study of senile plaque cores isolated from diseased brains that much of the Aβ in these deposits contained methionine sulfoxide and that copper and zinc were coordinated to the histidine residues. The importance of metal ions to the pathogenesis of AD is highlighted by our observation that the amount of Aβ deposition in a transgenic mouse expressing amyloidogenic human Aβ was substantially decreased by treating the mice with an orally available metal chelator (clioquinol) capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (30Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The significance of this result has been further highlighted by the successful conclusion of a phase II clinical trial that showed that clioquinol inhibited cognitive decline in moderate to severe AD patients (31Ritchie, C. W., Bush, A. I., Mackinnon, A., Macfarlane, S., Mastwyk, M., MacGregor, L., Kiers, L., Cherny, R. A., Li, Q.-X., Tammer, A., Carrington, D., Mavros, C., Volitakis, I., Xilinas, M., Ames, D., Davis, S., Beyreuther, K., Tanzi, R. E., and Masters, C. L. (2003) Arch. Neurol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Recently, the importance of Zn2+ in plaque formation has been emphasized by the finding that age- and female sex-related plaque formation in APP2576 transgenic mice was greatly reduced upon the genetic ablation of the zinc transporter 3 protein, which is required for zinc transport into synaptic vesicles (32Lee J.Y.

An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis to explain Aβ neurotoxicity is based on Aβ interacting with membranes and/or membrane proteins. Given that the Aβ peptide contains part of the putative transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein, it is not surprising that the peptide interacts with cell membranes and lipoproteins. Numerous reports have described the effects of Aβ on membranes and lipid systems and their possible roles in Aβ neurotoxicity (33Kourie J.I. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 173-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our previous studies (34Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L.

Met-35 has been reported to play a key role in the toxicity of Aβ, because Aβ peptides with Met-35 replaced by either norleucine or Cys are non-toxic and unable to induce oxidative stress responses in cells (36Varadarajan S. Yatin S. Kanski J. Jahanshahi F. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. Bull. 1999; 50: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides with an oxidized methionine have also been reported to be non-toxic (37Varadarajan S. Kanski J. Aksenova M. Lauderback C. Butterfield D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5625-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We have shown that when Met-35 is either missing, as in Aβ1–28, or sequestered within a lipid environment and, therefore, not available as a co-factor, there is no metal reduction and hence no conditions for Fenton chemistry (34Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In addition to ameliorating the toxic behavior of Aβ, the oxidation of Met-35 also alters the physical properties of the peptide. Met(O)Aβ is more soluble in aqueous solution, and there is a disruption of the local helical structure when the peptide is dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles (38Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12700-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The oxidation of Met-35 also affects the aggregation properties of the peptide leading to a different oligomerization profile with the formation of trimers and tetramers significantly attenuated (39Palmblad M. Westlind-Danielsson A. Bergquist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19506-19510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and inhibition of fibril formation (40Hou L. Kang I. Marchant R.E. Zagorski M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40173-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Given that the Met(O)Aβ peptide is abundant in the brains of AD patients (27Naslund J. Schierhorn A. Hellman U. Lannfelt L. Roses A.D. Tjernberg L.O. Silberring J. Gandy S.E. Winblad B. Greengard P.

Siedlak S.L. Smith M.A. Perry G. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we examined the peptide's interactions with lipid vesicles and the ability of Met(O)Aβ to produce hydrogen peroxide and correlated these results with the peptide's toxicity in neuronal cell cultures. In this study we show by solid-state NMR that when Aβ binds and reduces Cu2+ to Cu+ the Met-35 residue becomes oxidized. Our results show that, like the native peptide the oxidized peptide will bind copper and produce H2O2 but the interactions of Met(O)Aβ with lipids are markedly altered. Importantly, Met(O)Aβ is toxic to neuronal cell cultures, via a toxicity that is rescued by catalase and the metal chelator clioquinol. This finding has profound implications for the mechanism(s) of Aβ toxicity. The acidic phospholipid spin label 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxystearyl)-phosphatidylserine was synthesized according to Hubbell and McConnell (41Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The water-soluble spin label TEMPO choline chloride was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. All spin probes were checked for purity and to ensure that their number of spins/mol were >90% of theory (42Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Advances in Membrane Fluidity 1: Methods for Studying Membrane Fluidity. Alan R. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar). Synthetic palmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) was purchased from Sigma, and palmitoyl phosphatidyl serine (POPS) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. LUV were prepared by dissolving equal quantities of POPS and POPC in chloroform, which was then evaporated off. The lipids were then dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Some glass beads were added, and the mixture was shaken for 1 h at 37 °C. The solution was decanted from the glass beads and subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. The lipids were then extruded 11 times through a 0.2-μm pore filter from Millipore, using an Avanti mini-extruder apparatus. LUV were stored at 4 °C and used within 48 h of preparation as described by Hope et al. (43Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Peptides as a freeze-dried powder were added to the desired concentration to a suspension of LUV in buffer, and the mixture was vortexed under N2 for 10 min at 305 K in polypropylene tubes. One hundred millimolar stock solutions of analytical reagent grade CuCl2 were prepared, and the desired amount was added to the LUV after the peptide. For copper EPR measurements 99.99% pure 65Cu (Cambridge Isotopes) was used. Metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Uptake of peptide by the LUV was estimated by density gradient centrifugation in Metrizamide™ (Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway)-Tris buffer (pH 7.0, 0.05 m) as described by Cornell et al. (44Cornell B. Separovic F. Baldassi A. Smith R. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and then measuring the extinction at 210 nm of the sub-phase. The protein concentration was estimated by using an extinction coefficient, E 1 cm1%, of 204 at 210 nm (45Tombs M.P. Souter F. Maclagan N.F. Biochem. J. 1959; 73: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was found that 10–15% of the added peptide was not taken up by the LUV. Peptides not synthesized were obtained from the W. M. Keck Laboratory, Yale University. Synthesis of Met(O)Aβ40 —The peptide was prepared by continuous flow Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis as described previously (46Tickler A.K. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D.

Following global cleavage and deprotection in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/H2O/ethanedithiol/triethylsilane (94:2.5:2.5:1, v/v, 10 ml), the crude lyophilized Aβ40 was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. Met(O)Aβ40 was prepared from this by dissolving the crude peptide (21 mg) in 0.1% aqueous TFA solution (10 ml), and 1-ml aliquots were reacted with hydrogen peroxide (250 μl) for 10 min at room temperature (47Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Wade J.D. J. Chem. Soc. Chem Commun. 1983; : 1060-1062Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) after which these were immediately purified by RP-HPLC and lyophilized. Analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (MH+ found: 4345, expected 4345), and amino acid analysis showed good correlation with expected values. Synthesis of Met(O)Aβ42—Met(O)Aβ42 was synthesized as described above with the exception that Met-35 was incorporated as the Nα-Fmoc-Met sulfoxide form. Following cleavage and side chain deprotection, the crude peptide was purified by RP-HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF MS (MH+ found: 4530.4, expected 4530.1). Amino acid analysis also showed good correlation with expected values. Peptide Characterization—RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters (Milford) instrument controlled by Millennium software equipped with photo-diode array detection. The solvent system used throughout this study was Buffer A (0.1% aqueous solution, TFA) and Buffer B (0.1% TFA/CH3CN). Semi-preparative RP-HPLC was performed using a Vydac polymer reversed phase column (10 × 250 mm, 8 μm, 300 Å) (Hesperia), at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using a 10–60% linear gradient of CH3CN over 30 min. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, samples were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix and examined using a Bruker BIFLEX instrument (Bremen, Germany) in linear mode at 19.5 kV or reflector mode at 19.5, 20 kV gradient reflector. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed on Fmoc-derivatized hydrolysates carried out on a GBC automatic analyzer (Melbourne, Australia) equipped with an ODS HYPERSIL reversed phase column (Runcorn, United Kingdom) and an LC 1250 fluorescence detector. Synthesis of t-Butoxycarbonyl-13C-Met(O)-OH—2-t-Butylcarbonyloximino-2-phenylacetonitrile (BocON; 1.8 g, 7.3 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 13C-labeled glycine (0.5 g, 6.7 mmol) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) and triethylamine (1.4 ml, 10 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of dioxin and water (8 ml). After stirring for 2 h at room temperature water (10 ml) and ethyl acetate (13 ml) were added, and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with additional ethyl acetate. The organic layer was then acidified with 5% citric acid, and the precipitate was washed with water and dried. (yield 85%, melting point 86.5–87.5 °C). A suspension of 13C-labeled methionine (1 g, 6.7 mmol) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) was stirred in water (3.3 ml), and hydrogen peroxide (0.7 ml of 30% solution) was added slowly with cooling. After 1 h at room temperature absolute ethanol was added, and the crystals were filtered and air-dried (yield 80%, melting point 252–254 °C). 13C-Met(O) was then reacted as above to give t-butoxycarbonyl-13C-Met(O) in 70% yield. Synthesis of Aβ39 with 13C Labels at C α of Gly-9, Gly-25, and Gly-33 and C ϵ of Met-35— 13C Gly-9, Gly-25, Gly-33, and 13C Met-35-Aβ39 was synthesized on solid phase in an automated manner using a model 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Japan, Inc.) using a conventional t-butoxycarbonyl strategy and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase resin. 13C amino acids were loaded into the appropriate cartridges, and the synthesis was performed using a method described previously (48Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR experiments were conducted on a Varian Inova 300 spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA), operating at 75 MHz for 13C. Acquisition and processing of data was performed using Varian software. The acquisition parameters used for 13C cross-polarization (CP) magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR (49Pines A. Gibby M.G. Waugh J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 569-590Crossref Scopus (2352) Google Scholar) were as follows: proton π/2 pulse 4 μs, recycle delay 1 s, contact time 1 ms, sweep width 30 kHz, 4096 transients, and MAS speed ∼7000 Hz and were processed using 50-Hz line broadening. Chemical shifts were referenced to 0 ppm for an external tetramethylsilane sample Spectra were obtained on 13C-labeled Aβ39. To ascertain the effect of adding copper to Aβ peptides the following protocol was used: 5 mg of the reduced form of Aβ39 was dissolved in a small amount of TFA followed by addition of 1 ml of H2O and then a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide. 52 μl (1mmol) of 50 mm Cu(Gly)2 solution was then added to the Aβ39 peptide and left at room temperature for 3 days. Spectra were acquired on the precipitate that was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with MilliQ water, and lyophilized overnight. Continuous-wave X-band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller and flowthrough cryostat. 65Cu2+ spectra were collected at 110 K from samples contained in 4-mm inner diameter “Suprasil” quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad). To eliminate the possibility that any line broadening observed in the spectra might be because of freezing-induced localized concentrations of sample 10% glycerol was added to aqueous peptide buffer solutions. Labeled lipid samples (25 μl) were contained in 0.8-mm inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad) and handled as described by Gordon and Curtain (42Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Advances in Membrane Fluidity 1: Methods for Studying Membrane Fluidity. Alan R. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar) to ensure reproducibility. Other details, including the use of the non-membrane penetrant spin label Tempo choline chloride as an internal reference, have been given in Curtain et al. (34Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I.

CD spectra of peptides in the LUV were obtained using a CD spectropolarimeter model 62DS (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ). Peptide concentrations were determined using the molar extinction of the UV absorption from the tyrosine residue. The CD spectrum was obtained for each solution both neat and after a 1:4 dilution with MilliQ® water. CD spectra were obtained using a 1 mm-path length quartz cell, acquired at 297 K in 0.5-nm steps over a 185- to 250-nm wavelength range. H2O2 production by Aβ peptides was measured using a fluorimetric assay. 5 mm of the fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) (Sigma) in argon-purged Me2SO was deacetylated with 0.025 m NaOH (BDH) for 30 min, diluted to 1 mm with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma), and neutralized to pH 7.5. Aβ peptides (100 μm) preincubated with Cu(Gly)22+ (BDH) in a 1:2 molar ratio were incubated in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 1 h with 5 μm dopamine (Sigma), 100 μm DCF, and 100 mm horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in a final volume of 250 μl with PBS. Known standards of H2O2 were used to quantitate the signal. Fluorescence was measured in a Wallac Victor2 fluorimeter at 485-nm excitation and 535-nm emission. The mean and standard deviations of triplicate samples were calculated and compared. Aβ42 and Met(O)Aβ42 peptide stocks were prepared by initially weighing out peptide and determining a theoretical 200 μm concentration by weight, dissolving the peptide in 20 mm NaOH, then rapidly diluting out in water and 10× PBS in a ratio of 2:7:1. All Aβ peptide solutions were sonicated in a water bath for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at high speed, and the was supernatant used for the toxicity experiments. The final concentration of the peptides were further quantified according to procedures outlined by Huang et al. (19Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J.D. Hanson G.R.

Briefly, the absorbance value at A 214 was measured using a UV spectrophotometer for the Aβ preparations, and the protein concentration was determined from BCA standard curves. This method of Aβ preparation was found to be associated with increased solubility of the peptides. Clioquinol was purchased from Sigma. Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (22Opazo C. Huang X. Cherny R.A. Moir R.D. Roher A.E. White A.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Inestrosa N.C. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, embryonic day 14 BL6Jx129sv mouse cortices were removed, dissected free of meninges, and dissociated in 0.025% (w/v) trypsin. Dissociated cells were plated in poly-llysine-coated sterile 48-well culture plates at a density of 125,000 cells/cm2 in plating medium (minimum Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum/5% horse serum). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h before the plating medium was replaced with Neurobasal growth medium containing B27 supplements. This method resulted in cultures highly enriched for neurons. After 5–6 days in culture, the medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 lacking antioxidants for treatment. For the treatment of neuronal cultures, fresh soluble Aβ stock solutions were diluted to a final concentration of 6 μm in Neurobasal medium. Inhibition of neurot"
https://openalex.org/W2118098860,"Liprin-α/SYD-2 is a family of multidomain proteins with four known isoforms. One of the reported functions of liprin-α is to regulate the development of presynaptic active zones, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we report that liprin-α directly interacts with the ERC (ELKS-Rab6-interacting protein-CAST) family of proteins, members of which are known to bind RIMs, the active zone proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release. In vitro results indicate that ERC2/CAST, an active zone-specific isoform, interacts with all of the known isoforms of liprin-α and that liprin-α1 associates with both ERC2 and ERC1b, a splice variant of ERC1 that distributes to both cytosolic and active zone regions. ERC2 colocalizes with liprin-α1 in cultured neurons and forms a complex with liprin-α1 in brain. Liprin-α1, when expressed alone in cultured neurons, shows a partial synaptic localization. When coexpressed with ERC2, however, liprin-α1 is redistributed to synaptic sites. Moreover, roughly the first half of ERC2, which contains the liprin-α-binding region, is sufficient for the synaptic localization of liprin-α1 while the second half is not. These results suggest that the interaction between ERC2 and liprin-α may be involved in the presynaptic localization of liprin-α and the molecular organization of presynaptic active zones.

These results suggest that the interaction between ERC2 and liprin-α may be involved in the presynaptic localization of liprin-α and the molecular organization of presynaptic active zones. The active zone is a specialized presynaptic plasma membrane region where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse. The cytoskeletal matrix assembled at active zones (CAZ) 1The abbreviations used are: CAZ, cytoskeletal matrix assembled at active zones; aa, amino acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DIV, days in vitro. is a complex proteinaceous structure implicated in the organization of the site of neurotransmitter release (1Garner C.C.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 94-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the CAZ is formed and maintained. Liprin-α is a family of multidomain proteins with four known isoforms (3Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Liprin-α was originally isolated as a binding partner of the LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (3Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The presynaptic function of liprin-α was first demonstrated by a study on syd-2 (for synapse-defective), a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of liprin-α (5Zhen M. Jin Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Deletion of syd-2 was found to result in the lengthening of the presynaptic active zones and impaired synaptic transmission (5Zhen M. Jin Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the Dliprin-α gene, a Drosophila homolog of liprin-α, led to changes in the size and shape of active zones (6Kaufmann N. DeProto J. Ranjan R. Wan H. Van Vactor D. Neuron. 2002; 34: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), suggesting that liprin-α regulates the formation and/or maintenance of presynaptic active zones. However, the question remains as to how liprin-α regulates presynaptic development. Previous results suggest that the three following mechanisms may be involved. First, liprin-α associates with active zone components. Liprin-α directly interacts with RIMs (7Schoch S. Castillo P.E. Jo T. Mukherjee K. Geppert M. Wang Y. Schmitz F. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), active zone proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release (8Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Second, liprin-α may regulate membrane traffic at the active zone. In support of this hypothesis, liprin-α distributes to both cytosolic and active zone regions (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wyszynski M. Kim E. Dunah A.W. Passafaro M. Valtschanoff J.G. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 39-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ARFs that are negatively modulated by liprin-α-binding GITs are expressed in neurons (17Hernandez-Deviez D.J. Casanova J.E. Wilson J.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 623-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and are known to regulate membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton (18Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Third, we recently reported that liprin-α associates with KIF1A (19Shin H. Wyszynski M. Huh K.H. Valtschanoff J.G. Lee J.R. Ko J. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11393-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a neuronal kinesin motor protein (20Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that liprin-α may be involved in the KIF1A-mediated long range transport of active zone components in neurons. However, additional data may be needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the liprin-α-dependent regulation of presynaptic development. Recently, a novel family of active zone proteins termed ERC (ELKS-Rab6-interacting protein-CAST) with two known members (ERC1 and ERC2/CAST) was identified as a binding partner of RIMs (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 25: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There are two known splice variants of ERC1 that differ at their C termini (ubiquitous ERC1a and brain-specific ERC1b), whereas no splice variants are known for the brain-specific ERC2 (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, ERC1b and ERC2 show different subcellular distribution patterns in neurons. ERC1b is expressed as a cytosolic protein as well as an active zone component, whereas ERC2 is an active zone-specific protein (22Wang Y. Liu X. Biederer T. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, both ERC1b and ERC2 share a common motif at their C termini (the class II PDZ domain binding motif) through which they interact with the PDZ domain of RIMs (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Functionally, a RIM1 mutant lacking the PDZ domain showed a reduced presynaptic targeting in cultured neurons, suggesting that ERC2 may play a role in the presynaptic localization of RIM1 (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, ERC1 interacts with Rab6 (22Wang Y. Liu X. Biederer T. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Monier S. Jollivet F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Johannes L. Goud B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a small GTPase that is implicated in the regulation of post-Golgi membrane traffic in neurons (25Tixier-Vidal A. Barret A. Picart R. Mayau V. Vogt D. Wiedenmann B. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 935-947PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ERCs may regulate membrane traffic at the active zone. However, other than their association with RIMs, little is known of the role of ERCs in the organization of the active zone. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that ERCs associate with liprin-α and we demonstrate that active zone-specific ERC2 promotes the synaptic accumulation of liprin-α in cultured neurons. These results suggest that the ERC-liprin-α interaction is involved in the presynaptic localization of liprin-α, active zone assembly, and perhaps in the regulation of membrane traffic at the active zone.

GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and Coclustering Assays in Heterologous Cells—For GST fusion proteins, the following regions of liprin-α were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences): liprin-α1 (aa 351-512, 513-673, and 351-673, BamHI and EcoRI); liprin-α2 (aa 369-696, XhoI-EcoRI); liprin-α3 (aa 333-645, EcoRI); and liprin-α4 (the region corresponding to aa 351-673 of liprin-α1, BamHI-EcoRI). For hexahistidine fusion proteins containing ERC2, aa 1-957 and aa 725-957 of ERC2 were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pET32a (Novagen) and pRSETB (Invitrogen), respectively. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (12Kim S. Ko J. Shin H. Lee J.R. Lim C. Han J.H. Altrock W.D. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Premont R.T. Kaang B.K. Kim E. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation, lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP-ERC2 and/or HA-liprin-α1 constructs were extracted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitated with HA (3 μg/ml) or EGFP (1173, 3 μg/ml) antibodies, and immunoblotted with EGFP (1167, 1 μg/ml) and HA (1 μg/ml) antibodies. Coclustering assay was performed as described previously (26Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation in Rat Brain—In vivo coimmunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (32Wyszynski M. Valtschanoff J.G. Naisbitt S. Dunah A.W. Kim E. Standaert D.G. Weinberg R. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6528-6537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxycholate extracts of the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain were immunoprecipitated with liprin-α1 (1288, 5 μg/ml), ERC2 (1292, 5 μg/ml) or ERC2 (1296, 5 μg/ml), and rabbit or guinea pig IgG (5 μg/ml) antibodies. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates was performed using the following antibodies: liprin-α1 (1288, 1 μg/ml); ERC2 (1292, 1 μg/ml); GIT1 (1:2000); GRIP2 (1 μg/ml); RIM (1 μg/ml); GKAP (1 μg/ml); and PSD-95 (1:1000). Neuron Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic (E18) rat brain as described previously (33Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 339-370Google Scholar). For double immunofluorescence staining, cultured neurons were incubated with combinations of ERC2 (1292; 1 μg/ml), liprin-α1 (1288) and liprin-α1 (1290, 2 μg/ml), Shank (3856, 1:300), and Piccolo (1203, 1 μg/ml) antibodies followed by Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). For targeting experiments, neurons were transfected at 5 days in vitro (DIV) using mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). Two days after transfection (DIV 7), neurons were fixed with cold 100% methanol for 15 min and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% horse serum, 0.1% crystalline grade BSA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The following antibodies were used for the immunocytochemistry of transfected neurons: EGFP (1173, 1 μg/ml), HA (1 μg/ml), Piccolo (1203, 1 μg/ml), and ERC2 (1292, 1 μg/ml). Image Acquisition and Quantitative Analysis—Fluorescent images were acquired using confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Zeiss) and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). The image acquisition settings were kept constant during scanning. Images of distal thin neurites of cultured neurons from 3 to 10 independent experiments were captured for analysis. In image analysis, clusters were defined as discrete regions of immunoreactivity with an average fluorescence intensity at least 10-fold higher than that in background regions. Non-discrete regions were excluded from quantitative analysis. Colocalization between two puncta was defined as an overlap of >50% of each region, and colocalization analyses were performed blind. Approximately, 30-50 clusters were analyzed per cell and average values from each of the cells were used to obtain final mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test. Characterization of the Interaction between ERC and Liprin-α by a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—In a yeast two-hybrid screen (one million colonies) of a human brain cDNA library using liprin-α4 as bait, we obtained a fragment of ERC2/CAST containing roughly the first half of the protein (aa 34-535; full-length is 957 aa). The minimal liprin-α-binding region in ERC2 was narrowed down to aa 118-535 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, the minimal ERC-binding region in liprin-α1 was aa 351-602 (Fig. 1B), which is distinct from the minimal GIT1-binding region (aa 603-673; Fig. 1B) and the reported RIM-binding region (aa 200-350) in liprin-α1 (7Schoch S. Castillo P.E. Jo T. Mukherjee K. Geppert M. Wang Y. Schmitz F. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the minimal GIT1-binding region in liprin-α1 (aa 603-673) was further narrowed down in this study from the one that we previously reported (aa 513-673) (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERC2 interacted with all of the known liprin-α family members (liprin-α1, liprin-α2, liprin-α3, and liprin-α4) (Fig. 1C). ERC and Liprin-α Colocalize in Cultured Neurons and Heterologous Cells—To study ERC and liprin-α proteins in vivo, we generated ERC and liprin-α polyclonal antibodies against regions of ERC2 (aa 427-698, 1292 rabbit and 1296 guinea pig; aa 725-957, 1284 rabbit) and liprin-α1 (aa 513-673, 1288 rabbit and 1290 guinea pig) (Fig. 1, A and B). The 1292, 1296, and 1284 ERC2 antibodies reacted much more strongly with ERC2 than ERC1, whereas the 1288 and 1290 liprin-α1 antibodies reacted specifically with liprin-α1 rather than liprin-α2 in immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). In brain, these antibodies recognized a single band of ERC2 and liprin-α1 whose apparent molecular weight matched that of these proteins expressed in heterologous cells (Fig. 2, C and D). In immunofluorescence staining of cultured hippocampal neurons at 21 DIV, ERC2 showed a punctate distribution pattern and the majority of the ERC2 puncta colocalized with those of Piccolo, a presynaptic marker protein (Fig. 2E). This finding suggests that ERC2 mainly distributes to synaptic sites and is consistent with the reported ultrastructural localization of ERC2 at active zones and the colocalization of ERC2 with other presynaptic marker proteins including Bassoon, RIM, and synapsin (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In parallel immunohistochemical analyses, liprin-α1 exhibited a similar punctate distribution pattern, but only a portion of the liprin-α1 puncta colocalized with those of Piccolo (Fig. 2F). This finding suggests that liprin-α1 is partially synaptic, a result that is consistent with previous reports (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wyszynski M. Kim E. Dunah A.W. Passafaro M. Valtschanoff J.G. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 39-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In double-labeled immunofluorescence staining assays of cultured neurons, ERC2 often colocalized with liprin-α1 at various subcellular sites (probably presynaptic sites) of mature neurons (DIV 21, Fig. 3A). Previously, ERC2 and liprin-α (liprin-α1 and liprin-α2) have been shown to distribute to small puncta in the growth cones of young cultured neurons (DIV 2-4) (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H.

Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When tested for their colocalization in young cultured neurons (DIV 2) in our experiments, both proteins were detected in a large number of puncta within the growth cones and some of the ERC2 puncta clearly colocalized with liprin-α1 puncta (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that ERC2 and liprin-α1 colocalize in vivo. In heterologous cells, singly expressed liprin-α1 was diffusely distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 3C), whereas ERC2 formed intracellular aggregates (Fig. 3D), which extensively colocalized with BiP, a marker protein for the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). When both proteins were coexpressed, a significant portion of liprin-α1 was redistributed to and colocalized with ERC2 aggregates (Fig. 3E). These results further suggest that ERC associates with liprin-α. ERC Forms a Complex with Liprin-α in Vitro and in Vivo—We tested for the interaction between ERC and liprin-α in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4A-D). GST fusion proteins containing liprin-α isoforms (liprin-α1, liprin-α2, liprin-α3, and liprin-α4) pulled down ERC2 expressed in heterologous cells (Fig. 4A). GST-liprin-α1 (aa 351-673) containing the minimal ERC-binding region but not the control GST fusion proteins brought down ERC2 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, GST-liprin-α1 pulled down all of the deletion variants of ERC2 that contain the minimal liprin-α-binding region (Fig. 4C), consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, GST-liprin-α1 (aa 351-673) brought down hexahistidine (H6)-tagged ERC2 full-length (aa 1-957) but not H6-ERC2 (aa 725-957) lacking the liprin-α-binding region (Fig. 4D), suggesting that ERC directly interacts with liprin-α. In doubly transfected HEK293T cells, liprin-α1 formed a complex with the deletion variants of ERC2 that contain the minimal liprin-α-binding region (full-length, aa 1-954, and aa 1-693) but not with ERC2 (aa 773-957) (Fig. 4, E-I). In addition to liprin-α1, liprin-α2 formed a complex with ERC2 (Fig. 4J) and liprin-α1 formed a complex with ERC1 in addition to ERC2 (Fig. 4K). These results along with the yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down results (Figs. 1C and 4A) suggest that the ERC family proteins (ERC1 and ERC2) interact with all of the known members of the liprin-α family. From the lysates of the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain, liprin-α1 (1288) antibodies brought down liprin-α1 and coprecipitated ERC2 and other liprin-α1-associated proteins including GIT1 and GRIP2 but not GKAP and PSD-95 (Fig. 4L). In addition, ERC2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated liprin-α1, GIT1, GRIP2, and RIM but not PSD-95 and GKAP (Fig. 4, L and M). These results suggest that ERC and liprin-α form a complex in vivo. Overexpression of ERC2 Increases the Synaptic Levels of Liprin-α1 in Cultured Neurons—It has been reported that ERC2 plays a role in the presynaptic localization of RIM1 (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether ERC2 is also involved in the presynaptic localization of liprin-α. To this end, we first determined the subcellular distribution of ERC2 and liprin-α1 in cultured neurons. When expressed alone in cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV 7), EGFP-tagged ERC2 (EGFP-ERC2) showed a punctate distribution pattern along the length of neurites and EGFP-ERC2 clusters colocalized well with endogenous Piccolo (Piccolo-positive EGFP-ERC2 clusters = 97.5 ± 1.4%, n = 10 cells; EGFP-ERC2-positive Piccolo clusters = 69.4 ± 3.1%, n = 23, 1271 clusters, Fig. 5A). This finding suggests that despite the ∼5.5-fold higher expression level of EGFP-ERC2 compared with that of endogenous ERC2 (determined by comparison of immunofluorescence intensity, data not shown), EGFP-ERC2 mainly distributes to synaptic sites, similar to the distribution pattern of endogenous ERC2 (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Liu X. Biederer T. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). HA-tagged liprin-α1 (HA-liprin-α1) expressed alone in cultured neurons also showed a punctate distribution pattern, but each liprin-α1 cluster was often indiscrete and had an elongated shape. In addition, liprin-α1 clusters only partially colocalized with endogenous ERC2 or Piccolo clusters (Fig. 5B, an example of double staining for HA-liprin-α1 and ERC2). In quantitative analysis, only 20.7 ± 2.4% (n = 17) of ERC2 clusters and 10.1 ± 2.0% Piccolo clusters (n = 15) were HA-liprin-α1-positive. Measurement of the percentage of ERC2- or Piccolo-positive HA-liprin-α1 clusters was not attempted because liprin-α1 often formed indiscrete clusters along the length of neurites. These results suggest that HA-liprin-α1 is partially synaptic, similar to the distribution pattern of endogenous liprin-α1 (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wyszynski M. Kim E. Dunah A.W. Passafaro M. Valtschanoff J.G. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 39-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We then determined the subcellular distribution of EGFP-ERC2 and HA-liprin-α1 coexpressed in cultured neurons. Intriguingly, HA-liprin-α1 showed a prominent colocalization with EGFP-ERC2 clusters (liprin-α1-positive ERC2 clusters = 90.8 ± 2.6%, n = 17, Fig. 5C; quantitation summarized in Fig. 5J). These results indicate that the synaptic localization of liprin-α1 is increased by ERC2 coexpression. To determine the regions of ERC2 that promote synaptic localization of liprin-α1, we employed deletion variants of EGFP-ERC2 (aa 1-954, 1-693, and 773-957; schematic diagrams shown in Fig. 4C). We first tested whether these variants are localized to synaptic sites by themselves. When compared with the full-length ERC2 (97.5% synaptic localization), ERC2 aa 1-954 and 1-693 showed a slightly reduced but still significant synaptic localization (83.2 ± 3.1% (n = 16) and 79.4 ± 4.2% (n = 8) of their clusters, respectively, were Piccolo-positive), whereas aa 773-957 of ERC2 showed a mainly diffuse distribution, similar to the previous results (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, D-F; see quantitation in Fig. 5K). When tested for their ability to enhance liprin-α1 targeting, ERC2 (aa 1-954 and 1-693 but not aa 773-957) promoted the synaptic localization of liprin-α1 (91.0 ± 2.4% (n = 10) and 89.8 ± 4.3% (n = 7) of ERC clusters, respectively, were HA-liprin-α1-positive in Fig. 5, G-I; see quantitation in Fig. 5L), similar to that induced by full-length ERC2 (90.8 ± 2.6%). These results suggest that roughly the N-terminal half of ERC2 (aa 1-693) plays a major role in promoting the synaptic localization of liprin-α1. Functions of the Interaction between ERC and Liprin-α—Our in vitro data indicate that both ERC isoforms (ERC1b and ERC2) associate with liprin-α1 and that ERC2 associates with all of the known isoforms of liprin-α (Figs. 1 and 4). Different ERC isoforms show different subcellular distribution patterns. ERC1b distributes to both cytosolic and active zone regions while ERC2 localizes to active zones (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similar to ERC1b, liprin-α distributes to both synaptic and nonsynaptic sites (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14464-14469Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although the detailed subcellular distribution patterns of the four known liprin-α isoforms remain largely unknown. In characterizing the in vivo association of ERC and liprin-α in this study, we used antibodies against a subset of all of the known isoforms, namely ERC2 and liprin-α1. Therefore, the in vivo colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of ERC2 and liprin-α1 revealed in this study (Figs. 3 and 4) may represent only a small fraction of the in vivo associations that may occur in various other subcellular compartments. The generation of additional isoform-specific antibodies will allow a more systematic analysis of their in vivo association in future studies. However, we may speculate on the functions of the ERC-liprin-α interaction observed in this study. Our data indicate that the synaptic levels of liprin-α1 are markedly increased by coexpression of ERC2 in cultured neurons (Fig. 5) and that this enhancement is mediated by the N-terminal half of ERC2 (Fig. 5), which contains the minimal liprin-α-binding region (Fig. 1). A simple interpretation of these results is that ERC2, through its interaction with liprin-α1, may recruit liprin-α1 to presynaptic active zones. However, this may not represent a physiological situation because it is not known whether the presynaptic levels of ERC2 are dynamically regulated. A more plausible hypothesis is that ERC2 may be involved in the stabilization of liprin-α at the presynaptic active zone, although further details remain to be determined. In the case of ERC1b, its association with liprin-α is likely to occur both in the cytosol and the active zone. At the active zone, ERC1b may be involved in the presynaptic stabilization of liprin-α in a manner similar to that hypothesized for ERC2. It is also possible that the ERC-liprin-α interaction may be involved in the regulation of membrane traffic at the active zone. Recent results have indicated that presynaptic active zones are formed by the insertion of preassembled active zone precursor vesicles into the presynaptic plasma membrane (34Shapira M. Zhai R.G.

Buchanan J. Smith S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that ERC may associate with liprin-α on the surface of cytosolic precursor vesicles and that the ERC-liprin-α interaction may play a role in the surface delivery of these vesicles. This is supported by the observation that ERC1 binds to Rab6 (23Monier S. Jollivet F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Johannes L. Goud B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a small GTPase implicated in the regulation of post-Golgi traffic in neurons (25Tixier-Vidal A. Barret A. Picart R. Mayau V. Vogt D. Wiedenmann B. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 935-947PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, liprin-α is linked to ARFs, small GTPases known to regulate membrane traffic (18Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) through GITs (10Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, an interesting possibility is that the interaction between ERC and liprin-α may mediate the integration of the Rab6 and ARF signaling pathways for the regulation of membrane traffic. And finally, the ERC-liprin-α interaction may assist in a kinesin-mediated neuronal transport. We recently reported that the KIF1A kinesin motor associates with liprin-α and liprin-α-interacting RIMs, which suggests the possibility that liprin-α links KIF1A to cargo vesicles containing various liprin-α-binding proteins including RIMs and ERCs (19Shin H. Wyszynski M. Huh K.H. Valtschanoff J.G. Lee J.R. Ko J. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11393-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by immunohistochemical studies on cultured neurons that have indicated that both ERC1b and liprin-α are detected in neuronal cell bodies in addition to synaptic sites (16Wyszynski M.

ERC2 colocalizes with liprin-α1 in fine puncta in growth cones of young neurons (Fig. 3B), which are thought to represent active zone precursor vesicles (34Shapira M. Zhai R.G. Dresbach T. Bresler T.

In addition, ERC2 and RIM1 are detected in vesicles immunoisolated with antibodies against Bassoon (a good marker of active zone precursor vesicles) (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ERC-Liprin-α Interaction and Organization of the CAZ—The interaction of liprin-α with RIMs is mediated by a region of liprin-α (aa 200-350 in liprin-α1) that is distinct from the ERC-binding region (aa 351-602, Fig. 1) and that associates with the C2B domain of RIMs (7Schoch S.

This finding suggests that ERC2, in addition to its direct interaction with the PDZ domain of RIMs through its C terminus, is indirectly linked to RIMs through liprin-α. Although the function of this tripartite interaction remains to be determined, one possibility is that ERC may employ two distinct molecular mechanisms, direct and indirect, to ensure the synaptic accumulation of RIMs, which are important regulators of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic long-term potentiation (7Schoch S.

In support of the role of liprin-α in the ERC-dependent synaptic localization of RIMs, we note that the RIM1 mutant lacking the PDZ domain shows some (although mainly diffuse) synaptic localization in cultured neurons (21Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting that regions of RIMs other than the PDZ domain, such as their Zn2+-fingers and C2 domains, may assist its synaptic localization. In addition, RIM/UNC-10 is mislocalized in C. elegans liprin-α/SYD-2 mutants (7Schoch S. Castillo P.E. Jo T. Mukherjee K. Geppert M. Wang Y. Schmitz F. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Conversely, the abundance and solubility of ERC and liprin-α proteins are not changed in RIM1 knock-out mice (7Schoch S.

There are only a few known active zone scaffold (or CAZ) proteins including Piccolo, Bassoon, ERC, RIM, Munc13, and liprin-α (1Garner C.C. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Curr. Opin.

It is interesting to note that our finding of the ERC-liprin-α interaction provides a molecular link to bring some of the CAZ components together: (RIM or ERC)-liprin-α-GIT-Piccolo. Although this may not be a complete picture, our work may provide a useful first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular organization of the active zone.

AR is localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of androgen and translocates into the nuclei to activate gene expression in the presence of ligand. Regulation of AR nuclear import and export represents an essential step in androgen action. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified in the DNA-binding domain and hinge region of AR and other steroid receptors. Studies on nuclear export of AR, however, are limited, and what might be the underlying mechanism regulating the intracellular localization of steroid receptors is unclear. Our studies have identified a leptomycin B-insensitive nuclear export signal (NESAR) in the ligand-binding domain of AR, which is active in the absence of androgen and repressed upon ligand binding. Consistent with its androgen-sensitivity, NESAR contains amino acid residues in the immediate vicinity of the bound ligand. NESAR is necessary for AR nuclear export and is dominant over the NLS in the DNA-binding domain and hinge region in the absence of hormone. Our findings suggest that androgen can regulate NESAR and, subsequently, the NLS of the AR, providing a mechanism by which androgen regulates AR nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling.

Gross F. Grumbach M. Labhart A. Lipsett M. Mann T. Samuels L. Zander J. The Mechanism of Action of Androgen. Springer Verlag, New York1977: 10Google Scholar, 2Zhou Z. Wong C. Sar M. Wilson E. Recent Progress in Hormone Research. 1994; 49: 249-274PubMed Google Scholar). AR is necessary for male accessory organ development and is involved in prostate cancer progression. The human AR contains 918 amino acids and consists of the N-terminal transactivation domain (1–555), DNA-binding domain (DBD) (556–623), hinge region (624–665), and C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (666–918) (3Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The DBD, hinge region, and LBD of AR share a high degree of homology with other steroid receptors. Intracellular localization of AR and other steroid receptors such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is ligand-dependent. The limit for passive diffusion across the nuclear pore complex has been suggested to fall within the range of 20–40 kDa (4Marte B. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: E135Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Larger proteins such as AR, which is ∼100 kDa in size, must be actively transported through the nuclear pore complex to enter or leave the nucleus. AR is localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand and translocates into the nucleus in the presence of ligand (5Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 949: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, nuclear AR can be exported to the cytoplasm upon ligand withdrawal (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that AR contains both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) and that their activities are regulated by androgen either directly or indirectly. Because nuclear localization is necessary for steroid receptors to transactivate their target genes, the ligand-dependent nuclear import/export represents a critical mechanism by which steroids regulate the activity of their cognate receptors. The signal involved in the transport of steroid receptors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus has been studied extensively. Mutagenesis studies of the human AR have defined a bipartite NLS in the DBD and hinge region at amino acids 617–633 (9Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This NLS is composed of two clusters of basic amino acids (underlined) separated by 10 amino acid residues: RKCYEAGMTLGARKLKK. Similar NLS were found in other steroid receptors. In addition to the NLS in the DBD and hinge region, Picard and Yamamoto (10Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of a ligand-dependent NLS present in the LBD of GR. When fused to β-galactosidase or to N-terminal fragments of the GR lacking the NLS, the LBD of GR conferred ligand-dependent nuclear localization to the fusion proteins. Similarly, a ligand-dependent NLS also exists in the LBD of AR, which is capable of inducing nuclear import in the absence of the NLS in the DBD and hinge region (11Jenster G. van der Korput J.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on sequences responsible for transportation of steroid receptors from the nucleus to the cytoplasm are limited. The best characterized nuclear export mechanism uses the export receptor CRM1 that binds to proteins containing a leucine-rich NES to direct protein export from the nucleus. Steroid receptors lack any leucine-rich sequence that would resemble a classical NES (13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Studies with progesterone receptor (PR) showed that nuclear export of PR involves its NLS and is not mediated by CRM1/exportin 1 (13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7179-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PR export does not involve Ran GTP and does not depend upon the hydrolysis of GTP. Recent studies with GR showed that the DBD of steroid receptors can function as an NES and that the nuclear export of GR requires the binding of calreticulin (15Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Rastinejad F. Paschal B.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1749-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because the calreticulin-binding site and NLS are in the DBD and hinge region rather than in the LBD, it remains unclear how steroids regulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of steroid receptors by means of the calreticulin-binding site and NLS. The fact that AR intracellular localization is regulated by androgen has led to the hypothesis that the LBD is involved in the regulation of AR nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. Through mutagenesis studies, we have identified NESAR, a region in the LBD that is necessary for AR nuclear export and is dominant over the reported NLS in the DBD and hinge region in the absence of ligand. When hormone is present, NESAR is repressed, and the NLS directs nuclear localization of the AR. This ligand-regulated NES is also present in MR and ERα and contains many amino acid residues in the immediate vicinity of the bound ligand. Our studies provide insights into the mechanism by which steroids regulate intracellular localization of steroid receptors. Expression Vector Construction—Cloning into the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) results in fusion proteins with GFP at the N terminus. The GFP tag allows for convenient visualization by fluorescence microscopy. We generated pEGFP-AR to express GFP-AR fusion protein, pEGFP-LBDAR (666–918) to express GFP-LBD fusion protein, and pEGFP-AR (1–665) to express the GFP-AR (1–665) fusion protein. AR (1–665) consists of the N-terminal region, DBD, and hinge region. We also generated one set of expression vectors for fusion proteins with GFP at the N terminus and LBD deletion mutants at the C terminus and another set for fusion proteins with GFP at the N terminus, AR (1–665) in the middle, and LBD deletion mutants at the C terminus (see Fig. 3E). Various AR mutants were generated by anchor PCR using the full-length human AR cDNA as the template, which was kindly provided by Dr. Shutsung Liao (3Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). All expression vectors were verified by sequencing analysis. The plasmids were double CsCl gradient purified for transient transfection. Once the NES sequence was identified in the LBD region corresponding to AR (742–817), we tried to amplify the cDNA coding for AR (742–817). We were unable to amplify this region; however, we were able to amplify the cDNA coding for AR (743–817) and clone it into pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-AR (1–665) vectors, resulting in expression vectors pEGFP-NESAR (743–817) and pEGFP-AR (1–665)-NESAR (743–817). We also generated the GFP-AR(ΔNESAR) expression vector; the deletion of NESAR was PCR-based. Substitution mutagenesis of pEGFP-NESAR (743–817) was accomplished to introduce nucleotide substitutions over a conserved region corresponding to amino acids YFAPDAR (762–766). The substituted nucleotides encoded the amino acid sequence GPLGS. This NESAR mutant was cloned into pEGFP-C1 to produce pEGFP-NESAR-GPLGS762. The regions in estrogen receptor α (ERα) and MR corresponding to the NESAR were cloned into pEGFP-C1 to generate pEGFP-NESER (386–455) and pEGFP-NESMR (809–883). Furthermore, the peptide sequence of GSNELALKLAGLDINKTGGC, corresponding to the NES of the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Wen W. Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Feramisco J. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32214-32220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned into pEGFP-C1 to generate pEGFP-NESPKI. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human prostate cancer cell line PC3 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). PC3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The various AR deletion constructs were transfected into PC3 cells using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). PC3 cells were transfected at >60% confluence in 6-well plates in phenol red-free cFBS-RPMI. To induce nuclear translocation of GFP-AR and GFP-LBD, 10–8m dihydrotestosterone was added at the time of transfection. The localization of GFP fusion proteins was visualized 16 h after transfection with fluorescence microscopy using either a Leica DM-IL microscope or a Nikon TE 2000U inverted microscope. Cytoplasmic localization in transfected cells was defined when the GFP fluorescence in the cytoplasm was greater than in the nuclei. Likewise, nuclear localization was defined when the GFP fluorescence in the nuclei was greater than in the cytoplasm. Even distribution indicates that GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in transfected cells. Inhibition of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export by leptomycin B (see Fig. 5, LMB) was based on experiments described previously (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Four hours after transfection of PC3 cells, the media were replaced with cFBS-RPMI containing 15 ng/ml LMB. Localization of GFP fusion proteins was observed through fluorescence microscopy 12 h after LMB addition. GFP-NESPKI was used as a control in parallel experiments. To test whether liganded nuclear GFP-LBD fusion protein undergoes nuclear export upon ligand withdrawal, PC3 cells were transfected with GFP-LBD (see Fig. 2). Four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 10–8m mibolerone (mib) for 16 h to induce nuclear localization of GFP-LBD, which was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Then, cells were washed five times with cFBS-RPMI and cultured in cFBS-RPMI under androgen-free conditions for 4 h to induce export of nuclear GFP-LBD in the presence or absence of LMB (see Fig. 2). The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added 2 h prior to the ligand withdrawal to ensure that cytoplasmic GFP-LBD was exported from the nucleus rather than derived from de novo synthesis in the cytoplasm (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The localization of GFP-LBD in transfected cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 24 h after transfection. GFP-NESPKI was used as a control in parallel experiments. Quantification of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic localization of GFP-tagged fusion proteins was carried out by counting 20–200 transfected cells/dish in at least two dishes in each experiment. All of the experiments were reproduced at least once. ClustalW Analysis—To determine homology, the amino acid sequences of NESAR, NESER, and NESMR were entered into the ClustalW program accessed from the European Bioinformatics Institute web site. ClustalW generated a multiple sequence alignment and graded amino acid identity and similarity, distinguishing between highly conserved residues and semi-conserved residues. Androgen Regulation of Nuclear Translocation of the Ligand-binding Domain of AR—To study the role of the LBD of AR in nuclear import and export, we tagged the full-length AR or the LBD (amino acids 666–918) with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-tagged AR is functionally indistinguishable from the untagged wild type AR (5Georget V. Lobaccaro J.M. Terouanne B. Mangeat P. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The GFP tag allowed us to determine the intracellular localization of the AR and various AR mutants. We separately transfected GFP-AR and GFP-LBD expression vectors into the human prostate cancer cell line, PC3. PC3 cells were chosen as a model in this study because high transfection efficiency is easily obtained in these cells. As expected, unliganded AR is localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and translocates into the nuclei in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, Fig. 1). Interestingly, the LBD alone is also localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand and undergoes nuclear translocation in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. This observation demonstrates the importance of the LBD in androgen regulation of AR nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. Further, it indicates the existence of a signal in the LBD that specifies cytoplasmic localization in the absence of ligand. In the presence of hormone, GFP-LBD translocates to the nucleus, suggesting that this signal is repressed upon ligand binding. This result also confirms the existence of an NLS in the liganded LBD. Cytoplasmic Localization of GFP-LBD Is Due to CRM1-independent Nuclear Export—To determine whether the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-LBD was due to nuclear export, hormone-withdrawal experiments were conducted. Briefly, PC3 cells were transfected with GFP-LBD. The cells were treated with androgen agonist mibolerone to induce nuclear import of GFP-LBD, resulting in nuclear localization of GFP-LBD (Fig 2A). As expected, GFP-LBD was localized to the cytoplasm after hormone withdrawal. The cytoplasmic GFP-LBD was exported from the nucleus rather than derived from de novo synthesis in the cytoplasm because the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not affect intracellular localization of GFP-LBD after hormone withdrawal (Fig. 2A). This observation suggests the existence of a novel NESAR in the LBD of AR. To examine whether the nuclear export of GFP-LBD depends upon CRM1, the hormone withdrawal experiments were repeated in the presence or absence of leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (Fig. 2B). Cycloheximide was again used to prevent new protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. LMB did not prevent nuclear export of GFP-LBD fusion protein after hormone withdrawal (Fig. 2B), suggesting that GFP-LBD nuclear export is CRM1-independent. In parallel control experiments, LMB inhibited the nuclear export of the GFP-tagged NES of the heat stable protein kinase inhibitor NESPKI, a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal sensitive to LMB inhibition (13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), resulting in even localization or predominantly nuclear localization of GFP-NESPKI in the majority of the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Our finding is in agreement with a previous report demonstrating that nuclear export of the AR was insensitive to LMB inhibition (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations indicate the existence of a CRM1-independent, ligand-regulated NESAR in the LBD. Identification of NESAR in the LBD—Figs. 1 and 2 show that cytoplasmic localization of GFP-LBD in the absence of ligand is caused by the presence of an NESAR in GFP-LBD. A mutant GFP-LBD with NESAR disrupted should be evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus. On the other hand, if NESAR were not deleted, the mutant GFP-LBD construct would predominantly localize to the cytoplasm. Based on the above rationale, we employed deletion mutagenesis to map the NESAR in the LBD. Nine N-terminal (n1–n9) and nine C-terminal (c1–c9) LBD deletion mutants (Fig. 3E) were generated and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 expression vector. Fig. 3A shows the effect of N-terminal deletion on the intracellular localization of GFP-LBD. The n1–n3 mutants exhibit cytoplasmic localization in 97% of the transfected cells. The n4 and n5 deletion mutants are localized to the cytoplasm in 65 and 20% of the transfected cells, respectively. The n6–n9 deletion mutants are evenly distributed between the nuclei and cytoplasm in more than 90% of the transfected cells. This result indicates that the N-terminal boundary of the NESAR is around the n3 position at amino acid residue 742 in AR. Fig. 3B shows the effect of C-terminal deletion on the intracellular localization of GFP-LBD. The c7–c9 deletion mutants are localized to cytoplasm in >93% of the transfected cells. In contrast, the c1–c3 mutants are evenly distributed in >97% of the transfected cells. The c4, c5, and c6 mutants are localized to the cytoplasm in 42, 60, and 85% of the transfected cells, respectively. This observation indicates that the C-terminal boundary of the NESAR is around the c6 position at amino acid residue 817 in the AR. The results from both N- and C-terminal deletion analyses suggest that this NESAR is localized within the region of amino acid residues 742–817 of AR. The above experiments identified the region containing NESAR from the LBD in the absence of the N-terminal region, DBD, and hinge region of AR. It is well established that the DBD and hinge region contain an NLS; we sought to determine whether NESAR can specify cytoplasmic localization in the presence of other AR domains. To address this question, amino acid residues 1–665 of AR, consisting of the N-terminal region, DBD, and hinge region, were inserted between GFP and the various LBD deletion mutants in our expression vectors. This procedure resulted in a series of new expression vectors for tripartite fusion proteins consisting of GFP, AR (1–665), and various deletion mutants of LBD, denoted N1–N9 or C1–C9 (Fig. 3E). The inclusion of AR (1–665) in the fusion protein did not inhibit the activity of the NESAR in the LBD deletion mutants (Fig. 3, C and D). Fig. 3C shows the result of N-terminal deletion. The N1, N2, and N3 deletion mutant fusion proteins are localized to the cytoplasm in the transfected cells. In contrast, the N6, N7, N8, and N9 deletion mutant fusion proteins, which lack the region in the LBD containing NESAR, are localized to the nuclei of >90% transfected cells, presumably because of the NLS in the DBD and hinge region in AR (1–665). N4 and N5 deletion mutant fusion proteins, which only partially contain NESAR, are localized to cytoplasm in 51 and 27% of the transfected cells, respectively. The above observation suggests that the NESAR in LBD deletion mutants is dominant over the NLS in DBD and hinge region of the AR. The studies with the GFP, AR (1–665), and C-terminal deletion mutant tripartite fusion proteins also argue that the NESAR in the LBD is dominant over the NLS in the DBD and hinge region (Fig. 3D). As expected, C1, C2, and C3 mutant fusion proteins are localized to the nuclei in >95% of the transfected cells, presumably because of the NLS in AR (1–665). C4, C5, and C6 mutants are either predominantly localized to the cytoplasm or nuclei, with C4, C5, and C6 having cytoplasmic localization in 29.5, 57.5, and 74.5% of the transfected cells, respectively. C7, C8, and C9 deletion mutants, all of which contain the entire NESAR, were localized to the cytoplasm in >93% of the transfected PC3 cells. NESAR Is Necessary and Sufficient for AR Cytoplasmic Localization—Our mutagenesis studies identified NESAR in the LBD. To determine whether NESAR is necessary for cytoplasmic localization of AR, we have generated an expression vector for GFP-tagged AR with the deletion of NESAR. In the absence of NESAR, the mutant AR is predominantly localized to the nuclei of the transfected cells (Fig. 4). This observation argues that NESAR is necessary for nuclear export of AR. To determine whether NESAR is sufficient to confer cytoplasmic localization, we cloned the amino acid sequence corresponding to 743–817 of the AR into the pEGFP-C1 expression vector. Transient transfection of the expression vector into the PC3 cells showed that NESAR is sufficient to specify cytoplasmic localization of the tagged GFP reporter protein (Fig. 4). The above observations indicate that NESAR is necessary and sufficient for AR cytoplasmic localization. NESAR Is Dominant over the NLS in the DBD and Hinge Region of AR—Results in Fig. 3, C and D suggest that NESAR in the LBD is dominant over the NLS in the DBD and hinge region. To substantiate the above finding, we generated expression vector for fusion protein GFP-AR (1–665)-NESAR consisting of GFP at the N terminus, AR (1–665) in the middle, and NESAR at the C terminus. The percentage of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic localization of GFP-AR (1–665)-NESAR is virtually identical to that of GFP-NESAR (Fig. 4), suggesting that NESAR is dominant over the NLS in the DBD and hinge region within AR (1–665). NESAR Is Insensitive to Leptomycin B Inhibition—Nuclear export of steroid receptors including AR is insensitive to LMB inhibition (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol.

Thus, NESAR-mediated nuclear export should also be insensitive to LMB. As expected, LMB had a minimal effect on the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-NESAR, GFP-LBD, and GFP-AR fusion proteins (Fig. 5). In our control experiment, leptomycin B prevented predominant cytoplasmic localization of GFP-tagged NESPKI, which is known to be LMB-sensitive (13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The NES Is Functionally Conserved in the Steroid Receptor Superfamily—Because the LBD is conserved in the steroid receptor superfamily, the NES is also, not surprisingly, evolutionarily conserved. We cloned the regions in ERα (amino acids 386–455) and MR (amino acids 809–883) corresponding to NESAR into the pEGFP-C1 vector, generating pEGFP-NESER (386–455) and pEGFP-NESMR (809–883). Fig. 6A shows the sequence similarities, as determined by ClustalW analysis (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), between NESAR, NESER, and NESMR. The three NES share 18.7% identity, with an additional 25% of the residues being highly conserved. Although the amino acid sequence homology for the NES is moderate, the structure of NES is very similar, consisting of helix 5 through helix 8 of the LBD and a highly conserved β-turn between helix 5 and helix 6. This NES contains at least seven amino acid residues in the immediate vicinity of the ligand (20Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 21Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A. Basler S. Schafer M. Egner U. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26164-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NES activity in the LBD can be regulated by ligand binding. As expected, NESMR and NESER are sufficient to cause cytoplasmic localization of the fusion proteins in transfected PC3 cells (Fig. 6B). The GFP-NESER and GFP-NESMR fusion proteins are localized to the cytoplasm of 78 and 100% of the transfected PC3 cells, respectively. The high sequence identity in the β-turn (Fig. 6A) suggests that these amino acid residues may be important for nuclear export activity of NESAR. Adopting a mutagenesis strategy used to characterize the NLS in the DBD and hinge region of AR (9Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we substituted residues YFAPDAR (762–766) of NESAR with the sequence GPLGS. When cloned into pEGFP-C1, we designated the resulting fusion protein GFP-NESAR-GPLGS762. In transient transfection experiments with PC3 cells, the percentage of transfected cells exhibiting cytoplasmic localization of GFP-NESAR-GPLGS762 is only slightly less than that of GFP-NESAR (Fig. 6, B and C). This finding suggests that cytoplasmic localization of GFP-NESAR does not depend upon the identity of the conserved amino acid residues YFAPDAR (762–766) in the β-turn region (Fig. 6). This paper reports the identification and characterization of a novel NES that specifies AR cytoplasmic localization. NESAR is dominant over the NLS in the DBD and hinge region in the absence of hormone and is repressed by ligand binding. This NES is also functionally conserved in the LBD of MR and ER. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of ligand-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of steroid receptors. The observation that GFP-LBD fusion protein is localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of androgen and to the nuclei in the presence of androgen (Fig. 1) indicates that the LBD contains a ligand-regulated nuclear export signal, NESAR. The NESAR is active in the absence of androgen and is repressed in the presence of androgen. The androgen withdrawal experiment in Fig. 2 confirms the existence of NESAR and indicates that NESAR is insensitive to LMB. According to our deletion mutagenesis studies (Fig. 3), NESAR consists of residues in helix 5 through helix 8 of the LBD and has at least seven amino acid residues in the immediate vicinity of the bound ligand (Fig. 6). Thus, it is not surprising that ligand binding can regulate the activity of the NES in the intact LBD. The identification of NESAR also provides an explanation for previous findings that deletion of regions overlapping NESAR tended to reduce the cytoplasmic localization of the AR mutants (9Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that the LBD of AR performs nuclear export activity in the absence of ligand and nuclear import activity in the presence of ligand. Some peptide sequences are bidirectional signals, exhibiting either NES or NLS activity (23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Thus, an interesting possibility is that the NES in the intact LBD could function as an NLS upon ligand binding. This would explain the nuclear import of GFP-LBDAR in the presence of androgen. Our studies showed that the NESAR is necessary and sufficient to cause AR nuclear export (Fig. 4). GFP-AR(ΔNESAR) is localized to the nuclei of the transfected cells, demonstrating the necessity of NESAR in AR nuclear export. On the other hand, GFP-NESAR exhibited cytoplasmic localization in >80% of the transfected cells, indicating that NESAR is sufficient to cause nuclear export. Our observations suggest that the mechanism of AR nuclear export is identical to that of NESAR-mediated nuclear export. Previous studies showed that nuclear export of steroid receptors, including AR, GR, and PR, is insensitive to LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1/exportin 1 (8Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Liu J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the finding that NESAR does not share sequence similarity with the leucine-rich NES, which directs export mediated by the CRM1/exportin 1 pathway. If NESAR is truly the nuclear export signal responsible for AR nuclear export, the NESAR-mediated nuclear export should also be insensitive to LMB. As expected, LMB had virtually no influence on cytoplasmic localization of GFP-NESAR (Fig. 5). Our studies indicate the existence of this NES in the LBD of at least two other steroid receptors. We have demonstrated that GFP-NESER and GFP-NESMR are localized to the cytoplasm of 78 and 100% of transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 6). This NES is likely to be present in additional steroid receptors. For example, rat GR mutants with deletions protruding into the region which would correspond to NESGR also show impaired cytoplasmic localization (10Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of the NES are only 18.6% identical, the structure of the NES is very similar, consisting of helices 5–8 of the LBD and the highly conserved β-turn region between helix 5 and helix 6 (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, when five amino acids in the middle of the β-turn region (YFAPDAR (762–766)) were replaced with the sequence GPLGS, only a small decrease in the cytoplasmic localization of this construct was observed (Fig. 6, B and C). Because the β-turn region is the most highly conserved section of the NES (Fig. 6A), the minimal effect of the GPLGS substitution presents the possibility that the three dimensional structure of the NES rather than its exact amino acid composition may be critically important for its nuclear export activity. AR has a well characterized NLS in the DBD and hinge region. Our studies showed that, in the absence of ligand, NESAR in the LBD is dominant if both NESAR and NLS are present in the same peptide. This result provides an explanation for androgen regulation of AR nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. In the absence of ligand, NESAR in the LBD is active and dominant, causing nuclear export of AR. In contrast, the binding of ligand inhibits NESAR in the LBD, induces NLS activity in the LBD, and alleviates the NESAR-dependent repression of the NLS in the DBD and hinge region, leading to efficient nuclear import of AR. Our observations argue strongly that NESAR is a nuclear export signal, although we were unable to directly demonstrate that with nuclear microinjection. This was caused by our inability to purify fusion proteins containing NESAR for nuclear injection, because the GST fusion proteins containing NESAR are present only in the insoluble fraction. Nevertheless, our data show that NESAR is required for AR cytoplasmic localization. In summary, we have identified NESAR, a region in the LBD of AR which specifies cytoplasmic localization. NESAR is active and dominant over the NLS in the absence of ligand. The binding of ligand to AR inhibits NESAR and simultaneously releases repression of the NLS, leading to AR nuclear localization. This NES is also present in other steroid receptors. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the ligand-dependent nuclear import/export of AR and other steroid receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2046864479,"Our perception of fine visual detail relies on small receptive fields at early stages of visual processing. However, small receptive fields tend to confound the orientation and velocity of moving edges, leading to ambiguous or inaccurate motion measurements (the aperture problem). Thus, it is often assumed that neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) carry only ambiguous motion information. Here we show that a subpopulation of V1 neurons is capable of signaling motion direction in a manner that is independent of contour orientation. Specifically, end-stopped V1 neurons obtain accurate motion measurements by responding only to the endpoints of long contours, a strategy which renders them largely immune to the aperture problem. Furthermore, the time course of end-stopping is similar to the time course of motion integration by MT neurons. These results suggest that cortical neurons might represent object motion by responding selectively to two-dimensional discontinuities in the visual scene."
https://openalex.org/W2115802065,"Voltage-dependent K+ channels (VDPC) are expressed in most mammalian cells and involved in the proliferation and activation of lymphocytes. However, the role of VDPC in macrophage responses is not well established. This study was undertaken to characterize VDPC in macrophages and determine their physiological role during proliferation and activation. Macrophages proliferate until an endotoxic shock halts cell growth and they become activated. By inducing a schedule that is similar to the physiological pattern, we have identified the VDPC in non-transformed bone marrow-derived macrophages and studied their regulation. Patch clamp studies demonstrated that cells expressed outward delayed and inwardly rectifying K+ currents. Pharmacological data, mRNA, and protein analysis suggest that these currents were mainly mediated by Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 channels. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent proliferation induced both channels. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation differentially regulated VDPC expression. While Kv1.3 was further induced, Kir2.1 was down-regulated. TNF-α mimicked LPS effects, and studies with TNF-α receptor I/II double knockout mice demonstrated that LPS regulation mediates such expression by TNF-α-dependent and -independent mechanisms. This modulation was dependent on mRNA and protein synthesis. In addition, bone marrow-derived macrophages expressed Kv1.5 mRNA with no apparent regulation. VDPC activities seem to play a critical role during proliferation and activation because not only cell growth, but also inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression were inhibited by blocking their activities.

Immune system responses to an antigen involve a complex network of several cell types. Among them, the mononuclear phagocyte family comprises numerous cell types, including tissue macrophages, Kupffer cells, dermal Langerhans cells, osteoclasts, microglia, and perhaps some of the interdigitating and follicular dendritic cells from lymphoid organs (1Ogawa M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages perform critical functions in the immune system, acting as regulators of homeostasis and as effector cells in infection, wounding, and tumor growth. In response to different growth factors and cytokines, macrophages can proliferate, become activated or differentiate. As monocytes differentiate into mature, non-proliferating macrophages they can produce a large variety of responses, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and secretion of numerous cytokines and other substances. To elicit the appropriate physiological response plasma membrane protein expression changes dramatically from proliferation to activation (2Celada A. Nathan C. Immunol.

Despite considerable progress, important questions remain unsolved, the relationship of these proteins to cell function being one of the most relevant (18Gallin E.K. Physiol.

VDPC are associated with macrophage functions such as migration, proliferation, activation, and cytokine production (see Refs. 18Gallin E.K. Physiol.

Although microglia appears to express most neuronal channels, circulating macrophages have a number of VDPC yet to be defined (19Eder C. Am. J.

These proteins have been studied in various cellular models, and outward delayed and inwardly rectifying K+ currents have been identified. Furthermore, the presence of the shaker-like Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 channels has been detected in some studies. However, the use of either activated or transformed macrophage cell lines has led to controversial results (4Gallin E.K. Livengood D.R. Am. J.

Lippincott Willians & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1999: 141-157Google Scholar). Thus, while a high-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel has been clearly identified as an early step in transmembrane signal transduction in macrophages (21Blunck R. Scheel O. Müller M. Brandenburg K. Seitzer U. Seydel U. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the physiological role of VDPC in either proliferation or activation is not known. Primary culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) is a unique non-transformed model in which proliferation and activation can be studied separately, mimicking physiological processes that occur in the body (22Soler C. García-Manteiga J. Valdés R. Xaus J. Comalada M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Celada A. Felipe A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Macrophages are generated in the bone marrow and, through the bloodstream, reach all tissues, stop proliferation, and become activated (2Celada A. Nathan C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 15: 100-102Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is the specific growth factor for this cell type (23Stanley E.R. Berg K.L. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S. Pixley F.J. Wang Y. Yeung Y.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer Gram-negative bacteria membrane, which interacts with monocytes/macrophages and induces a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, finally leading to the release of endogenous mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 (24Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPS triggers cellular activation and apoptosis by an early TNF-α-dependent mechanism (25Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. López-Soriano F.J. Argilés J.M. Bogdan C. Celada A.

Several VDPC candidates could be present in macrophages and our first interest was to identify these channels in a primary culture of BMDM. Macrophages mainly expressed the outward delayed Kv1.3 and the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 potassium channels. Because VDPC could be involved not only in proliferation but also in activation, our second goal was to determine their specific role by inducing a schedule that is similar to the physiological pattern in BMDM. M-CSF-dependent proliferation led to an up-regulation of VDPC generating an increase in potassium current densities without changes in current kinetics. When cells were further incubated with LPS the electrophysiological properties changed dramatically. Thus, Kv1.3 was further increased, whereas Kir2.1 was down-regulated. We also show that TNF-α partially mimicked the response to LPS, suggesting that there are TNF-α-dependent and -independent mechanisms mediating LPS-induced VDPC modulation in macrophages. Our results have physiological relevance and indicate that VDPC expression is important as an early regulatory step, and fine-tuning modulation of their expression is crucial to the specific membrane signaling that triggers the appropriate immune response. Animals and Cell Culture—BMDM from 6- to 10-week-old BALB/c or C57/BL6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used. Cells were isolated and cultured as described elsewhere (22Soler C. García-Manteiga J. Valdés R. Xaus J. Comalada M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Celada A. Felipe A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and both femurs were dissected removing adherent tissue. The ends of bones were cut off and the marrow tissue was flushed by irrigation with medium. The marrow plugs were passed through a 25-gauge needle for dispersion. The cells were cultured in plastic dishes (150 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 30% supernatant of L-929 fibroblast (L-cell) conditioned media as a source of M-CSF. Macrophages were obtained as a homogeneous population of adherent cells after 7 days of culture and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments, they were cultured with the same tissue culture differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 30% L-cell medium) or arrested at G0 by M-CSF deprivation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 18 h. G0-arrested cells were further incubated in the absence or presence of recombinant murine M-CSF (1200 units/ml), with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF-α (100 ng/ml), for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were exposed to rMargatoxin (MgTx), BaCl2, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D as previously described (26Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J.N. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W.

The TNF-α receptor I/II double knockout mice (C57/BL6) used in this study were generated and characterized as previously reported (25Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. López-Soriano F.J.

DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was measured as the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) to DNA, as described elsewhere (22Soler C. García-Manteiga J. Valdés R. Xaus J. Comalada M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Celada A. Felipe A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages (5 × 104) were seeded in 24-well plates in 1 ml of medium without M-CSF for at least 18 h. Cells were then cultured for a further 24 h in the absence or presence of M-CSF with/without LPS, TNF-α, MgTx, or BaCl2 (1 mm). Finally, the medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of the same medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. After three additional hours of incubation, cells were fixed in 70% methanol, washed three times in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 1% SDS and 0.3% NaOH. The whole content of the well was used for counting radioactivity. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from mouse macrophages, brain, and liver was isolated using the Tripure reagent (Roche Diagnostics), following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were further treated with the DNA-free kit from Ambion Inc. to remove DNA. Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used in a one-step RT-PCR as described elsewhere (22Soler C. García-Manteiga J. Valdés R. Xaus J. Comalada M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Celada A. Felipe A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Fuster G. Vicente R.

Physiol. 2003; 195: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total RNA and selected primers at 1 μm were added to the beads. The RT reaction was initiated by incubating the mixture at 42 °C for 30 min. Once the first-strand cDNA had been synthesized, the conditions were set for further PCR: 92 °C for 30 s, either 55 °C (Kv1.3 and 18S) or 60 °C (Kir2.1) for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min. These settings were applied for 40 cycles. Every 10 cycles, 10 μl of the total reaction was collected in a separate tube for further electrophoresis and analysis. A range of dilutions of RNA from each independent sample was performed to obtain an exponential phase of amplicon production (not shown) as described previously (32Fuster G. Vicente R. Coma M. Grande M. Felipe A. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002; 24: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The same independent RNA aliquot was used to analyze the VDPC mRNA expression and the respective amount of 18 S rRNA. Primer sequences and accession numbers were: Kv1.3 (accession number M30441), forward, 5′-CTCATCTCCATTGTCATCTTCTGA-3′ (base pairs 741–765) and reverse, 5′-TTGAATTGGAAACAATCAC-3′ (base pairs 1459–1440); Kir2.1 (accession number AF021136), forward, 5′-TGGCTGTGTGTTTTGGTTGATAGC-3′ (base pairs 297–320) and reverse, 5′-CTTTGCCATCTTCGCCATGACTGC-3′ (base pairs 555–532); and 18 S (accession number X00686), forward, 5′-CGCAGAATTCCCACTCCCGACCC-3′ (base pairs 482–498) and reverse, 5′-CCCAAGCTCCAACTACGAGC-3′ (base pairs 694–675). Kv1.5 and other Kv mRNA expression was analyzed by PCR as previously described (33Coma M. Vicente R. Busquets S. Carbó N. Tamkun M.M. López-Soriano F.J. Argilés J.M. Felipe A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In all cases negative controls were performed in the absence of the RT reaction. Once the exponential phase of the amplicon production had been determined the specificity of each product was confirmed in test RT-PCR using the appropriate cDNA probe in a Southern blot analysis. PCR-generated VDPC cDNA probes from mouse brain were subcloned using the pSTBlue-1 acceptor vector kit (Novagen) and the sequences were confirmed using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). EcoRI-digested [α-32P]CTP random primer-labeled cDNAs were used as probes as previously described (34Grande M. Suàrez E. Vicente R. Cantó C. Coma M. Tamkun M.M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. Felipe A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At least three different filters were made from independent samples and representative blots are shown. Results were analyzed with Phoretix software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Protein Extracts and Western Blot—Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice with lysis solution (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl) supplemented with 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 86 μg/ml iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors. Sample protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The proteins from cell lysates (100 μg) were boiled at 95 °C in Laemmli SDS-loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. They were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and blocked in 5% dry milk-supplemented 0.2% Tween 20 PBS prior to immunoreaction. To monitor Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 expression, rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Alomone Labs) were used. To study the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a rabbit antibody against mouse iNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Kv1.5 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. M. M. Tamkun (Colorado State University). As a loading and transfer control, a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used. Electron Microscopy—Cell monolayers on Petri dishes were scraped and collected into PBS buffer. BMDM were cryofixed by high-pressure freezing using an EMPact (Leica). Freeze substitution was performed in an “Automatic Freeze Substitution system” (AFS) from Leica, using acetone containing 0.5% of uranyl acetate, for 3 days at –90 °C. On the fourth day, the temperature was slowly increased, 5 °C/h, to –50 °C. At this temperature samples were rinsed in acetone and then infiltrated and embedded in Lowicryl HM20. Ultrathin sections were picked up on Formvar-coated copper-palladium grids. For immunogold localization, samples were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS for 20 min and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with polyclonal anti-Kv1.3 or anti-Kir2.1 (1:200). Washes were performed with PBS prior to adding goat anti-rabbit conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold (BioCell Research Laboratory) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, samples were washed and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min and observed in a Hitachi 600AB electron microscope. Electrophysiological Recordings—Whole cell currents were measured using the patch clamp technique. An EPC-9 (HEKA) with the appropriate software was used for data recording and analysis. Currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz. Series resistance compensation was always above 70%. Patch electrodes of 2–4 Mohms were fabricated in a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments Co.) from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.2 mm and inner diameter 0.94 mm; Clark Electromedical Instruments Co.). Electrodes were filled with the following solution (in mm): 120 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 20 d-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 25 d-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. After establishing the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique macrophages were clamped to a holding potential of –60 mV. To evoke voltage-gated currents all cells were stimulated with 200-ms square pulses ranging from –150 to +50 mV in 10-mV steps. All recordings were routinely subtracted for leak currents. The pharmacological characterization of the inward rectifier K+ current was performed by adding to the external solution BaCl2 and CsCl at various concentrations (28Lepple-Wienhues A. Berweck S. Böhmig M. Leo C.P. Meyling B. Garbe C. Wiederholt M. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To block the outward current, MgTx and ShK-Dap22 were added to the external solution (26Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J.N. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Before experiments, toxins were reconstituted to 10 μm in Tris buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). All recordings were done at room temperature (20–23 °C). Reagents—Recombinant murine TNF-α was obtained from Prepo-Tech EC. Recombinant murine M-CSF was from R&D Systems. Cycloheximide, actinomycin D, LPS, CsCl, and BaCl2 were purchased from Sigma, and MgTx from Alomone Labs. ShK-Dap22 was from Bachem Biosciences Inc. Other reagents were of analytical grade. Analysis and Statistics—According to the solutions used, the calculated equilibrium potential for potassium was –79 mV (EK) using the Nernst equation. The normalized G/Gmaxversus voltage curve was fitted using Boltzmann's equation: G/Gmax = 1/(1 + exp((V[1,2]–V)/k)), where V½ is the voltage at which the current is half-activated and k is the slope factor of the activation curve. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences was established by either Student's t test or one way ANOVA (Graph Pad, PRISM 3.0) for either two-group or two-factor comparison, respectively. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Macrophages Express Outward and Inward K+Currents: Pharmacology and Molecular Characterization of Kv1.3 and Kir2.1—Cells (n = 80) plated in the presence in L-cell-conditioned medium expressed outward delayed and inward rectifier potassium currents (Fig. 1A). Following a train of 200-ms depolarizing pulses to +50 mV at 400-ms intervals, the outward current showed a characteristic cumulative inactivation phenomenon (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the effect of MgTx and ShK-Dap22 on the outward conductance. The IC50 for inhibition were ∼5 and ∼3 pm for MgTx and ShK-Dap22, respectively. These results indicated that Kv1.3 would be the main channel responsible for the outward potassium current. On the other hand, the high sensitivity to Ba2+ (Fig. 1D) and Cs+ (Fig. 1E), together with the closed state above 0 mV of the inward current, indicated that the channel was Kir2.1. To identify K+ channels at the molecular level, we performed RT-PCR analyses. Mouse brain and liver RNAs were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Fig. 2A shows that macrophages expressed Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 mRNA to a similar extent to that observed in the brain. In addition, specific Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 signals were obtained by Western blot analysis in brain and BMDM protein samples (Fig. 2B). The presence of other VDPC (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.6, and Kv3.1) analyzed by RT-PCR was negative (Fig. 2C). However, BMDM expressed Kv1.5 mRNA but the protein expression was below detection levels analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2C and data not shown).Fig. 2Voltage-dependent K+ channel expression in macrophages.A, mRNA expression of Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 in the mouse brain and macrophages but not in the liver. 1 μg of total RNA was used in RT-PCR reactions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 protein expression in the mouse brain and BMDM.

However, the precise mechanism triggering the first step of mRNA decay and its relationship to translation have not been elucidated. Here, we show that the translation termination factor eRF3 mediates mRNA deadenylation and decay in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The N-domain of eRF3, which is not necessarily required for translation termination, interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein PABP. When this interaction is blocked by means of deletion or overexpression of the N-domain of eRF3, half-lives of all mRNAs are prolonged. The eRF3 mutant lacking the N-domain is deficient in the poly(A) shortening. Furthermore, the eRF3-mediated mRNA decay requires translation to proceed, especially ribosomal transition through the termination codon. These results indicate that the N-domain of eRF3 mediates mRNA decay by regulating deadenylation in a manner coupled to translation.

Messenger RNA decay, which is a precisely controlled process dependent on an array of specific nucleases, cis-acting sequences, and trans-acting factors, plays an important role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression (1Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 2Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Two common structural elements of mRNA, the m7G cap at the 5′ terminus and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end, function to provide a basal level of stability to all mRNAs except for a histone-type mRNA that contains a stem loop instead of a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. The degradation of most mRNAs begins within the poly(A) tail and proceeds into the mRNA body. Thus, poly(A) shortening is the first rate-limiting step in the turnover of mRNA. The mRNA-stabilizing properties of the poly(A) tail are linked to a poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), 1The abbreviations used are: PABP, polyadenylate-binding protein; eRF, eukaryotic releasing factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; dT, deoxythymidine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, human influenza hemagglutinin; UAS, upstream activation sequence; SL, stem-loop; Luc, firefly luciferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. which is also required for poly(A) shortening (3Bernstein P.

Recently, mRNA deadenylases specific to poly(A) have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Caf1·Ccr4 complex (5Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B.

The activity of the latter poly(A) nuclease is dependent on the presence of PABP (7Boeck R. Tarun Jr., S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Muller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the translation termination factor eRF3 forms a complex with PABP to initiate mRNA decay by shortening the poly(A) tail. The eRF3-mediated mRNA decay is coupled to the proceeding of translation. Yeast Strains and Genetic Manipulations—All strains used were in the genetic background of sup35/gst1-1 mutant YK21–02 (MATα gst1-1 his3 trp1 ura3) (10Kikuchi Y. Shimatake H. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or MBS (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1) (11Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Each strain derived from YK21–02 was as follows: YNH1 (MATa YCp pKT-CAT), YNH2 (MATa YCp-SUP35 pKT-CAT), YNH3 (MATa CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN pKT-CAT), YNH4 (MATa YCp pKT-CATmt), YNH5 (MATa YCp-SUP35 pKT-CATmt), YNH6 (MATa CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN pKT-CATmt). Each strain and its genotypic difference from MBS were as follows: YNH7 (MATa pKT10), YNH9 (MATa pKT-SUP35N), YNH10 (MATa pKT-1SUP35C), YNH15 (MATa SUP35-MYC-TRP1), YNH16 (MATa PAB1-HA-HIS3 SUP35-MYC-TRP1), YNH18 (MATa PAB1-HA-HIS3 SUP35-Myc-TRP1 pKT10), YNH19 (PAB1-HA-HIS3 SUP35-Myc-TRP1 pKT-SUP35N), YTK1 (MATa PAB1-MYC-TRP), YNH22 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35), YNH23 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN), YNH30 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35 pKT-Luc), YNH31 (MATa sup35Δ:: CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN pKT-Luc), YNH35 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35 pKT-SL-Luc), YNH36 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN pKT-SL-Luc), YNH37 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35 pKT-Luc-SL), and YNH38 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN pKT-Luc-SL), YNH39 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35 YEp-CAT-mini), and YNH40 (MATa sup35Δ::CgHIS3 YCp-SUP35ΔN YEp-CATmini). SUP35-gene disruption was performed in the YNH10 strain, which had been transformed with pKT-SUP35C. The targeting construct, which consisted of the Candida glabrata HIS3 selection marker and 45-bp flanking homologous sequences for the SUP35 gene, was prepared by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with Candida glabrata genomic DNA as the template (12Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides used were: SUP35dis (5′-ACT TGC TCG GAA TAA CAT CTA TAT CTG CCC ACT AGC AAC ACA CCG ATC TAC GTA CAG TGG) and SUP35dis (3′-ATT ATT GTG TTT GCA TTT ACT TAT GTT TGC AAG AAA TCC TGA CAA TCT GGC AGC TCG). After transformation of YNH10 with the targeting construct, the resultant His+ transformants were further transformed with YCp-SUP35 or YCp-SUP35ΔN, and pKT-SUP35C was eliminated by negative selection using 5-fluoroorotic acid, to give the SUP35 control strain YNH22 and the SUP35 amino-terminal deleted strain YNH23. Epitope tagging at the carboxyl terminus of the SUP35 or PAB1 gene products was performed by a PCR-based strategy (13Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) to introduce epitope tags to the chromosomal loci. In brief, the modules with epitope tag sequence, selection marker, and 45-bp flanking homologous sequences for the SUP35 or PAB1 gene were prepared by PCR using pYM2 or pYM6 as the template, and the products were used for transformation of MBS. The synthetic oligonucleotides used were: SUP35tag (5′-GGT ACC ACA ATA GCA ATT GGT AAA ATT GTT AAA ATT GCC GAG CGT ACG CTG CAG GTC GAC) and SUP35tag (3′-TTA TTG TGT TTG CAT TTA CTT ATG TTT ATG TTT GCA AGA AAT ATC GAT GAA TTC GAG CTC) for the SUP35 gene and PAB1tag (5′-GAG TCT TTC AAA AAG GAG CAA GAA CAA CAA ACT GAG CAA GTC CGT ACG CTG CAG GTC GAC and PAB1tag (3′-GAT AAG TTT GTT GAA GTA GGG AAG TAG GTG ATT ACA TAG AGC AAT CGA TGA ATT CGA GCT C) for the PAB1 gene. The transformants carrying chromosomally integrated tagged genes were selected on SD-His plate or SD-Trp plate. In the study of mRNA degradation, we used an RNA synthesis inhibitor, thiolutin (a generous gift from Pfizer Inc.), to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. Yeast transformation with plasmid or targeting construct was performed by a standard alkali ion method. Plasmid Construction—The single-copy plasmids YCp-SUP35 and YCp-SUP35ΔN were derived from pYK807 (10Kikuchi Y. Shimatake H. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) for the expression of SUP35 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–685 and 258–685 under the control of its own promoter. For creating GST-fused recombinant Sup35 or its N-domain, the SUP35 genes corresponding to amino acid residues 1–685 and 1–257 were subcloned into pGEX6P1 to give pGEX6P1-SUP35 and pGEX6P1-SUP35N, respectively. For overproducing the N- and C-domain of Sup35, the SUP35 genes corresponding to amino acid residues 1–257 and 258–685 was subcloned into pKT10 under the GAL1 promoter to give pKT-SUP35N and pKT-SUP35C, respectively. For nonsense suppression analysis, a CAT reporter gene containing the nonsense mutation corresponding to Gln30 was prepared by a PCR-based strategy and subcolned into pKT10 to give pKT-CATmt and pKT-CAT. To construct luciferase expression vectors with stem-loop structure, a synthetic oligonucleotide SL (as described below) was inserted into XhoI site of pKT10 to give pKT-SL. The luciferase gene encoding 550 amino acids was then inserted into PvuII or KpnI site of the pKT-SL, which were 2 bp downstream and 3 bp upstream of the stem-loop structure, to give pKT-SL-Luc and pKT-Luc-SL, respectively. In pKT-Luc-SL, the luciferase gene was in-frame with the stop codon appeared 6 bp downstream of the stem-loop structure. The sequence of the synthetic oligonucleotide SL with a stem-loop structure was: 5′-GAT ATC CCG TGG AGG GGC GCG TGG TGG CGG CTG CAG CCG CCA CCA CGC GCC CCT CCA CGG GAT ATC-3′. For the transcriptional pulse-chase analysis, a CATmini-reporter gene corresponding to amino acid residues 1–32 of CAT was amplified by PCR and subcloned into YEplac191 to which GAL1 promoter sequence had been introduced, to give YEp-CATmini. Immunological Analysis—Yeast cells (A 600 = 0.6) were lysed with the buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide) using glass beads (Sigma). The extract was treated with 0.5 μg/ml RNase A for 10 min at room temperature and mixed with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science), then proteins retained in the matrix were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% polyacrylamide gel) and analyzed for the presence of Sup35 by immunoblotting. Myc-tagged Sup35 and HA-tagged Pab1 were detected using 9E10 mAb (Sigma) and 12CA5 mAb (Roche Applied Science), respectively. Immunoblot analysis was carried out using a chemiluminescence substrate: SuperSignal West Femto maximum substrate or SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA of yeast cells was extracted by a modified hot-phenol method as described below. The equivalent of 10 ml of cell culture (A 600 = 0.8) was collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C), resuspended in 500 μl of NaOAc buffer (50 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), and lysed at 60 °C by the addition of phenol equilibrated with NaOAc buffer. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min at 20 °C), the aqueous phase was extracted again with phenol, twice with chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. RNase H cleavage of mRNA was carried out in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μg of total RNA and 500 ng of oligo(dT) with 0.3 unit of RNase H (Roche Applied Science) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, RNAs were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The analysis of mRNA decay was performed by Northern blot using a 1.2% agarose gel as described previously (14Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the amount of mRNA was calculated with a Fuji BAS 1800 bioimaging analyzer. To determine the poly(A) tail length, high resolution Northern blot using polyacrylamide gel (9Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was performed as described below. Total RNA was resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and 1 × TBE (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) and electroblotted to Hybond-XL (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.25 × TBE containing 0.05% SDS at 200 mA for 2 h. The hybridization step was performed as previously described (14Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All blots were standardized by the amount of total RNA. The N-domain of eRF3/Sup35 Is Not Absolutely Required for Translation Termination—Translation termination is governed by two releasing factors, eRF1 and eRF3 (15Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). eRF1 recognizes all termination codons to release completed polypeptide chains from the ribosome (16Frolova L. Le Goff X. Rasmussen H.H. Cheperegin S. Drugeon G. Kress M. Arman I. Haenni A.L. Celis J.E. Philippe M. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and eRF3 is essential for the GTP-dependent releasing activity (17Frolova L. Le Goff X. Zhouravleva G. Davydova E. Philippe M. Kisselev L. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hoshino S. Imai M. Mizutani M. Kikuchi Y. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol.

Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). eRF3 forms a complex with eRF1 both in vivo and in vitro through their carboxyl (COOH)-terminal regions, and the interaction does not depend on their amino (NH2)-terminal domains (15Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16677-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first examined whether the N-domain of eRF3 is required for translation termination in the yeast S. cerevisiae, in which eRF3 is encoded by the SUP35 gene. For this purpose, we utilized nonsense suppression of a CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene (Fig. 1A) in a strain sup35/gst1-1 carrying a temperature-sensitive form of eRF3 (10Kikuchi Y. Shimatake H. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The reporter gene was under the control of the GAL1 promoter. At a non-permissive temperature (37 °C), the loss-of-function allele of the SUP35 gene led to a marked increase in CAT protein after 9-h incubation with galactose (Fig. 1A, upper panel), showing that sup35/gst1-1 is deficient in translation termination. The read-through phenotype could be complemented when a single copy of the wild-type SUP35 was introduced in the cells. Moreover, complementation was also observed with the amino-terminally deleted form of SUP35 (SUP35ΔN). In contrast, the expression of the wild-type CAT reporter was similarly observed in these cells (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Thus, the N-domain of Sup35 is not absolutely required for translation termination. The N-domain of eRF3/Sup35 Interacts with Pab1—To gain insight into the role of the N-domain of eRF3, we previously screened the interacting molecules and identified PABP in mammals (21Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16677-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The interaction was also detected between the yeast counterparts Sup35 and Pab1 in accordance with a recent in vitro binding study (22Cosson B. Couturier A. Chabelskaya S. Kiktev D. Inge-Vechtomov S. Philippe M. Zhouravleva G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3301-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We constructed strains where Sup35 and Pab1 were COOH-terminally tagged with Myc and HA, respectively. Myc-tagged Sup35 was detected when HA-tagged Pab1 was immunoprecipitated in yeast lysates even after RNase treatment (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Overproduction of the N-domain of Sup35 in the cells markedly decreased the immuno-precipitated amount of Sup35 (Fig. 2A, lane 6), suggesting that Sup35 interacts with Pab1 via its N-domain. The interaction was further confirmed in in vitro experiments. Cell lysate from yeast expressing epitope-tagged Pab1 was reconstituted with GST-fused recombinant Sup35 proteins, and the GST proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The Pab1 binding was observed for both Sup35 and its N-domain (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that Sup35 interacts with Pab1 via its N-domain, which is consistent with our recent results in mammalian counterparts (21Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16677-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). eRF3/Sup35 Is Required for Normal Rates of mRNA Turnover—Previous studies indicated that Pab1 regulates mRNA decay through its interaction with poly(A) tail (8Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that the N-domain of Sup35 is involved in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. Thus, we examined mRNA decay in the sup35/gst1-1 mutant. After a shift of the strain to a non-permissive temperature (37 °C) for 1 h, transcription was then inhibited by adding thiolutin, and the mRNA-decay rate was measured by Northern blot analysis. At the non-permissive temperature, the loss-of-function allele of SUP35 led to a slower decay of PGK1 mRNA compared with the wild-type strain. The half-life (t ½) of PGK1 mRNA was ∼3 h in the sup35/gst1-1 mutant (Fig. 1B), whereas it was 1 h in the wild-type strain (data not shown). When a single copy of SUP35 was introduced into the mutant, the slow degradation phenotype was completely returned to the level of the wild-type strain (t ½ ∼ 1 h). In sharp contrast, the amino-terminally deleted form of SUP35 showed a reduced level of complementation (t ½ ∼ 2 h). These results indicate that the loss-of-function allele of SUP35 inhibits mRNA degradation and that the N-domain plays an important role in the function. Since the N-domain-deleted SUP35 still shows partial complementation, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that the C-domain of Sup35 might also be involved in the regulation of mRNA decay. To investigate the significance of the Sup35-Pab1 interaction in mRNA decay, we examined the effect of overproducing the Sup35 N-domain, since its overexpression resulted in inhibition of the interaction between Sup35 and Pab1 (see Fig. 2A). All the mRNAs tested (PGK1, MFA2, and CYH2) were stabilized by the N-domain overexpression, i.e. mRNA decay is impaired in the transformed cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest the importance of the Pab1 interaction with Sup35 via its N-domain. To elucidate the direct role of the N-domain in mRNA decay, we further constructed a SUP35 disruptant carrying YCp-SUP35ΔN (sup35ΔN) for the expression of N-domain-deleted Sup35. We also constructed a wild-type control strain, which carries YCp-SUP35 for the expression of full-length Sup35. Both genes were under the own promoter of SUP35, and the expression levels were almost the same as that of endogenous SUP35 in the wild-type strain (data not shown). The control strain expressing full-length Sup35 showed no difference in the mRNA-turnover rate from the wild-type strain (data not shown). In sharp contrast, the sup35ΔN strain showed a slower decay rate in PGK1 and MFA2 mRNAs compared with the control strain (Fig. 3A). Thus, the deletion of the N-domain of Sup35 caused a defect in mRNA decay. eRF3/Sup35 Functions in mRNA Deadenylation—To determine which step in mRNA decay was affected in the sup35ΔN mutant, we first examined the poly(A)-tail length of mRNA. For this purpose, small sized MFA2 mRNAs were chosen because the size difference is readily detectable. Compared with the control strain, the sup35ΔN mutant accumulated longer MFA2 transcripts at steady-state level (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Removal of poly(A) tails by treating the transcripts with RNase H and oligo(dT) exhibited the same length of MFA2 mRNAs (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the size differences were due to the length of the poly(A) tails. The maximal poly(A) tail lengths for MFA2 mRNA were estimated to be 86 ± 4 and 107 ± 3 adenylate residues in the control and the sup35ΔN strain, respectively. Thus, in the sup35ΔN mutant, MFA2 mRNA was ∼20 adenylate residues longer than that in the control strain. The same phenotypes were also observed by sup35/gst1-1ts mutation or by overproducing the N-domain of Sup35 (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, the deadenylation process of the poly(A) tail was analyzed by a transcriptional pulse-chase method (6Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Transcription of the CAT reporter gene was rapidly induced and then repressed by the carbon source regulation of the GAL1 UAS. The metabolism of the poly(A) tail of the newly transcribed CAT mRNA was chased over time. As shown in Fig. 3E, the deadenylation rate was impaired in the sup35ΔN mutant. These results indicate that the mutant strain has a defect in the deadenylation step of mRNA decay. eRF3/Sup35-mediated mRNA Decay Requires Proceeding of Translation—These results clearly indicate that in addition to the role of the C-domain of Sup35 in translation termination, the N-domain is involved in mRNA decay. To elucidate the interrelation between the two functions of Sup35, we examined the decay of luciferase reporter mRNA with a translation-blocking secondary structure immediately upstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 4A, middle panel). The secondary structure led to the inhibition of translation (see Supplemental Fig. S1). Although the normal luciferase reporter mRNA showed a slower decay rate in the sup35ΔN mutant compared with the control strain (Fig. 4B, left panel), the modified reporter mRNA showed the same decay rate between these strains (Fig. 4B, middle panel), indicating that Sup35-mediated mRNA decay requires ongoing translation. To test whether the translation dependence involves ribosome transit through the termination codon, we next introduced the translation-blocking secondary structure immediately upstream of the termination codon of the reporter mRNA (Fig. 4A, right panel). The secondary structure was confirmed to inhibit even the transition of 80S ribosome at elongation (see Supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, reporter mRNA with the secondary structure inserted up-stream of the termination codon was again not stabilized in sup35ΔN (Fig. 4B, right panel). Thus, Sup35 is strongly suggested to be involved in the translation termination-dependent mRNA decay. Based on these results, we conclude that eRF3/Sup35 regulates mRNA deadenylation and decay in a manner dependent on translation. In our study, the eRF3-mediated mRNA decay was shown to require the ribosomal transition through termination codon. Therefore, we propose a model of “translation termination-coupled mRNA decay.” In this model, translation termination triggers the decomposition of a protein complex consisting of eRF1, eRF3, PABP, and a putative deadenylase, which leads to the exposure of poly(A) and its shortening (see Fig. 4C). Recently, we have identified Pan2 as a candidate deadenylase, which is involved in the complex (data not shown). Thus, mRNA is degraded after translation is terminated. If mRNA is degraded while translation is still in progress, deleterious truncated proteins may be synthesized. It is reasonable to assume that the termination signal triggers mRNA degradation. In relation to this, there is another example in which the translation-termination signal functions as the trigger of the mRNA degradation. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a process that down-regulates aberrant gene expression by degrading mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (23Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathew M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 827-847Google Scholar, 24Maquat L.E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathew M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 849-868Google Scholar). In this case, eRF3 also functions in the recognition of the termination codon. Interestingly, the mRNA-decay pathway triggered by the premature termination codon is deadenylation-independent. Thus, it will be intriguing to clarify the switching mechanism between the two different decay pathways. We are grateful to Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2034260252,"Deregulation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway is a hallmark of human cancer. The core members of this pathway include the tumor suppressor protein, pRB, which through binding to a number of cellular proteins, most notably members of the E2F transcription factor family, regulates progression through the cell division cycle. With the aim of identifying transcriptional changes provoked by deregulation of the pRB pathway, we have used cell lines that conditionally express a constitutively active phosphorylation site mutant of pRB (pRBΔCDK) or p16INK4A (p16). The expression of pRBΔCDK and p16 resulted in significant repression and activation of a large number of genes as measured by high density oligonucleotide array analysis. Transcriptional changes were found in genes that are essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation. In agreement with previous results, we found a high degree of overlap between genes regulated by p16 and pRB. Data we have obtained previously for E2F family members showed that 74 of the genes repressed by pRB and p16 were induced by the E2Fs and 23 genes that were induced by pRB and p16 were repressed by the E2Fs. Thus, we have identified 97 genes as physiological targets of the pRB pathway, and the further characterization of these genes should provide insights into how this pathway controls proliferation. We show that Gibbs sampling detects enrichment of several sequence motifs, including E2F consensus binding sites, in the upstream regions of these genes and use this enrichment in an in silico filtering process to refine microarray derived gene lists.

We show that Gibbs sampling detects enrichment of several sequence motifs, including E2F consensus binding sites, in the upstream regions of these genes and use this enrichment in an in silico filtering process to refine microarray derived gene lists. Data generated in the last decade have pointed to a central role for the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway in regulating the progression through the G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar). The core members of this pathway include, in addition to pRB (and its family members p107 and p130), the D-type cyclins that, in association with CDK4 and CDK6, promote proliferation of the cell cycle, in part through the phosphorylation of the pRB family members, and the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that specifically bind and inhibit the activity of CDK4 and CDK6. The high frequency by which alterations have been identified in the pRB pathway in human cancer taken together with the understanding of the central role of its core members in regulating cell proliferation have led several researchers to suggest that the deregulation of the pRB pathway is an obligatory event in human cancer (e.g. see Ref. 2Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21908) Google Scholar).The biochemical mechanism by which pRB is restricting cell proliferation is widely believed to involve protein-protein interactions. Several hundred proteins have been reported to bind to pRB (3Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), however, the relevance of most of these interactions is poorly understood. The most studied and the best understood targets for pRB are members of the E2F transcription factor family (4Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The E2F transcription factors are essential for the proper transcriptional regulation of a number of genes, whose gene products control the progression through the cell cycle. These genes include CCNE1 (cyclin E1), CCNA2 (cyclin A2), and CDC25A, which are all essential for the entry into the S phase of the cell cycle, and genes that are involved in the regulation of DNA replication, such as CDC6, DHFR, and TK1 (thymidine kinase) (6Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). When E2Fs bind to the promoters of these genes in complexes with pRB or its family members, gene expression is repressed. The repression is effectively relieved by CDK 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PWM, position weight matrix; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PWM, position weight matrix; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.-mediated phosphorylation of the pRB family members, resulting in transcription of the E2F-regulated genes and subsequent progression through the cell cycle.Because of the central role of the E2Fs in regulating the progression through the cell division cycle, we and others have used gene expression profiling and chromosomal immunoprecipitation assays to identify novel E2F target genes (5Muller H.

The data obtained from these expression profiles have shown that the E2Fs, in addition to having a role in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, also regulate the expression of genes controlling differentiation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The aim of the current study was to identify transcriptional changes provoked by the reintroduction of a functional pRB pathway in human tumors. By performing such a study we expected to identify genes whose deregulation, as a result of a non-functional pRB pathway, could contribute to transformation. Moreover, we also expected that the gene expression would give valuable therapeutic biomarkers, which could be useful when compounds aimed at restoring a functional pRB pathway in tumor cells will be tested. To perform these studies, we chose the widely used human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS as an experimental model because these cells do not express p16. Moreover, because of the high level of CDK activity in U-2 OS cells, the majority of pRB is in its hyperphosphorylated state. Reintroduction of p16 and a non-phosphorylatable version of pRB results in cell cycle arrest in these cells, which can be abrogated by re-expression of the E2Fs (14Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K.

Here, we report the identification of 74 genes, whose expression is repressed by p16 and pRB, and induced by E2F. Gibbs sampling performed in the upstream regions of these genes detects the enrichment of several sequence motifs, including E2F consensus binding sites. The enriched sequence motifs were used in a search of roughly 10,000 human upstream regulatory regions to identify novel E2F target gene candidates and to refine the microarray data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Cell Cycle Analysis—U-2 OS cells expressing tetracycline responsive p16 or constitutively active pRb (pRbΔCDK) alleles were described previously (17Jiang H.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (South American), 2 μg/ml puromycin. 200 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline. U-2 OS cells expressing HA-tagged ER-E2F1 (5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K.

Nearly confluent cultures of U-2 OS clones were trypsinized and plated at 5 × 106 cells per 15-cm plate on the day before induction. Induction of E2F activity was accomplished by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen to a final concentration of 300 nm for 4 h. Exogenous p16 or pRbΔCDK proteins were induced by rinsing cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by growing in tetracycline-free media. After the first hour of culture the media was changed again. RNA was isolated at 12 h for pRbΔCDK, or 16 h for p16. For cell cycle analysis, cells were pulse labeled for 30 min in 20 μm bromodeoxyuridine, harvested by trypsinzation, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and permeabilized in 70% methanol. DNA was denatured in 2 n HCl for 20 min and cells were neutralized in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, for 2 min. Bromodeoxyuridine was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and DNA was stained in 0.5 ml of propidium iodide (10 μg/ml).RNA Preparation—RNA for analysis by microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and integrity was determined by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. For use in quantitative PCR, the protocol included on-column treatment with DNase I according to the manufacturer's protocol.Immunostaining—Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 16 h. Expression of HA-tagged pRbΔCDK protein was detected with anti-HA (12CA5) antibody. Exogenous p16 protein was detected with anti-p16 (Santa Cruz sc-467).Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Changes in gene expression were confirmed using SYBR Green quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR following the protocols from Applied Biosystems.

Target concentration was 30 μg of fragmented cRNA in 200 μl of hybridization solution. Images were scanned with a HewlettPackard GeneArray scanner and the images were analyzed using Affymetrix's Microarray suite 5.0 software. All targets were hybridized to two different sets of HG-U95 microarrays (chips Av2 through E). Chip replicas were analyzed as described in Ref. 5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar. The probe sets that were identified as regulated by the analysis of chip replicas were inserted into GeneSpring™ 5.1 software as gene lists for visualization, annotation, and clustering purposes. All data obtained in the array experiments will be made available. 2array.ifom-firc.it.Generation and Use of the Promoter-Exon 1 Data Base—We used the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser (assembly released 28th of June 2002) 3genome.ucsc.edu. to retrieve genomic DNA sequence for 16,031 human Reference Sequence accession numbers (NM_001234) available as of 02/11/02 including 1000 bp of upstream sequence as reported by the genome browser. Then, we blasted the exon 1 sequence as reported by the genome browser to 100 bp of the 5′-end of the cDNA as reported by the reference sequence entry. Only if this blast reported a hit with 99 or 100% identity in the correct orientation (plus/plus strand), did we consider the promoter-exon 1 sequence for further analysis. This procedure reduced the number of entries in the promoter-exon 1 data base from 16,031 to 9,652 entries. All position weight matrix searches using this data base were performed exactly as described by Ref. 21Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar.Position Weight Matrix Similarity (PWM Similarity)—The test for PWM similarity was performed in two different ways. 1) Using 50,000,000 random 25-mer oligonucleotide sequences, each sequence was presented to each PWM at the stringency indicated in Table II. A PWM score was calculated as described in Ref. 21Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar. If the PWM score for that sequence was equal or higher than the stringency indicated in Table II, the oligonucleotide sequence was scored as a hit. In this test, similar matrices have the tendency to recognize similar sequences as a hit. The degree of similarity was quantified using the binomial distribution where the number of successes is the number of hits that two PWMs have in common, the number of trials is the number of hits of one PWM, and the probability of success is the number of hits of the second PWM divided by 50,000,000. The cumulative p value was then calculated. PWMs were judged similar if this value fell between 0.99999 and 1 (i.e. the number of successes lies far out in the tail of the distribution). The relatively high number of random oligonucleotide sequences was necessary because half of the PWMs would recognize only 1 hit in roughly 10,000 sequences. 2) To visualize the similarity of PWMs, the same random sequences were presented to the PWMs at a stringency that would recognize 5% of the sequences as a hit. By doing so, each sequence was assigned a pattern of 0s and 1s, where 0 stands for no hit with a given PWM and 1 stands for a hit with a given PWM. These patterns were analyzed by cluster analysis using the GeneSpring 5.1. software (Silicon Genetics).Table IIMotifs enriched in E2F target gene promotersScoring Scheme for in Silico E2F Target Gene Filter—Based on the test for PWM similarity, each PWM was assigned to a PWM family: 1) E2F site (M00024, M00050, M00180, motif 5, motif “Kel et al.” (21Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and motif “Farnham”); 2) GC-rich (motif 7, motif 20, motif 33, motif 63, and motif 71); 3) CCAAT box (motif 4); and 4) CCAAT-like (motif 45). If within a PWM family more than one PWM recognizes a binding site in a promoter, only the PWM with the highest enrichment factor is considered. The enrichment factors of the PWMs that recognize a binding site in a promoter are multiplied to give the final score. Multiplication of enrichment factors is justified because the probability to find two or more motifs in the same promoter is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of finding each motif in the promoter.RESULTSPreviously, we have described the identification of several hundred genes whose expression changes significantly upon activation of E2F1, E2F2, or E2F3 (5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In total, between 7 and 10% of all genes tested in this screen showed changes in expression level. Computer-assisted motif searches in the promoters of these genes did not show a significant enrichment for the consensus E2F DNA binding site (TTTSSCGC). 4H. Muller, unpublished data. There are several possibilities that could account for this observation. Although the more obvious explanation is that many of the genes are false positives, and several of them are not direct targets of the E2Fs, we do not believe that this is the case, because Northern blotting or quantitative PCR confirmed the microarray results for more than 95% of the genes tested (Ref. 5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Moreover, our current understanding of the E2F binding site consensus and more generally the mechanism of E2F mediated regulation of transcription is limited. Several E2F-regulated genes have been described (e.g. CCNE1, CCNA2, and MYBL2) that do not contain perfect consensus E2F DNA binding sites (22Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S.

Likewise, a number of genes identified in an E2F4-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation assay do not contain a consensus E2F binding site (11Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that E2F-mediated transcription control is exerted in tight collaboration with other transcription factors such as RYBP, YY1, Max/Mga, and Smads (25Schlisio S. Halperin T. Vidal M. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5775-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y.

Cell. 2002; 110: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Considering these observations, we sought to identify the functionally relevant E2F target genes by comparing the E2F-induced changes in gene expression to the corresponding changes induced by pRB and/or p16. Because endogenous E2F activity is repressed by the induction of pRB or p16 in U-2 OS cells, genes that in this setting show a pattern of regulation opposite to the one observed for induction of E2F activity are likely to be the relevant E2F target genes that are deregulated in cancer cells upon loss of p16 or pRB function.We took advantage of two U-2 OS-derived cell lines that overexpress either pRbΔCDK (18Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or p16 (17Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a tetracycline-regulated manner. Fig. 1 shows that both cell lines uniformly express high levels of p16 or pRbΔCDK as tested by immunostaining after removal of tetracycline (Fig. 1, A and B). This observation was confirmed by Western blot analysis showing that both pRbΔCDK and p16 reach high levels of expression 20 h after removal of tetracycline from the culture medium (Fig. 1, E and F). Both proteins were undetectable at time 0 h and reached near maximum levels of expression 16 h after induction. In the p16 cell line, endogenous pRB began to accumulate in its hypophosphorylated form 12 h after induction of p16 expression, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms began to diminish at this time (Fig. 1E). Northern blot analysis using a PAI1 specific probe, a gene previously identified as an E2F repressed and pRb-induced gene (5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 28Koziczak M. Krek W. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), revealed significant accumulation of PAI1 mRNA in both cell lines 12 h after induction of pRbΔCDK and 16 h after induction of p16 expression (Fig. 1G). The accumulation of PAI1 mRNA upon induction of pRbΔCDK and p16 expression provides an example of a gene whose expression level changes in the opposite direction as observed upon induction of E2F activity. The induction of pRbΔCDK and p16 expression is capable of arresting the cell cycle (17Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest in turn can regulate the expression of hundreds of genes (e.g. see Ref. 29Cho R.J. Huang M. Campbell M.J. Dong H. Steinmetz L. Sapinoso L. Hampton G. Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We used the induction of PAI1 expression and the repression of cyclin E1 expression as parameters to identify the earliest time point where significant changes in the expression can be observed in the absence of detectable cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1, C and D). The time points chosen for further analysis were 12 h after the induction of pRbΔCDK and 16 h after the induction of p16. The choice of early time points should ensure maximum specificity in terms of regulation of endogenous E2F activity in the absence of indirect interference because of cell cycle arrest.Fig. 1Functional characterization of U-2 OS cells expressing p16 or pRBΔCDK in a tetracyclin-regulated manner. U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding tetracycline-repressed wild type p16 or HA-pRbΔCDK were tested for uniform expression and to determine the appropriate time points for RNA extraction. A, immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for p16 was used to determine that most cells express the endogenous gene upon removal of tetracycline. Staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to control for the number of cells. B, immunofluorescence using an antibody against the HA tag present on HA-pRbΔCDK demonstrated that most cells express the exogenous gene. C and D, cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide-bromodeoxyuridine fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. No cell cycle block can be observed at the time points utilized for microarray analysis.

F, Western immunoblot analysis demonstrating robust expression of HA-pRbΔCDK (indicated by arrow) upon removal of tetracycline. G, expression of the E2F-repressed PAI1 gene was monitored upon induction of p16 or HA-pRbΔCDK by Northern blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used oligonucleotide gene expression microarrays to identify genes whose expression changes significantly in the two cell lines after induction of pRbΔCDK and p16. Total RNA was isolated 0 (control) and 12 h after induction of pRbΔCDK expression and 0 (control) and 16 h after p16 expression. Each target cRNA was hybridized to two microarrays to facilitate statistical analysis of the results. The data were analyzed using Microarray suite version 5.0 (Affymetrix) and GeneSpring™ (Silicon Genetics) software. We also re-analyzed the microarray data gathered for the induction of E2F1, -2, and -3 activity derived from the HU6800FL + Hu35k chipset (Affymetrix) that had been analyzed previously using Microarray suite version 4. During this procedure, around 5% of the genes considered previously were discarded as insignificant but the total number of genes found regulated was nearly doubled. These differences are entirely because of improvements in the statistical algorithm used by Microarray suite version 5.0, not to differences in the analysis settings.To compare the data that were derived from two different chipsets, we restricted the following analyses to probe sets that were present on both chipsets. In total, we analyzed 42,089 probe sets (24.600 Unigenes) in the E2F induction experiments and 62,907 probe sets (40.915 Unigenes) in the pRbΔCDK and p16 induction experiments. 23,527 probe sets (16.897 Unigenes) were found to be comparable among each other and were used for further analysis.Activation of the E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3) or induced expression of pRB or p16 resulted in significant changes in the expression of a number of genes. For each of the activated or induced proteins, we organized the up-regulated and the repressed genes into a total of 10 lists of regulated genes, 5 lists of up-regulated genes, and 5 lists of down-regulated genes. We asked how to combine the lists in a way that generates a high degree of specificity without excessive loss of potential candidate genes. We used published information about the identity of E2F target genes (Refs. 5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K.

This list contains 47 genes, 38 of which were present on both chip sets we analyzed (Fig. 2A). We reasoned that a meaningful combination of lists of regulated genes should maximize both the total number of known target genes as well as the proportion of known target genes relative to the total number of genes in the combined list. Because the activity of E2Fs is repressed by induction of pRB and/or p16, we focused our attention on combinations of lists with opposing effects on gene expression of the E2Fs on the one h"

AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine (PM) inhibit both the formation of AGEs and development of complications in animal models of diabetes. PM also inhibits the chemical modification of protein by advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) during lipid peroxidation reactions in vitro. We show here that several PM adducts, formed in incubations of PM with linoleate and arachidonate in vitro, are also excreted in the urine of PM-treated animals. The PM adducts N-nonanedioyl-PM (derived from linoleate), N-pentanedioyl-PM, N-pyrrolo-PM, and N-(2-formyl)-pyrrolo-PM (derived from arachidonate), and N-formyl-PM and N-hexanoyl-PM (derived from both fatty acids) were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of rat urine. Levels of these adducts were increased 5–10-fold in the urine of PM-treated diabetic and hyperlipidemic rats, compared with control animals. We conclude that the PM functions, at least in part, by trapping intermediates in AGE/ALE formation and propose a mechanism for PM inhibition of AGE/ALE formation involving cleavage of α-dicarbonyl intermediates in glycoxidation and lipoxidation reactions. We also conclude that ALEs derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids are increased in diabetes and hyperlipidemia and may contribute to development of long term renal and vascular pathology in these diseases.

Non-enzymatic chemical modification of protein by reducing sugars, known as the Maillard reaction, is implicated in the development of pathology during aging and in chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimers disease (1Thorpe S.R.

The presence of severe hyperlipidemia in the STZ diabetic rats and the reno-protective effects of PM in both the diabetic and the Zucker rat suggested that lipids, rather than carbohydrates, might be the primary source of chemical modification of proteins in diabetes. In the present study, we have extended earlier work on the reaction of PM with the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleate and arachidonate, to identify other intermediates trapped by PM during lipid peroxidation reactions and to determine whether PM functions as an inhibitor of advanced lipoxidation reactions in vivo. We show that several lipid-derived PM adducts formed in in vitro reactions are also detected in the urine of PM-treated control, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic rats and that these adducts are present at substantially higher concentrations in the urine of diabetic and hyperlipidemic animals, compared with control rats. Our results support a role for lipoxidation reactions in the chemical modification of proteins and development of complications in diabetes and prediabetic hyperlipidemic states and demonstrate that the protective effects of PM are consistent with its role in reducing plasma lipids and trapping intermediates in lipoxidation reactions in vivo. Materials—Except where indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific. Reaction of PM with Fatty Acids—PM (1 mm) and either linoleic acid (LA) (5 mm) or arachidonic acid (AA) (5 mm) were incubated in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a shaking water bath at 37 °C, and phosphate buffers were sterilized by ultrafiltration through 0.2-μm syringe filters (Costar Corp., Acton, MA). Aliquots were taken at 0, 1, 3, and 6 days, quenched with a final concentration of 1 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, and frozen at –70 °C until analyzed. Samples were diluted 1:10 in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ) before analysis by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and/or positive ion electrospray ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ESI+-LC/MS/MS). Control incubations consisted of either PM or PUFA alone. Synthesis of PM Adducts—All synthesized PM adduct standards were purified by RP-HPLC and characterized by ESI+-LC/MS/MS and/or by 1H and 13C NMR, as described below. The structures of synthesized PM adducts that were also detected in urine are shown in Fig. 1. N-Hexanoyl-PM (HAPM) and N-nonanedioyl-PM (NDAPM) were synthesized from PM and hexanoyl chloride or nonanedioic acid monomethyl ester, respectively, as described (10Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J.

Equimolar amounts (0.6 mmol) of d 11-hexanoic acid (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Pierce) were dissolved in 15 ml of dimethylformamide and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. PM·(HCl)2 (0.6 mmol) in 1 ml of 200 mm borate buffer, pH 9, was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted to 30 ml with water, and the pH was adjusted to 8.1 with 1 m NaOH. The mixture was extracted three times with an equal volume of diethyl ether, and the pooled extracts were dried under nitrogen. The resulting white powder was reconstituted in 1% HFBA, and d 11-HAPM was purified in 20% yield by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. For ESI+-MS, m/z = 278 [M+H]+. N-Pentanedioyl-PM (PDAPM) was synthesized from PM and glutaric anhydride. PM·(HCl2) (0.24 mg; 1 μmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of 250 mm NaHCO3, pH 10, and placed in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. A total of 3.4 mg (30 μmol) of glutaric anhydride was added in three aliquots at 10-min intervals, and the reaction was continued for an additional 10 min after the last addition. The reaction mixture was then dried overnight in vacuo (Savant Speed Vac, Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The residue was reconstituted in 1% HFBA, and PDAPM was purified (20% yield) by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. For ESI+-MS, m/z = 283 [M+H]+. N-Formyl-PM (FAPM) was synthesized according to the method of Yamada and Okamoto (14Yamada H. Okamoto T. Yakugaku Zasshi. 1975; 95: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, pyridoxine·HCl (1.14 g, 10 mmol) was added to 4.8 ml of formamide (120 mmol) and incubated in a heating block at 100 °C for 24 h. The resulting red oil was diluted 1:100 in 1% HFBA, and a red precipitate formed immediately and was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was fractionated by RP-HPLC, and a region containing FAPM was collected and dried overnight in vacuo. FAPM was subsequently purified in 50% yield upon re-injection of the collected fraction. For ESI+-MS, m/z = 197 [M+H]+. Structure conformation was provided by 1H NMR on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) Inova 500 MHz instrument using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (d 6-Me2SO) as solvent. The chemical shifts were: δ 2.49 (s, 3H), 4.37 (d, 2H, J = 5.8 Hz), 4.72 (s, 2H), 5.20 (s, 1H), 5.75 (s, 1H), 8.01 (s, 1H), 8.92 (t, 1H, J = 5.8 Hz), and 11.2 (s, 1H). N-Pyrrolo-PM (PyPM) was synthesized by the method of D'Silva and Walker (15D'Silva C. Walker D.A. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 6715-6718Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, PM·(HCl)2 (0.27 g, 1 mmol) and 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran (0.16 g, 1 mmol) were dissolved in 4.25 ml of pyridine: acetic acid:water (1.9:1.35:1), and the mixture was reacted in a heating block at 100 °C for 2 h. The resulting brown liquid was diluted 1:100 in 1% HFBA, and PyPM was purified in 95% yield by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. For ESI+-MS, m/z = 219 [M+H]+. Structure conformation was provided by 500 MHz 1H and 13C NMR using d 6-Me2SO as solvent. The chemical shifts were: 1H NMR δ 2.60 (s, 3H), 4.55 (s, 2H), 5.30 (s, 2H), 5.97 (s, 2H), 6.75 (s, 2H), and 8.20 (s, 1H). The chemical shifts were: 13C NMR δ 15.8 [–CH3 (PM)], 42.3 [–CH2– (PM)], 57.5 [–CH2– (PM)], 107.9 [–CH=(pyrrole)], 121.2 [–CH=(pyrrole)], and 130.6–152.2 [5 pyridinyl (PM)]. N-(2-Formyl)-pyrrolo-PM (FPyPM) was synthesized from PM and xylose based on the method of Hayase and Kato (16Hayase F. Kato H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 467-473Google Scholar). PM·(HCl)2 (2.4 g, 10 mmol) and xylose (1.5 g, 10 mmol) were dissolved in 5 ml of water and heated at 95 °C for 2 h, after adjusting the pH to 4 with 6 n NaOH. The resulting brown liquid was extracted three times with equal volumes of diethyl ether, and the pooled ether extracts were evaporated under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 1% HFBA, and FPyPM was purified in 0.1% yield by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. For ESI+-MS, m/z = 247 [M+H]+. Structure conformation was provided by 500 MHz 1H NMR using d 6-Me2SO as a solvent. The chemical shifts were: δ 2.35 (s, 3H), 4.38 (d, 2H, J = 4.7 Hz), 5.20 (t, 1H, J = 4.7 Hz), 5.60 (s, 2H), 6.15 (dd, 1H, J = 2.5, 3.9 Hz), 6.82 (unresolved dd, 1H), 7.00 (dd, 1H, J = 1.7, 3.9 Hz), 7.99 (s, 1H), and 9.61 (s, 1H). Quantification of PM Adduct Standards—The concentrations of FAPM, HAPM, NDAPM, and PDAPM standards were determined by acid hydrolysis and subsequent quantification of released PM, as described (10Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21177-21184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of standard were hydrolyzed in 2 n HCl for 2 h at 95 °C, dried in vacuo, and then reconstituted in 1% HFBA. The concentrations of standards were determined, based on the yield of PM measured by RP-HPLC. Because FPyPM and PyPM were stable to acid hydrolysis and did not exhibit the fluorescence characteristic of compounds containing PM, the concentrations of these standards were determined by RP-HPLC using absorbance detection as described below. FPyPM and PyPM concentrations were estimated using the molar extinction coefficient of PM (92,000 m–1 cm–1). RP-HPLC—Samples were analyzed on a Waters (Milford, MA) 626/600 HPLC system, using an Aquasil (Thermo Hypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA) C-18 column (5 μm; 250 mm × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 0.95 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% HFBA in water and Solvent B was 90% acetonitrile in water. The gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, 15% B; 2–37 min, linear ramp to 90% B; 37–40 min, hold at 90% B; 40–50 min, return to 15% B; 50–65 min, hold at 15% B. PM and PM adducts were detected by fluorescence (λex = 295 nm, λem = 393 nm) and/or by absorbance at 294 nm. Mass Spectrometry—ESI+-LC/MS/MS was performed on a Micromass (Beverly, MA) Quattro LC mass spectrometer equipped with an Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 series HPLC system and an Aquasil C-18 column (5 μm, 250 × 2 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% HFBA in water and Solvent B was 90% acetonitrile in water; all solvents including water were of HPLC grade. The gradient was as follows: 0–5 min, 15% B; 5–37 min, linear ramp to 90% B; 37–42 min, hold at 90% B; 42–52 min, return to 15% B; 52–60 min, hold at 15% B. The capillary was held at 3.11 kV, and the sampling cone and collision cell were held at 14 and 20 V, respectively. The source block and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 100 and 350 °C, respectively. The identity of all synthesized PM adducts detected in urine was unequivocally established by mixing experiments and by ESI+-LC/MS/MS, including precursor-ion and product-ion spectrum scans. PM and PM adducts generate m/z = 152 as the predominant product-ion, corresponding to the deaminated ion (PM), deamidated ion (FAPM, HAPM, NDAPM, and PDAPM), or loss of the pyrrole functional group (FPyPM and PyPM), when subjected to collision-induced dissociation. In addition to m/z = 152, unidentified intramolecular rearrangement ions of PM (m/z = 140 and 134) were consistently observed in production analyses of all PM adducts, as well as the [M+H]+ ion of PM, m/z = 169. Animal Studies—All studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of South Carolina. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased at 5 weeks of age from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). Male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF/Gmi-fa), lean Zucker diabetic fatty (+/fa), and Zucker non-diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats were purchased at 5 weeks of age from Genetic Models, Inc. (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Rats were housed in the Animal Resource Facility for 1 week before studies were started; all animals had free access to food and water throughout the study. Plasma glucose and plasma triglycerides were measured with Sigma Kit No. 315 and No. 339, respectively. Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on Harlan Teklad (Indianapolis, IN) rodent diet (W). Diabetes was induced by a single tail-vein injection of 45 mg/kg streptozocin in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, as described previously (11Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D. Beattie R.J. Basgen J.M. Steffes M.W. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Non-diabetic animals were sham-injected with buffer only. Animals with plasma glucose above 16 mm were classified as diabetic and assigned to either an untreated diabetic control group (STZ-Db, n = 16) or a diabetic group receiving PM (STZ-Db+PM, n = 16) in drinking water at 1 g/liter. Non-Db (n = 12) animals received PM (non-Db+PM) in drinking water at 2 g/liter, to compensate, in part, for the lower water consumption of these animals. Diabetic animals received insulin (3–5 IU; Humulin; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) 3 times/week to maintain body weight and limit hyperglycemia. Plasma glucose in STZ-Db animals was ∼25 mm throughout the study, whereas plasma glucose in non-Db animals remained at ∼5 mm. Further experimental details are provided elsewhere (11Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D. Beattie R.J. Basgen J.M. Steffes M.W. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Zucker rats were maintained on Purina (St. Louis, MO) 5008 rat chow (16.7% of total calories from fat). The ZDF/Gmi-fa rat develops non-insulin-dependent diabetes on this diet. Plasma glucose increased to 20 mm by week 5 of the study and rose gradually to 40 mm during the course of the 23-week study. Animals were assigned to either untreated or treated groups (n = 10/group) designated as follows: +/fa control (L), +/fa receiving PM (L+PM) in drinking water at 2 g/liter, fa/fa control (F), fa/fa receiving PM (F+PM) in drinking water at 2 g/liter, ZDF/Gmi-fa control (ZDF-Db), and ZDF/Gmi-fa receiving PM (ZDF-Db+PM) in drinking water at 1 g/liter. Plasma glucose in +/fa and fa/fa rats was ∼5 and 8 mm, respectively. Urine Preparation and Analysis—Rats were housed in metabolic cages for 24 h to collect urine; urine collection beakers contained several drops of toluene to prevent microbial growth. Urine samples were stored at –70 °C, and aliquots of urine from each group of rats were pooled for analysis. For analyses of NDAPM and FPyPM, either 8 ml of diabetic or 1.5 ml of non-diabetic urine, containing ∼1 mg of creatinine, was adjusted to pH 1 with 6 m HCl and centrifuged (Marathon, Fisher Scientific) at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove particulate matter. The supernatant was then applied to a 60-mg Oasis™ MCX column (Waters), which was washed sequentially with 4 ml each of 0.1 n HCl and methanol and then eluted with 4 ml of 10% concentrated NH4OH in methanol. The eluted fractions were dried in vacuo, reconstituted in 1% HFBA, and ultrafiltered prior to analysis. For analyses of FAPM, HAPM, PDAPM, and PyPM, aliquots of urine were diluted 1:20 in 1% HFBA, ultrafiltered as described above, and analyzed directly without further purification. PM adducts were quantified using d 11-HAPM as the internal standard, which was added to urine samples prior to sample preparation. Standard curves were constructed with mixtures of serially diluted authentic standards and constant amounts of d 11-HAPM. Total daily excretion of PM adducts was calculated using average 24-h urine output volumes for each animal group: non-Db+PM and STZ-Db+PM animals, ∼30 and 145 ml of urine, respectively; L+PM, F+PM, and ZDF-Db+PM animals, ∼15, 38, and 158 ml of urine, respectively. Reaction of PM with PUFAs—We have shown previously that PM traps intermediates formed during lipid peroxidation reactions in vitro (10Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21177-21184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As an extension of these studies and to identify additional PM-lipid characteristic of each of these fatty acids, PM was incubated with either LA or AA in phosphate buffer at physiological pH for 6 days. Approximately 60% of PM was consumed in both of the PM-PUFA incubations after 6 days. As shown in Fig. 2, products containing PM were observed in both the LA and AA systems. Product characterization, described below, focused on those PM derivatives that were subsequently detected in the plasma and urine of PM-treated animals. Eight PM adducts were observed in the incubation of PM with LA (Fig. 2A). Six of these (m/z = 267, 305, 323, 339, 377, and 479) had been observed previously, of which two had been identified, the hexanoate amide HAPM (m/z = 267) and the nonanedioate amide NDAPM (m/z = 339) (10Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21177-21184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The PM derivative with m/z = 197 has now been identified as the formic acid amide FAPM, based on MRM-LC/MS/MS analysis of mixing experiments with authentic standard. The structure of the PM adducts having m/z = 305, 321, 323, 377, and 479, which were not detected in urine, have not been determined. However, the product with m/z = 479 is consistent with a PM-LA dioxo derivative, and the products with m/z = 323 and 305 are consistent with a hydrated furan and a furan derivative of PM. Although formed in different yields than in reactions with LA, four adducts (FAPM, HAPM, and unknowns with m/z = 305 and 377) were also detected in incubations of PM with AA (Fig. 2B). Four new compounds were also observed in the PM-AA incubation. Three of these were identified as pyrrole (PyPM), formylpyrrole (FPyPM), and pentanedioate (PDAPM) derivatives of PM, respectively, by MRM-LC/MS/MS analysis of mixing experiments with authentic standards. None of the other products in either the LA or AA reactions were detected in the urine of animals treated with PM, possibly because they are early or transient intermediates or were labile during urine collection or storage. Detection of PM Adducts in Vivo—To determine whether PM also traps intermediates formed in lipid peroxidation reactions in vivo, we treated diabetic and obese animals with PM in drinking water. Urine samples (24 h) were collected at monthly intervals, and urine pools collected at the 7th month of the studies were analyzed for PM derivatives. Several compounds identified in incubations of PM with PUFA in vitro were detected in urine, and in each case, authentic standards were added to the urines to confirm the presence of the PM adduct in question by MRM-LC/MS/MS. A typical spiking experiment is shown in Fig. 3. Six PM adducts observed in reactions of PM with LA (Fig. 4A) and AA (Fig. 4B) were also detected in the urine of animals treated with PM. NDAPM (derived from LA), PDAPM, PyPM, FPyPM (derived from AA), and FAPM and HAPM (derived from either PUFA) were readily detected in urine from STZ-Db+PM (Fig. 4C) and F+PM (Fig. 4D) animals by MRM-LC/MS/MS. None of these PM adducts was observed in the urine of untreated, control animals (data not shown). Other PM derivatives, which have not yet been characterized, were also detected in the urine of PM-treated rats (Fig. 4, C and D), and each of these products had fragment ions characteristic of PM when analyzed by daughter-ion LC/MS/MS. Most are more hydrophobic than PM, which elutes between FAPM and NDAPM, and may represent products from other lipid (or carbohydrate) precursors trapped during PM inhibition of oxidative modification of proteins in vivo. Quantification of PM Adducts in Vivo—PM adducts in pooled urine of treated animals were quantified by MRM-LC/MS/MS, using d 11-HAPM as the internal standard. As shown in Fig. 5, the levels of these adducts in the urine of PM-treated diabetic animals were on average 5–10-fold higher than those in the urine of PM-treated non-diabetic animals. FAPM (Fig. 5A), which may be derived from both LA and AA, was the major adduct in the urine of control (non-Db) and STZ-Db animals (22.9 ± 0.8 and 132 ± 12 nmol/24 h, respectively), whereas PDAPM (Fig. 5A) derived exclusively from AA was the major product in the urine of Zucker lean (L+PM), Zucker obese (F+PM), and Zucker type 2 diabetic (ZDF-Db) rats (9.1 ± 0.2, 68.9 ± 7.0, and 97.0 ± 4.5 nmol/24 h, respectively). Although FAPM and HAPM were produced in similar yield from both LA and AA in vitro, FAPM was detected in much larger relative amounts in urine (Fig. 5, A versus B), suggesting alternative sources of FAPM in vivo. HAPM excretion (Fig. 5B) was greatest in STZ-Db animals, about 800 pmol/24 h, and was 10-fold higher than in the urine of control (non-Db) animals. HAPM excretion in ZDF-Db animals was also 10-fold higher than in the urine of lean Zucker rats (L) and 7-fold higher than in the urine of obese (F) animals. The level of NDAPM (Fig. 5B), which is produced only from LA peroxidation (or other Δ9 PUFAs) was typically the lowest of any of the measured adducts in the urine of animals, averaging about 7 pmol/24 h in non-diabetic animals and 50–100 pmol/24 h in diabetic animals. In general, PDAPM, FPyPM, and PyPM, products of AA oxidation, were more abundant than the LA-derived NDAPM (Fig. 5), suggesting that despite the higher concentration of LA in plasma and membrane lipids, AA contributes to the majority of PM adduct formation in vivo. This is consistent with the chemistry of these PUFAs, i.e. that AA is more readily oxidized than LA. Similar results were obtained during Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of human low density lipoprotein in the presence of PM (data not shown), i.e. the yield of AA-derived products was greater than that of LA-derived products, despite the higher concentration of LA compared with AA in low density lipoprotein. Metabolic Analyses—Plasma glucose and triglyceride levels in various groups of rats are summarized in Fig. 6. As noted in several previous studies (11Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D.

To this end, we used a technical knock-out approach to reduce the expression of leptin receptors specifically in white adipose tissue. The evaluation of leptin receptor reduction in adipocytes was based on real time PCR analysis of the mRNA levels, Western blot analysis of the proteins, and biochemical analysis of leptin signaling capability. Despite a normal level of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus and normal food intake, mutant mice developed increased adiposity, decreased body temperature, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as elevated hepatic and skeletal muscle triglyceride levels. In addition, a variety of genes involved in regulating fat and glucose metabolism were dysregulated in white adipose tissue. These include tumor necrosis factor-α, adiponectin, leptin, fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, glycerol kinase, and β3-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, the mutant mice are significantly more sensitive to high fat feeding with regard to developing obesity and severe insulin resistance. Thus, we provide a genetic model demonstrating the physiological importance of a peripheral effect of leptin in vivo.

Leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice and leptin receptor deficiency in db/db mice lead to hyperphagia, sterility, obesity, and diabetes (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L.

The ability of leptin to regulate food intake, body weight, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity has been demonstrated extensively (for review, see Refs. 1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L.

Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar). These vital functions of leptin have been attributed exclusively to its actions in the hypothalamus (2Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Accordingly, intracerebroventricular injection of leptin in ob/ob mice can reduce food intake and body weight and alleviate the diabetic phenotypes (6Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar). However, when leptin is peripherally infused or overexpressed in vivo, only a portion of the leptin-induced weight loss can be attributed to a reduction in food intake in the leptin-treated animals compared with the control animals with matched caloric intake (7Levin N.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutant mice with brain-specific deletion of the leptin receptors developed obesity, whereas mutant mice with liver-specific deletion of leptin receptors did not exhibit any weight-related phenotype. Interestingly, the weight gain of the mutant mice with brain-specific deletion of leptin receptors was not as great as that of ob/ob and db/db mice at equivalent ages (14Cohen P. Zhao C. Cai X. Montez J.M. Rohani S.C. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Friedman J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). These studies point to the possibility of a peripheral effect of leptin on body weight regulation. Indeed, many recent studies have suggested that at the cellular level leptin can play important physiological roles in many systems, such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, T-lymphocytes, pancreatic β-cells, and vascular endothelial cells (11Wang M.Y.

In this study, we aim to create a genetic model to investigate whether leptin might play a role in regulating the peripheral functions (such as those of adipocytes) in vivo, in addition to its actions in the central nervous system.The technical knock-out (TKO) 1The abbreviations used are: TKO, technical knock-out; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; OBR, OB receptor; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RT, reverse transcription; SREBP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription-3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; WAT, white adipocyte tissue(s).1The abbreviations used are: TKO, technical knock-out; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; OBR, OB receptor; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RT, reverse transcription; SREBP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription-3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; WAT, white adipocyte tissue(s). system has been deployed successfully to reduce the expression of several signaling proteins relevant to glucose and lipid homeostasis, such as Gαi2 and Gαq (22Moxham C.M.

This technology takes advantage of the tissue specificity of a rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter to drive and restrict the expression of short antisense sequences of a given target gene in fat and liver without affecting other nontarget genes or nontarget tissues (22Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Galvin-Parton P.A. Chen X. Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4335-4341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because of the developmental regulatory nature of PEPCK promoter, the transgene (with the antisense sequences) is not expressed until after birth, thus eliminating concerns regarding any potential compensatory changes during embryonic development. By taking advantage of the TKO system, we can express a short stretch of antisense sequences of leptin receptor gene in fat and liver and potentially create mutant mice with selective leptin receptor deficiency in these tissues. The transgenic mice thus created are hereafter referred to as TKO-OBR mice, short for technical knock-out of OBreceptor. Here, we describe our initial characterizations of such mutant mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransgenic Mice, Genotyping, and Determination of Transgene Expression—An antisense sequence corresponding to a short stretch of sequences (39 bp) immediately 5′ to the ATG initiation codon of the leptin receptor mRNA was inserted into the TKO vector, which was then used to generate transgenic animals (Fig. 1A). A BLAST search in the GenBank nucleotide data base indicated that this stretch of sequence showed no significant homology to any other known mouse genes. We used B6D2F1 hybrid strain for the initial production of transgenic mice. Subsequently, three independent lines were back-crossed with C57BL/6 to the F4 generations. All phenotypic changes of the TKO-OBR mice were relative to their wild-type littermates. The animals were fed standard food and water ad libitum, housed under controlled temperature at 22 °C and a 12-h light-dark cycle with light from 0630 to 1830 h. All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. The sequences of primers for genotyping are as follows: P1, 5′-CGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGA; P2, 5′-TTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGG; P3, 5′-CCCTTCTCATGACCTTTGGCCGTG; P4, 5′-CCAGGTGTACACCTCTGAAGAAAG. For determination of transgene expression, the RNA samples (∼100 ng each) from different tissues were subject to a RT-PCR (with P1 and P2 as primers) followed by a Southern blot with a probe generated from the region flanked by P1 and P2. The specific primers for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene are 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. The RNA samples were extracted using a standard Trizol kit (Invitrogen).Western Blot Assays—Protein samples were prepared by extracting tissues with an immunoprecipitation assay buffer described previously (25Degerman E. Landström T.R. Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Ahmad F. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Methods. 1998; 14: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), separated on 8% or 10% SDS gels, and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary before being subjected to a chemiluminescent reaction for detection. The sources of antibodies are as follows: leptin, Peprotech, NJ; fatty acid synthase, BD Transduction Laboratory; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α,) sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), β3-adrenergic receptor, leptin receptor (K-20), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA. A previously characterized rabbit polyclonal antibody against all variants of murine leptin receptor (15Zhao A.Z. Shinohara M.M. Huang D. Shimizu M. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11348-11354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the expression levels of leptin receptors except where noted.Measurement of Food Intake and Rectal Temperature—Transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates were caged individually, and food was weighed before and at the end of each day for 2 days. The food crumbs were collected and weighed at the end of the observations to provide accurate assessment of food intake. The cumulative food intake in 48 h was divided by 2 to achieve the values of cumulative food intake in 24 h. The whole procedure was repeated three times for 6 days in a row. The temperature measurements were performed between 0930 and 1030 with a rectal microprobe and a microprobe thermometer (BAT-12) (Harvard Apparatus, MA).Analysis of Total Body Fat Content—The analysis of total body fat content was according to a previously published protocol (14Cohen P. Zhao C. Cai X. Montez J.M. Rohani S.C. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Friedman J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Mice at 18-19 weeks of age were sacrificed, and carcasses were weighed and then oven dried in a 90 °C oven until the weight was constant. The carcass was then homogenized in a blender, and duplicate aliquots were extracted using a 3:1 mixture chloroform/methanol. The extracted homogenate was dried overnight and weighed to calculate fat mass and lean mass.Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test and Insulin Sensitivity Test—After overnight fasting, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose at a dose of 2 g/kg of body weight, and the blood glucose levels were monitored with Precision-Xtra strips (Medisense Products, MA) for 2 h through tail vein blood samples. For insulin sensitivity test, the mice were fasted overnight before being injected with a bolus of insulin (0.3 unit/kg of body weight), and their blood glucose levels were monitored through tail vein blood.Measurements of Triglyceride Levels in Serum and Tissues, Serum Levels of Insulin, Leptin, TNF-α, and Adiponectin—Hepatic and skeletal muscle triglycerides were extracted with a protocol established previously (10Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of triglyceride were determined with an Infinity Triglyceride kit (Sigma). The serum insulin and adiponectin levels were measured with radioimmunoassay kits from Linco Research, and the serum leptin level was determined with a radioimmunoassay kit from Alpco. The serum TNF-α level was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). All comparisons were subjected to a two-tailed Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.Determination of Leptin Signaling—Mice were fasted but given free access to water, for 8 h before intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg saline or leptin. The animals were sacrificed 30 min after injection, and the white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For in vitro analysis, primary adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pad of both transgenic and wild-type mice based on a previous protocol (25Degerman E. Landström T.R. Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Ahmad F. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Methods. 1998; 14: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The adipocytes were subsequently treated with leptin or insulin for 10 min before being harvested for analysis of leptin signaling. The analysis of PI3-kinase was carried out with a protocol described previously in which we used an anti-phosphotyrosine (pY20) antibody (Transduction Laboratory) to precipitate the PI3-kinase activity (15Zhao A.Z. Shinohara M.M. Huang D. Shimizu M. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11348-11354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The analysis of phospho-STAT3 and phospho-MAPK was based on Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-STAT3 (pY705) antibody and an anti-phospho-MAPK (pT202/pY204) antibody, respectively (Cell Signaling). Quantitative analysis was achieved by scanning and quantifying the bands of interest with a NIH Image 6.0 program, and all comparisons were subjected to a two-tailed Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Recombinant mouse leptin (AFP376C) was obtained NHPP, NFDDK, and Dr. A. F. Parlow.RESULTSGenotyping of TKO-OBR mice was performed using a standard PCR screening of tail genomic DNA with two different pairs of specific primers engineered into the transgene construct (P1/P2 and P3/P4, Fig. 1A). Transgenic clones were identified by the presence of P1/P2 and P3/P4 amplicons (examples shown in Fig. 1B). Tissue specificity of the transgene at the mRNA level was determined through a sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay (Fig. 1, C and D). The transgene proved to be expressed at high levels in the WAT and in the liver, and at much lower levels in the kidney (Fig. 1C, lanes 12, 11, and 5, respectively). Expression was not detectable either in the brain, brown fat, heart, lung, pancreas, spleen, skeletal muscle, and testis, or in the fat and liver of wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). To eliminate further the possibility that the transgene may be expressed in the hypothalamus, we also performed RT-PCR analysis on the hypothalamic samples from the transgenic mice with an extensive amplification (40 cycles). No expression of the transgene was detected in the hypothalamic RNA samples of the TKO-OBR mice (example shown in Fig. 1D). This expression pattern accurately reflects the tissue specificity of a traditional PEPCK promoter as described before (26Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).The loss of leptin receptor expression in WAT was evaluated from three different aspects, which include Western analysis of OBR protein levels, real time PCR analysis of OBR mRNA levels, and examination of leptin signaling capability in WAT of the TKO-OBR mice. With a specific antibody recognizing several variants of leptin receptor (15Zhao A.Z. Shinohara M.M. Huang D. Shimizu M. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11348-11354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we analyzed OBR expression at the protein level in different tissues of the TKO-OBR mice. Although this antibody has been characterized previously (15Zhao A.Z. Shinohara M.M. Huang D. Shimizu M. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11348-11354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we further demonstrated its specificity by comparing its immunoactivity with that of another leptin receptor antibody recognizing different epitopes (K20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). The results in Fig. 2A indicate that the two different leptin receptor antibodies detected the same long and/or short forms of leptin receptors from the hypothalamic and WAT samples on Western blot assays. The sizes of the long and short forms of leptin receptors detected here are consistent with those observed in previous studies (21Bouloumie A. Drexler H.C. Lafontan M. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 27Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Breininger J.F. Jonak Z. Schaefer J. Krouse M. Burghardt C.

The identification of OB-Rb was confirmed by further comparing the immunoreactive bands of the wild-type brain with those of db/db hypothalamic and brain extracts because the db/db mice do not express OB-Rb but maintain the expression of short forms of OBR (4Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Expression levels of leptin receptors in different tissues of TKO-OBR mice. The protein expression levels of leptin receptors were determined by a Western blot assay with a specific antibody recognizing all variants of mouse leptin receptors (15Zhao A.Z. Shinohara M.M.

The arrows indicate detected leptin receptors with the dashed ones indicating the long form of OBR. A, Western blot analysis comparing two different antibodies against the leptin receptors in the hypothalamic (Hypoth.) and WAT extracts. Antibody Ab1 (ours) was a rabbit polyclonal antibody made against a polypeptide representing an extracellular portion of mouse leptin receptors (amino acids 634-784). Antibody Ab2 was a commercial goat polyclonal antibody made against a peptide representing amino acids 32-51 of mouse leptin receptors (K-20). In each case, the blots were first probed with Ab1. After the Western blot reactions, the blots were stripped and reprobed with Ab2. The two different leptin receptor antibodies clearly recognize the same immunoreactive bands. B, demonstration of the absence of OB-Rb in db/db mice with our OB antibody in a Western blot assay. The long form (OB-Rb) was absent in the hypothalamic and brain samples, whereas the short forms of OBR appear to be normal in the db/db mice. Br, brain; hyp, hypothalamus. WT, wild-type. C, the predominant leptin receptors in the liver and WAT are the short forms. In all three independent lines of TKO-OBR mice, the leptin receptor levels were drastically reduced either >80% (one line) or >90% (two lines), whereas the hepatic expression levels of leptin receptors were unaffected. We used STAT3 as a control protein for loading. wt, wild-type. D, the central nervous system and hypothalamic expression of leptin receptors (both the long and the short forms) was not affected in the TKO-OBR mice. The molecular mass of the top band (∼150 kDa) is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the OB-Rb. E, Western blot analysis of leptin receptor expression in multiple tissues. The predominant variants of the leptin receptor expressed in the skeletal muscle (SM; lanes 1 and 2), heart (lanes 3 and 4), lung (lanes 5 and 6), kidney (lanes 7 and 8), spleen (lanes 9 and 10), testis (lanes 11 and 12), and brown fat (lanes 13 and 14) are the short forms. The sizes of the short forms vary slightly from tissue to tissue (110-120 kDa), most likely reflecting tissue-specific post-translational modifications. In skeletal muscle, brown fat, and to a less extent, the brain tissues, the bands with very high molecular mass (≥200 kDa) are similar to the reported glycosylated leptin receptors (48Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The lanes with odd numbers represent the tissue samples from the wild-type littermates; the lanes with even numbers represent the tissue samples from the TKO-OBR mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The predominant forms of OBR in WAT are the short forms, but this result does not exclude the possibility of a minor presence of OB-Rb playing important physiological roles. In fact, we were able to detect a low level of OB-Rb expression in a RT-PCR assay (Supplemental Data 1). As anticipated, in all three independent lines of TKO-OBR mice, the transgene was able to reduce the expression of leptin receptors substantially in the WAT with more than 80% reduction in one line and greater than 90% reduction in the other two lines (n = 5 for each genotype; p < 0.05; examples shown in Fig. 2C). The extent of OBR reduction is essentially the same between the male and female transgenics. These three lines of TKO-OBR mice had very similar phenotypes, and the results described below reflect the averages from all three transgenic lines. Although the transgene was highly expressed in the liver and modestly in the kidney of TKO-OBR mice, it failed to reduce the expression levels of the leptin receptors expressed in these tissues (Fig. 2, C and E). Because of the dynamic regulations of PEPCK gene expression, we also determined the hepatic expression level of leptin receptors under a fasting condition where the transgene was supposed to have the maximal effect because of its high expression levels. Even after an extensive fasting period (18 h), the hepatic levels of leptin receptors of the TKO-OBR mice were essentially the same as those of the wild-type littermates (data not shown). We further confirmed the reduction of adipocyte leptin receptor expression at the mRNA level. We found that the OBR mRNA level in WAT of TKO-OBR mice was reduced by 80% relative to that of wild-type littermates (n = 5, p < 0.05), whereas the hepatic ORB mRNA level was essentially unchanged (n = 6), further demonstrating a differential targeting of leptin receptor expression in these two tissues.Consistent with the RNA expression pattern of the transgene, the levels of leptin receptors in the TKO-OBR mice were not affected in the brain, brown fat, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and testis (Fig. 2, D and E). To eliminate the concerns that the transgene might alter the levels of leptin receptor in the hypothalamus, we also isolated hypothalamic tissues of TKO-OBR mice and analyzed their expression level of leptin receptor (examples shown in Fig. 2D). We found no detectable difference in the hypothalamic expression of leptin receptors between the TKO-OBR mice and their wild-type littermates (wild-type 100% versus TKO-OBR 107 ± 10%, n = 4 for each genotype). The results thus far indicate that TKO-OBR mice have adipocyte-selective deficiency of leptin receptors and that they maintained normal levels of leptin receptors in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus.To provide a functional proof that the leptin actions were reduced in WAT, we examined the ability of leptin to stimulate several signaling pathways in WAT. It has been well demonstrated that leptin can activate PI3-kinase, MAPK (p42/44), and STAT3 in a variety of tissues including WAT (30Zhao A.Z. Huan J.N. Gupta S. Pal R. Sahu A. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2090840497,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes the survival of cerebellar granule neurons by enhancing calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, whereas NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx can lead to excitotoxic death. Here we demonstrate that L and NMDA receptor channel activities differentially regulate the transcription factor C/EBPbeta to control neuronal survival. Specifically, we show that L channel-dependent calcium influx results in increased CaMKIV activity, which acts to decrease nuclear C/EBPbeta levels. Conversely, NMDA receptor-mediated influx rapidly elevates nuclear C/EBPbeta and induces excitotoxic death via activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. Moderate levels of AMPA receptor activity stimulate L channels to improve survival, whereas higher levels stimulate NMDA receptors and reduce neuronal survival, suggesting differential synaptic effects. Finally, N-type calcium channel activity reduces survival, potentially by increasing glutamate release. Together, these results show that the L-type calcium channel-dependent survival and NMDA receptor death pathways converge to regulate nuclear C/EBPbeta levels, which appears to be pivotal in these mechanisms."

This ability to aggregate cytoskeletal elements, transmembrane receptors, and cytoplasmic signaling proteins is potentially important not only in the stabilization of receptors at the cell surface but also in cell signal integration (1Stossel T.P.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The role of filamin within the vasculature is incompletely understood. It almost certainly plays an important role in cellular migration during vascular development since mutations of the filamin-A gene that block filamin expression and cause human periventricular heterotopia, an X-linked disease characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures, also lead to unusually high incidences of congenital vascular abnormalities (12Fox J.M. Lamperti E.D. Eksioglu Y.Z. Hong S.E. Feng Y. Graham D.A. Scheffer I.E. Dobyns W.B. Hirsch B.A. Radtke R.A. Berkovic S.F. Huttenlocher P.R. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1315-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Unlike the brain, where filamin-A is concentrated during periods of active neuronal migration then down-regulated in the adult, filamin-A persists at high levels in the adult vasculature (13Zhang W.J. Han S.W. Mckeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within vascular smooth muscle cells, it is known to be involved in bundling actin into stress-fibers within the body of the cell and to associate with the plasma membrane at specialized adhesion sites known as membrane-associated dense plaques (14Small J.V. Gimona M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These belong to a family of adherens type junctions that include the focal adhesions of cultured cells (15Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 16Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 487-525Crossref Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) and are the sites at which the cytoskeleton and contractile apparatus of smooth muscle cells anchor to the plasma membrane (17Draeger A. Stelzer E.H.K. Herzog M. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 703-711PubMed Google Scholar). In common with other focal adhesions, the dense plaque regions act as assemblage sites for a number of signaling molecules and are potentially important loci for the integration of signal transduction pathways controlling processes such as actin-remodeling and contractility (18Gerthoffer W.T. Gunst S.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whether filamin plays any role in this signal integration and whether it binds to proteins other than actin within smooth muscle cells has not been fully investigated. Here we report the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen of a porcine coronary artery cDNA library that identify filamin-A (also known as actin-binding protein 280 and filamin-1) as a binding partner of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1. Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) 1The abbreviations used are: Kir2.1, inward rectifier potassium channel 2.1; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MKK-4, MAP kinase kinase; pS, picosiemens; pF, picofarads; aa, amino acids. channels constitute a functionally diverse family of channel proteins that allow K+ to move into the cell more easily than out (19Isomoto S. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1997; 47: 11-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). This asymmetry in the current-voltage relation results from the channel susceptibility to voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and magnesium ions and allows for modulation of the electrical properties of cells without excessive K+ loss. Consequently, Kir channels are involved in setting and maintaining the resting membrane potential, modulation of prolonged action potentials in electrically excitable cells, and potassium homeostasis and secretion (19Isomoto S. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1997; 47: 11-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Kir2.1 is the only isoform of the classical strong (Kir2) inward rectifier subfamily expressed in smooth muscle cells (21Bradley K.K. Jagger J.H. Bonev A.D. Heppner T.J. Flynn E.R. Nelson M.T. Horowitz B. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and, crucially, has been shown to be an important regulator of smooth muscle membrane potential and, hence, vascular tone under conditions of metabolic stress (22Zaritsky J.J. Eckman D.M. Wellman G.C. Nelson M.T. Schwarz T.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We investigate the potential functional consequences of filamin-A binding to Kir2.1 and show through the use of human melanoma cells that lack filamin-A that the interaction does not affect the way the channel behaves but, instead, is important for its functional surface expression. We propose that filamin-A acts as a cytoskeletal anchoring protein for Kir2.1, ensuring its stable surface expression and potentially controlling its location and proximity to other proteins at the cell membrane. In smooth muscle cells this interaction may function to recruit Kir2.1 to signaling complexes within membrane specializations such as the dense plaque region. Antibodies, Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-filamin-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (Sigma-Aldrich); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Abcam Ltd.); rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA (Roche Applied Science); rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Norman, Dept. of Medicine, University of Leicester (23Stonehouse A.H. Pringle J.H. Norman R.I. Stanfield P.R. Conley E.C. Brammer W.J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Horseradish peroxidase-, Texas Red-, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide-Tris gels and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution containing 1% skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the membranes for 2–3 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for a further hour at room temperature. Labeled bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid construct filamin-A (repeats 19–24) fused to the NH2-terminal HA epitope tag in pcDNA-HANII was a generous gift from Prof. Sonnenburg (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Wild-type and eGFP-Kir2.1 in pcDNA3 were as described previously (24Leyland M.L. Dart C. Spencer P.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Dual-tagged HA- and eGFP-Kir2.1 in pcDNA3 was generated by digestion of an internal cassette flanked by BsmB1 and XhoI restriction sites and containing the HA extracellular epitope from HA-Kir2.1 pcDNA3 (25Dart C. Leyland M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20499-20505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and subsequent ligation of the cassette into eGFP-Kir2.1 pcDNA3. Cells and Cell Transfection—Human melanoma cell line, filamin– (lacking expression of filamin-A) and isogenic cell line, filamin+ (stably transfected with full-length filamin-A), were kind gifts from Dr. J. Hartwig (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 8% newborn calf serum, 2% fetal calf serum. Filamin+ cells were cultured in G418 (0.5 mg/ml) to maintain selection of cells harboring the transfected plasmid. HEK293 were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were performed in 6-well culture plates with cells at 80% confluence. Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screen—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed according to the Matchmaker library construction and screening kit (BD Biosciences). A bait construct comprising amino acids 307–428 of mouse Kir2.1 was amplified by PCR (Pfu polymerase) using the wild-type Kir2.1 expression construct in pcDNA3 as template. The PCR product was A-tailed and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) before subcloning into BamHI and EcoRI sites of the GAL4 binding domain plasmid, pGBKT7. The plasmid was transformed into yeast strain, Y187, harboring the lacZ reporter gene under the control of GAL4-binding sites. Total RNA was isolated (SV total RNA isolation kit, Promega) from porcine coronary arteries dissected from hearts donated by a local abattoir (Joseph Morris & Sons, Leicestershire, UK) and reversed-transcribed using SMART (switching mechanism at 5′ end of RNA transcript) technology. cDNA was co-transformed with SmaI-linearized GAL-4 activation domain vector, pGADT7, into yeast strain AH109 harboring reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2 under the control of GAL4-binding sites. Library-carrying AH109 were mated with Y187-carrying bait plasmid pGBKT7-2.1C and plated onto synthetic quadruple drop-out medium (SD/–Ade/–His/–Trp/–Leu). Positive colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity using a filter-lift assay. Activation domain plasmids, pGADT7, were isolated from yeast colonies displaying positive phenotype and transformed into bacteria to obtain plasmids suitable for sequencing reactions. Plasmid inserts were sequenced (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK) and compared against the GenBank™ data base by BLAST search analysis (National Institutes of Health). Generation of Truncation Constructs and Two-hybrid Mapping Studies—Mapping studies of protein-protein interactions between the COOH-terminal filamin clone and Kir2.1 truncation constructs were analyzed by filter-lift and liquid culture β-galactosidase assay in yeast strain Y187. Truncation constructs of the Kir2.1 carboxyl terminus (amino acids: 307–366, 367–428, 307–326, 325–346, 347–366) were amplified by PCR (Pfu polymerase) using the yeast two-hybrid vector, pGBKT7-Kir2.1C, as template and unique primers incorporating EcoRI and BamHI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. PCR fragments were A-tailed and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) before subcloning into BamH1/EcoR1 restriction sites of the GAL4 binding domain vector, pGBKT7. Mutations of pGBKT7-Kir2.1 (aa 307–326 and 307–428) corresponding to Andersen's syndrome (Δ 314–315) were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). All inserts were verified by automated sequencing (Protein and Nucleic Acid Laboratory facility, University of Leicester). Plasmids were incorporated into yeast by standard lithium acetate-mediated transformation (BD Biosciences), and transformed colonies were selected for by growth on double drop-out medium (SD/–Trp/–Leu). Standard methodology provided by BD Biosciences was used to perform β-galactosidase filter-lift and liquid culture assays using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate, respectively. Recombinant Protein Expression and in Vitro Binding Assay—Filamin-A carboxyl-terminal fragment (aa 2481–2647) isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen was excised from EcoRI and XhoI sites of the GAL4 activation domain vector, pGADT7, and subcloned in-frame into the GST fusion protein vector, pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Kir2.1C (aa 307–428) construct was PCR-amplified using the Kir2.1 pcDNA3 construct as template and cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of the NH2-terminal His-tagged vector, pET15b. DNA constructs cloned into pGEX-6P-1 and pET-15b were transformed into DH5α and BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells, respectively. Overnight cultures were diluted (1:100) into fresh Luria Bertani broth, grown to A ≈ 0.5, and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm, 3–4 h, 37 °C). DH5α pellets harboring the GST-filamin (aa 2481–2647) fusion protein were resuspended in ice-cold PBS, sonicated (two 10-s bursts), and incubated with Triton X-100. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and bound proteins were washed with PBS (×3). GST fusion protein was released with glutathione elution buffer (20 mm glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl). BL21(DE3)pLysS pellets harboring insoluble His-tagged Kir2.1C (aa 307–428) were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 8 m urea, and insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were incubated with Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences), and bound His-tagged Kir2.1C was refolded by washing through serial dilutions of urea (8 to 0 m in buffer A). Renatured His-tagged Kir2.1C (aa 307–428) was resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated overnight with block buffer and overlaid with equal quantities of GST and GST-tagged filamin (aa 2481–2647) fusion protein (1 h, 20 °C). After extensive washing in blot buffer, membranes were exposed to anti-GST antibody (1:1000 in blot buffer, 1 h, 20 °C), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:10 000 in blot buffer, 1 h, 20 °C). Coimmunoprecipitation—Mammalian HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid cDNA encoding HA-tagged filamin (carboxyl-terminal repeats, 19–24) and eGFP-tagged Kir2.1. Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1:100 dilution, Sigma Protease Inhibitor Mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, bestatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A), and insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation. Soluble fractions were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (5 μg) or mouse non-immune control serum (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Rat arterial smooth muscle lysates were prepared by homogenization of tissue in ice-cold lysis buffer in a hand-held homogenizer. Insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation, and soluble fractions were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 or rabbit non-immune control serum as above. Antigen-antibody complexes were captured with protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; 4 °C, 2 h). Beads were washed extensively before removal of bound proteins by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell Imaging—Cells were grown to 80% confluence on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips before transfection with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Before imaging of live cells, coverslips were sealed to the base of an imaging chamber with vacuum grease and maintained in PBS at room temperature. Alternatively, filamin+ and filamin– cells were fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-filamin (1:200) primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by extensive washing in PBS before incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200 in PBS containing 10% v/v goat serum) for2hat room temperature under dark conditions. After repeated washing (PBS), coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Ltd). Live and fixed cells were viewed using an inverted PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview™ confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser and ×60 oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.0. Images of cells expressing the eGFP-HA-Kir2.1 construct were analyzed using a method similar to that described previously (26Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tagged image file format (TIFF) images were imported into NIH ImageJ, the cells were outlined, and the mean pixel values were obtained. Pixel values were on an 8-bit scale (28 = 256; 0–255). Laser levels were kept constant between 488- and 568-nm channels. Smooth Muscle Immunocytochemistry—Smooth muscle cells were isolated enzymatically using a modification of methodology described previously (27Quayle J.M. Dart C. Standen N.B. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereby secondary enzymatic digestion of arterial segments with collagenase and hyaluronidase was omitted. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips before fixation and permeabilization in paraformaldehyde and Triton X-100 (0.1%), respectively. Antibody staining and cell imaging were as described for heterologous cells. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-filamin (diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 10% v/v goat serum) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 (1:500) and visualized with anti-mouse Texas Red- and anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. Electophysiology—Whole-cell currents were recorded from either filamin+ or filamin– cells typically 24–48 h post-transfection using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Currents recorded in response to voltage steps were filtered at 5kHz (–3 dB, 8-pole Bessel), digitized at 10 kHz using a DigiData 1320A interface (Axon Instruments), and analyzed using pCLAMP software. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 1.17 mm; Clarke Electromedical, Pangbourne, UK) and fire-polished to give a final resistance of 5 megaohms when filled. The pipette-filling solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The external solution contained 70 mm KCl, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm, CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. The junction potential between pipette and external solutions was sufficiently small (<1.5 mV) to be neglected. As far as possible analogue means were used to correct capacity transients. Up to 90% compensation was routinely used to correct for series resistance. Single channel currents recorded from either filamin+ or filamin– cells were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Single channel all-point amplitude histograms and single channel open probability were calculated using pClamp software. Electrodes for single channel recordings were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 0.86 mm; Clarke Electromedical) and fire-polished to give a final resistance of 15–20 megaohms when filled. The pipette-filling solution for single channel experiments contained 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. The external solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. All experiments were performed at room temperature (18–22 °C), and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's unpaired t test; level of significance was *p < 0.05. Identification of Filamin-A as a Binding Partner for Kir2.1 by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To isolate binding partners of Kir2.1, a carboxyl-terminal segment of the channel (aa 307–428) was subcloned into the GAL4 binding domain bait vector, pGBKT7. This was used as bait to screen a porcine coronary artery cDNA library incorporated into the GAL4 activation domain vector, pGADT7, by yeast two-hybrid analysis. A screen of 1 × 106 yeast colonies resulted in a large number (1738) exhibiting positive phenotype (growth on synthetic quadruple drop-out medium SD/–Ade/–His/–Trp/–Leu). These colonies were screened by β-galactosidase filter assay, but only 10 demonstrated a positive reaction (development of blue color at ∼40 min). One of the positive clones encoded a partial cDNA representing part of repeat 23, the hinge 2 region, and repeat 24 of filamin-A (actin-binding protein 280, aa 2481–2647; Fig. 1A). Translation of the sequence revealed that the isolated porcine clone exhibited a 94% homology with its human homologue (156 of 166 amino acids; Fig. 1B). Mapping of the Region on Kir2.1 Responsible for Interacting with Filamin—To further define the carboxyl-terminal Kir2.1 amino acid motif/motives responsible for interaction with filamin, successive deletion constructs of Kir2.1 (aa 307–428) were tested by yeast two-hybrid analysis for interaction with the isolated filamin clone. Fig. 2Ai shows the truncation constructs of Kir2.1 that were cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7. These were cotransformed into yeast strain Y187 along with the filamin clone in prey vector pGADT7 for quantitative β-galactosidase assays. Activation of the reporter gene occurred with amino acids 307–367 of Kir2.1 as bait but not amino acids 367–428. The strength of interaction increased with successive deletions of the 307–367 amino acid channel segment such that amino acids 307–326 demonstrated the strongest interaction tested (Fig. 2Bi). A similar observation has been reported for the interaction of glycoprotein GPIbα with filamin-A, where stronger yeast two-hybrid signals were obtained with smaller protein fragments (28Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2914-2919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transfection of the Kir2.1 truncation constructs with empty prey plasmid, pGADT7, prevented the positive interactions observed in the β-galactosidase filter-lift and liquid assays. Mutations in Kir2.1 can give rise to the development of Andersen's syndrome, a rare condition characterized by dysmorphic features, periodic paralysis, and cardiac arrhythmias (29Plaster N.M. Tawii R. Tristani-Firouzi M. Canun S. Bendahhou S. Tsunoda A. Donaldson M.R. Iannaccone S.T. Brunt E. Barohn R. Clark J. Deymeer F. George A.L. Fish F.A. Hahn A. Nitu A. Ozdemir C. Serdaroglu P. Subramony S.H. Wolfe G. Fu H.A. Ptacek L.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). One genetic variant of the disease has been documented as an in-frame deletion of amino acids 314–315. Because our results suggest that amino acids in the region 307–326 are involved in the interaction of Kir2.1 with filamin, we investigated the importance of amino acids 314–315 to filamin binding. We constructed 314–315 deletion mutants within the yeast two-hybrid bait vectors, pGBKT7-Kir2.1 aa 307–428 (Δ 314–315) and pGBKT7-Kir2.1 aa 307–326 (Δ 314–315) (Fig. 2Aii). Fig. 2, Aii and Bii, shows that deletion of the Andersen's syndrome amino acids 314–315 had no effect on the ability of filamin to interact with Kir2.1 amino acids 307–326, as assayed by filter-lift and liquid β-galactosidase experiments. Transformation of the latter Kir2.1 aa 307–326 (Δ 314–315) deletion constructs together with an empty prey domain vector prevented the positive result observed for the β-galactosidase assays, demonstrating the specificity of the interactions. Filamin Interacts in Vitro with Kir2.1—The interaction between filamin and the carboxyl terminus of Kir2.1 (Kir2.1C) was confirmed using an in vitro GST overlay assay. The filamin cDNA clone (aa 2482–2647) was excised from pGADT7 and subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 for expression as a GST fusion protein. Using a Far Western overlay assay, GST-filamin was shown to interact with membrane-bound His-tagged Kir2.1C, whereas GST alone failed to show any interaction (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2006990725,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is responsible for the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in steroidogenic tissues. Through its action, HSL is involved in regulating intracellular cholesterol metabolism and making unesterified cholesterol available for steroid hormone production. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) facilitates the movement of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is a critical regulatory step in steroidogenesis. In the current studies we demonstrate a direct interaction of HSL with StAR using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. The 37-kDa StAR is coimmunoprecipitated with HSL from adrenals of animals treated with ACTH. Deletional mutations show that HSL interacts with the N-terminal as well as a central region of StAR. Coexpression of HSL and StAR in Chinese hamster ovary cells results in higher cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of HSL. Transient overexpression of HSL in Y1 adrenocortical cells increases mitochondrial cholesterol content under conditions in which StAR is induced. It is proposed that the interaction of HSL with StAR in cytosol increases the hydrolytic activity of HSL and that together HSL and StAR facilitate cholesterol movement from lipid droplets to mitochondria for steroidogenesis.

Shen W.-J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDL3, human high density lipoprotein3; LDL, low density lipoprotein; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; START domain, StAR-related lipid transfer domain; TGH, triacylglycerol hydrolase. is responsible for the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in steroidogenic tissues. The most direct and convincing evidence comes from HSL knockout mice, where no detectable HSL protein and no neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity are observed in the adrenal (2Kraemer F.B.

It is believed that through its action as a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, HSL is involved in regulating intracellular cholesterol metabolism and, thus, contributing to a variety of pathways in which cells utilize cholesterol. The primary amino acid sequence of HSL is unrelated to any of the other known mammalian lipases; however, it shares some sequence similarity with liver arylacetamide deacetylase within its catalytic domain (4Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jenö D. Meter U.A. Randolfo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of HSL displays secondary structural homology with that of acetylcholinesterase and several fungal lipases (5Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A.

Using limited proteolysis, it has been suggested that HSL is composed of two major structural domains (8Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C.

Based on sequence alignment, structural homology with fungal lipases, and mutational analyses, the C-terminal domain has been shown to contain the catalytic triad and other residues important in hydrolytic activity, as well as a 150-amino acid insert that has been termed the regulatory module because several serines located within this region have been shown to be phosphorylated (1Kraemer F.B.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain in rat HSL constitutes the first 323 amino acids, which are encoded by exons 1–4, and displays no sequence or structural similarity with any other known proteins (8Østerlund T.

We (11Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and others (12Syu L.-J. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that HSL interacts specifically with intracellular proteins in adipose tissue. The interaction of HSL with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) occurs through amino acid residues within the N-terminal domain; the physical interaction of ALBP with HSL increases the hydrolytic activity of HSL and protects HSL from product inhibition by fatty acids (13Shen W.-J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the same way that the interaction of HSL with ALBP might help to facilitate the trafficking of fatty acids in adipose cells, HSL might interact with specific cholesterol carrier proteins in the adrenal and, thus, facilitate intracellular cholesterol trafficking to mitochondria for steroidogenesis. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is synthesized as a 37-kDa protein that is targeted to and processed in mitochondria to a 30-kDa mature protein that facilitates the movement of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) on the inner mitochondrial membrane (14Miller W.L.

The crystal structure of StAR shows that it has a classic lipid transporter-like structure (20Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct.

A. 2002; 99: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is characterized by internal hydrophobic cavities, clefs, or tunnels. In this paper, we demonstrate a direct interaction of HSL with StAR in both in vitro and in vivo physiological conditions. HSL interacts with the N-terminal as well as a central region of StAR. Coexpression of HSL and StAR in CHO cells results in higher hydrolytic activity of HSL. Transient overexpression of HSL in Y1 adrenocortical cells increases mitochondrial cholesterol content under conditions in which StAR is induced. It is proposed that the interaction of HSL with StAR in cytosol increases the hydrolytic activity of HSL and that together HSL and StAR facilitate cholesterol movement from stored lipid droplets to mitochondria for steroidogenesis.

Deletional and Mutational Constructs of StAR—PCR was used to produce deletional constructs from the C terminus as well as N terminus of StAR (a kind gift from Dr. J. Strauss, III, University of Pennsylvania). For the StAR C-terminal deletional constructs, the 5′-primer was the Sp6 primer, and the 3′-primers were: StAR 1–225, 5′-GAT GAT GCT CTT GGG CAG CC; StAR 1–205, 5′-CCC GAA GTC TGT GTC CAT GCC; StAR 1–155, 5′-GAC CTT GAT CTC CTT GAC ATT GGG; StAR 1–100, 5′-ACT CTC CTT CTT CCA GCC CTC TTG; StAR 1–62, 5′-CCG AGA ACC GAG TAG AGA GCT CCG.

The identities of the mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI prism DNA sequencer. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction—After sequence confirmation of the StAR mutants, the StAR constructs were in vitro translated with [35S]methionine using the TNT®Transcription/Translation System. GST-HSL and GST protein were produced as described previously (11Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). GST-HSL or GST alone was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed three times in buffer B and then incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled StAR proteins. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed five times in buffer B, and proteins that bound to the beads were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on SDS in 10% PAGE, and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were injected with saline or ACTH (25 μg) and the adrenals harvested 1 and 2 h after the injection. Adrenals were homogenized in TES buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, 1 mm EDTA and 8% sucrose, with 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and okadaic acid) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation and protein determination. Immunoprecipitation of HSL was performed as described (11Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A 250-μg aliquot was precleared with protein A beads and then incubated with an immunomatrix consisting of rabbit polyclonal anti-HSL/fusion protein IgG and protein A. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the immune complex was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and then twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.063 m Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 13% (v/v) glycerol), boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-StAR IgG (a kind gift from Dr. J. Strauss, III). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transient transfection experiments, cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in six well plates the day prior to incubation with 0.75 μg of pCMV-StAR or StAR mutants, 0.75 μg of pcDNA3-HSL, and 0.25 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase in 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent following the procedure from the manufacturer. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection for measurement of HSL activity. Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells were grown in F-10 medium supplemented with 12.5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transient transfection experiments, cells were subcultured at a density 1 × 106 cells/plate in 10-cm tissue culture plates the day prior to transfection. Each plate was transfected with either 5 μg of vector alone, pcDNA3-HSL, or pBK-CMV-TGH (a kind gift from Dr. Dennis Vance, University of Alberta, Canada) using Lipofectin reagent. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented with 500 μg of protein/ml HDL3 and 2.5 mm Bt2cAMP for 24 h. Cells were then changed to serum-free medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin overnight and stimulated with 2.5 mm Bt2cAMP in the presence of 100 μm aminoglutethimide for 2 h before harvesting in TES buffer. Mitochondria Preparation—Mitochondria of Y1-BS1 cells were prepared as described (23DiBartolomeis M.J. Williams C. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Harvested Y1-BS1 cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, with 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) and cells were allowed to swell for 10 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, cells were gently broken with several passes in a loose fitting glass-Teflon homogenizer. Phosphate buffer and sucrose were added to final concentrations of 50 and 100 mm, respectively, to maintain an isotonic suspension. Aliquots of the homogenate were removed for total cholesterol and protein determinations. To prepare the mitochondrial fraction, the homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were again centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing the mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in mitochondrial stabilizing buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 15 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose). Measurement of Cholesterol Content—Cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol content were measured using the Infinity” cholesterol measurement kit from Sigma after their separation by TLC. For TLC, lipids from isolated mitochondrial fractions were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42828) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the lower organic solvent phase was transferred, air dried, and dissolved in 50 μl of toluene. An aliquot was then applied to 20 × 20-cm TLC plates and developed sequentially with chloroform:methanol:water 60:40:10 (v/v/v) to 1 cm and then hexane:ether:acetic acid 85:15:2 (v/v/v) to 13 cm. Cholesterol and cholesteryl ester standards were applied on a separate lane on the TLC plates. The cholesterol and cholesteryl ester spots were visualized by brief exposure to iodine vapor, eluted, and measured enzymatically as described previously (2Kraemer F.B. Shen W.-J. Natu V. Patel S. Osuga J.-i. Ishibashi S. Azhar S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Other Measurements—Measurement of HSL activity was performed using a cholesteryl [14C]oleate emulsion as described previously (25Prokocimer P.G. Maze M. Vickery R.G. Kraemer F.B. Gandjei R. Hoffman B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 338-343PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was assayed using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Recombinant GST-HSL was produced in baculovirus as described previously (11Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test using InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego) software for Macintosh. HSL Interacts with StAR in Vitro—To determine whether HSL might interact with StAR, full-length StAR that was [35S]methionine-labeled by in vitro translation was incubated with either rat GST-HSL or with GST alone. The mixture was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, and the proteins that bound to the beads were washed, eluted, and separated on SDS-PAGE, and then visualized. Results are shown in Fig. 1. Whereas GST protein alone does not appear to interact with StAR, GST-HSL was able to pull down StAR. Thus, these results suggest that HSL is capable of specifically interacting with StAR in vitro. HSL Interacts with StAR in Vivo—To document that the interaction of HSL with StAR occurs in vivo, male rats were injected with ACTH to induce StAR expression or with saline. The adrenals were harvested 1 and 2 h after the injection, and HSL was immunoprecipitated from extracts of the adrenals with anti-HSL antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-StAR antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, anti-StAR antibodies recognize StAR in extracts of control adrenals as a 30-kDa protein, reflecting the mature protein after its processing in mitochondria. Interestingly, the 30-kDa StAR is also detected in the immune complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-HSL antibodies from adrenal tissue prior to ACTH treatment (lane 2), supporting an interaction of HSL with StAR in vivo. 1 h after injection of ACTH, the 37-kDa StAR, which is the product initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to transport and processing in mitochondria to the 30-kDa form, is detected in the immune complexes of adrenal tissue immunoprecipitated with anti-HSL antibodies, confirming the interaction of HSL with StAR in vivo. By 2 h after ACTH injection, the 37-kDa product is no longer detected, reflecting the short half-life of the 37-kDa StAR protein. In contrast, adrenal tissues immunoprecipitated with nonimmune antibodies do not have any detectable StAR, establishing that StAR was not found in the anti-HSL immune complexes because of nonspecific interactions during the immunoprecipitation. The intense signal in the lane immunoprecipitated with nonimmune IgG represents IgG heavy chains that are detected by the chemiluminescence assay. The IgG heavy chains do not appear in the lanes immunoprecipitated with anti-HSL IgG because an immunomatrix consisting of anti-HSL IgG cross-linked to protein A was used which prevents free heavy chains from appearing in the supernatant after the pelleted immune complex is solubilized. Region of StAR Participating in the Interaction with HSL—To explore the structural determinants in StAR that are mediating its interaction with HSL, a series of C-terminal deletions, StAR 1–225, StAR 1–205, StAR 1–155, StAR 1–100, and StAR 1–62, was generated, and the interactions of these in vitro translated products with HSL were examined (Fig. 3). Interestingly, although none of the constructs interacted with GST alone, all constructs were specifically pulled down by GST-HSL, suggesting that the N-terminal 62 amino acids of StAR, which contains the signal that targets StAR to the mitochondria and which is cleaved in the mitochondria, can participate in the interaction with HSL. In view of the ability of the 30-kDa StAR to be coimmunoprecipitated with HSL, it is apparent that regions in addition to the N terminus of the protein must also be involved in the interaction with HSL. Therefore, a series of N-terminal deletions of StAR was generated and their ability to interact with HSL tested (Fig. 4). Deleting the first 62 amino acids of StAR did not affect its ability to be pulled down by GST-HSL, suggesting that the N terminus is not the only region participating in the interaction with HSL. Deleting the first 155 amino acids of StAR also did not affect its ability to be pulled down by GST-HSL; however, N-terminal deletions of the first 205 and 225 amino acids did eliminate the interaction. When C- and N-terminal deletions were combined (Fig. 5), StAR 100–241 and StAR 100–221 still retained their ability to bind to HSL; however, StAR 100–182 did not. Thus, it appears that sites within the first 62-amino acid N terminus and within the region between amino acids 182 and 205/221 are able to mediate the interaction of StAR with HSL.Fig. 4Interaction of HSL with N-terminal StAR deletions. N-terminal truncations of StAR were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, pcDNA3-StAR 62–286 was in vitro translated and incubated with GST (lane 2) or GST-HSL (lane 3). B, pcDNA3-StAR 155–286 (lanes 1, 4, and 5), pcDNA3-StAR 205–286 (lanes 2, 6, and 7), and pcDNA3-StAR 225–286 (lanes 3, 8, and 9) were in vitro translated and incubated with GST (lanes 4, 6, and 8) or GST-HSL (lanes 5, 7, and 9) as described in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Interaction of HSL with combined N- and C-terminal StAR deletions.

Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ability of ALBP to increase substrate hydrolysis by HSL is not due entirely to the binding and sequestration of fatty acids by ALBP but is dependent on the physical interaction of ALBP with HSL, suggesting that the protein-protein interaction causes a conformational change or steric effect on the enzyme. Although StAR is not known to possess fatty acid binding properties, the fact that StAR does interact with HSL raised the possibility that the interaction of StAR with HSL might modulate HSL hydrolytic activity. To explore this possibility, HSL was expressed in CHO cells, and hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl ester was determined after coexpression of StAR or vector alone (Fig. 6). The amount of HSL expressed under these experimental conditions was similar, as determined by immunoblot (data not shown). Coexpression of HSL and StAR resulted in ∼75% increased hydrolysis (p < 0.001) of cholesteryl ester substrate. Thus, as observed with ALBP, the interaction of StAR with HSL can modulate the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. To investigate whether there is a correlation between HSL-StAR protein-protein interaction in vitro and HSL function, various deletional mutants of StAR were coexpressed with HSL in CHO cells, and hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl ester was determined (Fig. 7). Deletions of the first 100 or 155 amino acids of StAR, constructs that bind HSL, stimulated hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl ester (p < 0.05) to an extent similar to that of full-length StAR (1–286). Deletion of the first 205 amino acids of StAR appeared to stimulate HSL activity, but this did not reach statistical significance; deletion of the first 225 amino acids, a construct that does not bind HSL, had no effect on HSL activity. Likewise, expression of StAR 100–182, which does not bind HSL, also did not stimulate HSL activity. However, small constructs that do bind HSL (StAR 100–221 and 100–241) also had no effect on HSL activity. Interestingly, a construct in which amino acids 181–221 were deleted from StAR also failed to stimulate HSL hydrolytic activity. Thus, it appears that the simple binding of StAR to HSL is insufficient to explain the effects on hydrolytic activity. HSL Augments Mitochondrial Cholesterol Content in the Presence of StAR—To explore the functional significance of the interaction of HSL with StAR and to test the hypothesis that the interaction of HSL with StAR might facilitate intracellular cholesterol trafficking to mitochondria for steroidogenesis in adrenal cells, we transfected Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells with HSL or, as a control, triacylglycerol hydrolase. Triacylglycerol hydrolase is a neutral cytosolic lipase that has been reported to possess triacylglycerol (26Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem.

Rho GTPases are critical mediators of cytoskeletal reorganization, and their activity at the synapse is likely to be stringently regulated. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) belonging to the Dbl family of proteins represent one major class of proteins that regulate the activity of Rho GTPases. Here we demonstrate that IBP, a homologue of SWAP-70, is a novel GEF for Rac1 and Cdc42 in T lymphocytes, which is recruited to the immunological synapse upon engagement of the antigen receptor. Mutational analysis supports a model whereby IBP is inactive in unstimulated cells. Upon engagement of the T cell receptor, its GEF activity is enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as by binding newly generated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Although it is known that T cell receptor engagement leads to the recruitment of Vav to the immunological synapse, these findings indicate that other GEFs, such as IBP, also relocalize to this intercellular region. The recruitment and activation of distinct classes of GEFs may allow for precise control of Rho GTPase function at the crucial interface between T cells and antigen presenting cells.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src family, Lck and Fyn, constitutes one of the most proximal and crucial signaling events that couples receptor engagement to downstream biochemical pathways (3Clements J.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These Src family kinases phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the CD3 and TCR ζ chain leading to the recruitment and activation of additional kinases, adaptor proteins, and enzymes. Pharmacological and genetic studies have indicated that stimulation of the activity of one enzyme, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is particularly important in mediating the propagation and amplification of the TCR-mediated signaling cascade (4Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4639) Google Scholar, 5Ward S.G. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The products of PI3K, PI(3,4,5)P3, and PI(3,4)P2 bind to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains contained in a variety of crucial signaling intermediates inducing the relocalization of these proteins to specific areas of the plasma membrane. T cell recognition of antigen presenting cells (APCs) results in the formation of a specialized interface, termed the immunological synapse (IS) (6Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K.

The immunological synapse may function to integrate and/or stabilize TCR-generated signaling pathways and to promote the restricted delivery of secretory products, such as cytokines, to the target cell. Assembly of the immunological synapse is accompanied by the large scale redistribution of receptors and signaling proteins, processes that are critically dependent on TCR-mediated actin cytoskeletal remodeling and polarization. Actin cytoskeletal reorganization in the immunological synapse requires the activity of the Rho family of GTPases (9Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 10Krawczyk C. Penninger J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 317-330PubMed Google Scholar). Rho GTPases function as molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form (11Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 12Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) belonging to the Dbl family of proteins represent major regulators of the activation state of Rho GTPases (14Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). One member of this family, Vav, is critically important in orchestrating TCR-mediated actin cytoskeletal reorganization (15Fischer K.-D. Tedford K. Penninger J.M. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Dbl family, Vav contains a sequence of ∼200 amino acids termed the Dbl homology (DH) domain, responsible for catalyzing the GDP/GTP exchange reactions, followed by a C-terminal PH domain necessary for proper intracellular localization and function (18Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the PH domain serves to activate the GEF activity of Vav, which is further enhanced by multiple tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that cells employ multiple GEFs to elicit specific subsets of Rho GTPase-mediated responses (19Hakeda-Suzuki S. Ng J. Tzu L. Dietzl G. Sun Y. Harms M. Nardine T. Luo L. Dickson B.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Whether GEFs other than Vav are activated and recruited to the immunological synapse is, however, not known. Although the great majority of GEFs for Rho GTPases contain the canonical DH-PH module, recent studies (13Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) have revealed the existence of novel classes of these regulators. In particular, SWAP-70 is a novel type of Rac-GEF, in which the catalytic domain is flanked at its N terminus, rather than at its C terminus, by a PH domain (20Shinohara M. Terada Y. Iwamatsu A. Shihora A. Mochizuki N. Higuchi M. Gotoh Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The DH domain of SWAP-70 exhibits only a very low degree of homology to that of other Rho-GEFs such as Vav, further suggesting that this class of GEFs may activate a unique subset of Rho GTPase-mediated functions. We recently identified a novel protein termed IBP (IRF-4-binding protein) that exhibits significant similarity to SWAP-70 (21Gupta S. Lee A. Hu C. Fanzo J. Goldberg I. Cattoretti G. Pernis A.B. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IBP is highly expressed in lymphoid tissues, and, interestingly, the T cell compartment preferentially expresses IBP rather than SWAP-70 (21Gupta S. Lee A. Hu C. Fanzo J. Goldberg I. Cattoretti G. Pernis A.B. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Borggrefe T. Masat L. Wabl M. Riwar B. Cattoretti G. Jessberger R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to investigate the regulation and function of IBP in T cells. Here we report that IBP is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated by Lck in response to T cell activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IBP enables it to bind PI(3,4,5)P3. IBP is recruited to the T cell:APC contact region in a manner that is dependent on the activities of both Lck and PI3K, and these signals control the ability of IBP to function as a GEF toward Rac1 and Cdc42. The recruitment of IBP to the immunological synapse coupled with the finding that its GEF activity is controlled by TCR-mediated signals suggest that IBP is a novel type of GEF that participates in lymphocyte activation. Cell Cultures and Transfections—The various Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cell lines, including JE6–1 (wild-type), J.CaM1.6 (Lck-deficient), and J-TAg (SV40 large T-antigen-transfected) cell lines, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All the cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. 293T (a human embryonic kidney cell line) cells were a kind gift of Dr. Chris Schindler, Columbia University, New York, NY and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells (a generous gift of Dr. Steven Greenberg, Columbia University, New York, NY) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Raji cells were obtained from Dr. Raphael Clynes (Columbia University) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat T cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, serum-starved for 5 h, and then stimulated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods with a mouse anti-human CD3 mAb (clone OKT3) followed by cross-linking with a secondary goat anti-mouse Ig antibody, as described previously (23Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For expression of recombinant proteins, 293T cells and COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation method or the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.), respectively. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were harvested for cell extract preparation. DNA Constructs—The full-length wild-type human IBP expression plasmids (pCEP4-HA-IBP and pIRES2-EGFP-HA-IBP) were constructed by cloning the entire coding region of the human IBP cDNA, fused in-frame with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope coding sequence at its 5′ terminus, into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) or pIRES2-EGFP bicistronic expression vector (Clontech), respectively. The point mutations Y210F or R236C in the full-length IBP were introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Various deletion mutants of human IBP were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For preparation of various glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IBP fusion proteins, the corresponding GST-IBP expression plasmids were generated by cloning either the entire coding sequence of the human IBP cDNA or its appropriate segments, in-frame, into the pGEX-KG Escherichia coli expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The in-frame junction in the GST-IBP fusion constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The constitutively active Lck(Y505F) expression construct in pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (24Abraham K. Levin S. Marth J. Forbush K. Perlmutter R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Jerry Siu. Protein Purification, Antibodies, Cell Extracts, and Protein Assays— GST-IBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5α and affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), as described previously (25Gupta S. Jiang M. Anthony A. Pernis A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged IBP (full-length wild-type) was expressed in 293T cells and affinity-purified on immobilized anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10; anti-HA affinity matrix; Roche Applied Science) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The polyclonal anti-IBP antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified GST-IBP (amino acids 410–631) fusion protein (Covance, Inc., Princeton, NJ). This GST fusion protein contains a portion of the human IBP protein, which is least homologous to SWAP-70 and thus minimizes cross-reactivity of the antibody with SWAP-70 (21Gupta S. Lee A. Hu C. Fanzo J. Goldberg I. Cattoretti G. Pernis A.B. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The anti-IBP antibody was utilized at 1:1000 in Western blotting and at 1:200 in the immunofluorescence experiments. An anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The rat monoclonal antibody against HA epitope (clone 3F10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The PKC-θ and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (26Gupta S. Xia D. Jiang M. Lee S. Pernis A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5997-6004PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IBP antibody or anti-HA mAb (clone 3F10) as described previously (26Gupta S. Xia D. Jiang M. Lee S. Pernis A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5997-6004PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and then immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) or the anti-IBP antiserum. The bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Pull-down assays with phosphoinositide analogue beads (Echelon Research Laboratories Inc.) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IBP was assessed by in vitro Lck kinase assay using purified Lck kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) and either purified HA epitope-tagged IBP (wild-type) or immunoprecipitated recombinant IBP proteins (wild-type or Y210F mutant) according to previously described protocols (27Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified HA-IBP (∼150 ng) or immunoprecipitates of recombinant IBP proteins were incubated with 5 units of purified Lck in 30 μl of 1× kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μm cold ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. The reaction samples were resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed, soaked in 1 n KOH at 55 °C for 2 h, refixed, dried, and then autoradiographed to visualize tyrosine-phosphorylated products. In Vivo Rac1/Cdc42 Activation Assay and in Vitro GDP Release Assay— For the in vivo activation assays for Rac1 and Cdc42, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with an appropriate expression vector for either wild-type HA-IBP or various IBP deletion mutants. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2 and then lysed in 1× lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors). Activated GTP-bound Rac1 (or Cdc42) was affinity-precipitated from the cell lysates by using GST-PAK1 PBD (p21 Rac/Cdc42-binding domain) fusion protein immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The precipitated Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP was resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then visualized by Western blot analysis with either an anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or an anti-Cdc42 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), respectively. The in vitro GDP release assays were carried out by filter-binding method as described previously (28Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To prepare [3H]GDP-loaded GTPases, 40 pmol of bacterially expressed and purified GST-Rac1, GST-Cdc42, or His-RhoA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was incubated with 1 μm [3H]GDP in 100 μl of a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 60 min at 30 °C. The nucleotide exchange reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm nonradioactive GTP and 4 pmol of purified GST alone or GST-IBP fusion proteins (or when appropriate, 4 pmol of purified wild-type HA-IBP either non-phosphorylated or in vitro phosphorylated by purified Lck and cold ATP) to the [3H]GDP-loaded GTPase and then equally splitting and incubating the reaction mixture for the indicated time periods at room temperature. When indicated, control exchange reactions were also performed with purified Lck alone using the same amount of Lck as was used to phosphorylate purified HA-IBP. In some experiments, a water-soluble analogue of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon Research Laboratories Inc.) was added to the exchange reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 1 μm. The exchange reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2) to the reaction mixtures. The amount of [3H]GDP remaining bound to the GTPases was determined by filtering the quenched reaction samples over nitrocellulose membranes followed by extensive washing of the filters and then quantification of the membrane-bound radioactivity by scintillation counting. Conjugate Formation and CD3 Capping—Raji cells were used as the APCs for conjugation with Jurkat T cells. Raji cells were labeled with 10 μm 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin cell tracker blue dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by pulsing with or without 5 μg/ml SEE (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL) for 30 min at 37 °C. To induce conjugate formation, 1 × 105 B cells were combined with 1 × 105 Jurkat E6–1 or 1 × 105 Lck-deficient Jurkat (J.CaM1.6) T cells at 37 °C for 5 min. Conjugates were pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, washed, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. Conjugates were then stained with antibodies to IBP and PKC-θ followed by a secondary staining with Alexa-Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, IgAb), respectively. For treatments with wortmannin (Calbiochem), T cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing 100 nm wortmannin and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with APCs. Conjugates were examined by a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) with a ×100/1.3 Plan-Neofluor objective lens. FITC, TRITC, and 7-methyl-4-chloromethylcoumarin (in two-photon mode) were excited at 488, 543, and 800 nm, respectively, and emission was collected at 500–550, above 585, and 435–485 nm, respectively. Optical section thickness was ∼1 μm. Image enhancement and analysis were performed using the public domain program NIH Image 1.6 and Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Approximately 100 conjugates were scored visually for polarized IBP or PKC-θ at the synapse from two independent scores of three different experiments. For capping experiments, naïve CD4+ T cells were isolated from splenocytes of D0.11.10 TCR transgenic mice by negative selection using naïve CD4+-specific T cell enrichment columns (R & D Systems). The purity of naïve CD4+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry and was found to be >90%. T cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml anti-CD3ϵ Ab (Pharmingen) for 1 h on ice, followed by cross-linking with FITC-labeled mouse anti-hamster Ig Ab (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min at 4 or 37 °C. Cells were pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were then washed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against IBP followed by a secondary antibody stain of anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). Capped T cells were examined by a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) with a ×100/1.3 Plan-Neofluor objective lens. FITC and TRITC were excited at 488 and 543 nm, respectively, and emission was collected at 500–550 and above 585 nm, respectively. Optical section thickness was ∼1 μm. Image enhancement and analysis were performed using the public domain program NIH Image 1.6 and Adobe Photoshop 6.0. The percentage of cells displaying caps, in which the Alexa-Fluor condenses to less than 25% of the cell surface was determined by counting 10 fields per treatment composed of ∼150–250 cells. D0.11.10 TCR transgenic mice were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. IBP Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR Stimulation in an Lck-dependent Manner—The rapid activation of PTKs of the Src family is one of the earliest signaling events triggered by engagement of the TCR (1van Leeuwen J. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Because a survey of the IBP sequence utilizing the Scansite algorithm (32Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site, which fits the consensus motif for Lck-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 1A) (33Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we first determined whether IBP underwent enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation. Jurkat T cells, which express endogenous IBP, were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb for varying periods of time, and whole cell lysates were obtained and then immunoprecipitated with an Ab directed against IBP (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab revealed that TCR engagement led to the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of IBP. To address more directly the possibility that IBP might be a substrate for the Src family of tyrosine kinases, we determined whether purified Lck could phosphorylate purified recombinant IBP in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C). Coincubation of IBP and Lck resulted in the phosphorylation of IBP in addition to the known autophosphorylation of Lck. Furthermore, transient cotransfection of an IBP expression construct in 293T cells, together with a constitutively active form of Lck (LckY505F) (24Abraham K. Levin S. Marth J. Forbush K. Perlmutter R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), led to the tyrosine phosphorylation of IBP (data not shown). Given that the N terminus of IBP contains a tyrosine (Tyr-210) that represents a potential consensus motif for Lck-mediated phosphorylation, we then proceeded to determine whether inactivating this residue would affect the ability of Lck to phosphorylate IBP. As shown in Fig. 1D, in vitro kinase assays indeed demonstrated that Lck can phosphorylate wild-type IBP but not the Y210F mutant. To assess whether Lck was required for TCR-induced phosphorylation of IBP in lymphocytes, we compared the ability of IBP to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in cells from the Lck+ Jurkat cell line JE6.1 and in cells from J.CaM1.6, an Lck-deficient subline of JE6.1 (34Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IBP was markedly diminished in the Lck-deficient as compared with the Lck+ Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1E). Taken together these data indicate that IBP is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation and that IBP can serve as a substrate for Src kinases. IBP Binds PI(3,4,5)P3 upon Phosphorylation by Lck—Because IBP contains a PH domain we determined whether IBP binds specific phosphoinositides. We prepared whole cell lysates from 293T cells cotransfected with an HA-tagged IBP expression construct and either an empty vector or a vector expressing a constitutively active Lck (LckY505F). Lysates were then subjected to pull-down assays with a panel of different phosphoinositides conjugated to agarose beads (Fig. 2A). IBP bound efficiently to the PI3K product, PI(3,4,5)P3, only when coexpressed with constitutively active Lck. We did not detect association of IBP with PI(4,5)P2. To confirm the specificity of the interaction of PI(3,4,5)P3 with the PH domain of IBP, we generated a point mutation within the PH domain of IBP (R236C). This residue has been shown previously (35Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) to be critical for the interaction of PH domains with PI(3,4,5)P3, and a similar mutation was previously demonstrated to prevent the association of SWAP-70 with phosphoinositides (20Shinohara M. Terada Y. Iwamatsu A. Shihora A. Mochizuki N. Higuchi M. Gotoh Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the R236C mutation completely abolished the ability of IBP to interact with PI(3,4,5)P3. To further investigate whether phosphorylation of Tyr-210 by Lck was critical for the ability of IBP to efficiently associate with PI(3,4,5)P3 we then assayed the ability of the IBPY210F mutant to bind PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the notion that Tyr-210 constitutes the major Lck phosphorylation site within the IBP molecule, cotransfection of Lck with IBPY210F did not lead to binding of this mutant to PI(3,4,5)P3. Interestingly, a deletion mutant of IBP lacking the entire N terminus (IBP ΔN) bound to PI(3,4,5)P3 even in the absence of constitutively active Lck (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, this mutant also acquired the ability to bind PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Further studies are in progress to determine whether the binding of IBP ΔN to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2 is mediated directly by the PH domain of IBP or by association of this mutant with additional PH domain-containing proteins of different specificities. Collectively, these data are thus consistent with a model whereby phosphorylation of Tyr-210 by Lck leads to a conformational change in IBP that allows its PH domain to bind to the appropriate phosphoinositide molecule.

The presence of phosphatidic acid was found to be necessary for the translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. We have now employed a combination of alanine-scanning and deletion mutagenesis to identify the critical amino acid residues in Raf-1 necessary for interaction with phosphatidic acid. Progressive mutations within a tetrapeptide motif (residues 398-401 of human Raf-1) reduced and finally eliminated binding of Raf-1 to phosphatidic acid. We then injected zebrafish embryos with RNA encoding wild-type Raf-1 kinase or a mutant version with triple alanine mutations in the tetrapeptide motif and followed the morphological fate of embryonic development. Embryos with mutant but not wild-type Raf-1 exhibited defects in posterior axis formation exemplified by bent trunk and tail structures. Molecular evidence for lack of signaling through mutated Raf-1 was obtained by aberrant in situ hybridization of the ntl (no tail) gene, which functions downstream of Raf-1. Our results demonstrate that a functional phosphatidate binding site is necessary for Raf-1 function in embryonic development.

The protooncogene Raf-1 kinase plays a crucial role in several normal and pathologic cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, development, senescence, programmed cell death, cell cycle progression, immune responses, and carcinogenesis (1Roberts T.M.

A common aspect of Raf-1 activation is its translocation to the plasma membrane, which is composed predominantly of acidic (∼30%) and zwitterionic (70%) phospholipids (6Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar, 7Bazzi M.D. Nelsesteun G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7961-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Membrane lipids also function as second messengers for several intracellular signal transduction events. In the case of Raf-1, lipids such as ceramide and leukotriene D4 are related to its activation in select experimental systems (8Hoshino M. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4878-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol.

Based on the requirement for membrane translocation of Raf-1 prior to activation, we investigated whether membrane lipids might be involved in a functional interaction with Raf-1 kinase that can be a precursor to subsequent activation. In vitro analysis of Raf-1-lipid interaction reveals two distinct phospholipid binding sites within Raf-1 kinase (site I and site II; see Refs. 10Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M.

Site I is located between amino acid residues 139 and 184 of human Raf-1 kinase and consists of a zinc-coordinating cysteine-rich domain analogous to domains present in protein kinase C and other proteins (reviewed in Ref. 13Quest A.F.G. Bell R.M. Kuo J.F. Protein Kinase C. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1994: 64-95Google Scholar). Site I interacts with anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, predominantly via electrostatic interactions, driven by a cluster of basic amino acid residues (12Improta-Brears T. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 198: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second phospholipid binding site (site II) is located between residues 390 and 423 of human Raf-1. This region displays preferential interaction with phosphatidic acid, and the binding is not dependent on ionic interactions alone. An increase in membrane phosphatidic acid via activation of phospholipase D by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (14Sciorra V.A. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14226-14232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) correlates with a net translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (11Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). When the generation of phospholipase D-derived phosphatidate is inhibited by ethanol (via formation of phosphatidylethanol), a specific, dose-dependent loss of Raf-1 translocation is observed. These results suggest that agonist-induced Raf-1 translocation is coupled to the generation of phospholipase D-derived phosphatidic acid. Because translocation is a prerequisite for Raf-1 activation, we postulated that phosphatidic acid might regulate Raf-1 activation by enabling translocation. Subsequently Rizzo et al. (15Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23901-23908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (276) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (HIRcB cells), the stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway by insulin is dependent on phospholipase D activation and is mediated via an induction of Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane and early endosomes by PA. The generation of PA is essential for Raf-1 translocation and brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the ADP-ribosylation factor (required for phospholipase D activation), prevents the translocation of Raf-1 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition of Raf-1 translocation can be reversed by exogenously added PA. Additionally, Raf-1 translocation in response to PLD-derived PA is also observed in Rat-1 cells expressing constitutively activated p21Ras (Q61L mutant) suggesting that PA and Ras may act concurrently and by mutually independent pathways to promote Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 36Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K.A. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on the results from our experiments and that of Rizzo et al. (15Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

However, whether the proposed PA-Raf-1 interaction does indeed play a functional role in the biology of an intact organism is currently unknown. The present study addresses this question by first identifying the molecular nature of PA-Raf-1 interaction and then determining the biological consequences of disrupting such interaction in a model system of vertebrate development. 96-well microtiter plates (Probind) were obtained from BD Biosciences. Glutathione-agarose matrix (sulfur-linked), phosphate-buffered saline, and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were purchased from Sigma. All phospholipids tested were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other chemicals used were of the highest available commercial grade. Polyclonal anti-rabbit Raf-1 antibody (C12) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antiserum was a gift from Dr. Andrew Quest (University of Lauzanne, Lauzanne, Switzerland). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—All the GST fusion proteins used in this study were obtained from DNA generated by PCR using a FLAG-Raf-1 plasmid template (a gift from Dr. Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Details of the PCR, cloning, bacterial expression, and purification of the fusion proteins have been described previously (10Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis on a phosphatidate binding fragment of Raf-1 kinase was performed via PCR as described (17Saiki R.K. Scharf S.J. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Erlich H.A.

Maintenance and Breeding of Zebrafish—Adult zebrafish were obtained from local pet stores and were maintained on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle at 28.5 °C. For breeding, single male and female fish were placed in a breeding tank consisting of a 1 gallon plastic tank that was placed inside a 2.5-gallon tank. The bottom of the plastic tank had been removed and replaced with plastic mesh so that the eggs would pass through the mesh and would be collected at the bottom of the larger tank. In Vitro Transcription and RNA Injection—Raf constructs were cloned in pT7TS (gift of Paul Krieg, University of Arizona), a pGEM4z derivative that contains Xenopus β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences and an A30C30 sequence inserted downstream from a T7 polymerase promoter site. Constructs were linearized downstream from the A30C30 sequence and were transcribed in vitro using a mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion), following the recommended protocol of the manufacturer. Following DNase treatment, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were quantitated either spectrophotometrically or by RiboGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc.). RNAs were injected into embryos in 0.1 m KCl, 0.2% phenol red at a concentration of 100 ng/μl to 1 μg/μl using an Eppendorf 5242 pressure injection apparatus and sterile Femtotips.

The amplified sequence was inserted into pGEMT vector (Promega) for sequencing and in vitro transcription. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-labeled ntl antisense RNA and zebrafish phospholipase D sense and antisense RNAs were synthesized in vitro and used as probes for whole mount in situ hybridization, following previously published methods (19Hauptmann G. Gerster T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 266-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), except that the chorions were removed after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the incubation in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 + 2 mg/ml glycine was omitted. For detection, embryos were incubated in staining solution containing nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Primers 5′-TGAAGTGGCGTGCAACATCT-3′ and 5′-GCCTTGGCATGACATTGCTT-3′ and probe 5′-FAM-TGGCTGCTTGCCCATGAACCAC-TAMRA-3′ were synthesized based on the sequence of the zebrafish phospholipase D cDNA sequence and were used for Taqman quantitative real time RT-PCR, using 25 ng of DNased total RNA from embryos at different stages of development. All values obtained from Taqman were normalized to β-actin RNA levels in the same sample using the following primers and probe for actin: 5′-TGCTGTTTTCCCCTGCATTG-3′ (forward primer), 5′-TTCTGTCCCATGCCAACCA-3′ (reverse primer), and 5′-FAM-TGGACGACCCAGACATCAGGGAGTG-3′ (probe). Identification of Key Residues That Mediate Raf-1-Phosphatidate Interaction—Employing deletion mutagenesis, we previously identified a 35-amino acid segment within the carboxyl terminus of Raf-1 kinase (site II) that interacts with phosphatidic acid (11Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Analysis of site II amino acid sequences of Raf-1 isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf, Raf-1) and Raf-1 from different species reveals two subdomains of significant sequence homology. The first subdomain includes a cluster of basic amino acids corresponding to residues 398-401 of human Raf-1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number X03484; Locuslink number 5894). The second subdomain contains predominantly hydrophobic residues encoded by amino acids 404-407. A Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity profile analysis of site II identified two distinct regions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters that matched the two sequence homology domains (data not shown). We analyzed the relative contribution of each homology domain toward interaction of Raf-1 with phosphatidic acid via alanine-scanning mutagenesis of individual amino acids. A total of 18 different site II mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis and expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Fig. 1a is a schematic depiction of all the mutants used in this study. We then tested the ability of the mutated GST-Raf-1 fusion proteins to interact with phosphatidic acid via an in vitro assay as described previously (10Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1, b-d. Fig. 1b shows the binding curves generated with proteins that contain mutations within the basic residues of the first homology domain of site II. Single site R398A or R401A replacements did not affect phosphatidate binding when compared with the wild-type protein. K399A replacement resulted in reduced binding to phosphatidic acid. The two-site replacement mutants (R398A,R401A) also displayed reduced binding to PA compared with the wild-type protein. The reduction in binding was more severe in the two-site mutants containing mutations in Lys-399 (R398A,K399A, and K399A,R401A, respectively). Finally, the binding was severely compromised (80-95% reduction compared with wild-type) in a triple site mutant (R398A,K399A,R401A). These results suggested that the basic cluster, RKTR, constitutes a critical determinant for Raf-1-PA interaction with Lys-399 probably providing the major contribution. We then focused on the second region of homology within site II, encompassing the hydrophobic residues, and created single site alanine mutants for residues 402-410 of human Raf-1. The mutated proteins were again tested for their relative ability to bind phosphatidic acid by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format assay described previously. The results, shown in Fig. 1c, demonstrate that site-directed mutagenesis within this domain had only a modest effect on interaction with phosphatidic acid. Replacement of Val-403, Leu-406, Leu-407, and Phe-408 to alanine did not change the binding profile to phosphatidic acid, compared with the wild-type sequence. Mutations of His-402, Ile-405, and Met-409 resulted in slightly reduced binding to phosphatidic acid. The greatest reduction in phosphatidate binding (about 40% of control) was observed with the Asn-404 and Gly-410 mutants. A comparison of the effects of mutations within the first and second homology domains of site II suggests that the charged tetrad sequence, RKTR, probably constitutes a major determinant for binding to phosphatidate and may provide an initial, electrostatic-driven clustering around one or more phosphatidate head groups. The hydrophobic region, adjacent to RKTR, may subsequently function to associate with phosphatidic acid via non-ionic interactions, resulting in a more stable complex. However, in the absence of the primary interaction driven by the charged amino acids, the hydrophobic residues are not sufficient to form stable association with phosphatidate. Additional support in favor of the critical role of the RKTR sequence in binding to phosphatidate is provided by a site II mutant lacking the tetrapeptide motif altogether (RafDel398-401). As expected, the corresponding mutant protein failed to interact with PA. A comparison of relative PA binding by all the site II mutants employed in this study is shown in Fig. 1d. To examine whether the RafAAA mutation would affect normal development, synthetic RNAs encoding wild-type human Raf, RafK375M, or RafAAA were injected into one-two cell zebrafish embryos. Previous work in Xenopus has shown that injecting the RafK375M allele into one-two cell embryos results in embryos lacking trunk and tail structures (26MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 571-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The RafK375M mutation replaces a critical lysine residue at the ATP binding pocket of Raf-1 resulting in an inactive protein. As shown in Fig. 2 injection of wild-type Raf had no effect on normal zebrafish development, whereas about 30% of embryos injected with either RafAAA or RafK375M produced a phenotype similar to that seen in Xenopus; in 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) embryos the tail is absent or severely shortened, and the overall length of the anterior-posterior axis is shortened. Examination of injected embryos at 12 hpf frequently revealed that the notochord was bent or shortened (data not shown). Measurement of the steady state levels of human Raf-1 in injected embryos by immunoblotting showed comparable protein levels in embryos injected with the different forms of Raf-1(data not shown). One of the known downstream targets of FGF signaling during vertebrate gastrulation is the product of the Xbra or ntl gene. Expression of a dominant negative FGF receptor or a mutant allele of one of several different MAP kinase cascade components results in a reduction or elimination of normal Xbra expression. Conversely, overexpression of FGF or a constitutively active MEK or treatment of Xenopus animal caps with FGF causes an increase in Xbra expression (20Griffin K. Patient R. Holder N. Development. 1995; 121: 2983-2994PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effects of injecting the various forms of Raf-1 on ntl expression, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using a digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense probe to ntl. ntl expression normally begins at 5.5 hpf. At this time (germ-ring stage) the germ ring forms and is considered the start of gastrulation. In normal embryos, ntl expression is restricted at the germ-ring stage to a circumferential belt of cells that have newly involuted from the epiblast layer inwards toward the yolk, forming the mesendodermal cell layer (Fig. 3a). In embryos injected with either RafAAA or RafK375M but not wild-type Raf-1 this belt of expression is disrupted, resulting in embryos with a discontinuous band of cells expressing ntl (Fig. 3b). Thus, injection of Raf-1 with a mutated phosphatidate binding site is sufficient to block normal signaling events that are required for the expression of ntl in the newly formed mesendodermal layer. Phosphatidic acid can be generated by two different mechanisms. In one mechanism, glycerol is phosphorylated by enzymes belonging to the diacylglycerol kinase family to yield PA. The other mechanism involves the hydrolysis of phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine to PA by the action of the phospholipase D group of enzymes. The relative contribution of these reactions toward the generation of PA in zebrafish embryos is not clear. However, previous experiments suggest that phospholipase D-derived PA is involved in the regulation of Raf-1 kinase (11Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Based on these reports, we sought to determine whether phospholipase D transcripts were indeed present in the zebrafish embryos at the time when the dominant negative effects of RafAAA were evident. Other studies have shown that phospholipase D isoforms (PLD1 and PLD2) are selectively and differentially expressed in the developing mouse brain (38Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.A. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem.

Patterns. 2002; 2: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on the sequences of two PLD isoforms in mammals (PLD1 and PLD2), we designed degenerate primers and isolated, via RT-PCR, a ∼1-kb fragment encoding part of a zebrafish phospholipase D using shield stage RNA as template. The amplified fragment was sequenced and found to be more closely related to mammalian PLD1. We did not obtain zebrafish phospholipase D sequences corresponding to phospholipase D2. A review of the sequence similarity of available zebrafish expressed sequence tags revealed several with similarity to vertebrate phospholipase D1 but none with similarity to the D2 form (data not shown). At present, it is not known if a zebrafish phospholipase D2 exists, and, if so, its pattern of expression. Based on the sequence of the amplified fragment we synthesized primers and probes to the zebrafish phospholipase D and performed real time, quantitative PCR analysis via Taqman (21Medhurst A.D. Harrison D.C. Read S.J. Campbell C.A. Robbins M.J. Pangalos M.N. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 98: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), using RNA obtained from embryos at various stages of development. As shown in Fig. 4, zebrafish phospholipase D transcripts were found to be present at all stages of development that were examined, with highest expression at the 12 somite stage. The results obtained from the Taqman analysis demonstrate the presence of zebrafish phospholipase D transcripts in developing embryos consistent with the generation of PA during a time course when Raf-1 plays a crucial role in the process of mesoderm induction and anterior-posterior specification. However, these results provide no information about the status of activation of PLD protein during these stages of zebrafish development. Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe. As shown in Fig. 5, phospholipase D1 transcripts appear to be present at uniform levels in different regions of embryos at the 64-cell, shield, and 12-hpf stages. Colley et al. (38Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.A. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have also shown a widespread distribution of PLD1 and PLD2 transcripts, with expression detected in all mouse tissues examined, as assayed by Northern analysis. However, unlike our findings, expression levels were not uniform, varying 10-100-fold in the tissues examined. In addition, in situ hybridization analysis of the expression pattern within the E11.5 embryonic brain and in the adult brain revealed that both PLD1 and D2 transcripts are present in a restricted pattern, with PLD1 transcripts detected in ventricular cells lining the brain and spinal cord, in the retina, and in a portion of the nasal neuroepithelium of the E11.5 embryo. The 12-hpf zebrafish embryo brain lacks any overt morphological subdivisions, so our analysis of the transcript pattern of zebrafish PLD1 was done at embryonic stages that are earlier than an E11.5 mouse embryo. It is possible that as development proceeds, the pattern of expression of zebrafish PLD1 may also become more restricted. It is also possible that sectioning of the zebrafish embryos shown in Fig. 5 may reveal an expression pattern that is restricted to specific cell types or specific regions of these embryos. These results indicate that phospholipase D transcripts are present before the onset of zygotic transcription at the mid-blastula transition and are present in both ectodermal and mesendodermal cells at later stages. We previously identified a segment within human Raf-1 kinase (amino acid residues 390-423) that binds PA. We also showed that PA is required for the translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stimulated with the phorbol ester, 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. Rizzo et al. (15Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol.

In their studies, PA did not directly activate Raf-1 in vitro or in vivo strongly arguing for a role of PA primarily in facilitating the translocation of Raf-1 kinase."

SULT2B1b has a predilection for cholesterol but is also capable of sulfonating pregnenolone, whereas SULT2B1a preferentially sulfonates pregnenolone and only minimally sulfonates cholesterol. We have determined the crystal structure of SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b bound to the substrate donor product 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate at 2.9 and 2.4 Å, respectively, as well as SULT2B1b in the presence of the acceptor substrate pregnenolone at 2.3 Å. These structures reveal a different catalytic binding orientation for the substrate from a previously determined structure of hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) binding dehydroepiandrosterone. In addition, the amino-terminal helix comprising residues Asp19 to Lys26, which determines the specificity difference between the SULT2B1 isoforms, becomes ordered upon pregnenolone binding, covering the substrate binding pocket.

In addition, the amino-terminal helix comprising residues Asp19 to Lys26, which determines the specificity difference between the SULT2B1 isoforms, becomes ordered upon pregnenolone binding, covering the substrate binding pocket. Sulfonation of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics is catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called sulfotransferases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of a SO3 group from PAPS, 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; SULT, sulfotransferase; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square; EST, estrogen sulfotransferase; E2, estradiol-17β. the universal sulfonate donor molecule, to an acceptor group of various substrates. Cytosolic sulfotransferases sulfonate small molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, bioamines, and therapeutic drugs (1Coughtrie M.W. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Falany C.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases sulfonate the 3-hydroxy group of steroids and are part of the superfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases that includes phenol (aryl) and amine sulfotransferases. The prototypical human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase SULT2A1 readily sulfonates dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) but also has a broad substrate predilection (3Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 703-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, two human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases, SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b, have been shown to be encoded by the same gene but differ at the amino terminus by 8 and 23 amino acids, respectively, as a result of an alternative exon 1 (4Her C.

The SULT2B1a isoform avidly sulfonates pregnenolone, whereas sulfonation of cholesterol is minimal. In contrast, the SULT2B1b isoform preferentially sulfonates cholesterol with greater efficiency and, to a lesser extent, pregnenolone (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although both isoforms are capable of sulfonating DHEA, they do so with relatively low efficiencies (3Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 703-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Differential expression patterns of SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b in organ systems, particularly the skin and brain, in association with their respective substrate preferences reveal potential physiological implications for the sulfonated product. SULT2B1b, now recognized as a cholesterol sulfotransferase, is quantitatively the predominant hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase expressed in human skin. Cholesterol sulfate has been recognized to be essential in skin development as a regulatory molecule in human keratinocyte differentiation and creation of the barrier (6Kuroki T. Ikuta T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the evidence that the brain and spinal cord in mouse almost exclusively express SULT2B1a (11Shimizu C. Fuda H. Yanai H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone sulfate, which is most efficiently produced by SULT2B1a, is now acknowledged as an essential neurosteroid that modulates neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid type A, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and Sigma 1 (11Shimizu C.

Although the SULT2A1 and SULT2B1 isozymes are ∼37% identical in amino acid sequence, the SULT2B1 isoforms have extended amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends that are absent in the SULT2A1 isozyme (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that removal of the 52 amino acid carboxyl-terminal end that is common to both SULT2B1 isoforms has no effect on catalytic activity of either isoform (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Removal of the 8-residue aminoterminal end that is unique to SULT2B1a has no significant effect on catalytic activity; however, removal of the 23-residue amino-terminal end that is unique to SULT2B1b abolishes catalytic activity for cholesterol but not pregnenolone (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Full wild-type activity of SULT2B1b for cholesterol can be retained if only the first 18 amino acids are deleted (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that residues 19DISEI23 are responsible for the ability of SULT2B1b to sulfonate cholesterol. Thus, the difference in substrate specificity appears to lie at the unique amino terminus of the SULT2B1 isoforms. To better understand the nature of the substrate specificity differences among SULT2A1, SULT2B1a, and SULT2B1b, we have solved the x-ray crystal structures of SULT2B1a and an active truncated version of SULT2B1b (Asp19-Asp312) in the presence of PAP, the substrate donor product, as well as the structure of SULT2B1b in the presence of PAP and the acceptor substrate pregnenolone. These structures reveal a different orientation of acceptor substrate binding for SULT2A1 and the SULT2B1 isoforms and suggest a possible role for the unique amino terminus of SULT2B1b in determining substrate specificity for cholesterol. Expression and Purification of SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b— SULT2B1a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U92314) was cloned into the pGEX-6P-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described to create a glutathione S-transferase-SULT2B1a fusion protein (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This construct was then used to transform Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The truncated form of SULT2B1b (Asp19-Asp312) used for the crystallographic studies was cloned from the previously described pGEX-6P-3 glutathione S-transferase-SULT2B1b fusion plasmid containing the full-length SULT2B1b cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U92315) using the upstream primer 5′-CCGAATTCCGACATCTCGGAAATCAGCCAGAAG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCAGTCTTCATCCCAGGGGAAGGTCGG-3′ (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. DNA sequencing identified appropriate clones. The corresponding construct was transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells. SULT2B1a fusion protein was expressed overnight in 2× YT (16 g of bacto-tryptone, 10 g of bacto-yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, and 5 ml of 1 m NaOH in 1 liter) media at 22 °C on a shaker after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 350 mm NaCl), sonicated on ice, and spun down. Soluble protein was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. The resin was washed extensively in batch with lysis buffer plus 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The full-lengh SULT2B1a enzyme was eluted from the resin by PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) digestion, and the protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and then dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Protein was loaded onto a PAP-agarose column but did not bind. The flow-through was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a salt gradient from 100 mm to 1.0 m NaCl. The eluted protein was then concentrated to 13 mg/ml and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. PAP was then added to the concentrated protein for a final concentration of 4 mm. The SULT2B1b fusion protein was expressed, and cells were disrupted using a very similar protocol but with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Soluble protein was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and extensively washed in lysis buffer and 0.5 mm PAP. The pure SULT2B1b enzyme was then eluted by thrombin digestion. PAP was added to the eluted protein for a final concentration of 1 mm to increase the protein solubility. The protein then was concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml and run over a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The fractions corresponding to SULT2B1b were concentrated to 23 mg/ml, and PAP was added for a final concentration of 4 mm. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of SULT2B1a were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of prepared SULT2B1a with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.8–1.0 m sodium tartrate, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m CHES, pH 9.0. Crystals were transferred in four steps of increasing sodium tartrate and ethylene glycol into 1.5 m sodium tartrate, 15% ethylene glycol, 40 mm Li2SO4, 4 mm PAP, and 80 mm CHES, pH 9.0, and then flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to -180 °C for data collection. Attempts to cocrystallize full-length SULT2B1a in the presence of pregnenolone resulted in crystals, but no substrate was observed in the acceptor substrate binding pocket. In addition, attempts to soak pregnenolone into the crystal also failed. However, it was discovered that a molecule of CHES from the buffer was binding with the sulfate group interacting with Gln170 and Tyr29 in a competitive manner to the acceptor substrate in the binding pocket. Attempts to co-crystallize the complex in Tris buffer did not result in diffraction quality crystals. Crystals of SULT2B1b were obtained using the hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of prepared protein with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing between 0.55 and 0.8 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m imidazole at pH 8.0–8.5. For co-crystallization attempts, 1 mm pregnenolone, 1 mm DHEA, saturated cholesterol (<1 mm), and saturated 25-hydroxycholesterol (<1 mm) were added to the protein solution of different hanging drops. These crystals were transferred in four steps of increasing sodium citrate and ethylene glycol concentrations into the cryosolution consisting of 1.0 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PAP between 1 mm and saturated acceptor substrate, and 10% ethylene glycol. Crystals were flash-cooled directly into liquid nitrogen and then transferred into a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to -180 °C. Electron density was visible for the pregnenolone and DHEA data sets. The 25-hydroxycholesterol data set did not produce electron density for the substrate; however, it diffracted to higher resolution than any apocrystals tried, therefore it is used as the apodata set. Data Collection and Refinement—The SULT2B1b data set collected in the presence of pregnenolone was collected on a MARCCD area detector system at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamline 22 at Advanced Photon Service. All of the other data sets were collected on a Rigaku RU3H rotating anode generator with a Raxis4 area detector and MSC blue mirrors (Table I). All of the diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38605) Google Scholar). The phase problem for the SULT2B1a data set was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (19Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with the x-ray crystal structure of SULT2A1 solved in the presence of PAP and with no acceptor substrate as the starting model (20Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This model was refined at 2.9-Å resolution using iterative cycles of model building with the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and torsion angle simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement using the program CNS (22Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The model of SULT2B1a was then used to refine the structure of SULT2B1b in the presence of pregnenolone at 2.3 Å in a similar fashion. This structure was used as the starting model to solve the structures of the apo and DHEA data sets of SULT2B1b. The quality of the models was checked using PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ordered residues for the SULT2B1a structure are Leu12-Leu95 and Ser103-Glu296. Ordered residues for the SULT2B1b structure with pregnenolone bound are Ser18 (from the thrombin cleavage site) and Asp19-Glu311. Ordered residues for the SULT2B1b structure with DHEA are Ser18, Asp19-Asp115, and Ser118-Glu311. The ordered residues for the SULT2B1b structure with no acceptor substrate present are Leu27-Asp115 and Pro119-Glu311.Table ICrystallographic data statisticsData set2b1a2b1b2b1b + pregnenolone2b1b + DHEAData CollectionUnit cell dimensionsa = b = 75.26; c = 252.27 α = β = γ = 90°a = b = 75.72; c = 252.08 α = β = γ = 90°a = b = 75.96; c = 253.62 α = β = γ = 90°a = b = 75.859; c = 253.8 α = β = γ = 90°Resolution (Å)25-2.950-2.450-2.350-2.5Space groupP41212P41212P41212P41212No. of observations105,36771,042174,703141,095Unique reflections29,92826,99832,28225,505R sym (%) (last shell)aR sym = Σ(|Ii - 〈I〉|)/Σ(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection.8.1 (59.8)11.3 (37.5)5.8 (31.2)11.9 (37.7)I/σI (last shell)12.1 (2.1)25.3 (2.0)14.3 (3.2)25.9 (3.5)Mosaicity1.10.60.50.8Completeness (%) (last shell)99.0 (98.5)90.3 (78.2)95.4 (78.4)96.0 (86.8)Refinement statisticsR cryst (%) (last shell)bR cryst = Σ||Fo | - |Fc ||/Σ|Fo | calculated from working data set.

Open table in a new tab Sulfotransferase Assay—Sulfotransferase activity of truncated SULT2B1b was determined using radiolabeled cholesterol and pregnenolone according to a previously reported procedure (5Fuda H.

Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min. This construct was shown to have two-thirds the activity for cholesterol and four times the activity for pregnenolone as the full-length protein (Table II). Activity for the full-length SULT2B1a used in these experiments has been reported previously (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Table IICatalytic activity of SULT2B1b constructProteinCholesterolPregnenolonenmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgFull-length9.4 ± 0.452.1 ± 0.09Asp19-Asp3126.1 ± 0.157.9 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab Overall Description—The crystal structures of full-length SULT2B1a and the construct Asp19-Asp312 of SULT2B1b with PAP and no acceptor substrate bound are for all intents and purposes identical. For SULT2B1a, the amino-terminal 11 residues and the carboxyl-terminal 52 residues (proline-rich region) are disordered. For SULT2B1b, residues Asp13-Lys26 are disordered. Therefore, the sequences of the ordered residues are identical. Because the structure of SULT2B1b is a higher resolution structure, the discussion of the structures will focus on the SULT2B1b structures. The overall structure of SULT2B1b is that of the classical cytosolic sulfotransferase fold consisting of an α/β motif comprised of a central 5-stranded parallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). Superposition to other cytosolic sulfotransferases reveals a r.m.s. of 1.3 Å for 272 structurally equivalent Cαs to human estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and 1.5 Å for 263 structurally equivalent Cαs to SULT2A1 (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As might be expected, residues surrounding the PAPS binding site are highly conserved among the cytosolic sulfotransferases with the major structural and sequence differences existing around the hydrophobic acceptor substrate binding pocket. PAP Binding—The loop connecting the first strand of the central β-sheet with the first helix forms the PSB-loop (residues 67TYPKSGT73) (26Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This loop is similar in structure to the P-loop motifs found in many protein kinases and is involved in binding the 5′-phosphate of PAPS (or PAP) (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A number of residues from the PSB-loop form interactions with the 5′-phosphate of PAP (Fig. 2a). Backbone amide nitrogens from Ser71 (3.1 Å), Gly72 (3.1 Å), and Thr73 (2.8 Å) as well as the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr73 (2.5 Å) are all within hydrogen-bonding distance to the oxygen atom O4P of the 5′-phosphate. The O5P oxygen of the 5′-phosphate is in position to form hydrogen bonds with both the backbone amide nitrogen (2.9 Å) and the hydroxyl oxygen (2.8 Å) of Thr74. The amine nitrogen from highly conserved Lys70 is within hydrogen-bonding distance (3.0 Å) to the oxygen atom O6P of the 5′-phosphate. From a previously solved structure of human EST in complex with PAPS, it has been shown that this oxygen is the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and the sulfuryl moiety (Fig. 2b) (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A number of residues are also involved in binding the 3′phosphate. Backbone amide nitrogens from Lys275 (2.8 Å) and Gly276 (2.9 Å) are in position to bind the O2P phosphate oxygen, whereas the O3P phosphate oxygen is within hydrogen-bonding distances to nitrogen atom NH2 of Arg274 (3.1 Å) and atom NH2 of Arg147 (3.1 Å). The O1P oxygen of the 3′-phosphate is 3.1 Å from nitrogen atom NE of Arg274 and is also 2.8 Å from the hydroxyl oxygen of the highly conserved residue Ser155. The adenine group of PAP is found sandwiched between two aromatic residues in a parallel ring-stacking orientation with Trp75 and anti-parallel ring-stacking orientation with Phe246. Atom N3 of the adenine is hydrogen bound to the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr210 (2.8 Å), and the N6 amine nitrogen is 2.9 Å from the carbonyl oxygen of Ser244. Substrate Binding—The crystal structures of SULT2B1b in the presence of PAP and acceptor substrates pregnenolone or DHEA reveals that these two similar compounds, which differ at the C17 carbon side chain, bind in identical positions and orientations (Fig. 3, a–c). The substrate binding site is highly hydrophobic. There is only one hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) made between the protein and substrate that is between the O3 acceptor hydroxyl off the C3 carbon and atom NE2 of His125, the proposed catalytic base. Residues found lining the hydrophobic acceptor binding pocket near the A ring of the steroid substrates other than His125 are Phe272, Tyr159, Gln165, Tyr44, and Trp103. The aromatic side chain of Trp103 is stacked parallel to that of the steroids A and B rings (Fig. 3a). Residues found lining the pocket near the B and C rings are Tyr257, Leu260, and Thr106. Finally, residues found lining the opening of the binding pocket at the surface of the protein near the D ring of the steroid are Trp98, Val108, Leu43, Leu264, and Ile20. Interestingly, Ile20 resides on the amino-terminal helix comprised of residues Asp19 to Lys26, which is only ordered upon substrate binding and is required for cholesterol activity. In both the SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b structures with no acceptor substrate, the first ordered residue is the leucine equivalent to that of Leu27 in SULT2B1b. Catalytic Mechanism—Based on the crystal structure of mouse EST with PAP and estradiol-17β (E2) bound, it has previously been suggested that sulfotransferases proceed by an SN2-like in-line displacement reaction mechanism (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The position of pregnenolone binding in SULT2B1b places the acceptor hydroxyl 4.3 Å away from the position of the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and the sulfuryl group in PAPS. Superposition of PAPS from the human EST + PAPS structure on to the SULT2B1b active site positions the sulfur atom of PAPS 2.6 Å from the acceptor hydroxyl in line with the acceptor hydroxyl and the bridging oxygen from the leaving group PAP (Fig. 2b) (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, this geometry supports the in-line displacement mechanism. In such a reaction mechanism for SULT2B1b, conserved His125 could serve as a general base to help deprotonate the acceptor hydroxyl and conserved Lys70 could help to reduce the negative charge build up on the bridging oxygen between the leaving group PAP and the sulfuryl group of PAPS. Interestingly, in the structure of PAPS bound to human EST, residues equivalent to conserved Ser155, which interacts with the 3′-phosphate of PAP, and Lys70 form a hydrogen bond (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, in the transition state and PAP bound states, the lysine side chain undergoes a conformational change and interacts with the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and the sulfuryl group to help facilitate sulfuryl transfer (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, residue Ser155 may participate not only in substrate donor binding but may help inhibit hydrolysis of PAPS by interacting with the lysine in the absence of acceptor substrate (Fig. 2b). Comparision to Human EST and SULT2A1—Although the overall fold of the SULT2B1 isoforms is very similar to that of other cytosolic sulfotransferases, there is a striking difference in the position of the acceptor substrates (Fig. 4). Three other cytosolic sulfotransferases that have been solved in the presence of their presumed physiological substrates are human EST and mouse EST in the presence of E2 and human SULT2A1 in the presence of DHEA (24Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DHEA is found in two different competitive orientations in the active site of SULT2A1 (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One site positions the acceptor hydroxyl in the same position as that of E2 in the human EST structure, and the molecule extends out toward the surface of the protein in the same direction and position as E2 but rotated by approximately 30° with respect to an imaginary axis running the length of the molecules. This is believed to be the catalytically relevant binding orientation of DHEA (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The other position of the DHEA molecule binds such that the C3 carbon only differs in position by 1.1 Å; however, the molecule has shifted such that the O17 ketone oxygen has moved 7.4 Å from that of the catalytic binding position resulting in an approximate 45° angle difference in binding. This positions the acceptor hydroxyl 2.2 Å away from the catalytic position, no longer in line with the position of the leaving group PAP of PAPS. Thus, this position has been suggested to be involved in substrate inhibition. Interestingly, the catalytic binding position of pregnenolone and DHEA in the SULT2B1b structures is in the same position but a different orientation as the substrate inhibition site of SULT2A1 (Fig. 4). However, in the case of SULT2B1b, the acceptor hydroxyl is in the correct position and orientation for catalysis (Fig. 2b). In addition, the pregnenolone and DHEA are rotated approximately 170° along the imaginary long axis of the molecule with respect to DHEA binding in the substrate inhibition site in SULT2A1. Structural difference at the opening of the binding pocket suggest that residues Gln165, Leu43, Leu27, and Leu264 of SULT2B1b would form steric clashes with the D ring of a steroid if it were bound in the catalytic orientation as E2 in human EST and DHEA in SULT2A1 (Fig. 4). Perhaps the most striking structural difference in the overall fold in this protein is the position of the amino-terminal helix of SULT2B1b with respect to human EST and SULT2A1. Structural similarities between the proteins begin at residue Glu30 of SULT2B1b. In the acceptor substrate bound structure of SULT2B1b, the amino-terminal helix runs across the opening of the acceptor substrate binding pocket positioning itself between loops containing residues Leu259 to Ser263 and Thr106 to Val108, effectively burying the substrate in the hydrophobic binding site (Fig. 3a). Substrate Specificity of SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b—Previously, it has been suggested that the specificity difference for cholesterol and pregnenolone between SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b could be traced to the unique amino-terminal residues 19DISEI23 (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The results from alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 19DISEI23 region reveal that only the I20A and I23A mutants knocked out cholesterol-sulfonating activity. It was then shown that this activity could be partially restored by replacement with a conservative substitution such as leucine (5Fuda H. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Javitt N.B. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36161-36166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The position of Ile20 and Ile23 are such that they lie on the same side of the helix facing on the inside of the hydrophobic pocket, whereas residues Ser21 and Glu22 are solvent-exposed. Interestingly, the residues corresponding to 19DISEI23 of SULT2B1b are 4PPPFH8 in SULT2B1a. With three prolines in a row, it is unlikely that these residues are able to form a α-helix and therefore would be unable to cover the opening to the substrate binding pocket in the same manner as is seen in the SULT2B1b structure. Although we do not have a crystal structure of SULT2B1b with cholesterol bound yet, the position of pregnenolone is such that the O20 ketone is only 3.4 Å from atom CD1 of Ile20 and the C21 atom is 6.0 Å from atom CD1 of Ile23. Thus, these residues may be in position to form positive van der Waal's interactions with the longer side chain of the C17 atom of cholesterol. However, slight conformational changes of the protein may be necessary to accommodate the longer side chain of cholesterol. Alternatively, it is possible that Ile20 may form positive van der Waal's interactions with the hydrophobic side chain of cholesterol, whereas the role of Ile23 is to form positive van der Waal's interactions with residues Leu27, Gly42, and Leu43 locking the helix in place. Neither interaction alone may be enough to bind the helix in the present orientation upon substrate binding, but when both are present the helix can lock down in position over the active site to bind the hydrophobic cholesterol molecule. To better understand the possible binding position of the cholesterol side chain, coordinates of cholesterol were taken from the structures of cholesterol bound to β-cryptogein (29Lascombe M.B. Ponchet M. Venard P. Milat M.L. Blein J.P. Prange T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and bound to nuclear receptor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α ligand binding domain (30Kallen J.A. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Geisse S. Geiser M. Delhon I. Fournier B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and superimposed on the pregnenolone molecule bound to SULT2B1b. In these superpositions, the closest distance between Ile23 and cholesterol is 5.9 Å with the side chains of the cholesterol molecules extending between residues Trp98 and Val108 toward the surface of the protein (Fig. 5). This finding supports the notion that Ile23 interactions with the protein may help stabilize Ile20 in an orientation where it can form positive van der Waal contacts with the cholesterol molecule and that Ile23 does not interact directly with the cholesterol molecule. However, it should be kept in mind that the cholesterol side chain is flexible and conformations other than what are seen in Fig. 5 could be possible. In conclusion, these structures reveal a different catalytic binding orientation of the acceptor substrate than previously seen and provide insight into the role the amino terminus plays in dictating substrate specificity for cholesterol between the SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b proteins. In addition, these structures combined with previous structures of other cytosolic sulfotransferases help us to understand better the broad overlapping substrate specificities of these enzymes.

Degranulation was stimulated by intracellular application of calcium and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate via the recording patch pipette or via streptolysin-O permeabilization. Exocytotic fusion was monitored by capacitance measurements, whereas release of fluorescent weak bases, which accumulate selectively within eosinophil granules, was followed by fluorescence imaging. Several distinct types of granule fusion events were directly observed by simultaneous capacitance and fluorescence measurements. These are fusion of a single granule with the plasma membrane, intracellular granule-granule fusion, fusion of large compounds of pre-fused granules with the plasma membrane (compound exocytosis), and sequential fusion of granules to granules previously fused to the plasma membrane. Extensive granule-granule fusion was also observed by electron microscopy of permeabilized cells. All these fusion mechanisms contribute to focal release. The coexistence of distinct modes of exocytosis suggests that their regulation may modulate effector functions of eosinophils during helminth infection and allergic response.

Eosinophils are involved in host defense against multicellular parasites (1Butterworth A.E. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1977; 77: 127-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and have also been implicated in allergic asthmatic response (2Lacy P. Moqbel R. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 1: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Parasite killing is mediated by adherence of eosinophils to the parasite surface followed by directed release of cytotoxic granule contents by exocytosis (3Henderson W.R. Chi E.Y. Jörg A. Klebanoff S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 111: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nüsse O. Lindau M. Cromwell O. Kay A.B. Gomperts B.D. J. Exp.

Degranulation in eosinophils occurs through formation of degranulation sacs, which ensures release of cytotoxic proteins in high concentration at focal sites through a single fusion pore (3Henderson W.R. Chi E.Y. Jörg A. Klebanoff S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 111: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tai P.-C. Spry C.J.F. Br. J. Hematol. 1981; 49: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is widely assumed that in eosinophils and basophils homotypic granule-granule fusion inside the cell leads to formation of compound granules followed by compound exocytosis, i.e. fusion of the compound with plasma membrane (6Tai P.-C. Spry C.J.F. Br. J. Hematol. 1981; 49: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7McLaren D.J. Mackenzie C.D. Ramalho-Pinto J.F. Clin. Exp.

Galli S.J. Morgan E. Galli A.S. Hammond M.E. Dvorak H.F. Lab. Investig. 1981; 44: 174-191PubMed Google Scholar). Patch clamp capacitance measurements on horse eosinophils have suggested that in addition to compound exocytosis a mechanism of cumulative fusion exists, also leading to formation of a degranulation sac and focal release. Cumulative granule fusion is proposed to occur by fusion of a first granule with the plasma membrane followed by fusion of further granules with the already fused granule directing release of all granular contents through the initially formed fusion pore in the plasma membrane (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Scepek S. Moqbel R. Lindau M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 276-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Horse eosinophils contain particularly large granules (11Henderson W.R. Chi E.Y. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 73: 33-48PubMed Google Scholar) with a mean diameter of ≈1.5 μm, making them suitable for fluorescence imaging of single granule fusion events and patch clamp admittance analysis (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By using electron microscopy and fluorescence imaging combined with square wave membrane capacitance measurements (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

J. 2001; 81: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we provide direct evidence of both mechanisms, compound exocytosis and cumulative fusion. In the accompanying paper (32Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44928-44933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we show that the three different fusion processes, granule-granule fusion, granule-plasma membrane fusion, and granule-fused granule fusion, are differentially regulated. Cell Preparation—Eosinophils were isolated from 50–150 ml of fresh blood obtained from the jugular vein of horses and purified by centrifugation over discontinuous Percoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) gradients as described (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended at 0.5 × 105–106 cells/ml in Medium 199 (containing penicillin, streptomycin with 4.2 mm each of glutamine, and NaHCO3), stored at room temperature, and used within 12 h of preparation. For fluorescence imaging combined with patch clamp capacitance measurements, ∼30–50 μl of cell suspension was dispensed onto 25-mm glass coverslips held in a low wall Delrin chamber (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). External solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2–7.3, ∼300 mOsm containing 1 μm lysotracker green DND-26 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the chamber to a final volume of about 1 ml. The cells were allowed to incubate in the dark for 45 min before the chamber was washed with external solution lacking the lysotracker dye. Electrophysiology—Square wave whole-cell patch clamp methods were employed to measure passive electrical cell parameters (12Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 13Thompson R.E. Lindau M. Webb W.W. Biophys.

Internal pipette solution contained 125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm CaCl2, 5 EGTA-KOH, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, ∼300 mOsm containing GTPγS concentrations as stated in the text. GTPγS stock solution was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Whole-cell current measurements were made with a HEKA EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier controlled by an Atari computer using a gain setting of 2 mV/pA, t r = 2 μs and with the C-slow compensation turned off. A symmetrical square wave voltage stimulus with an amplitude of 20 or 32 mV (250 Hz) was generated by an analog/digital converter board (PCI-MIO-16XE-10; National Instruments, Austin, TX) and applied to the input of the EPC-9 on a holding potential of 0 mV. Currents were filtered using the 30-kHz 3-pole Bessel filter of the EPC-9 and continuously sampled at 100 kHz by the analog/digital converter board. Current transients were averaged and fit off-line using exponential curve fitting routines of IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Cell membrane capacitance (C m), conductance (G m), and access resistance (R a) circuit elements were obtained as described previously (12Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A time delay introduced to the current transients by the amplifier current filter was corrected empirically by making small changes of the C-slow and R a controls of the EPC-9 with an open head stage until the effect of changes in the estimates of either circuit element on the other was at a minimum (12Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 13Thompson R.E. Lindau M. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Single exponential fits were applied to all current transients initially, and current transients that produced large fitting residuals were refit using a double exponential fitting routine. Equivalent circuit elements comprising the plasma membrane capacitance (C c), fusing granule membrane capacitance (C g), fusion pore conductance (G p), cell membrane conductance (G m), and pipette access resistance (R a) were calculated as described previously (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Imaging—Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope using a 100 × 1.30 NA Fluar oil-immersion objective with a 1.6× Optovar setting. A cooled, intensified 12-bit CCD camera (Quantix 57; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) was mounted to the top port of the microscope and connected to a PC computer running V++ software (Digital Optics, New Zealand). Images were acquired using 2 × 2 pixel binning, and the exposure times for image acquisition were between 40 and 100 ms. The image pixel size was 160 nm. Synchronization of the image acquisition and the electrophysiological measurements was effected by addition of the 5-V exposing output (scaled by 0.1 using a voltage divider) of the Quantix 57 camera to the whole-cell current at the analog/digital converter board for the initial 1 s of the measurements. Epi-illumination was obtained using a 75-watt xenon arc lamp that was strongly attenuated using a 0.1% transmission neutral density filter, and a 480/40 nm excitation filter, 505 nm LP dichroic, and a 535/50 nm emission filter (Omega Optical, Inc., and Chroma Technology, both of Brattleboro, VT). Under these imaging conditions, autofluorescence of eosinophil granules was not detectable, and photobleaching of lysotracker green was kept to a minimum. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Image Analysis—Images were acquired and processed using V++ software and its built-in routines. Single frames (n) from acquired time-lapse sequences were extracted as signed 32-bit images. A subtraction procedure was implemented providing difference images according to the following scheme. For a sequence of j number of images (imagen... imagen+j-1) difference images (differencei = image i - average, i = n... n + j - 1) were generated by subtracting the average of 10 images preceding the first image in the following Sequence 1, (average=∑k=110imagen-k/10)SEQUENCE 1 The 32-bit difference images contained both negative and positive values. The difference images of the sequence (n... n + j - 1) were scaled and converted to 8-bit gray scale images such that the minimum and maximum pixel values found in the difference image sequence were converted to values of 0 and 255, respectively. In some cases 10 sequential frames from the acquired time-lapse sequences were averaged into a single frame (n) and used to produce difference images. Fluorescence intensities of individual granules represent the mean pixel intensity from a 6 × 6 or 5 × 5 pixel region centered over a single granule. Whole-cell fluorescence intensity represents the mean pixel intensity from a rectangular region encompassing the cell. Cell Permeabilization and Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy cells were permeabilized at room temperature in internal solution containing 125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, 0.4 units/ml streptolysin-O, and 200 μm GTPγS, pH 7.2. After 0–12 min the cells were pelleted at 300 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. After a 15-min fixation in a solution containing 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4, cells were washed in distilled water, treated with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, washed with propylene oxide, and infiltrated with 50% propylene oxide/Epon. After another centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, the pellet transferred to Epon, and polymerized at 56 °C for 48 h. Thin sections (100 nm) were transferred to Formvar-coated grids, stained with 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate in ethanol (6 min), washed 4 times with distilled water, and stained further with lead acetate. Electron microscopy was performed after thorough washing with water and dehydration. Exocytosis of Single Granules—Imaging of individual eosinophil granules stained with lysotracker green was facilitated in cells that had flattened on the glass coverslip bottom of the recording chamber (Fig. 1A). The cell was stimulated by intracellular application of 30 μm GTPγS via a patch pipette in the whole-cell configuration. Exocytosis of single granules manifests itself as a rapid disappearance of the fluorescent dye from discrete ∼1.7-μm diameter fluorescent spots that is clearly evident from the difference images (Fig. 1B). The time course of fluorescent dye release from the two granules was obtained by plotting average fluorescence in the area covered by the respective granules (Fig. 1C). The membrane capacitance (C m) measurement shows two discrete capacitance steps of ∼50–60 fF (Fig. 1D, dashed lines) correlated in time (vertical solid lines) with the loss of fluorescent dye obtained by imaging. The capacitance increase of granule 1 occurs at 112.54 s (Fig. 1D). A faint fluorescence change is apparent in the subsequent frame, and fluorescence loss is complete within the next 2 frames (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, fusion pore opening of granule 2 indicated by the next capacitance step precedes release of the entrapped dye as observed previously (14Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) for exocytosis of giant granules from beige mouse mast cells. With a specific membrane capacitance of 9 fF/μm2 (15Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), a spherical granule with a capacitance of 60 fF was estimated to be ∼1.5 μm in diameter. We attributed the slightly larger size in the fluorescence image to the point spread function of the microscope and concluded that the loss of discrete fluorescent granule-size features represents exocytosis of single granules. Compound Exocytosis—In the same cell at a later time, fluorescence was lost sequentially from 6 granules (Fig. 2A), but this loss of fluorescence was associated with one single but very large capacitance step of 480 fF (Fig. 2B), corresponding to the addition of 53 μm2 of granule membrane to the plasma membrane. The capacitance step increase occurred over a period of less than 8 ms indicating a rapidly expanding fusion pore (data not shown). The 480 fF capacitance step occurred at 191.82 s of the recording time. The fluorescence loss from the first granule begins shortly after the capacitance step at 191.88 s (Fig. 2C). Subsequent loss of fluorescence from the other granules occurs over a period of 1 s (Fig. 2C) and is not associated with further capacitance changes (Fig. 2B). This result demonstrates that the 6 granules had already fused with one another preceding fusion of the compound granule with the plasma membrane. If 6 granules contributed to the 480-fF capacitance step, then an average granule membrane capacitance of 80 fF and granule diameter of ∼1.7 μm was obtained consistent with the size of individual granules in these cells. Although in compound exocytosis release occurred through a single fusion pore, the individual granules do not release their contents simultaneously but sequentially. The connectivity among granules and the plasma membrane during this compound granule fusion event may be inferred from the sequence of dye release from the compound granule (Fig. 2, C and D). By using the notation of Fig. 2, C and D, first granule 1 fuses with the plasma membrane and releases it contents, followed by granules 2 and 2′ that release their contents simultaneously. At the time when release from these granules started, the fluorescence decrease from granule 1 was slowed down, presumably reflecting release from granules 2 and 2′ through granule 1. Next granules 3 and 4 were released, associated with a slowing of the fluorescence decrease in granule 2, reflecting passage of the contents of granules 3 and 4 through granule 2. It should be noted that fluorescence loss from granule 2′ was very rapid because there was no passage of contents through granule 2′ from other granules. Finally, the content of granule 5 was released through the other granules, and the fluorescence decay of granule 1 goes to completion only when granule 5 had fully emptied. Proof that all 6 granules were already fused at the time of release of granule 1 is provided by the single large membrane capacitance step that precedes the first release event (Fig. 2B). The granules had thus fused inside the cell without an obvious change in their morphology. Stimulation of Granule-Granule Fusion Preceding Compound Exocytosis—Are multigranular compounds present in resting cells or are they formed following stimulation of degranulation? Light microscopy cannot easily answer this question because granule-granule fusion is not associated with obvious morphological changes. However, intracellular granule-granule fusion could be observed following GTPγS stimulation, taking advantage of variation in fluorescent staining among individual granules within the same cell following incubation with lysotracker green, similar to an observation made previously in mast cell granules stained with quinacrine (14Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Differential loading of granules with the weak amine lysotracker green may occur due to differences in internal pH among the granules. In the cell shown in Fig. 3A (left), three granules appeared rather dim compared with the other granules (arrows denoted 1–3 in Fig. 3A). Fusion of a dim granule with a brighter granule should result in an increase of its fluorescence as their contents equilibrate. Conversely, fusion of a brighter granule with a dimmer granule should result in a respective decrease of its fluorescence. By 16.2 s, the fluorescence is much more homogeneous (Fig. 3A, middle), and the difference image (Fig. 3A, right) shows adjacent dark and bright spots suggesting transfer of fluorescent granule contents. Granules 1–3 show a fluorescence increase, whereas granules 1′–4′ show a fluorescence decrease. It should be noted that the fluorescence otherwise remains rather constant. No membrane capacitance changes occurred during this time. The fluorescence decrease in granules 1′–4′ is thus not due to exocytosis of these granules. The fluorescence changes are not due to granule movement (compare left and middle panels of Fig. 3A), which would produce white and dark edges in the difference image. The fluorescence changes occurring in the individual granules were quantified by choosing 6 × 6 pixel regions centered over each granule providing the time course of mean pixel intensity. The fluorescence increase of granule 1 starts at 9.0 s (Fig. 3B (1 and 1′)). The fluorescence decrease in the adjacent granule 1′ has a similar time course suggesting that these signals reflect fusion between granule 1 and granule 1′. The onset of the fluorescence decrease of granule 2′ slightly precedes the fluorescence increase of granule 2, suggesting that they may not reflect fusion of these granules with each other but fusion with out-of-focus granules at slightly different times (Fig. 3B (2 and 2′)). Similarly, the fluorescence decrease of granule 3′ precedes the fluorescence increase of granule 3 (Fig. 3B (3 and 3′)). The fluorescence decrease of granule 4′ starts before all other changes and has a slow time course (Fig. 3B (4′)). Additional fusion events between granules with similar fluorescence levels or fusion of granules in out-of-focus image planes may have occurred but would not be detectable. Because none of the fluorescence changes are associated with capacitance steps, they therefore reflect intracellular granule-granule fusion events. In the same cell at a later time (25.44 s), a fusion pore formed with a conductance (G p) of 3.5 nS, between a very large multigranular compound with a capacitance (C g) of 2.4 pF and the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, C and D). The compound connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow fusion pore has a slower capacitive charging time constant than the plasma membrane. In response to square pulse voltage steps, a capacitive current transient with a slow charging time constant appears in parallel with the faster capacitive transient of the plasma membrane (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These components can thus be separated by fitting the current transients with the sum of two exponentials providing the capacitance of the plasma membrane (C c), the compound granule capacitance (C g), and the fusion pore conductance (G p), in addition to cell membrane conductance (G m) and access resistance (R a) as illustrated in Fig. 3C. The exocytosed compound thus forms a degranulation sac with C g = 2.4 pF. This step size corresponds to a compound consisting of about 35 granules. C g then increases to a final value of 3.5 pF, presumably reflecting fusion of another ∼15 granules with the degranulation sac after the fusion pore has formed. At 32.4 s, G p increases to a very large value. The charging time constant of the degranulation sac becomes very fast, and the capacitance of the degranulation sac and the capacitance of the plasma membrane cannot be distinguished anymore. At this time the C g becomes part of the plasma membrane (C c) which accordingly increases by ∼3.5 pF (Fig. 3D). As observed previously (14Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) for the giant granules of beige mouse mast cells, release of fluorescent dye (Fig. 3D, fluorescence trace) is hardly detectable until the fusion pore conductance becomes very large at 32.4 s (Fig. 3D, G p trace). However, slow release of secretory products does occur through fusion pores with small conductance (15Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 16Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernández-Chacón R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Before the fusion pore formed, the whole-cell fluorescence (Fig. 3D) decreased slowly and linearly (straight solid line), presumably due to photo-bleaching of lysotracker green. After fusion pore formation, although the fusion pore is small (between vertical lines), the linear regression yields a significant increase in slope (dashed line) of the fluorescence decrease indicative of slow release through the narrow fusion pore. It should be noted that very little morphological changes occur before the fusion pore conductance increases to a large value. The increase of fusion pore conductance is followed by a rapid loss of fluorescent dye. The large fusion pore conductance could reflect either a single large pore or the formation of a large number of smaller pores. If one single large pore is formed, then release should occur at one focal site. Indeed, as shown in difference images presented in Fig. 3E, loss of the dye is first detectable at a focal spot at the plasma membrane. Originating from this point the fluorescence decrease expands indicating focal release through a single pore. A few seconds later, the cell is nearly devoid of visible granules and fluorescent dye (Fig. 3E, frame 5) with the exception of a few small bright spots, indicating secretion of the contents from the entire intracellular pool of ∼50 granules through a single fusion pore. These results demonstrate directly that compound exocytosis in eosinophils is preceded by intracellular granule-granule fusion and that a narrow fusion pore forms between the compound granule and the plasma membrane which allows for focal release upon fusion pore dilation. Electron Microscopy of Compound Exocytosis—Compound exocytosis becomes more prevalent when GTPγS is introduced into the cell at 100–200 μm concentration (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To capture compound formation by electron microscopy before exocytosis occurs, cells were permeabilized with streptolysin-O and stimulated with 200 μm GTPγS. At this concentration all granules may fuse inside the cell leading to compound exocytosis with a single capacitance step of ∼3 pF (17Lindau M. Hartmann J. Scepek S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows serial sections from a cell that was fixed several minutes after addition of streptolysin-O and GTPγS. When the different planes are considered, it becomes apparent that all granules are interconnected. However, no exocytosis has occurred yet since all granules have retained their dense core. Cells that were fixed immediately after stimulation did not show such features. In the permeabilized cells granule shape was somewhat distorted, but cytosolic space is clearly visible between adjacent granules (Fig. 5A). At later stages, when exocytosis has occurred, the granular contents within the degranulation vacuole appear less dense (Fig. 5B) whereas at least one unfused granule (arrow) has retained its dense core.Fig. 5A, a cell fixed shortly after stimulation shows no granulegranule fusion. B, a later stage of degranulation. The cell contains a large degranulation sac connected to the outside via an expanded fusion pore (asterisk). One granule shows no sign of exocytosis (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cumulative Fusion and Formation of a Degranulation Sac—An alternative mode of exocytosis called sequential or cumulative exocytosis has been proposed to produce a degranulation sac and focal release during eosinophil degranulation (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Morgan E. Galli A.S. Hammond M.E. Dvorak H.F. Lab. Investig. 1981; 44: 174-191PubMed Google Scholar). In this mode granules fuse sequentially to a granule already connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow fusion pore. Fluorescence microscopy of cells stimulated with low (5 μm) GTPγS concentration directly visualizes this mode of exocytosis (Fig. 6). The capacitance measurement (Fig. 6A) reveals an increase in a number of steps, many of which have the size expected for individual granules and compounds that consist of a few granules. As in the analysis presented in Fig. 3, C c + C g was determined from double exponential fits. When C g and C c are plotted separately (Fig. 6A C g , C c), most of the capacitance increase occurs in C g, suggesting formation of a growing degranulation sac. During the stepwise increase of C g, the fusion pore of the degranulation sac shows an uncorrelated fluctuating increase in fusion pore conductance (G p). Fig. 6B shows the associated cellular morphological changes. Initially, a few exocytotic events occur near the left edge of the cell, accompanied by the first capacitance steps. Then an exocytotic event at the right edge is followed by cumulative fusion such that a degranulation sac of increasing size is formed. The morphological disappearance of individual granules indicates contact with extracellular space via a fusion pore. Further granules fuse and blend into the growing degranulation sac. The morphological appearance of the degranulation sac is correlated with the appearance of a growing capacitance C g, connected to the extracellular space via a fusion pore with rather low conductance. Accordingly, the fluorescence from individual granules equilibrates, but the overall loss of fluorescence is very slow due to the limiting size of the fusion pore. The initial development of a degranulation sac is revealed in detail by correlating capacitance changes with the loss of fluorescence intensity from individual granules. Fig. 6C shows the change of fluorescence intensity of the granules labeled 1–6 in Fig. 6D. The change in fluorescence for each granule is correlated with distinct steps in the membrane capacitance traces as indicated by the vertical arrows in Fig. 6, A and C. By using the notation of Fig. 6, C and D, granule 1 first fuses with the plasma membrane. The rapid fluorescence decrease from this peripheral granule immediately follows a capacitance step appearing in the C g trace. The next capacitance step is associated with a fluorescence loss in granule 2 and a fluorescence increase in granule 1 demonstrating directly that this capacitance step reflects fusion of granule 2 with granule 1 and not fusion of granule 2 with the plasma membrane. Accordingly, this fusion event appears clearly in C g, reflecting a cumulative increase in the area of the degranulation sac. Subsequently, granules 3 and 4 also fuse in a sequential manner with granule 2 as illustrated in Fig. 6D and contribute capacitance steps that increase the capacitance of the growing degranulation sac. The relatively dim granule 5 then undergoes a sudden increase in fluorescence associated with the next capacitance step indicating that it also fuses with the degranulation sac. The onset in the fluorescence decrease of granule 6 slightly precedes this fusion event suggesting that it likely fuses with granule 5 before fusion of granule 5 with the degranulation sac. The cumulative fusion of these granules is also evident morphologically on the right-hand side of the cell in the associated fluorescence images acquired between 7.9 and 15.7 s. Examination of the remaining recording shows that the capacitance of the degranulation sac, C g, continues to grow in size by ∼0.91 pF with the cumulative addition of ∼14 granules (average granule capacitance = 65 fF). No further changes in the capacitance measurement occur after 20 s (data not shown). Indeed, another 14 granules clearly visible in the 15.7 s image lose their structural integrity, blending onto the degranulation sac (Fig. 6B). These changes are very slow and extend beyond the last exocytotic event that occurred at about 18 s (compare image 20.2 and 32.6 s Fig. 6B). During this second phase of capacitance increase to C g (between 14 and 20 s), an unambiguous assignment of fluorescence changes in individual granules with certain capacitance steps is troublesome due to the slow rate of release of dye from fused granules within the degranulation sac. The cumulative fusion events produced a degranulation sac with a large volume, while the fusion pore conductance was still only ∼10 nS (Fig. 6A, G p). The fluorescence between all granules in the sac thus equilibrated, and further lysotracker dye loss was very slow as seen in the traces of Fig. 6C and in the images of Fig. 6B. The main physiological function of eosinophils is thought to be in defense against parasitic infection. These cells can kill various parasites, in particular at the larval stage (18Meeusen E.N. Balic A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 95-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The release of cytotoxic proteins from eosinophil granules onto the parasite surface plays an important role in parasite killing. On the other hand, eosinophil degranulation can also lead to tissue damage in some types of allergic asthma (19Walsh G.M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 453-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the physiological function of eosinophils it is thus essential that release of granule contents is focused onto the target and that diffusion of cytotoxic proteins to host tissue cells is prevented. By using combined patch clamp capacitance measurements and fluorescence imaging, we demonstrate directly that focal release from eosinophils occurs by two mechanisms. In compound exocytosis, intracellular granule-granule fusion can lead to formation of a large multigranular compound that releases its contents through a single fusion pore. Compound exocytosis has been demonstrated for lamellar body exocytosis in alveolar type II cells by using a similar approach combining capacitance measurements and FM1-43 fluorescence imaging (20Mair N. Haller T. Dietl P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L376-L382PubMed Google Scholar). Growing fluorescent spots indicating cumulative fusion were also observed in stimulated pituitary lactotrophs (21Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In eosinophils intracellular granule-granule fusion is not associated with morphological changes visible in the light microscope but is clearly evident from fluorescent content transfer and in electron microscopy. Changes in granule morphology require solubilization of granule cores. Dissolution of acidic chromaffin granule contents occurs under alkaline conditions (22Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eosinophil granules are also acidic organelles (23Kurashima K. Numata M. Yachie A. Sai Y. Ishizaka N. Fujimura M. Matsuda T. Ohkuma S. Lab. Investig. 1996; 75: 689-698PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore it is a possibility that the consecutive solubilization of granule contents during compound exocytosis occurs due to consecutive granule core alkalization. In pituitary lactotrophs, dissolution of granule cores was markedly enhanced by treatments that reduced cytosolic cAMP concentration suggesting a mechanism regulating the susceptibility of granules to undergo solubilization following exocytosis and exposure to neutral pH (24Angleson J.K. Cochilla A.J. Kilic G. Nussinovitch I. Betz W.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previous electrophysiological studies suggested that in eosinophils focal release is also achieved by formation of a degranulation sac from cumulative granule fusion events (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In cumulative fusion a granule performs exocytotic fusion with the plasma membrane followed by daisy chain fusion of additional granules. Fluorescence imaging (Fig. 6) directly visualizes the formation of a growing degranulation sac, and the multiple capacitance steps associated with this process show that these previously are sequential fusion events. Such cumulative fusion sequences have been reported for exocytosis of zymogen granules, studied in intact pancreatic acini by multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (25Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Zymogen granules fused with the plasma membrane, maintained their Ω shape and served as targets for sequential fusion of granules located within deeper layers of the cell, such that transport of granules to the plasma membrane was not required (25Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In eosinophils a cumulative fusion mechanism ensures focal release. It was shown in mast cells that local stimulation induces local degranulation (26Lawson D. Fewtrell C. Raff M. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of eosinophils upon contact with a parasite may initiate exocytosis at the site of contact that would then be followed by cumulative fusion leading to focal release. In the experiments described here, cells were stimulated by intracellular application of GTPγS. Even with this delocalized stimulus focal release occurs. This mechanism requires that the rate at which cytoplasmic granules fuse with the membrane of previously exocytosed granules is much higher than the rate at which they fuse with the plasma membrane. The fusion of eosinophil granules with the plasma membrane is thus a rare event, which ensures that focal release preferentially occurs through a single fusion pore. The molecular mechanisms controlling granule-granule fusion, compound, and cumulative exocytosis in eosinophils are not known. In lactotrophs, the incidence of compound exocytosis was found to increase upon incubation with phorbol ester (21Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) pointing toward a controlling role of protein kinase C. It has been suggested that cumulative exocytosis of granules to previously fused granules (in pancreatic acinar cells) is mediated by the transfer of a plasma membrane protein, possibly a SNARE protein to the granule membrane because there was no evidence for intracellular granule-granule fusion (25Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, as shown here, in eosinophils granule-granule fusion does occur indicating that the required SNARE proteins must be present on the granule membrane. In mast cells, compound exocytosis is dependent on the translocation of SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein) from the plasma membrane to granule membrane (27Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whereas in Drosophila, SNAP-24, which is resident on glue protein-containing granules in salivary gland cells, has also been implicated in regulating compound exocytosis (28Niemeyer B.A. Schwarz T.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4055-4064PubMed Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are expressed in eosinophils (29Hoffmann H.J. Bjerke T. Karawajczyk M. Dahl R. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Lacy P. Logan M.R. Bablitz B. Moqbel R. J. Allergy Clin.

Immunol. 2002; 109: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but their roles in compound and cumulative exocytosis remain unexplored. In eosinophils, high GTPγS concentration increases the incidence of compound exocytosis (5Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) implicating a GTP-binding protein in the control of granule-granule fusion. The differential regulation of granule-granule fusion, cumulative fusion, and granule-plasma membrane fusion by calcium and GTP-binding proteins is investigated in the accompanying paper (32Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44928-44933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

These proteins catalyze the repetitive condensation of acetate or propionate units, similar to fatty acid biosynthesis, to produce these diverse and complex molecules (7Khosla C. Gokhale R.S. Jacobsen J.R. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Staunton J. Weissman K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar).Modular polyketide biosynthetic pathways are usually made up of several large polyketide synthase proteins, each containing up to 20 catalytically active domains. All the domains required for the addition and tailoring of a single acetate or propionate unit onto the growing polyketide chain are grouped together to form a module (Fig. 1). Each module must receive the incoming acyl chain from the previous module (onto its ketosynthase domain) and load the correct extender unit (onto the acyl carrier protein domain via the acyltransferase domain). The extender unit is then added onto the growing acyl chain in a ketosynthase-catalyzed reaction, and the product is reductively tailored by optional ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoylreductase domains. Finally the module must transfer the acyl chain to the next module for further processing (7Khosla C. Gokhale R.S. Jacobsen J.R. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Staunton J. Weissman K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar).The modular arrangement of these biosynthetic pathways facilitates evolutionary change (9Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), accounting for the large degree of structural and functional variation found in the small molecule polyketide products. Recombination of the order, type, and number of modules in a given biosynthetic pathway presumably maintains the core function of each module while allowing for change in the structure and function of the final products. The adaptive but robust nature of modular PKS suggests that they can be harnessed to generate rationally designed complex polyketides through bioengineering (10Ranganathan A. Timoney M. Bycroft M.

These inter-modular linkers facilitate chain transfer between adjacent covalently or non-covalently associated modules. The specificity of the ketosynthase (KS) domains for the stereochemistry of the incoming acyl chain (15Wu N. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem.

To test the generality of these observations, we have evaluated the ability of modules from three different PKS pathways to tolerate more complex substrates. We selected a panel of modules from the erythromycin (1Cortes J. Haydock S.F. Roberts G.A. Bevitt D.J. Leadlay P.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 2Donadio S.

For a subset of these modules, we also investigated the relative importance of chain transfer versus chain elongation in the processing of a specific radiolabeled substrate.Fig. 2Native polyketide synthase pathways used to generate hybrid systems in this study. In this study selected modules (*) were examined from three different pathways, erythromycin (A), picromycin (B), and rifamycin (C).

(2S,3R)-[1-14C]2-Methyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid N-acetylcysteamine thioester (14C-labeled product 4, 55.0 mCi/mmol) was obtained by custom synthesis from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. DNA manipulations were performed in Escherichia coli XL1 Blue (Stratagene) using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. PCRs were carried out using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer.Engineering of Module Cassettes and Module Nomenclature—By using module boundaries as defined earlier (13Gokhale R.S. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1999; 284: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), modular (typically BsaBI-SpeI) cassettes were engineered for a selected set of modules including modules 2, 3, 5, and 6 of DEBS (hereafter referred to as eryM2, eryM3, eryM5, and eryM6, respectively), modules 2, 3, and 6 of the picromycin synthase (hereafter referred to as picM3 and picM6, respectively), and modules 2, 5, 7, and 8 of the rifamycin synthetase (hereafter referred to as rifM2, rifM5, rifM7, and rifM8, respectively). The 5′ end of each cassette could be fused in a modular fashion to either the short N-terminal linker segment preceding eryM3 (M3N) or eryM5 (M5N), or an additional module followed by an intra-polypeptide linker (15Wu N. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 3′ end of each cassette could be fused to either the C-terminal linker segment found after eryM2 (M2C) or eryM4 (M4C) (15Wu N. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or to a thioesterase (TE) domain (eryTE or picTE) capable of catalyzing chain release.Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids pST133 (16Wu N. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5056-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (eryM5+eryTE), pKW124 (eryM6+eryTE), pKW122 (rifM2+ eryTE), pKW123 (rifM7+eryTE), and pKW110 (rifM8+eryTE) were constructed by replacing the BsaBI-SpeI fragments containing eryM3 in pRSG34 (eryM3+eryTE) (13Gokhale R.S. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1999; 284: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with DNA cassettes encoding the corresponding modules. All these polypeptides retain the N-terminal linker region of eryM3. Expression plasmids pKW127 (picM3+picTE) were constructed by replacing the BsaBI-EcoRI fragments containing eryM3+eryTE in pRSG34 with the corresponding modules fused to the picTE domain. Again (23Lu H. Tsai S.C. Khosla C. Cane D.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12590-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Tsai S.C. Lu H. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12598-15606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), both polypeptides retained the N-terminal linker region of eryM3. Expression plasmid pKW198 (picM6+picTE) was constructed by replacing the BsaBI-HindIII fragment containing eryM3+eryTE in pRSG34 with the fragment containing picM6+picTE. This polypeptide also retains the N-terminal linker region of eryM3. The bimodular expression plasmids pKW148 (eryM1+rifM5) and pKW142 (eryM1+picM2) were constructed by inserting the heterologous BsaBI-SpeI fragments in place of eryM2 in the eryA1 gene. All these polypeptide retain the C-terminal linker region of eryM2. Finally, the expression plasmids pKW170 (eryM5+eryTE), pKW171 (eryM3+eryTE), pKW169 (eryM6+eryTE), and pKW194 (rifM5+eryTE) were constructed by replacing the NsiI-PacI fragment containing eryM5+eryM6 in pBP130 (23Lu H. Tsai S.C. Khosla C. Cane D.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12590-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the corresponding modules. All these polypeptides retain the N-terminal linker region of eryM5.In Vivo Production of Polyketides—E. coli BAP1 (25Pfeifer B.A. Admiraal S.J. Gramajo H. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 2001; 291: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) was used as host for polyketide production. [1-14C]Propionic acid feeding was performed as follows. Individual transformants were inoculated into 10 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) media in the presence of carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.6–0.8), cooled on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the remaining supernatant and induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and [1-14C]propionic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.27 mm. The culture was stirred for an additional 20 h at 22 °C. At this point the culture was centrifuged, and 100 μl of the supernatant was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (300 μl each time). The extract was dried in vacuo and subjected to TLC analysis.Unlabeled or [1-13C]propionic acid feeding experiments were performed as follows. A single transformant was used to start a 5-ml LB culture with carbenicillin (100 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 250 rpm. The starter culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB media at the same antibiotic concentrations as above. These culture were grown at 250 rpm and 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.6–0.8), cooled to 4 °C for 10 min, and induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Unlabeled or [1-13C]propionic acid was added to a final concentration of 250 mg/liter, and the cultures were incubated at 22 °C for 20 h. The sample was then centrifuged and the supernatant extracted twice with 600 ml of ethyl acetate. The sample was dried in vacuo, resuspended in CDCl3, analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography (Beckman System Gold, C18 reverse-phase column, 4.6 mm × 25 cm; Beckman Coulter, CH3CN/H2O gradient), and analyzed by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization- or electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (Thermo-Finnigan LCQ).In Vitro Production of Individual Modules—Individual modules fused with a TE domain were expressed and purified as described previously (15Wu N. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis was performed in a solution of 400 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 5 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1.5% Me2SO, pH 7.2, in the presence of 1 μm protein, 20 mm diketide (product 4), 800 μm [2-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA (or [2-14C]malonyl-CoA), and 4 mm NADPH. After 1 h, the reactions were quenched by the addition of ethyl acetate and vortexing. Extraction twice with ethyl acetate removed the triketide lactone product from the aqueous layer. Triketide product was detected using radio-TLC and compared with authentic reference sample. In vitro reactions were also carried out as described above except without NADPH, and the β-keto products were compared with authentic β-keto triketide reference samples.Detection and Characterization of Polyketide Products—Polyketides were considered to be produced if 14C-labeling experiments produced a detectable spot at the correct Rf on a radio-TLC assay. The lower limit of sensitivity for this assay is 0.1 pmol of product for the in vitro experiments. In the in vivo experiments, polyketides were considered detectable if quantification of the correct spot showed it to be >1% of the intensity of the product from DEBS1 and eryM3+TE (Fig. 3B, product 6). The polyketide products 5, 6, 8, and 11 were characterized by LC/MS and matched with authentic samples from previous studies (17Wu N. Kudo F. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4847-4852Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Kao C.M. Luo G. Katz L. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9184-9185Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Kao C.M. Luo G. Katz L. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9105-9106Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both 13C-labeled and unlabeled polyketide products 9 and 12 were characterized by LC/MS. Administration of sodium [1-13C]propionate gave product 9 labeled at C-1, C-3, C-5, and C-7 consistent with incorporation of four intact propionate units and gave product 12 labeled at C-3 and C-7 consistent with incorporation of two intact propionate units and decarboxylated product.Fig. 3Three systems test the substrate selectivity of various KS domain for a di-, tri-, and pentaketide. Various modules (module X) were assayed with three different substrates ( 4, 7 , and 10). All of the substrates were intermediates in the biosynthesis of erythromycin (see Fig. 2A). Six products are expected in A, five in B, and only one in C based on the native activity of the modules (see Fig. 2). Only the experimentally observed products are shown. PKS proteins DEBS1 and DEBS2 were used to generate substrates 7 and 10 in situ and in vivo (B and C). Assays were performed using 14C-labeled extender units, and product formation was monitored by radio-TLC analysis. Products 5, 6, 8 , and 11 were characterized by comparison to authentic standards. Compound 9 was characterized by LC/MS analysis since an authentic standard was not available. For modules tested and results see Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Labeling Experiments—Protein labeling experiments were performed by preincubating individual proteins (20 μg) for 5 min at room temperature with or without 5 mm cerulenin. Thereafter 14C-labeled product 4 was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5 μl), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–15% Bio-Rad). The gel was stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the labeling pattern was visualized by exposure to a PhosphorImager (Packard Instrument Co.) for 24 h.RESULTSIn Vitro Production of Triketide Lactone—We tested the ability of various KS domains to accept and process a simple diketide substrate in vitro ( 4 , Fig. 3A). Modules were fused to a thioesterase domain and a hexa-His tag and expressed in E. coli under the control of the T7 promoter. Purification by affinity chromatography afforded the individual proteins high purity. The individual proteins were then incubated in vitro with the N-acetylcysteamine thioester of the diketide (product 4), 14C-labeled methylmalonyl-CoA (or malonyl-CoA), and NADPH and assayed for the production of radiolabeled chain elongation products. Because of the availability of authentic standards of the expected triketide products, we were able to determine with certainty in a radio-TLC based assay whether the expected compounds were produced. The high sensitivity of the radio-TLC assay also allowed us to probe for very low levels of product formation (0.1 pmol, which corresponds to a product concentration of 5 nm under typical assay conditions). We found that four modules from DEBS (eryM2, eryM3, eryM5, and eryM6), one module from the rifamycin synthetase (rifM5), and one module from the picromycin synthase (picM6) could elongate 4 as evidenced by a detectable spot at the appropriate retention time on the radio-TLC image. Our assays also showed that eryM4, rifM2, rifM7, rifM8, and picM3 could not elongate 4 since there was no detectable spot on the radio-TLC image at the appropriate retention time for the β-keto or β-hydroxy triketide lactone products.Dissecting Barriers to Chain Elongation by Individual Modules—We investigated the ability of selected individual modules from the above experiment to accept substrate (product 4) and a methylmalonyl extender unit. To determine whether the substrate was accepted by the protein, 1-14C-labeled product 4 was incubated in separate experiments with eryM5 and eryM6 (which catalyze elongation of 4), and rifM7 and picM3 (which do not catalyze elongation of 4). To verify that the substrate was acylating the correct active site of these multifunctional proteins, the KS domain, incubations were performed in the presence and absence of cerulenin, a selective KS inhibitor (28Price A.C. Choi K.-H. Heath R.J. Li Z. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6551-6559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE autoradiography (Fig. 4, A and B) revealed that the purified modules were acylated and that cerulenin inhibited acylation. Similar observations were also made with other modules that do not catalyze elongation of 4 (data not shown). Separate incubation of the above purified proteins with either [14C]methylmalonyl-CoA or [14C]malonyl-CoA (29Hans M. Hornung A. Dziarnowski A. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 5366-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that the proteins were selectively acylated by methylmalonyl-CoA, the predicted extender unit (data not shown).Fig. 4Assay of functional acylation of the KS domain of purified recombinant modules.

Because the synthetic triketide N-acetylcysteamine thioester spontaneously cyclizes, we constructed a system that generated the triketide intermediate in situ. By using the expression construct for the protein DEBS1, we were able to generate the desired triketide as an acyl-enzyme intermediate (product 7). We then created a set of plasmids with a complementary resistance marker to the above construct. This set of nine plasmids contained individual modules fused to a TE domain (Fig. 3B). To facilitate the transfer of the acyl intermediate between the two proteins, the native C terminus of DEBS1 and the N terminus of DEBS2 were incorporated into our two-plasmid system. By co-expressing the DEBS1 expression plasmid with plasmid containing either eryM3 or picM6, we observed by radio-TLC and LC/MS the expected tetraketide product 8 which matched authentic sample from previous studies (26Kao C.M. Luo G. Katz L. Cane D.E. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9184-9185Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the reaction of DEBS1 with eryM6 and rifM5, the expected tetraketide product 9 was isolated and characterized by radio-TLC and LC-MS. When [1-13C]propionate was fed to these systems, the mass of the product increased as expected by four m/z units, confirming the tetraketide character of the compound. When eryM5, rifM2, rifM7, rifM8, and picM3 were assayed, by co-expression with DEBS1 and [14C]propionate feeding, the expected products could not be detected by radio-TLC analysis (<1% as active as ery3).In Vivo Tolerance of Modules for Pentaketide Substrates—We further extended our in vivo system by testing individual modules toward pentaketide substrates ( 10 , Fig. 3C). Since pentaketide substrates present a significant challenge to synthesize chemically, we developed an in situ method for their production. We used a construct that expresses the first two proteins from erythromycin biosynthesis, DEBS1 and DEBS2. This system produced the pentaketide as acyl-enzyme intermediate (product 10). We then constructed a small library of plasmids containing our modules of interest fused to a TE domain. To facilitate the transfer of the pentaketide intermediate between proteins, we added the N-terminal linker sequence from DEBS3 to the N terminus of our plasmid library (Fig. 3). We selected the modules eryM5, eryM6, and rifM5 to study with this system because we had authentic references of the product. Moreover, the above studies showed that eryM6 and rifM5 were relatively tolerant toward unnatural substrates, whereas eryM5 was the natural recipient of the pentaketide product of DEBS1 and DEBS2. When each individual member of our library was co-expressed with DEBS1 and DEBS2, we were able to detect the formation of compound 11 by comparison to an authentic reference on radio-TLC. We were also able to confirm product formation by mass spectrometry.In Vivo Tolerance of Modules eryM3 and picM3 for Alternative Triketides—We tested the ability of two different KS domains from eryM3 and picM3 to accept and process two different triketide substrates 7 or 12 (Fig. 3B and Fig. 5). This experiment was based on the two-plasmid system described under “In Vivo Tolerance of Modules for Triketide Substrates.” From the above work we had three of the four needed expression vectors. The remaining plasmid was generated from DEBS1 by replacing eryM2 with picM2. Expression of the vector containing eryM2 produced compound 7 as an acyl enzyme intermediate, and expression of the vector containing picM2 generated 12 as an acyl enzyme intermediate. When eryM3 was co-expressed with the acyl-enzyme intermediate 7 we were able to detect the formation of the expected product by both radio-TLC and LC/MS analysis (Table I, entry 2B). However, when eryM3 was co-expressed with intermediate 12, none of the expected product could be detected (Fig. 5). We were also able to detect the expected product when picM3"
https://openalex.org/W2068625498,"The molecular organization of bacterial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I or NDH-1) is not established, apart from a rough separation into dehydrogenase, connecting and membrane domains. In this work, complex I was purified from Escherichia coli and fragmented by replacing dodecylmaltoside with other detergents. Exchange into decyl maltoside led to the removal of the hydrophobic subunit NuoL from the otherwise intact complex. Diheptanoyl phosphocholine led to the loss of NuoL and NuoM subunits, whereas other subunits remained in the complex. The presence of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide or Triton X-100 led to further disruption of the membrane domain into fragments containing NuoL/M/N, NuoA/K/N, and NuoH/J subunits. Among the hydrophilic subunits, NuoCD was most readily dissociated from the complex, whereas NuoB was partially dissociated from the peripheral arm assembly in N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide. A model of subunit arrangement in bacterial complex I based on these data is proposed. Subunits NuoL and NuoM, which are homologous to antiporters and are implicated in proton pumping, are located at the distal end of the membrane arm, spatially separated from the redox centers of the peripheral arm. This is consistent with proposals that the mechanism of proton pumping by complex I is likely to involve long range conformational changes. The molecular organization of bacterial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I or NDH-1) is not established, apart from a rough separation into dehydrogenase, connecting and membrane domains. In this work, complex I was purified from Escherichia coli and fragmented by replacing dodecylmaltoside with other detergents. Exchange into decyl maltoside led to the removal of the hydrophobic subunit NuoL from the otherwise intact complex. Diheptanoyl phosphocholine led to the loss of NuoL and NuoM subunits, whereas other subunits remained in the complex. The presence of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide or Triton X-100 led to further disruption of the membrane domain into fragments containing NuoL/M/N, NuoA/K/N, and NuoH/J subunits. Among the hydrophilic subunits, NuoCD was most readily dissociated from the complex, whereas NuoB was partially dissociated from the peripheral arm assembly in N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide. A model of subunit arrangement in bacterial complex I based on these data is proposed. Subunits NuoL and NuoM, which are homologous to antiporters and are implicated in proton pumping, are located at the distal end of the membrane arm, spatially separated from the redox centers of the peripheral arm. This is consistent with proposals that the mechanism of proton pumping by complex I is likely to involve long range conformational changes. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I, EC 1.6.5.3) is the first enzyme of the respiratory chains of most mitochondria and many bacteria. It catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to quinone, coupled to the translocation of about 4 protons across the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 3Videira A. Biochim. Biophys.

Complex I is one of the largest known membrane protein complexes. The bovine enzyme has a mass of ∼980 kDa and is composed of about 46 subunits, including the seven hydrophobic ND subunits encoded in the mitochondrial genome (5Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The simplest version of the complex in terms of protein content is the prokaryotic enzyme that has 13–14 subunits and a combined molecular mass of about 550 kDa (6Yagi T. Yano T. DiBernardo S. Matsuno Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). All of the subunits of bacterial complex I (also referred to as NDH-1) have analogues in the mitochondrial enzyme (4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because of its relatively simple subunit composition, NDH-1 represents a useful “minimal” model to study the structure and function of complex I. It is currently the least understood component of the respiratory chain. In contrast to other enzymes of the respiratory chain, the atomic structure of complex I is not known and the mechanisms of proton pumping and electron transfer are not established.Electron microscopy has shown that both the mitochondrial and the bacterial enzyme have a characteristic L-shaped structure. One arm is embedded in the membrane and the other, the peripheral arm, protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm. This was demonstrated at about 20 to 30 Å resolution for the enzyme from fungus Neurospora crassa (7Leonard K. Haiker H. Weiss H. J. Mol.

An alternative “horseshoe”-like conformation of active complex I from E. coli has been proposed recently (14Bõttcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17970-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but this observation was not confirmed in our laboratory (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The membrane and peripheral arms contain mainly hydrophobic and hydrophilic subunits, respectively. Because a more precise allocation of subunits is not possible at the current resolution, biochemical studies have been considered to refine the structural model. The disruption of complex I into smaller subcomplexes and the cross-linking of subunits are potentially ways that can provide such information.Dissociation of complex I by chaotropes and detergents indicates that all the redox centers of the enzyme (FMN and up to 8–9 iron-sulfur clusters) are located in the peripheral arm (2Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 16Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Finel M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The peripheral arm of the bovine enzyme has been resolved into smaller fragments still, namely a flavoprotein fraction and an iron-sulfur protein fraction. The main components of the flavoprotein fraction were the 51-kDa (NuoF in E. coli) and 24-kDa (NuoE) subunits, whereas the iron-sulfur protein fraction comprised mainly the 75-(NuoG), 49-, and 30-kDa (NuoCD, fused in E. coli) and PSST (NuoB) subunits (19Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With the E. coli enzyme, resolution of the peripheral arm into a dehydrogenase fragment containing NuoE, NuoF, and NuoG subunits, and a connecting fragment, containing NuoCD, NuoB, and NuoI (bovine TYKY) subunits, has been described (20Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).The membrane spanning part of the enzyme, which seemingly lacks prosthetic groups, has been studied far less than the peripheral part. However, it is clear that essential components of the proton translocating machinery must reside in the transmembraneous subunits. Sequence comparisons have suggested that subunits ND2 (NuoN in E. coli), ND4 (NuoM), and ND5 (NuoL) evolved from a common ancestor related to K+ or Na+/H+ antiporters and thus are likely to be involved in the proton translocation (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 105-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 22Kikuno R. Miyata T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of E. coli subunit NuoL is 66 kDa, NuoM is 57 kDa, and NuoN is 52 kDa (23Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These are the largest hydrophobic subunits of complex I, adding up to about 2/3 of the molecular mass of the membrane arm of the bacterial enzyme. They are likely to have between 12 and 16 transmembrane helices each (24Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Clearly, the position of these large subunits within the membrane arm has important implications for our understanding of the organization of the complex.To date, evidence available regarding the location of antiporter-like subunits in complex I has been contradictory, with some reports placing these subunits in proximity to the peripheral arm and some suggesting a distal location. We have demonstrated by disruption of the bovine enzyme that subunits ND4 and ND5 are likely situated in a different part of the membrane arm to subunits ND1 (NuoH in E. coli), ND2, ND3 (NuoA), and ND4L (NuoK) (18Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our electron crystallography studies, which located subunit ND5 to the distal end of the membrane arm (25Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analyses of ND subunits mutants in human and mouse cell lines (26Bai Y.D. Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Hofhaus G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 964-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (28Cardol P. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) are consistent with this proposal.In contrast, comparison of sequences of complex I with membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases have suggested that subunits NuoL and NuoH, along with subunits of the connecting fragment, form part of a core “hydrogenase” module, whereas NuoM and NuoN are a part of a “transporter” module spatially separated from the peripheral arm (29Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Albracht S.P. Hedderich R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several transmembraneous subunits have been implicated in quinone binding, with initial studies concentrating on ND1 (NuoH) (31Earley F.G. Patel S.D. Ragan I. Attardi G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). More recently, on the basis of specific labeling, it was suggested that ND5 (32Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and/or NuoM (33Gong X. Xie T. Yu L. Hesterberg M. Scheide D. Friedrich T. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25731-25737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are likely to form a part of the inhibitor/Q-binding pocket located probably at the junction of the peripheral and membrane arms.Two main models for the mechanism of proton pumping by complex I are being discussed in the literature: direct (redox-driven) and indirect (conformation-driven) (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The first model, employing modifications of the Q cycle, assumes that the electron carriers are located in the membrane and are directly involved in proton translocation (34Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Sled V.D. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this case quinone binding sites and proton translocation machinery would be located close to the peripheral arm with its redox centers to allow direct interaction. This would be consistent with a location of subunits NuoL/M/N proximal to the peripheral arm and associated with the Q-binding pocket (29Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 32Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Gong X. Xie T. Yu L. Hesterberg M. Scheide D. Friedrich T. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25731-25737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the second model, the catalytic module with electron carriers is an entity distinct from the proton pumping module and energy transduction takes place through long range conformational changes (4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Brandt U. Kerscher S. Drõse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this second case, the two modules can be spatially separated, which would be consistent with a location for NuoL/M/N distal from the peripheral arm. A combination of the two mechanisms to explain a high H+/e – ratio in complex I has also been discussed (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been suggested recently that complex I from a bacterium closely related to E. coli, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, might pump two sodium ions instead of four protons per two electrons (38Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). If this observation is confirmed, it would support an indirect mechanism for complex I, as the Q cycle with Na+ is not possible.Here, by disruption of complex I from E. coli into subcomplexes, we show that antiporter-like subunits NuoL and NuoM are located in a distal part of the membrane arm of the enzyme, spatially separated from the redox centers of the peripheral arm. This provides experimental evidence in support of an indirect, conformation-driven, coupling between the redox reactions and proton translocation as at least a part of the complex I proton pumping machinery. Analysis of the observed subcomplexes allows us to propose the most detailed model to date of subunit arrangement in bacterial complex I.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Dodecyl-, undecyl-, and decylmaltoside were purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), E. coli total lipids and diheptanoyl phosphocholine from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), other detergents were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Complete™ protease inhibitors tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science, Bio-scale DEAE column was from Bio-Rad, and other chromatography columns were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Purification of Complex I, Detergent Exchange, and Resolution into Subcomplexes—The enzyme was purified from E. coli BL21 cells grown under limited oxygen as described previously (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Purified complex I was stored in small aliquots under liquid nitrogen and used for detergent exchange experiments as required.The procedure for detergent exchange was as follows: a sample in dodecylmaltoside was diluted 10–20-fold in buffer A, containing 20 mm MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DDM, dodecylmaltoside, DM, decylmaltoside; DHPC, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DQ, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone; FeCy, ferricyanide; LDAO, N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide; Q1, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-1,4-benzoquinone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 0.002% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and the new detergent at the described concentrations. The sample was then loaded onto an anion exchange column (DEAE HiTrap 5 ml or Mono-Q 5/5) equilibrated in buffer A. After elution with a gradient of NaCl in buffer A, fractions containing either intact complex or putative subcomplexes were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and applied to a gel filtration column for further analysis. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on either a Superose 6 or a Superose 12 column calibrated using a high molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). Buffers for gel filtration comprised 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.002% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the relevant detergent at the described concentrations. A flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was used and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In cases where Triton X-100 was used, all buffers contained 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 instead of MES.The positions of all individual subunits of complex I on our SDS-PAGE system were positively determined by mass spectrometry (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), allowing for unambiguous assignment of subunits constituting observed subcomplexes. Additionally, positions of all hydrophilic subunits were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing (data not shown). In the case of subunits NuoE and NuoJ overlapping on the gel, additional identification of subunits in subcomplexes was performed as described previously (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Analytical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford (Bio-Rad) method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Pre-prepared Novex Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels containing a 10–20% acrylamide gradient (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme activity assays were performed at 30 °C under constant stirring in a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer with a magnetic stirrer attachment. Ferricyanide (FeCy) reduction was followed at 420 nm in an assay buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Reactions were started by the addition of 1–2 μl of protein solution (∼2–4 μg of protein) to 2.0 ml of assay mixture containing 0.1 mm NADH and 1 mm FeCy. The oxidation of NADH in the presence of decyl-ubiquinone (DQ) or ubiquinone-1 (Q1) was followed at 340 nm. Assay buffer contained 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml E. coli total lipids, and 0.1% CHAPS carried over with the lipids. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm NADH after preincubation of 2.0 ml of otherwise complete assay mixture (containing 4–10 μg of protein and 0.1 mm of DQ or Q1) at 30 °C with stirring for 2 min.RESULTSSubunit NuoL Is Dissociated from Complex I in Decylmaltoside—DDM is one of the mildest detergents and it can support the integrity of complex I from E. coli during purification and several days incubation at 4 °C (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As part of a strategy employed in the search for crystallization conditions and for characterization of putative subcomplexes, we explored the stability of the enzyme in detergents other than DDM. Subcomplexes were studied by performing two different chromatography steps in the presence of the new detergent, anion exchange followed by gel filtration.Among detergents with shorter hydrophobic carbon chains and higher critical micellular concentrations than DDM, n-undecyl-β-d-maltoside preserved complex I intact (data not shown). However, exchange into n-decyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) at 0.5% (w/v) led to partial dissociation of the enzyme. During the first chromatography step (anion exchange) the complex remained intact, apart from a minor dissociation of the hydrophilic subunit NuoCD (probably less than 10% of the protein), which eluted partially in a first peak (Fig. 1A, fraction 1 and C, lane A1). The second and major peak (Fig. 1A, fraction 2) contained apparently intact complex (Fig. 1C, lane A2). The fractions from this peak were concentrated and applied to a gel filtration column. SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluate indicated that along with intact complex (Fig. 1B, fraction 1 and C, lane B1) the preparation contained in later fractions of complex I a diminished amount of subunit NuoL (Fig. 1B, fraction 2, and C, lane B2). Additionally, a clear peak of subunit NuoL was observed late in the elution profile (Fig. 1B, fraction 3, and C, lane B3). Other subunits visible in lane B3 were because of the tail of the main protein peak. The main peak itself was shifted slightly (∼13 ml) compared with the elution of intact complex I on a Superose 6 column (∼12.5 ml; ∼550 kDa plus detergent), consistent with it being a mixture of intact enzyme and complex I without NuoL. The position of the NuoL peak in the elution profile (∼15.5 ml) corresponds to about 150–200 kDa. Although close to the resolution limit of the column, this value is consistent with the elution of NuoL (∼66 kDa) surrounded by a detergent micelle.Thus, the chromatography in the presence of DM shows that the large hydrophobic subunit NuoL of the membrane part of complex I can be removed, whereas the integrity of the rest of the complex is preserved. This indicates a distal location of this subunit in the L-shaped assembly.Subunits NuoL and NuoM Are Removed from Complex I in Diheptanoyl Phosphocholine—1,2-Diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) is a short chain lipid that can be used as a relatively mild detergent for the solubilization of membrane proteins (40Hauser H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). During exchange of complex I into DHPC (0.15% w/v) by anion exchange chromatography, we observed a significant protein peak (Fig. 2A, fraction 1) before the elution of the bulk of the protein (Fig. 2A, fraction 2). SDS-PAGE indicated that the first peak contained subunits NuoL and NuoM (Fig. 2C, lane A1), which were completely removed from the rest of the complex (Fig. 2C, lane A2). When the fractions containing the bulk of the protein were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography, a symmetrical peak eluting at ∼13.3 ml (corresponding to about 450 kDa plus detergent) was observed (Fig. 2B). All subunits except NuoL and NuoM were present and eluted in concert throughout the fractions, with the peak fraction shown in Fig. 2C, lane B1.Fig. 2Chromatography of E. coli complex I in DHPC.

This demonstrates that neither subunit is involved in contacts between the membrane and peripheral arms of the enzyme.Peak fractions from gel filtration chromatography in DHPC, containing complex I lacking subunits NuoL and NuoM, were pooled, concentrated, and assayed for NADH dehydrogenase activity. As can be seen from Table I, the activity with artificial electron acceptor FeCy was still observed, although at somewhat lower levels than with intact enzyme. However, with water-soluble quinone Q1 the rate was severely reduced, about 20-fold lower as compared with the intact enzyme. There was no measurable activity when hydrophobic ubiquinone analogue DQ was used as an acceptor.Table IActivities of intact E. coli complex I and of the subcomplex obtained in DHPC (with subunits NuoL and NuoM removed)PreparationNADH:FeCy activityNADH:Q1 activityNADH:DQ activityIntact complex I54.2 ± 3.317.7 ± 2.621.3 ± 2.1Complex I without NuoL and NuoM28.4 ± 4.30.80 ± 0.150.0 Open table in a new tab Further Fragmentation of Complex I—The observations on the relative lability of subunits NuoL and NuoM were confirmed by the dissociation of the complex after detergent exchange into Triton X-100. In the experiments described so far, we used pH 6.0 to keep the enzyme as stable as possible (15Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol.

However, Triton X-100 (0.15% v/v) was used at pH 7.5 with a preincubation of the enzyme with 0.3 m NaCl, to promote dissociation of the complex (20Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T.

Anion exchange chromatography indicated the presence of three major fractions: a membrane domain without subunits NuoL and NuoM (Fig. 3, A, fraction 1, and B, lane A1), an apparently intact membrane domain complete with subunits NuoL, NuoM, and a minor proportion of NuoCD (Fig. 3, A, fraction 2, and B, lane A2), and a peripheral domain (Fig. 3, A, fraction 3, and B, lane A3). The peripheral domain appeared to be a stable assembly, such that during subsequent gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column it eluted as a single species of about 300 kDa, containing all six hydrophilic subunits (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2054795600,"Activation of mouse 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (mPDK1) requires phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue, Ser244, in the activation loop. However, the mechanism by which mPDK1 is phosphorylated at this site remains unclear. We have found that kinase-defective mPDK1 (mPDK1KD), but not a kinase-defective mPDK1 in which Ser244 was replaced with alanine (mPDK1KD/S244A), is significantly phosphorylated in intact cells and is a direct substrate of wild-type mPDK1 fused to the yellow fluorescence protein. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping studies revealed that mPDK1 trans-autophosphorylation occurred mainly on Ser244. On the other hand, Ser399 and Thr516, two recently identified autophosphorylation sites of mPDK1, are phosphorylated primarily through a cis mechanism. In vivo labeling studies revealed that insulin stimulated both mPDK1KD and mPDK1KD/S244A phosphorylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the insulin receptor. However, Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific antibody revealed no increase in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser244 in these cells overexpressing mPDK1. mPDK1 undergoes dimerization in cells and this self-association is enhanced by kinase inactivation. Deletion of the extreme C terminus disrupts mPDK1 dimerization and Ser244 trans-phosphorylation, suggesting that dimerization is important for mPDK1 trans-phosphorylation. Taken together, our results show that mPDK1 autophosphorylation occurs at multiple sites through both cis and trans mechanisms and suggest that dimerization and trans-phosphorylation may serve as mechanisms to regulate PDK1 activity in cells.

PDK1 phosphorylates many important cellular kinases such as protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), PKC isoforms, and p70 S6 kinase in the activation loop and contributes to their activation in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. These results suggest that PDK1 may play a key role in the regulation of various cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Wick K.L.R. Liu F. Curr. Drug Targets: Immune, Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2001; 1: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While PDK1 has been shown to activate PKB/Akt and its other substrates by catalyzing the phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the activation loop of these kinases, how PDK1 itself is regulated remains largely unknown. Recent studies suggest that phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of PDK1 function in cells (3Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified on PDK1 and several heterologous kinases that mediate some of these phosphorylation events have been identified. Src, Fyn, and Abl tyrosine kinases can phosphorylate PDK1 in vitro and overexpression of v-Src results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 in cells (4Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R.

Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Specific serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate PDK1 have not been identified. However, PDK1 has been shown to possess the intrinsic ability to phosphorylate itself (7Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 8Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PDK1 undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser244 in the activation loop remains unknown. It is interesting to note that the sequence surrounding Ser244 of mPDK1 is highly homologous to the consensus motif in the activation loop of PDK1 substrates. This suggests that phosphorylation of Ser244 may be mediated by an intermolecular mechanism. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if PDK1 autophosphorylation is regulated in cells. Phosphorylation at Ser241 in the activation loop of human PDK1 (homologous to Ser244 in murine PDK1) appears to be independent of growth factor stimulation (7Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, in certain cell types, insulin stimulation increases both mPDK1 phosphorylation and activity in a Ser244-dependent manner (3Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests that extracellular stimuli can affect phosphorylation at this site. Interaction of PDK1 with the phosphorylated hydrophobic motif of its substrate RSK may induce PDK1 autophosphorylation (9Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, conformational changes induced by protein interactions may regulate autophosphorylation. In the present study, we show that mPDK1 undergoes autophosphorylation via both cis and trans mechanisms. Using phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping, we identified Ser244 as a major site of trans-phosphorylation and Ser399 or Thr516 as major sites of cis-phosphorylation in vitro. In vivo labeling, phosphopeptide mapping, and Western blot analysis using a Ser244 phosphospecific antibody demonstrated that mPDK1 also undergoes trans-phosphorylation at Ser244 in cells. Moreover, mPDK1 dimerizes in cells and disruption of this interaction inhibits trans-phosphorylation at Ser244. Our results suggest that dimerization and trans-phosphorylation in the activation loop may regulate PDK1 activity in cells.

All mPDK1 mutants were generated using single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis according to a previously described protocol (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using customized primers. Each mPDK1 mutant construct was verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Generation of mPDK1 Constructs—GST-mPDK1 fusion proteins were generated by cloning cDNAs of full-length or truncated mPDK1 into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), in-frame with a sequence encoding the GST protein. To generate mPDK1-YFP fusion proteins, cDNA encoding YFP was first cloned from peSP72-YFP (a generous gift from Dr. Patricia Camacho, UTHSCSA) into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA.A (Invitrogen) in-frame with the Myc-tag (pcDNA/YFP-myc). cDNAs encoding full-length or truncations of mPDK1 were then cloned into this vector in-frame with YFP and the Myc-tag.

Transfections were performed using LipofectAmine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in Buffer B. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was used for either immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the primary antibody conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads for 6–18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold Buffer A. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes and bound proteins were detected by blotting with primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). GST-mPDK1 Pull-down Assays—Expression of GST-mPDK1 proteins was carried out using similar protocols as described previously (13Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Langlais P. Liu F. J. Biol.

CHO/IR/HA-mPDK1 cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by serum starvation for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in Buffer B as described above. Clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST alone or various GST-mPDK1 proteins for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold Buffer A and bound protein eluted by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained or blotted to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. In Vitro/in Vivo Phosphorylation Assays—For in vitro trans-phosphorylation of PDK1, cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged, YFP-fused or full-length mPDK1 proteins were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by serum starvation for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in Buffer B, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibody to the tag. Bound protein was washed twice with ice-cold Buffer A and once with Buffer C. Phosphorylation was initiated with the addition of 30 μl of Buffer C plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Beads were washed with Buffer A and bound proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. Phosphorylation of PDK1 was visualized by autoradiography, and protein amounts determined by Western blot analysis. Alternatively, bands corresponding to PDK1 were eluted and used in various assays. In vivo 32P metabolic labeling, phosphoamino acid analysis, and phosphopeptide mapping studies of mPDK1 were carried out using similar protocols as described previously (8Wick M.J. Dong L.Q.

Generation of a Ser244 Phosphospecific Antibody—The phosphopeptide C-LSPESKQARpSFVGTA was synthesized and purified by FPLC reverse-phase chromatography using a Source (C4-C18) column. The major peak was lyophilized and conjugated to KLH pre-activated with Sulfo-MBS (Pierce). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized and boosted three times with the conjugate at 4, 7, and 10 weeks. ELISA assays using phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated Ser244 peptide antigen were performed to determine antiserum specificity and dilution. mPDK1 Undergoes trans-Phosphorylation at Ser244 in the Activation Loop—We (3Chen H.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and others (7Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have identified Ser244 (mPDK1) or Ser241 (hPDK1) in the activation loop as critical for PDK1 kinase activity. To characterize the mechanism by which mPDK1 undergoes phosphorylation at this site, we generated mammalian expression vectors encoding an N-terminal YFP-fused wild-type mPDK1 (YFP-mPDK1), a kinase-defective mutant of mPDK1 (mPDK1KD), and mPDK1KD containing an alanine substitution at Ser244 (mPDK1KD/S244A); all of these constructs possessing a Myc-epitope tag at the C terminus. These proteins were expressed individually in CHO/IR cells, immunoprecipitated using antibody against the tag, and phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1A). Significant autophosphorylation was detected on YFP-mPDK1, suggesting that the YFP fusion had no adverse affects on mPDK1 autokinase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 3). No detectable phosphorylation was observed for either mPDK1KD or mPDK1KD/S244A alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). However, in the presence of YFP-mPDK1, mPDK1KD, but not mPDK1KD/S244A, underwent significant phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 1A, lane 4 versus 5). These results suggest Ser244 as a potential trans-phosphorylation site. Under these conditions, no other phosphorylation bands were observed when the immunoprecipitated YFP-mPDK1 was incubated with Mg2+[γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). This finding helps to rule out the possibility that the phosphorylation of mPDK1KD was due to the presence of a contaminating kinase(s) co-immunoprecipitated with YFP-mPDK1. To further test whether Ser244 undergoes trans-phosphorylation, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis was performed on the in vitro trans-phosphorylated mPDK1KD (Fig. 1B, left panel). A control map of autophosphorylated wild-type mPDK1 is also shown (Fig 1B, right panel). Analysis of trans-phosphorylated mPDK1KD revealed phosphorylation mainly on the peptide previously found to contain Ser244 (Fig. 1B, left panel, phosphopeptide e) (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because Ser244 in wild-type mDPK1 is already significantly phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, we do not typically observe significant phosphorylation of this site in vitro (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in agreement with our earlier study (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), significant autophosphorylation at Ser399 (Fig. 1B, right panel, phosphopeptide 3) and Thr516 (Fig. 1B, right panel, phosphopeptides 1 and 2) is normally observed in the in vitro autophosphorylated mPDK1. Unlike wild-type mPDK1, in vitro phosphorylated mPDK1KD revealed no significant phosphorylation at either site (Fig. 1B, left panel). These findings suggest that mPDK1 phosphorylation at Ser244 occurs through a trans mechanism, while Ser399 and Thr516 may be cis-phosphorylated. To further confirm that Ser244 of mPDK1 is a site of trans-phosphorylation, we generated mPDK1KD/S244T in which the ATP-binding site Lys114 and the activation loop Ser244 were replaced with Gly and Thr, respectively. mPDK1KD/S244T was phosphorylated by YFP-mPDK1 in vitro, and its phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 1C) and phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1D). A significant increase in phosphorylation was observed for mPDK1KD/S244T compared with mPDK1KD (Fig. 1C, lane 2 versus 1). Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated mPDK1KD/S244T revealed mainly threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 1D, right panel). By contrast, in vitro trans-phosphorylation of mPDK1KD occurred primarily on serine (Fig. 1D, left panel). These results provide further evidence that Ser244 is phosphorylated by a trans mechanism in vitro. Ser244 in the Activation Loop of mPDK1 Is trans-Phosphorylated in Intact Cells—To examine potential mPDK1 trans-phosphorylation in cells, we metabolically labeled CHO/IR cells expressing Myc-tagged wild-type, kinase-inactive, or Ser244 mutants of mPDK1. In agreement with our previous studies (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), wild-type mPDK1 underwent significant phosphorylation in cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Replacing Ser244 with alanine significantly decreased mPDK1 phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 2A, lane 2 versus 1). In contrast, mutant PDK1 with Ser244 replaced by threonine showed increased phosphorylation compared with wild-type PDK1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus 1). Kinase-defective mPDK1 was also significantly phosphorylated in CHO/IR cells (Fig. 2A, lane 4), as well as in CHO and HEK293 cells expressing endogenous IR (data not shown), suggesting that mPDK1 undergoes trans-phosphorylation in cells. In vivo phosphorylation of mPDK1KD was markedly decreased by mutating Ser244 to alanine (mPDK1KD/S244A) (Fig. 2A, lane 5 versus 4). On the other hand, mutation of Ser244 to threonine (mPDK1KD/S244T) only modestly reduced mPDK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lane 6 versus 4). Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vivo-labeled mPDK1 proteins revealed that both mPDK1 and mPDK1KD were phosphorylated mainly on serine (Fig. 2B, upper and lower left panels). Mutation of Ser244 to threonine resulted in a significant increase in phosphothreonine content of wild-type or kinase-inactive mPDK1 (Fig. 2B, upper and lower right panels). These findings provide strong evidence that Ser244 of mPDK1 is a major trans-phosphorylation site in intact cells. Notable serine phosphorylation remained on both mPDK1S244T (Fig. 2B, upper right panel) and mPDK1KD/S244T (Fig. 2B, lower right panel). Thus, in addition to Ser244, mPDK1 may be trans-phosphorylated on additional serine residue(s). Ser399 and Thr516 of mPDK1 Undergo cis Mediated Phosphorylation in Cells—To explore the mechanism by which Ser399 and Thr516 (two recently identified mPDK1 autophosphorylation sites (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), are phosphorylated in cells, mPDK1, mPDK1KD, and mPDK1S244A proteins were immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled CHO/IR cells and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis. Replacing Ser244 with alanine in mPDK1 led to a loss of three phosphopeptides e, h, and i (Fig. 2C, right versus left panel), which have been previously identified as Ser244-containing peptides (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, these phosphopeptides were visible in the map of kinase-defective mPDK1 (Fig. 2C, middle versus left panel), suggesting that Ser244 of mPDK1 is the major trans-phosphorylation site in cells. The two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of wild-type mPDK1 also contained three moderately phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2C, left panel; peptides 1, 2, and 3), which we previously identified as phosphopeptides containing Thr516 (peptides 1 and 2) and Ser399 (peptide 3). These phosphopeptides were absent in the map of mPDK1KD (Fig. 2C, middle panel), suggesting these sites are phosphorylated in vivo by a cis mechanism. mPDK1 Undergoes Insulin-stimulated trans-Phosphorylation in Cells—In some cell types, insulin stimulates mPDK1 phosphorylation (3Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether mPDK1 trans-phosphorylation is stimulated by insulin, mPDK1, mPDK1KD, or mPDK1KD/S244A proteins were transiently expressed in CHO/IR cells. These cells were 32P-labeled, treated with or without insulin, and phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated protein was assessed by autoradiography. Treatment of cells with insulin led to an increase in phosphorylation of wild-type mPDK1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus 1) and mPDK1KD (Fig. 3A, lane 4 versus 3). Replacing Ser244 with alanine significantly reduced overall phosphorylation of mPDK1KD (Fig. 3A, lane 6 versus 4). However, the stimulatory effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of mPDK1KD/S244A was still observed (Fig. 3A, lane 6 versus 5). This result suggested that a site(s) in addition to or other than Ser244 is trans-phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation. To further examine mPDK1 trans-phosphorylation, we developed a phosphospecific antibody to Ser244 of mPDK1. We found that this phosphoantibody recognized Ser244 phosphorylation on wild-type protein (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 2), but not mPDK1 with Ser244 mutated to alanine (mPDK1S244A), aspartate (mPDK1S244D), or glutamate (mPDK1S244E) (Fig. 3B, lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively). Furthermore, detection of Ser244 phosphorylation was blocked by incubation of the antibody with the phosphorylated Ser244 peptide antigen (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lane 2), but not with the corresponding, non-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3B, top panel, lane 2). To examine whether phosphorylation of mPDK1 at Ser244 is stimulated by insulin, CHO/IR cells transiently expressing mPDK1 or mPDK1KD were left untreated or treated with insulin. Phosphorylation of mPDK1 proteins at Ser244 was examined by Western blot using our phosphospecific antibody. Significant phosphorylation at Ser244 was observed in both wild-type and kinase-defective mPDK1 under basal conditions (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 3). Interestingly, insulin stimulation had no significant effect on Ser244 phosphorylation of the overexpressed mPDK1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 3). Under similar conditions, insulin significantly stimulated Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). These findings suggest that phosphorylation at Ser244 is not regulated by insulin when mPDK1 is overexpressed in CHO/IR cells. Dimerization of mPDK1 Occurs in Vitro and in Cells—The finding that mPDK1 is trans-phosphorylated in mammalian cells suggested that mPDK1 may undergo an intermolecular interaction. To examine this possibility, we generated a GST-mPDK1 fusion protein and carried out “pull-down” studies using lysates from CHO/IR cells stably expressing HA-tagged mPDK1 (CHO/IR/HA-mPDK1). As shown in Fig. 4A, a significant amount of HA-tagged mPDK1 was pulled-down by GST-mPDK1. No detectable interaction between HA-mPDK1 and GST was observed. To determine if mPDK1 dimerization occurs in cells and whether insulin regulates this interaction, we expressed untagged mPDK1 in CHO/IR cells together with either YFP-mPDK1-myc or YFP-myc. Cells were treated without or with insulin, and Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-Myc antibody. Western blot analysis revealed that untagged mPDK1 co-immunoprecipitated with YFP-mPDK1, but not with YFP (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4 versus 5 and 6). However, no significant difference in mPDK1 interaction was observed following insulin treatment (Fig. 4B, lane 3 versus 4). Similarly, we observed insulin-independent dimerization of mPDK1 overexpressed in HEK-293 and CHO cells (data not shown). It is possible that PDK1 dimerization in cells may be due to an associated protein. However, this is unlikely since the mPDK1 proteins were overexpressed and any affect by an associated endogenous protein would be much less significant compared with the interaction between two overexpressed proteins. Subsequently, we investigated if kinase activity of the enzyme is important for mPDK1 dimerization. We expressed YFP-mPDK1 and YFP-mPDK1KD in CHO/IR cells together with untagged mPDK1 or mPDK1KD. We found increased interaction between YFP-mPDK1 and mPDK1KD compared with mPDK1WT (Fig. 4C, lane 3 versus 1). Similarly, increased amounts of mPDK1 were immunoprecipitated by YFP-mPDK1KD compared with YFP-mPDK1WT (Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus 1). However, when similar studies were performed using wild-type mPDK1 and an YFP-mPDK1 mutant in which Ser244 was mutated to alanine, we noted no significant difference in the amount of untagged mPDK1 co-immunoprecipitated by YFP-mPDK1S244A compared with YFP-mPDK1 (data not shown). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Ser244 itself probably does not contribute significantly to dimerization. Instead, kinase inactivation induced conformational changes may play a role in the increased dimerization seen in the YFP-mPDK1KD mutant. Deletion of Residues 501–559 in the PH Domain Disrupts mPDK1 Dimerization and trans-Phosphorylation—mPDK1 contains a C-terminal PH domain including amino acid residues 453–553 (10Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region is involved in mPDK1 interaction, we expressed GST fusion proteins of full-length mPDK1, mPDK1 with a deletion in the PH domain (residues 501–559; mPDK1ΔPH), or mPDK1 with a deletion at its C terminus (residues 341–559; GST-mPDK1ΔC). Pull-down studies revealed that HA-tagged mPDK1 interacted with GST-mPDK1 but not with GST alone (Fig. 5A, lane 2 versus 1). Significantly less HA-tagged protein was precipitated by either GST-mPDK1ΔPH or by GST-mPDK1ΔC compared with wild-type (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 2). These findings suggest that the C-terminal PH domain is important for mPDK1 dimerization. To examine if the C terminus is required for mPDK1 dimerization in intact cells, we generated YFP fusion proteins with a series of mPDK1 deletion mutants (Fig. 5B). These fusion proteins were expressed in CHO/IR cells together with untagged mPDK1 and their interactions examined by immunoprecipitation studies. Significant amounts of untagged mPDK1 protein were co-immunoprecipitated with YFP-mPDK1 (Fig. 5C, lane 1), but not with YFP-mPDK1 with a deletion in the PH domain (YFP-mPDK1ΔC1,Fig. 5C, lane 2) or YFP-mPDK1 proteins with further C-terminal deletions (Fig. 5C, lanes 3–5). These results indicate that the PH domain of mPDK1 is important for mPDK1 association in intact cells. To determine if dimerization is required for mPDK1 in vitro trans-phosphorylation, we compared phosphorylation of mPDK1KD by full-length and C-terminal truncations of YFP-mPDK1. Consistent with our previous results, mPDK1KD was significantly phosphorylated by YFP-mPDK1 (Fig. 6, lane 1). In contrast, YFP-mPDK1 proteins truncated at the C terminus were unable to appreciably phosphorylate mPDK1KD (Fig. 6, lanes 2–5). These results indicate a role for the C-terminal PH domain in mPDK1 trans-mediated phosphorylation and suggest that dimerization may be required for mPDK1 trans-phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of members of the AGC family protein kinases in the activation loop by PDK1 is essential for both catalysis and substrate recognition (14Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 15Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PDK1 itself is a member of the AGC kinase family and is phosphorylated in the activation loop, and this phosphorylation has been found to be crucial for kinase activity (3Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which PDK1 is phosphorylated in this region is unknown. Our results show that PDK1KD, but not PDK1KD/S244A, is significantly phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. 2A) and is a direct substrate for YFP-PDK1 in vitro (Fig. 1A). In addition, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated PDK1KD revealed that this phosphorylation occurs predominantly on Ser244-containing peptides (Fig. 1B, phosphopeptides e, h, and i). Furthermore, in vitro trans-phosphorylation of PDK1KD occurred almost exclusively on threonine when Ser244 was replaced with threonine (Fig. 1D). These results provide strong evidence that phosphorylation at Ser244 in mPDK1 is mediated by trans mechanism. In contrast, Ser399 and Thr516, two recently identified mPDK1 autophosphorylation sites, are most likely phosphorylated via a cis mechanism. These two sites are significantly phosphorylated in wild-type mPDK1, both in vitro and in intact cells (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, no appreciable Ser399 and Thr516 phosphorylation was observed in the kinase inactive mPDK1 (Fig. 2 and data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites is dependent on the kinase activity of the enzyme. Taken together, our results indicate that autophosphorylation of distinct sites in mPDK1 are mediated by separate mechanisms. We found that the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of a kinase inactive mPDK1 was dramatically decreased when Ser244 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 3A). While this finding is consistent with the possibility that Ser244 of mPDK1 is a major insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site, no significant difference in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at this site was observed by Western blot using a phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 3C). One possible explanation may be that mutation of Ser244 affected insulin-mediated cis- and/or trans-phosphorylation. Alternatively, the trans kinase, which phosphorylates mPDK1KD in response to insulin stimulation, might require an intact activation loop region, which was disrupted by mutation of Ser244 to alanine. However, it should also be pointed out that these studies were carried out in cells overexpressing mPDK1. It remains possible that phosphorylation of endogenous mPDK1 at Ser244 is stimulated by insulin under physiological conditions. Further studies will be needed to test these possibilities. The C terminus of PDK1 contains a PH domain. Binding of phosphoinositides to this region has been shown to contribute to the regulation of PDK1 activity (16Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N.

Our results show that truncation of the PH domain disrupts mPDK1 interaction (Fig. 5) and trans-phosphorylation (Fig. 6), suggesting that the PH domain may play a role in regulating mPDK1 interaction. However, inhibition of phosphoinositide production by either overexpression of the phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN or by treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin did not affect trans-phosphorylation at Ser244 in CHO/IR (data not shown). Furthermore, no significant difference in Ser244 phosphorylation was observed between wild-type and kinase inactive mPDK1 using our phospho-Ser244 antibody (Fig. 3C). Thus, insulin-stimulated mPDK1 phosphorylation in CHO/IR cells most likely occurs at sites other than Ser244. It is possible that endogenous PDK1 dimerization and trans-phosphorylation may be regulated in cells more physiologically relevant to insulin signaling. Further studies will be required to test this hypothesis. PDK1 recognizes and phosphorylates several substrates by interacting with a C-terminal hydrophobic docking site of the substrates that contain the motif Phe-X-X-Phe-(Ser/Thr)-Phe/Tyr (9Frodin M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In some PDK1 substrates, such as Akt and p70 S6 kinase, phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif creates a docking site that facilitates interaction between the substrate and PDK1. In other kinases such as atypical PKC isoforms or PKC-related kinases (PRK-1/PKN and PRK-2), the phospho-acceptor position in the hydrophobic motif is replaced by an acidic Asp residue that mimics a phosphorylated state (22Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 23Storz P. Toker A. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: d886-d902Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PDK1 dimerizes in cells remains unknown. A conserved C-terminal hydrophobic motif is not found in PDK1. On the other hand, mPDK1 contains a potential hydrophobic motif at its C terminus (Phe514-Lys515-Thr516-Phe517). It should be noted that Thr516 within this potential hydrophobic motif is autophosphorylated both in vitro and in cells and replacing this residue with negatively charged glutamate increases PDK1 activity in cells (11Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, we found that replacing Thr516 with Ala or Phe514 and Phe517 with leucine had no effect on mPDK1 dimerization (data not shown). These findings suggest that PDK1 may use an alternative mechanism to form complexes with other PDK1 molecules or downstream substrates. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Ser244 in the activation loop of mPDK1 is autophosphorylated by a trans mechanism. In addition, two other recently identified mPDK1 autophosphorylation sites, Ser399 and Thr516, are most likely phosphorylated through a cis mechanism. We found that mPDK1 undergoes dimerization in cells and truncations at the C terminus prevented both PDK1 association and trans-phosphorylation. These findings suggest that dimerization may facilitate trans-phosphorylation at Ser244 and other unidentified site(s). Since phosphorylation at Ser244 is essential for PDK1 activity, dimerization and subsequent trans-phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser244 may be an important mechanism for regulation of PDK1 kinase activity and function in cells.

Studies on the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development in porcine cardiac fibers demonstrated that TnT-ΔK210 caused a significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas the TnT-R141W did not result in any change in Ca2+ sensitivity when compared with human cardiac wild-type TnT (HCWTnT). TnT-ΔK210 also caused a decrease in maximal force when compared with HCWTnT and TnT-R141W. In addition, the TnT-ΔK210 mutant decreased maximal ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+. However, the TnT-K273E mutation caused a significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity but behaved similarly to HCWTnT in actomyosin activation assays. Inhibition of ATPase activity in reconstituted actin-activated myosin ATPase assays was similar for all three TnT mutants and HCWTnT. Additionally, circular dichroism studies suggest that the secondary structure of all three TnT mutants was similar to that of the HCWTnT. These results suggest that a rightward shift in Ca2+ sensitivity is not the only determinant for the phenotype of DCM. The effects of Troponin T (TnT) mutants R141W and ΔK210, the only two currently known mutations in TnT that cause dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM) independent of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), and TnT-K273E, a mutation that leads to a progression from FHC to DCM, were investigated.

These results suggest that a rightward shift in Ca2+ sensitivity is not the only determinant for the phenotype of DCM. Contraction of cardiac muscle is initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-specific regulatory site in Troponin C (TnC), 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; WT, wild type; HCWTnT, human cardiac wild-type troponin T; CD, circular dichroism; cTnT, cardiac TnT; RLC, regulatory light chain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TM, tropomyosin. the Ca2+ binding subunit of the troponin (Tn) complex, which also contains Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT). The Tn complex, together with tropomyosin (Tm), forms the regulatory system of the contractile apparatus (1Gergely J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Contraction results from the ATP-driven interaction of the thin, actin-containing filaments and the thick, myosin-containing filaments. This interaction is regulated by Tm-Tn in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Upon binding of Ca2+ to the single Ca2+-specific site of cardiac TnC, the C terminus of TnI interacts with the amino terminus of TnC and dissociates from the actin·Tm complex, allowing myosin to bind to actin. TnT is thought to stabilize the troponin complex, but it also regulates the Ca2+ sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase activity and the level of ATPase activation as well as force development (2Zot A.S.

Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in genes for various sarcomeric proteins were shown to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (4Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). DCM is a relatively common disorder that results in heart failure and premature death (5Cohn J.N. Bristow M.R. Chien K.R. Colucci W.S. Frazier O.H. Leinwand L.A. Lorell B.H. Moss A.J. Sonnenblick E.H. Walsh R.A. Mockrin S.C. Reinlib L. Circulation. 1997; 95: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). DCM is characterized by ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function. Pathological manifestation of DCM includes modest hypertrophy, myocyte degeneration, and increased interstitial fibrosis (4Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Proposed causes of DCM include alcohol toxicity, ischemia, metabolic and nutritional deficiency, infectious diseases, and familial and genetic factors. Among these factors, it is estimated that heritable gene mutations account for 25–30% of cases (4Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The first thin filament-associated DCM mutation was described in the cardiac actin gene (6Olson T.M. Michels V.V. Thibodeau S.N. Tai Y.S. Keating M.T. Science. 1998; 280: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mutations were found in other sarcomeric proteins, including β-myosin heavy chain, cardiac myosin binding protein C, titin, α-Tm, and cardiac TnT (7Fatkin D. Graham R.M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 945-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The presumed mechanism by which these mutations cause DCM is not clearly understood. So far there are four TnT mutations (R92W, R141W, ΔK210, and K273E) that are known to cause DCM. However, only two of these mutations (R141W and ΔK210) are known to cause DCM independent of FHC. After genotypic analysis, Kamisago et al. (8Kamisago M. Sharma S.D. DePalma S.R. Solomon S. Sharma P. McDonough B. Smoot L. Mullen M.P. Woolf P.K. Wigle E.D. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) reported the first TnT mutation as the cause of DCM in two unrelated families. This mutation occurs in exon 13 of cardiac TnT because of a deletion of the basic amino acid lysine at position 210. None of the individuals affected with DCM exhibited ventricular hypertrophy, a hallmark feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Medical records of deceased individuals from these families revealed sudden deaths of two infants with infantile cardiomyopathy and three young adults (8Kamisago M. Sharma S.D. DePalma S.R.

Fourteen living members of the family clinically manifested DCM, predominantly in the second decade of their life. Seventeen members of this family died of heart failure before the genotypic studies were carried out. It is worth mentioning that arginine at position 141 of cardiac TnT (cTnT) is conserved in many species, including mouse, rat, chicken, quail, and nematode as well as among the slow or fast skeletal muscle isoform of TnT (9Li D.

Cardiol. 2002; 89: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported another novel mutation in the cardiac TnT gene at position 273, where the highly conserved amino acid lysine is switched to glutamic acid. Nine family members from two unrelated pedigrees inherited the mutation, and this mutation is associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death in one family. This mutation primarily caused asymmetric septal hypertrophy in seven of nine family members with the mutation. Interestingly, the mutation caused a complete transition from FHC to DCM in one of the two family members whose disease progression was monitored for 12–14 years. To date, the biochemical mechanisms regulating cardiac dilation are not clearly understood. In this study, we have investigated the functional consequences of the DCM-causing TnT mutations R141W, ΔK210, and K273E on the regulatory properties of the thin filament. Previously, Morimoto et al. (11) investigated TnT-ΔK210 and hypothesized that the Ca2+ desensitizing effect of this mutation is the primary cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. Because Ca2+ is the primary activator of the thin filament, we investigated how this mutation affects the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. Our results are in agreement with Morimoto's group, which showed that the mutation TnT-ΔK210 caused a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity. However, we also observed a significant decrease in the Ca2+-activated maximal force in TnT-ΔK210-reconstituted fibers when compared with HCWTnT-reconstituted fibers, which was not previously observed by Morimoto et al. (11). However, ATPase activation assays done in the presence of Ca2+ showed differences for both the TnT-DCM mutants compared with HCWTnT. Both TnT-DCM mutants showed a significant decrease in the maximum ATPase activity when compared with HCWTnT, with the ΔK210 mutation having a larger impairment of maximal ATPase activity compared with the R141W mutation. So far, no one has investigated the functional effect caused by the TnT-R141W or the TnT-K273E mutation. We found that the DCM mutant TnT-R141W did not result in any change in Ca2+ sensitivity and maximal force when compared with HCWTnT. The TnT-K273E mutation sensitized the muscle to lower Ca2+ concentrations, consistent with most TnT-FHC-causing mutations. These results suggest that distinct DCM mutations within the same sarcomeric protein, TnT, have different effects in regulating muscle contraction.

Porcine muscle fiber bundles were mounted on a force transducer and treated with the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 for ∼1 h. The composition of pCa 8.0 solution was 10–8m Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase; ionic strength = 150 mm. Subsequently, the fibers were transferred to pCa 8.0 solution without Triton X-100 and then into pCa 4.0 solution for the initial force determination. The composition of the pCa 4.0 solution is the same as that of the pCa 8.0 buffer, except the Ca2+ concentration was 10–4m. To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, the fibers were gradually exposed to the solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations, from pCa 8.0 to pCa 4.0. To displace the endogenous Tn complex, the fibers were incubated in a solution containing 250 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and ∼0.8–1 mg/ml HCWTnT or TnT-DCM mutants, for 1 h at room temperature. After a 1-h incubation, the fibers were incubated in fresh TnT protein for another hour. This was done to ensure the displacement of endogenous troponin from the fibers. Displaced fibers were then washed with the same solution without the protein (10 min at room temperature) and tested for the Ca2+-unregulated force that developed due to the absence of the endogenous porcine cardiac TnI and TnC. The Ca2+ regulation of steady-state force was restored with a preformed human cardiac TnI·TnC complex. The reconstitution with the TnI·TnC complex (30 μm) was performed in the pCa 8 solution for ∼1.5 h at room temperature for the force to reach a stable level. Control fibers were run in parallel and treated with the same solutions without the proteins. The final Ca2+ sensitivity of force development was determined after human cardiac TnI·TnC reconstitution as before by exposing the fiber to increasing Ca2+ concentration from pCa 8.0 to pCa 4.0. The data was analyzed using the Hill equation in Sigma plot. The Hill equation is written as follows: % Relative force = 100 × [Ca2+] n H/[Ca2+] n H + pCa50nH, where pCa50 determines Ca2+ concentration of the solution in which 50% of force is produced and n H is the Hill coefficient. Western Blot Analysis of Experimental Fibers—The protein samples used in the analysis are: Control fiber (treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min); fibers displaced with 0.8 mg/ml of HCWTnT, TnT-R141W, TnT-ΔK210, TnT-K273E for 2 h; and fibers reconstituted with HCTnI·HCTnC after being displaced with HCWTnT and the TnT mutations, respectively. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C in 0.4% SDS, 6 m urea, 500 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 14.2 m β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.03% bromphenol blue (w/v) before electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE was performed with 15% acrylamide gels. Using a mini-gel apparatus (mini-protean II dual slab cell; Bio-Rad), the samples were electrophoresed for 1 h at a constant voltage of 130 V. Proteins on the SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) with a mini-trans-blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The transfer was complete after 1 h at 95 V, and the membranes strips were incubated for 1 h in a blocking buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm sodium chloride, 3%(v/v) milk, 0.05% Tween 20 to eliminate nonspecific binding sites. Then the strips were incubated with monoclonal anti-cardiac Troponin I (Research Diagnostics Inc.) (1:4000 dilution) and rabbit polyclonal regulatory light chain (generated in our laboratory) at 1:250 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. After 2 h, the membrane strips were washed three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 0.05%(v/v) Tween 20 for 10 min. Following this, the membranes were incubated for 2 h in polyclonal goat anti-mouse (Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit antibody (ICN). Binding was visualized by addition of diaminobenzidine (3,3′,4,4′-tetraamino biphenyl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Color development was stopped by rinsing membrane strips in deionized water. Proteins were quantified on the stained gel by densitometric scanning using NIH Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp.). Troponin Complex Formation—Rabbit skeletal F-actin was prepared as described by Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (19Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Jakubiak M. Drabikowski W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac myosin was purified according to Murakami et al. (20Murakami U. Uchida K. Hiratsuka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac Tm was prepared from pig ventricles according to Potter (21Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Tn complexes containing HCWTnT and TnT-R141W, TnT-ΔK210, TnT-K273E with recombinant human cardiac TnI and TnC were prepared according to the following protocol (21Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All three troponin subunits (TnT, TnI, and TnC) were first dialyzed against 6 m urea, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3. After dialysis they were mixed at a molar ratio 1·25:1·25:1 (TnT:TnI:TnC) and incubated for 1 h on ice before being dialyzed against buffers with decreasing concentrations of urea. The dialysis buffer contained 1 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 NaN3, and 6 m urea initially followed by 3 m and 0 m urea. Subsequently, the complexes were gradually dialyzed against buffers containing decreasing concentrations of KCl, starting from 1 m, then 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and finally 0.1 m KCl. The excess TnT and TnI that precipitated at the low ionic strength without urea buffer was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The molar ratio of the reconstituted troponin complexes was verified by 15% SDS-PAGE and was 1:1:1 for TnT:TnI:TnC. ATPase Assays—The ATPase assays were performed with rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin (3.5 μm) containing porcine cardiac Tm (1 μm) and preformed Tn complexes (1 μm) as previously described (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The concentration of porcine cardiac myosin was 0.6 μm. All ATPase assays were performed in the presence (0.5 mm CaCl2) and absence (1 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. The ATPase reactions (in 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) were initiated with 2.5 mm ATP. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The inorganic phosphate that was released was measured according to the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (22Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra of the HCWTnT and the TnT mutants TnT-R141W, TnT-ΔK210, and TnT-K273E were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a cell path length of 0.1 cm at ambient temperature (22 °C) in a 10-mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 500-mm KCl solution. The CD spectrum was recorded at 190–250 nm in the far UV region with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min and at a resolution of 0.2 nm. The concentration of HCWTnT and the TnT mutants was determined by Bradford assay using HCWTnT as a standard. The concentration of HCWTnT was accurately determined by nitrogen analysis. Analysis and processing of data was done using the Jasco system software. Ten scans were averaged, base lines were subtracted, and no numerical smoothing was applied. The mean residue ellipticity [θ]MRE, in degrees·cm2·dmol–1 for the spectra was calculated using the equation [θ]MRE = [θ]/(10·Cr·l), where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length in cm. The α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the equation for [θ] at 222 nm (23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) [θ]222 = –30300 f H–2340 where f H is the fraction of α-helical content (f H × 100, expressed in %). Spectra are presented as the mean residue ellipticity. Data Analysis—Statistical analysis of the differences between mean values was done using the Student's t test. Level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Data values are presented as mean ± S.D. Ca2 + Sensitivity of Force Development in Porcine Skinned Fibers— Fig. 1A compares the pCa-force relationship in the porcine fibers exchanged with HCWTnT and reconstituted with human cardiac TnI (HCTnI)·human cardiac TnC (HCTnC) complex. As shown in Fig. 1A, porcine fibers exchanged and reconstituted with human Tn complex show a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity (ΔpCa50 = –0.14) when compared with untreated fibers. This result is consistent with what was previously observed in our laboratory (17Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This difference in Ca2+ sensitivity is due to the substitution of human Tn complex into the porcine fibers. In subsequent figures, the Ca2+ dependence of force development for both TnT-DCM mutants was compared with the Ca2+ dependence of force development of HCWTnT-treated fibers. Before TnT exchange, the Ca2+ dependence of force development was measured, and there was no statistically significant difference in Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity between the different groups of fibers used (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the Ca2+ sensitivity of fibers exchanged with TnT-ΔK210. We observed a significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50 = 5.27 ± 0.02) compared with HCWTnT-treated fibers (pCa50 = 5.39 ± 0.02). Fig. 1C shows the Ca2+ sensitivity of fibers exchanged with TnT-R141W. The TnT-R141W mutation caused a small but not statistically significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of force development when compared with HCWTnT-treated fibers. We also determined the effect on the Ca2+ dependence of force development for the TnT-K273E mutation (Fig. 1D). Because a different batch of fibers was used for this set, we had to determine the effect of HCWTnT on these porcine fibers. As with the other batch of fibers, we observed a ΔpCa50 of –0.14 in porcine fibers treated with HCWTnT. When TnT-K273E was employed to displace the endogenous troponin from porcine fibers, a leftward shift in Ca2+ sensitivity where a ΔpCa50 of +0.17 was observed. Table I summarizes the pCa50 values of the pCa-force relationship and the Hill coefficient for the fibers treated with HCWTnT and TnT mutants. There was no significant difference in the Hill coefficient (which is a measure of cooperativity) between HCWTnT and TnT mutant-treated fiber groups.Table IEffect of HCWTnT and TnT-DCM isoforms on the Ca 2+ sensitivity of force development and the Hill coefficient (nH) in skinned porcine cardiac muscle fibersHCTnT utilized in the fiberpCa50Hill coefficient (n H)No. of experiments (n)HCWTnT5.39 ± 0.021.82 ± 0.114TnT-ΔK2105.27 ± 0.02aThe pCa50 value for the TnT- ΔK210 and TnT-K273E is significantly different from HCWTnT (p < 0.01).1.74 ± 0.114TnT-R141W5.35 ± 0.031.74 ± 0.044HCWTnTbThe experiment was performed in a different batch of fibers.5.52 ± 0.022.24 ± 0.093TnT-K273EbThe experiment was performed in a different batch of fibers.5.67 ± 0.20aThe pCa50 value for the TnT- ΔK210 and TnT-K273E is significantly different from HCWTnT (p < 0.01).2.11 ± 0.23a The pCa50 value for the TnT- ΔK210 and TnT-K273E is significantly different from HCWTnT (p < 0.01).b The experiment was performed in a different batch of fibers. Open table in a new tab Ca2 + Regulation of Steady-state Force Development—In our fiber studies, we measure the force produced under relaxing conditions (pCa 8.0) as the basal force and the force produced at pCa 4.0 as 100% in a typical untreated fiber. After Tn exchange and reconstitution, 70% of the force was recovered (Fig. 2) in HCWTnT-treated fibers. As described previously, we used a different set of fibers for the TnT-K273E mutation analysis, and the HCWTnT that we used as control produced the same amount of force as the other set of fibers used for the other mutations (∼70%). Therefore, the data for the HCWTnT-displaced fibers was pooled from both sets of fibers. The TnT-R141W and TnT-K273E-treated fibers showed no change in the force recovered when compared with the HCWTnT-treated fibers. However, TnT-ΔK210-treated fibers showed a significant decrease in maximal force compared with fibers exchanged with HCWTnT (Fig. 2). Western Blot Analysis of Control, Troponin-displaced, and TnI·TnC-reconstituted Fibers—We did Western blot analysis of the control fibers (fibers treated with 1% Triton X-100), the fibers displaced with WT or mutant TnT (these fibers were not reconstituted with TnI·TnC), and fibers displaced with WT or mutant TnT and reconstituted with TnI·TnC. We checked both displacement and reconstitution for each mutant. We used double antibody staining for human cardiac TnI, and regulatory light chain (RLC) served as a loading control. Our analysis indicates that the displacement of troponin was essentially complete. Fig. 3 is a Western blot of the control, displaced and reconstituted fibers immunostained for TnI and RLC. Fig. 3, lane 2 shows a control fiber treated with 1% Triton for half an hour. The amount of TnI present in the control fiber is taken as 100%. The TnI present in TnT-displaced fiber and TnI·TnC-reconstituted fiber is stated relative to the control fiber. Fig. 3, lane 3 is a TnT-WT-displaced fiber. Densitometric analysis showed that 98% ± 5% of endogenous porcine TnI is displaced. Fig. 3, lane 4 is a TnT-R141W displaced fiber. Lane 5 is a TnT-ΔK210-displaced fiber; lane 6 is the TnT-K273E-displaced fiber. We observed 95% ± 6%, 95 ± 5% and 97 ± 4% displacement of endogenous TnI for TnT-R141W, ΔK210, and K273E, respectively. Lane 7 is the TnT-WT-displaced and TnI·TnC-reconstituted fiber. Here, we can see that after TnI·TnC treatment, the displaced TnI is readily reconstituted. Our quantification indicates that the amount of TnI reconstituted is 106% ± 5% for HCWTnT, 104 ± 6% for R141W, 105 ± 4% for ΔK210, and 108 ± 4% for K273E (data not shown). ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were carried out in the presence and absence of Ca2+ to investigate the activation and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows inhibition and Fig. 5 shows activation of ATPase activity. The myosin ATPase activity in the absence of HCTn was considered as the basal activity (0% inhibition). The inhibition of ATPase activity was found to be similar for Tn complexes containing HCWTnT or TnT mutants R141W, ΔK210, and K273E. At 2-μm Tn concentration, the Tn complex containing HCWTnT and DCM mutants was able to inhibit the ATPase activity to a similar extent (∼85% inhibition for all four proteins investigated). At 1 μm, TnT-R141W inhibits slightly better than HCWTnT (61% ± 6% for HCWTnT versus 70% ± 2% for TnT-R141W). However, this difference in inhibition was not found to be statistically significant by Student's t test. As shown in Fig. 5, the bar chart compares the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ between HCWTnT and TnT mutants. The experiment was performed by varying the Tn concentration such that the final concentrations were 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 μm. At Tn concentrations above 1 μm, the maximum ATPase activity did not increase further and plateaued. The ATPase activity in the absence of Tn was considered to be the basal activity or 100% activity in this assay. As shown in Fig. 5, TnT-DCM mutants showed a decrease in ATPase activity compared with HCWTnT. The ATPase activity of HCWTnT was 159% ± 9%, whereas the TnT-R141W mutant was 134% ± 5% (p <0.05) and TnT-ΔK210 was 102% ± 3% (p < 0.001). At 1-μm Tn concentration, the TnT-K273E mutant had a maximal activity of 168% + 8%, which was not significantly different from the HCWTnT. The asterisk in Fig. 5 indicates the statistical significance of the activation of the ATPase activity.Fig. 5Regulation of actomyosin ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2 +. The effect of HCWTnT and TnT mutants on the activation of actomyosin ATPase activity is measured by varying troponin concentrations; the effect at 1 μm Tn, the concentration of Tn that gave the maximal activity, is shown in the figure. The assay conditions are as follows. 3.5 μm actin, 1 μm Tm, 0 and 1 μm Tn, and 0.6 μm myosin were di"

The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin supports multiple protein interactions, including binding of β-catenin at the C terminus and of p120 ctn to the juxtamembrane domain. The temporal assembly and polarized trafficking of the complex or its individual components to the basolateral membrane are not fully understood. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells at steady state and after treatment with cycloheximide or temperature blocks, E-cadherin and β-catenin localized to the Golgi complex, but p120 ctn was found only at the basolateral plasma membrane. We previously identified a dileucine sorting motif (Leu586-Leu587, termed S1) in the juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin and now show that it is required to target full-length E-cadherin to the basolateral membrane. Removal of S1 resulted in missorting of E-cadherin mutants (EcadΔS1) to the apical membrane; β-catenin was simultaneously missorted and appeared at the apical membrane. p120 ctn was not mistargeted with EcadΔS1, but could be recruited to the E-cadherin-catenin complex only at the basolateral membrane. These findings help define the temporal assembly and sorting of the E-cadherin-catenin complex and show that membrane recruitment of p120 ctn in polarized cells is contextual and confined to the basolateral membrane.

Classical cadherins are part of a family of cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion in most solid tissues of the mammalian body (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 2Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied and prototypical member of the family is E-cadherin, which is required for the establishment and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity in epithelia and has key roles in tissue morphogenesis and tumorigenesis (3Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 4Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J.

E-cadherin is a single transmembrane-spanning protein that functions in adhesion as a multiprotein complex. The extracellular domain of E-cadherin binds in a homophilic Ca2+-dependent fashion to juxtaposed E-cadherin molecules on adjacent cells. In addition, β-catenin or plakoglobin binds with high affinity to the C terminus of E-cadherin, and α-catenin binds indirectly via β-catenin to link the complex to the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Ref. 6Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A number of other cytoplasmic proteins, including Hakai (7Fujita Y. Krause G.

In addition to their roles in cell-cell adhesion, members of the catenin family are also involved in cell signaling and cell dynamics. Notably, β-catenin can alternately act as a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 10Ben-Ze'ev A. Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). p120 ctn is an Armadillo repeat protein originally identified as Src kinase substrate (11Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p120 ctn can interact with a number of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases at the plasma membrane or translocate to the nucleus, suggesting a role in regulating cell-cell adhesion and gene expression (12Keilhack H.

Although a series of studies have elucidated roles for p120 ctn in stabilizing and regulating the adhesive properties of cadherins, it has not yet been established when and where p120 ctn and E-cadherin interact. The p120 ctn -binding site has been mapped to a core region of 15 amino acids in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) 1The abbreviations used are: JMD, juxtamembrane domain; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ecad, E-cadherin.1The abbreviations used are: JMD, juxtamembrane domain; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ecad, E-cadherin. of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail (16Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z.

Delivery of E-cadherin to the basolateral surface and its incorporation into adherens junctions are key events in cell polarization and tissue morphogenesis. E-cadherin itself, or as a presumptive complex, has to be sorted and targeted to the basolateral membrane in polarized cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that β-catenin binds with high affinity to E-cadherin early in the biosynthetic pathway (17Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) at a core distal region of 30 amino acids (18Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Further evidence suggested that this cadherin-catenin pair first forms at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (19Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). E-cadherin and β-catenin are therefore structurally and functionally linked from the outset. The temporal sequence for assembly of other components of the complex is currently less clear. Several reports show that α-catenin with its attendant actin does not interact until the complex is delivered to the plasma membrane (17Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J.

A recent study now reinvigorates the issue of cadherin-catenin complex assembly by suggesting that N-cadherin binds early to p120 ctn and at a later stage to β-catenin (20Wahl III, J.K. Kim Y.J.

Recently, we described a dileucine targeting signal required for the sorting and polarized trafficking of E-cadherin chimeras to the basolateral surface in epithelial cells (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A chimeric Tac/E-cadherin reporter molecule is sorted by utilizing the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin for basolateral trafficking. Mutation of the so-called S1 motif in the tail results in missorting and delivery to the apical membrane (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have now gone on to explore the sorting function of the S1 motif in the context of full-length E-cadherin. Dileucine motifs are commonly found as basolateral or sometimes endocytic sorting signals (22Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mechanically, they bind to adaptor subunits such as β-adaptin at the level of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to sort proteins during polarized trafficking (23Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the S1 motif and the p120 ctn -binding site in the JMD of E-cadherin prompted us to jointly investigate sorting, polarized trafficking, and the temporal binding of p120 ctn based on the assumption that steric hindrance might possibly preclude simultaneous binding of a putative sorting adaptor and p120 ctn. The results presented herein suggest that the assembly and sorting of E-cadherin with catenins are indeed orchestrated in both time and space. Cell Culture—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (strain II) were grown and passaged as described previously (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L.

For experiments, cells were plated at subconfluent density on glass coverslips or at confluent density on semipermeable polycarbonate filters (Transwell, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and maintained for 1–3 days before being used. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown and passaged in Ham's F-12 medium with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and dishes and maintained for 2–3 days before being used. In some experiments, cells were incubated in medium containing 10 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) to prevent protein synthesis and to deplete proteins from the biosynthetic pathway. Some cells were incubated in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) at either 18 or 20 °C for 3 h prior to use. The 18 °C temperature block accumulates proteins in early or recycling endosomes (24Galloway C.J. Dean G.E. Fuchs R. Mellman I. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The 20 °C temperature block prevents exit of proteins from the TGN, causing accumulation of proteins within the Golgi complex (25de Curtis I. Howell K.E. Simons K. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibody HECD1 (provided by Dr. M. Takeichi, Kyoto University) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of human E-cadherin (provided by R. G. Ali, S. Verma, and A. S. Y., University of Queensland) were used to detect human E-cadherin. A mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes dog E-cadherin (3B8, obtained from Dr. W. Gallin, University of Alberta) was used in experiments using MDCK cells. Other primary antibodies used were a mouse anti-human p120 ctn monoclonal antibody and an anti-p230 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against β-catenin (Sigma) and green fluorescent protein (GFP; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Secondary antibodies used included Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amrad, Victoria, Australia). Alexa-488 and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin were used to stain F-actin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Vector Construction—The molecular cloning techniques used were from Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J.

A human E-cadherin cDNA in the pcDNA3 expression vector has been described previously (27Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M. Gumbiner B. Cossart P.

The ΔS1 dileucine mutant E-cadherin was created by replacing the extracellular and transmembrane regions of pCMV-Tac/Ecad-(578–728)ΔS1 (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J.

The extracellular and transmembrane regions of E-cadherin were amplified by PCR with specific primers from pcDNA-Ecad-GFP (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers contained restriction endonuclease sites allowing generation of in-frame fusions with the dileucine-mutated cytoplasmic domain present in pCMV-Tac/Ecad-(578–728)ΔS1. Cloning the PCR product into pCMV-Tac/Ecad-(578–728)ΔS1 using NheI and HindIII sites generated pCMV-EcadΔS1, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The EcadΔS1 cDNA was then subcloned into the pcDNA vector, which carries the G418 (Geneticin) resistance gene. pcDNA-Ecad-GFP (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S.

This ΔS1 fragment was then ligated into the KpnI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA-Ecad-GFP plasmid, creating pcDNA-EcadΔS1. Next, a GFP tag was fused to the cytoplasmic tail of pCMV-EcadΔS1. pcDNA-Ecad-GFP was digested with SgrA1 and XbaI, releasing GFP cDNA. This was cloned into pCMV-EcadΔS1 digested with the same enzymes, creating pCMV-EcadΔS1-GFP. The p120GFP plasmid (GFP-tagged p120 ctn ; pEGFP-C1/mctn1A) (28Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M.

Vector Transfection and Expression—MDCK or CHO cells were plated at subconfluent density 24 h before transfection. The LipofectAMINE™ Plus system in combination with Opti-MEM (both from Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were typically used 24–48 h later, in some cases after reseeding on filters at confluent density. Stably expressing cell lines were generated as described previously (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T.

Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on filters or glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and stained as described previously (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed using an Olympus Provis AX-70 microscope, and images were captured on a CCD300ET-RCX camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) using NIH Image software or a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) mounted on a Nikon E600 microscope. All confocal hardware was driven by a workstation running LaserSharp 2000 imaging software (Bio-Rad). Images were collected using a ×60 objective (numerical aperture of 1.4), giving an optimal section depth of 0.6 μm. Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were excited using a 543-nm helium/neon laser, whereas Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibodies were excited with a 488-nm argon laser. Post-capture image analysis and processing of confocal image stacks were performed using the LaserVox software package (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were solubilized in cold precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) on ice and extracted for 30 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, extracts were precleared with protein G or protein A for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-human E-cadherin antibody complexed to Ultralink-immobilized protein G (Pierce) or anti-GFP antibody complexed to protein A (Pierce) for 2 h. Precipitates were recovered by centrifugation and then washed several times with cold precipitation buffer and with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) prior to solubilization in concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with Supersignal West Pico (Pierce) as described previously (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J.

E-cadherin Complexes with β-Catenin and p120ctn at the Lateral Plasma Membrane in MDCK Cells—E-cadherin, β-catenin, and p120 ctn are known members of cadherin-catenin complexes at adherens junctions in polarized epithelia (6Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy of MDCK cell monolayers confirmed the colocation of all three molecules on lateral cell membranes in these cells (Fig. 1A). Antibodies to E-cadherin co-immunoprecipitated both β-catenin and p120 ctn (Fig. 1B), confirming that, at steady state, all three proteins form a stable complex at adherens junctions. E-cadherin-GFP and β-Catenin, but Not p120ctn, Are Found on Intracellular Membranes—In MDCK cells, transiently expressed GFP-tagged E-cadherin (Ecad-GFP) (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) produced the same staining pattern as endogenous E-cadherin; it was found predominantly at the basolateral membrane, and newly synthesized Ecad-GFP was also seen in a perinuclear Golgi compartment (Fig. 2A). Co-localization with the TGN marker p230 (29Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed the Golgi localization of the intracellular pool of Ecad-GFP. Both endogenous β-catenin and p120 ctn co-localized with Ecad-GFP at the basolateral cell surface (Fig. 2A). Costaining of β-catenin with Ecad-GFP also occurred at the level of the Golgi complex, consistent with previous studies showing that β-catenin associates with E-cadherin early in the biosynthetic pathway (19Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast, we noted that p120 ctn staining was not seen in the region of the Golgi complex (Fig. 2A). To rule out the possibility that p120 ctn was not detected at intracellular sites because of epitope masking or any deficiencies of the immunolabeling process, we performed experiments on cells overexpressing p120GFP (28Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In confluent cells, p120GFP localized to the lateral plasma membrane; it was not on intracellular membranes and appeared as faint diffuse staining only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Endogenous E-cadherin co-localized with p120GFP at the lateral membrane; however, there was no co-staining of p120GFP on intracellular membranes. Notably, p120GFP-transfected cells showed increased E-cadherin staining on lateral membranes, an observation consistent with the demonstration that increased p120 ctn levels lead to increased stabilization of E-cadherin at the cell surface (30Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, in MDCK cells at steady state, β-catenin and Ecad-GFP appear together in the Golgi complex, but p120 ctn is found with Ecad-GFP only at the plasma membrane. To further investigate whether endogenous p120 ctn staining ever appears in the biosynthetic pathway, we treated cells with cycloheximide to deplete all newly synthesized proteins from the biosynthetic pathway and then analyzed staining patterns after washout of the drug, when newly synthesized proteins reappear inside cells (Fig. 3A). Immediately after incubation with cycloheximide, there was a significant decrease in E-cadherin plasma membrane staining and a complete disappearance of any intracellular staining; the cells also became flattened and more irregular in shape (Fig. 3A, 0hr). This corresponded to diminished p120 ctn plasma membrane staining and increased cytoplasmic staining. Two hours after washout of the cycloheximide, E-cadherin staining reappeared in the Golgi complex as determined by co-localization with β-COP (data not shown). By 4 h, there was prominent Golgi and vesicular staining, representing E-cadherin accumulation in secretory or endocytic compartments (Fig. 3A, 2hr and 4hr). Throughout this recovery, staining of E-cadherin on the plasma membrane also increased steadily, as did staining of p120 ctn , which increased on the plasma membrane while decreasing in the cytoplasm. At no time did p120 ctn staining appear on intracellular membranes other than on the plasma membrane. These results suggest that p120 ctn does not appear in biosynthetic compartments on its way to the cell surface, whereas E-cadherin complexes can be stained in transit through the Golgi complex and secretory pathway. The staining in these cells suggests that p120 ctn is translocated directly to the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm. As another approach to investigate whether p120 ctn can be found on intracellular compartments, we used temperature blocks to accumulate E-cadherin in the TGN or in endosomes. Cells subjected to a 20 °C temperature block for 3 h typically accumulate newly synthesized proteins in the TGN (25de Curtis I. Howell K.E. Simons K. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, E-cadherin staining of the perinuclear Golgi region was increased in cells incubated at 20 °C (Fig. 3B). Under the same conditions, there was no staining of p120 ctn in the perinuclear area. We have previously shown that recycling surface E-cadherin is accumulated in endosomes in cells treated with cycloheximide (to deplete biosynthetic proteins) and then incubated at 18 °C for 3 h (31Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in enhanced vesicular endosomal staining of E-cadherin, but not of p120 ctn (Fig. 3B). This staining provides further evidence to suggest that p120 ctn does not co-accumulate with endogenous E-cadherin complexes in the biosynthetic pathway or in endosomes. In all of these experiments in polarized cells, the only membrane domain that p120 ctn localized to was the lateral plasma membrane, regardless of the presence of E-cadherin complexes on other membranes. Cadherin Binding and Membrane Recruitment of p120ctn— The association of the E-cadherin complex with p120 ctn was then investigated using transfected cells expressing Ecad-GFP and a targeting mutant of E-cadherin. We have previously identified the dileucine motif (S1) as a basolateral sorting signal required for targeting of an E-cadherin chimera, Tac/Ecad- (574–724)ΔS1, consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Tac (interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit) fused to the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This S1 mutation (Leu586-Leu587 mutated to alanines) was now introduced into full-length human E-cadherin cDNA, creating EcadΔS1, and into GFP-tagged E-cadherin, creating EcadΔS1-GFP (Fig. 4A), which were used to probe the sorting of E-cadherin and its association with catenins; this is also of interest since the S1 motif is closely adjacent (within 15 amino acids) to the p120 ctn -binding site in the JMD of E-cadherin (16Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). CHO cells endogenously express p120 ctn , but not E-cadherin (32Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Transient expression of Ecad-GFP or E-cadherin in CHO cells produced plasma membrane staining and resulted in the recruitment of p120 ctn and the expression and recruitment of β-catenin to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). Transient expression of ΔS1 targeting mutants in the context of full-length E-cadherin (EcadΔS1-GFP) or a chimera (Tac/EcadΔS1) (data not shown) also successfully recruited p120 ctn and β-catenin to the plasma membrane, showing that both catenins can interact successfully with the targeting mutants. Immunoprecipitation was used to demonstrate directly that p120 ctn can bind to the tail of both wild-type Ecad-GFP and EcadΔS1-GFP (Fig. 4C). An anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate protein complexes from extracts of cells transfected with GFP alone, with Ecad-GFP, or with EcadΔS1-GFP. p120 ctn coprecipitated efficiently with both human Ecad-GFP and EcadΔS1-GFP. Thus, mutation of the S1 motif does not affect the binding of p120 ctn to the E-cadherin tail, providing further definition of the E-cadherin p120 ctn -binding site and allowing for speculation about the nature of interactions between E-cadherin and sorting adaptors or p120 ctn . Targeting of E-cadherin and ΔS1 Mutants in Polarized Cells—To study a possible relationship between sorting and p120 ctn binding, we constructed and expressed full-length E-cadherin with the ΔS1 mutation. Overexpressed E-cadherin is faithfully sorted and targeted to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells. This is shown here in cells overexpressing untagged human E-cadherin, which could be detected with a human-specific antibody (Fig. 5), but is also true of Ecad-GFP (21Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, EcadΔS1-GFP or EcadΔS1 expressed in polarized MDCK cells was mistargeted and could be stained on both the apical and basolateral membrane domains (Fig. 5). Missorting of these ΔS1 mutants is not a result of excessive overexpression, as wild-type E-cadherin expressed at similar or higher levels was not missorted. These results suggest that the S1 dileucine motif operates as a basolateral sorting determinant in full-length E-cadherin. E-cadherin molecules can dynamically form dimers (33Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996;"
https://openalex.org/W1997028288,"IFI16 is a member of the HIN-200 family (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeats) that contains a DNA binding domain, a transcriptional regulatory domain, and DAPIN/PAAD, a protein domain associated with interferon response. It can function as a transcription repressor and directly binds p53. Although the structural and biochemical properties of IFI16 are known, the physiological relevance of these properties in the cellular context is still elusive. Here we report that the inhibition of endogenous IFI16 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) induces p21Waf1 mRNA and protein expression through p53 but does not induce pro-apoptotic p53 target genes. This rapid induction of p21 was wild-type p53-dependent and resulted in cell cycle arrest along with a marked reduction of phosphorylated Rb in normally growing cells. We also showed that the repression of IFI16 affects p53 transcriptional activity at the p21 promoter as well as the protein stability of p53 and p21. Our findings identified a new role for IFI16 in modulating p53 function and its target gene regulation in the control of cell cycle regulation.

IFI16 is a human member of the HIN-200 1The abbreviations used are: HIN-200, hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeats; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild-type; Ab, antibody; Rb, retinoblastoma; CHX, cycloheximide.1The abbreviations used are: HIN-200, hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeats; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild-type; Ab, antibody; Rb, retinoblastoma; CHX, cycloheximide. family of interferon-inducible proteins (11Johnstone R.W. Kershaw M.H. Trapani J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11924-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Members of the HIN-200 family are characteristically induced by interferons and distinctly contain one or more of a conserved 200-amino acid motif. IFI16 was first detected in lymphoid cells (12Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M.J. Ramsay R.G. Eddy R.L. Show T.B. White P.C. Dupont B. Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but since then, through immunohistochemical staining of different tissues, it was found to be expressed at high levels in highly proliferating cells of various cell types (13Wei W.

Commun. 1995; 214: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are characteristics attributed to transcription factors. IFI16 can function as a transcription repressor and contains a separate DNA binding domain and a transcriptional regulatory domain (17Johnstone R.W. Kerry J.A. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17172-17177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). IFI16 also contains DAPIN/PAAD (domain in apoptosis and interferon response/pyrin AIM ASC and death domain-like), protein domain associated with apoptosis and interferon response (18Staub E. Dahl E. Rosenthal A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 83-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Pawlowski K. Pio F. Chu Z. Reed J.C. Godzik A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 85-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and it directly binds p53 at its first 200-amino acid repeat region (20Johnstone R.W. Wei W. Greenway A. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6033-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the structural and biochemical properties of IF16 are known, the physiological relevance of these properties in the cellular context is not known. However, from the biochemical properties of IFI16, its nuclear localization and ability to bind DNA as well as the expression of IFI16 in transcriptionally active cells with a nucleoli (16Dawson M.J. Trapani J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it has been predicted that IFI16 may be a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of cell differentiation (11Johnstone R.W. Kershaw M.H. Trapani J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11924-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In light of a recent expression pattern study that detected high levels of IFI16 in various tissue types (i.e. tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, digestive organs, reproductive organs, excretory organs) of high proliferative potential (specifically the epithelial lining tissue of many of these organs), it appears that IFI16 is not simply an interferon-response gene (13Wei W. Clarke C.J. Somers G.R. Cresswell K.S. Loveland K.A. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that it is likely to be involved in the broader pathway of general cell differentiation and/or cell cycle regulation in the cell. In this study, we have found that IFI16 transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of p21 through wild-type p53. We show that the knock-down of endogenous IFI16 protein levels by RNA interference in p53 wild-type cells results in significantly increased expression of p21, which leads to decreased S phase and cell cycle arrest only in a wt-p53-dependent manner. We also show that IFI16-regulated p21 expression is transcriptionally mediated through increased p53 binding to the p21 promoter at the p53 responsive element. Moreover, the inhibition of IFI16 resulted in increased stabilization of both the p53 and p21 protein in the cell. These data demonstrate a functional role of IFI16 as a novel regulatory element in p53-mediated cell cycle regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—U2OS and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C.siRNA Experiment—The following IFI16 siRNA sequence was generated by this laboratory and purchased through Dharmacon: 5′-GCUGGUCCUAACCAAACGUdTdT-3′ (IFI16 nucleotides 1106–1126. U2OS cells were seeded at 30% density the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Cells were trypsinized, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and then fixed with ice-cold 80% ethanol and precipitated overnight at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were resuspended in room temperature phosphate-buffered saline and treated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then analyzed using FACScan (BD Biosciences).Reporter Assays—U2OS and 293T cells were seeded at 90% confluency the day before transfection. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to transfect the cells. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase assay was performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and measured using a DLReady luminometer (Turner Designs).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NA4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). An equal amount of total cellular protein per sample (15 μg) was run on a SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting analysis: anti-IFI16 antibody (1G7 monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 antibody (Ab-1, Ab-6 monoclonal, Oncogene), anti-p21 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene), anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, Sigma), anti-Bax antibody (N-20 polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-MDM2 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene), anti-PUMA (bbc3, ProSci Inc.), anti-pRb (G99–549, BD Biosciences), anti-ppRb (G3–245, BD Biosciences) and anti-Noxa (Ab-1 monoclonal, Oncogene). The following antibody was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation: anti-p53 antibody (FL393 polyclonal, Santa Cruz).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted, denatured, and run on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled probes prepared with RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—U2OS cells were seeded in p100 dishes at 40% density the day before siRNA transfection. At 72 h after transfection, cells were formaldehyde cross-linked, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Up-state) with the following specifications/modifications. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight using 1 μg of anti-p53 FL393 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). The PCR reaction contained 3 μl of immunoprecipitation sample, or 3 μl of input sample, and 50 ng of each primer (5′-TGAAAGCTGACTGCCCCTAT-3′, 5′-CTCCTACCATCCCCTTCCTC-3′), and 45 μl of PCR Supermix High Fidelity (Invitrogen). After 35 cycles of amplification, the PCR product was run on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV light. Signal intensity was quantitated with ImageQuant version 3.3 (Amersham Biosciences).Cycloheximide Chase—A stock concentration of 25 mg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO. U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 40% density the day before siRNA transfection. At 72 h after transfection, CHX was added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Cells were lysed for Western blot analysis at the appropriate time points, and signal intensity was quantitated with ImageQuant v3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). The use of CHX for p21 and p53 stabilization assay has been described previously (21Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).RESULTSDecrease of IFI16 Leads to Increased p21 Expression and Cell Cycle Arrest—To determine the functional role of IFI16 in p53 regulation as well as in cell growth, we used IFI16 siRNA to knock down IFI16 expression in U2OS cells, which endogenously express both IFI16 and wt-p53. We detected a high level of endogenous IFI16 expression in U2OS cells. A 21-nucleotide siRNA was made against the IFI16 mRNA transcript. IFI16 can be detected as three isoforms resulting from differential mRNA splicing of the exon 7 region, and the isoforms are known to homo- and heterodimerize at the dimerization domain located in the amino terminus (11Johnstone R.W. Kershaw M.H. Trapani J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11924-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the siRNA was directed to a region of the mRNA above the splice region to target all three isoforms. U2OS cells were transfected with IFI16 siRNA, and the expression level of p53 and its downstream target genes was examined. The decrease of endogenous IFI16 over time resulted in a marked increase of p53 expression but an even greater induction of the p53 downstream target gene, p21 (Fig. 1A). In an effort to determine whether p21 induction mediated by the inhibition of IFI16 requires a functionally active p53, p53-null Saos2 cells, which express endogenous IFI16, were co-transfected with wt-p53 or vector alone and IFI16 siRNA or control siRNA (firefly luciferase). Whereas vector alone did not have an effect on p21 expression with or without IFI16 siRNA, wt-p53 expression induced p21 levels, and the suppression of IFI16 significantly enhanced this p53 induction of p21 (Fig. 1B).To assess the physiological response of the cell to the induction of p21 resulting from the decrease of IFI16, cell cycle analysis by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the decrease in endogenous IFI16 resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M stages with an ∼20% decrease in S phase. An important regulator in the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle is the tumor suppressor Rb. Rb binds to the E2F transcription factor and prevents E2F from turning on S phase genes in the progression from G1 to S phase (8Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar, 22Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) inactivates Rb and causes it to release E2F. p21 inhibits Cdk2 and Cdk4 from phosphorylating Rb (8Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar, 9Fang L. Igarashi M. Leung J. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of increased p21 expression because of IFI16 inhibition in the regulation of the cell cycle, we examined the phosphorylation state of Rb. It was observed that the effect of IFI16 reduction on the induction of p21 resulted in the decrease of Rb phosphorylation, which explained the decrease in S phase of IFI16 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that IFI16 negatively affects p21 expression level.Fig. 2Effect of reduced IFI16 expression on cell cycle distribution. A, effect of inhibition of IFI16 expression on the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter showed an ∼20% decrease of S phase in IFI16 siRNA-transfected U2OS cells compared with control siRNA-treated cells. B, effect of repressed IFI16 on Rb. Cell lysates of U2OS cells treated with either control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against phosphorylated Rb (ppRB), underphosphorylated Rb (pRb), and p21.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Elevated p21 Levels in IFI16 Knock-down Cells Are Transcriptionally Regulated—We demonstrated that IFI16 inhibition causes a significant increase in p21 protein levels as well as a minor increase of p53. Next, we examined whether p21 is transcriptionally up-regulated upon the inhibition of IFI16. First, we performed Northern blot analysis to determine the effect of IFI16 inhibition on p21 mRNA (Fig. 3). In U2OS cells with targeted degradation of IFI16 mRNA by RNA interference, there was a corresponding increase in p21 mRNA level; however, when both p53 siRNA and IFI16 siRNA were transfected, no p21 mRNA increase was detected. These data further indicate that the regulation of p21 by IFI16 is a p53-dependent process.Fig. 3Increased p21 mRNA induction following IFI16 siRNA treatment is dependent on the presence of p53. Total RNA isolated from U2OS cells 72 h after treatment with either control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA and p53 siRNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Note that reduced IFI16 levels did not result in an increase in p21 in the absence of p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the potential mechanism by which IFI16 affects p21 expression through p53, the effect of IFI16 on p21 transcription was examined with transcriptional reporter assays using the full-length p21 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter (pGL-p21). Previous studies showed that IFI16 contains a transcriptional regulatory domain in the N terminus and demonstrates transcriptional repressor function (17Johnstone R.W. Kerry J.A. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17172-17177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). U2OS cells, which endogenously express both IFI16 and p53, were co-transfected with pGL-p21 promoter construct and IFI16 siRNA (Fig. 4A). In the presence of IFI16 siRNA, there was an ∼2-fold increase in p21 promoter activity as compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. We also tested to determine whether ectopic expression of IFI16 had any effect on p21 promoter activity. 293T cells that do not endogenously express IFI16 or functional p53 were co-transfected with PGL-p21 and wt-p53 and/or IFI16B, the most abundant isoform of IFI16 (11Johnstone R.W. Kershaw M.H. Trapani J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11924-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IFI16B alone did not affect p21 promoter activity, but when it was expressed in the presence of p53, a reduction in p21 promoter activity compared with the induction of p21 by p53 alone was noted (Fig. 4B); however, this IFI16-mediated decrease did not fully abolish p21 transcriptional activity by p53. These results indicate that IFI16 can affect p21 expression at the transcriptional level in the presence of p53.Fig. 4Effect of IFI16 on the transcriptional activity of the p21 promoter. A, suppression of endogenous IFI16 expression by IFI16 siRNA in U2OS cells results in increased p21 promoter activity. U2OS cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing the full-length p21 promoter, pGL-p21 promoter, and either control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA and then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity 48 h after transfection. Control cells were co-transfected with an empty luciferase reporter vector, pGL-Basic, and either control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA. B, co-transfection of p53 and IFI16B decreases p53-mediated p21 transcriptional activity. 293T cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector containing the full-length p21 promoter, pGL-p21 promoter, and with pcDNA3-p53 and/or pcDNA3-IFI16B and then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity 48 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further support that IFI16 regulates p21 transcription in relation to p53, IFI16 siRNA-treated U2OS cells were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the effect of IFI16 on p53 binding at the p21 promoter, specifically at the p53-responsive element. Because p21 is a major downstream target gene of p53 and the p21 promoter contains a p53 responsive element (10el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7892) Google Scholar), we predicted that IFI16 may affect p53 binding at the p21 promoter. After cross-linking protein and DNA with formaldehyde fixation, cell lysates from IFI16 siRNA-transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with p53 antibody. The precipitated DNA fragments were amplified with primers flanking a 415-base pair region containing the p53-responsive element of the p21 promoter (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, ChIP showed that IFI16 siRNA-transfected samples resulted in an ∼50% increase in p53 binding at the p21 promoter. We confirmed p21 induction by IFI16 inhibition using Western blot analysis prior to ChIP assay (Fig. 5A). Together, these data indicate that IFI16 regulates p21 expression at the transcriptional level by affecting the ability of p53 to bind the p21 promoter at the p53 responsive element.Fig. 5Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of p53 binding interaction at the p21 promoter after inhibition of IFI16 by siRNA. A, U2OS cells show higher p53 binding affinity to the p21 promoter after IFI16 siRNA treatment. U2OS cells were treated with either control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA for 72 h, and then a ChIP assay was performed using a p53 antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR. Data were quantitated using ImageQuant v3.3 (Amersham Biosciences) to calculate signal intensities of the PCR products for the immunoprecipitation (IP) samples and the corresponding input samples. To compare the signal intensities for the IFI16 siRNA-transfected samples and the control siRNA-treated samples, data were normalized by dividing the immunoprecipitation (IP) signal intensity by its corresponding input signal intensity. B, a map showing the location of the primers on the p21 promoter. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers that amplified a 415-bp region of the p21 promoter, which encompasses a p53-responsive element. C, Western blot analysis of IFI16 siRNA-treated U2OS cells before the ChIP assay showed that a decrease in IFI16 protein level correlates to an increase in p21 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of IFI16 on the Protein Stability of p21 and p53—Next, we explored the possibility that IFI16 inhibition affected p21 protein accumulation by increasing stability because the transcriptional regulation of p21 in response to IFI16 inhibition could not completely account for the induction of the p21 protein. To address this issue, we examined the protein level by a CHX chase to assess protein stability. At 72 h after IFI16 siRNA transfection, cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. Then the steady-state levels of the proteins, p21, p53, mdm2, and PUMA, in U2OS cells were determined at the given time points after the addition of CHX. In control U2OS cells transfected with luciferase siRNA, the half-life of p21 was about 60 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Importantly, the half-life of p21 was significantly increased to ∼3hin IFI16-inhibited cells transfected with IFI16 siRNA (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, inhibition of IFI16 increased the stability of p53 and its target, Mdm2, to lesser extents (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, the stability of PUMA, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (23Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), was not greatly influenced in IFI16-inhibited cells (Fig. 6A). The above results indicate that, in addition to transcriptionally regulating p21, IFI16 also regulates p21 by affecting p21 protein stability.Fig. 6Effect of inhibition of IFI16 on p53 and p21 stability. A, reduction of endogenous IFI16 protein level by IFI16 siRNA in U2OS cells resulted in increased protein stability of p53 and p21. U2OS cells were transfected with control siRNA or IFI16 siRNA, and then 72 h after siRNA transfection, cells were chased with CHX (25 μg/ml) to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. At the indicated times after the addition of CHX, the levels of the p53, p21, and MDM2 proteins were analyzed at the indicated time points by cell lysis followed by Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibodies. The data from the CHX chase were quantitated and plotted. The p53 protein levels (B) and p21 protein levels (C) with IFI16 siRNA treatment at the indicated time points after the addition of CHX were quantitated using ImageQuant version 3.3 (Amersham Biosciences) and plotted against protein levels of p53 and p21 protein in U2OS cells treated with control siRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe structural and biochemical aspects of IFI16 have been established, but the functional relevance of IFI16 in the cellular context is still unclear.

The rate of Kv3.3 inactivation has, however, been difficult to establish given problems in obtaining consistent rates of inactivation in expression systems. This study characterized the properties of AptKv3.3, the teleost homologue of Kv3.3, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. We show that the properties of AptKv3.3 differ significantly between CHO and HEK cells, with the largest difference occurring in the rate and voltage dependence of inactivation. While AptKv3.3 in CHO cells showed a fast and voltage-dependent rate of inactivation consistent with N-type inactivation, currents in HEK cells showed rates of inactivation that were voltage-independent and more consistent with a slower C-type inactivation. Examination of the mRNA sequence revealed that the first methionine start site had a weak Kozak consensus sequence, suggesting that the lack of inactivation in HEK cells could be due to translation at a second methionine start site downstream of the NH2-terminal coding region. Mutating the nucleotide sequence surrounding the first methionine start site to one more closely resembling a Kozak consensus sequence produced currents that inactivated with a fast and voltage-dependent rate of inactivation in both CHO and HEK cells. These results indicate that under the appropriate conditions Kv3.3 channels can exhibit fast and reliable inactivation that approaches that more typically expected of “A”-type K+ currents.

Within the Kv1–4 families, fast inactivating K+ channels include Kv1.4, 3.4, and all three members of the Kv4 family, while an intermediate rate of inactivation has been reported for Kv3.3 (9Vega-Saenz de Miera E.

The voltage dependence and rate of inactivation of these channel subtypes are critical to determining their contribution to neuronal excitability. The inactivation properties of Kv1.4, Kv3.4, and Kv4.1–4.3 have all been well characterized in mammalian heterologous systems (12Hashimoto Y. Nunoki K. Kudo H. Ishii K. Taira N. Yanagisawa T. J.

Kentros C. Rudy B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and more recently in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEK, human embryonic kidney; UTR, untranslated region; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TEA, tetraethylammonium; S, siemens; IRES, internal ribosome entry site.1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEK, human embryonic kidney; UTR, untranslated region; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TEA, tetraethylammonium; S, siemens; IRES, internal ribosome entry site. cells (10Rae J.L. Shepard A.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), obtaining consistent inactivation of rat Kv3.3 has been difficult in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell expression system (16Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Understanding the kinetic properties of Kv3.3 channels is important as this channel can be densely distributed over dendritic membranes of both principal cells and interneurons (17Rashid A.J. Dunn R.J. Turner R.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 441: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a reduction in the contribution of these channels to dendritic spike repolarization has been shown to augment burst discharge in an electrosensory neuron (18Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of inactivation of Kv3.3 channels may even contribute to a dynamic modulation of dendritic refractory period during repetitive activity that underlies burst discharge (19Noonan L. Doiron B. Laing C. Longtin A. Turner R.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported on some of the properties of teleost Kv3.3 channels (AptKv3.3) when expressed in tSA201 HEK cells and recorded in the outside-out patch configuration (18Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as reported by others (16Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the inactivation rate of Kv3.3 whole-cell currents in HEK cells often showed little or no inactivation during 100-ms step commands. The present study examined the kinetic properties of whole-cell currents of AptKv3.3 channels expressed in CHO and HEK cells. We find that AptKv3.3 cDNA gives rise to a fast inactivating whole-cell current in CHO but not HEK cells. By mutating nucleotides upstream of the first start site to one more closely resembling the optimal Kozak consensus sequence, both CHO and HEK cells express fast inactivating AptKv3.3 current. Under these conditions AptKv3.3 currents are capable of inactivating at rates that are close to that reported for even the fast inactivating mammalian Kv3.4. Molecular Biology—Primers used to amplify the full coding region of AptKv3.3, including 10 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), have been described previously (18Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the same AptKv3.3 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using XhoI and XbaI restriction sites present in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. To generate an AptKv3.3 expression construct in which the Kozak sequence around the initiation methionine was altered (AptKv3.3Koz), a fragment of cDNA encompassing nucleotides –6 to 628 of AptKv3.3 was PCR amplified from an AptKv3.3 expression construct. The following primers were used: forward, 5′ (CAC TCG AGC CGC CAT GCT CAG TTC CGT GTG TG); reverse, 5′ (TAG CGG GCA TAT TTA GAG GAG TAG). The forward primer contained the altered sequence GCC GCC preceding the methionine codon and an XhoI at the 5′ end for subcloning. The PCR fragment encompassed an ApaI restriction site normally present in AptKv3.3 cDNA at position 590. After amplification, the PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and ApaI restriction enzymes and substituted for the XhoI-ApaI fragment present in the original AptKv3.3 expression vector. The presence of the altered Kozak sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amino-terminal truncated AptKv3.3 cDNA was prepared by replacement of the cDNA encoding amino acids 1–27 with the coding sequence of enhanced GFP in the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Sequences for mouse, rat, and human Kv3.3 and Kv3.4 sequences were obtained from the GenBank™ data base. Accession numbers are as follows: AptKv3.3 (AF308934), rKv3.3a, rKv3.3b, rKv3.3c, and rKv3.3d (rKv3.3a, M84210; rKv3.3b, M84211; rKv3.3c, AY179603.1; rKv3.3d, AY179604.1), mKv3.3b (NM_008422), hKv3.3a (AF055989), rKv3.4a (X62841), hKv3.4a and hKv3.4b (hKv3.4a, NM_004978; hKv3.4b, NM_153763). Heterologous Expression of AptKv3.3—HEK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented by 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. CHO (CHO-K1; ATTC CLL-61) were maintained in F-12K medium (Kaighn's modification) (Invitrogen) supplemented by 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cultures were kept at 37 °C. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and co-transfected with 5 μg of AptKv3.3 vector cDNA and 1.0 μg of eGFP-C1 (Invitrogen) using 50 ml of 2.5 m CaCl2 per 35-mm dish at 70% confluence. CHO cells were plated onto glass coverslips and co-transfected with 1.25 μg of AptKv3.3 vector cDNA and 0.7 μg of eGFP-C1 using 7.5 μl of Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per 35-mm dish at 70% confluence. All chemicals were obtained from BDH (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Electrophysiology—Patch electrodes were constructed from borosilicate glass (2.0 mm outer diameter or fiber-filled 1.5 mm outer diameter) (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller. Recordings were obtained using an Axopatch 200-A or Axopatch 1-D amplifier and PClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and data stored on a PC for later analysis. Seals were typically 1.5 GΩ or greater, and any leak current in whole-cell or outside-out mode was subtracted on-line. Electrode resistance was 2–5 MΩ with series resistance of 5–15 MΩ corrected by series resistance compensation at 80–90%. The electrolyte consisted of (in mm): KCl, 144; Hepes, 5; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 5; Mg-ATP, 1.5; 0.1, CaCl2; pH 7.2. Whole-cell recordings were acquired at 1–2 kHz and single channel recordings in the on-cell or outside-out configuration were acquired at 2–5 kHz and digitally filtered during analysis at 1–2 kHz. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on the stage of an upright submerged lens (Zeiss Axioskop I) or inverted microscope (Olympus) and perfused at room temperature with a medium consisting of (mm): NaCl, 148; Hepes, 10; K2H2PO4, 1.25; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.5; MgCl2, 1.5; d-glucose, 20; pH 7.4. Recordings were typically obtained 48–72 h after transfection of cells and identified by GFP fluorescence. The rate of transfection as judged by GFP fluorescence was typically 1–2%, with the vast majority of fluorescing cells expressing AptKv3.3 current. Recordings were restricted to cells expressing 1.5–8 nA whole-cell current when stepped from –90 to +50 mV. Whole-cell control recordings in non-transfected HEK cells yielded background K+ currents <300 pA and in CHO cells <25 pA. Our cell line gave no evidence for the range of potential K+ currents suggested by a recent PCR analysis of another 293 cell line (20Jiang B. Sun X. Cao K. Wang R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 238: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Calculations—Conductance was calculated as g = I/(V – E K) normalized to the maximum conductance, using an experimentally derived K+ reversal potential of –95 mV. Conductance and inactivation plots were fit to a Boltzmann equation as follows, I(V)=A1-A21+e(V-V1/2)/k+A2(Eq. 1) where V = voltage, and k = slope factor. The data points of TEA effects were fit to calculate IC50 using the following logistic function, I(x)=A1-A21+(x/x0)P+A2(Eq. 2) where x = TEA concentration and p is the equivalent Hill coefficient. Activation τ was calculated between the end of the compensated capacitive transient and the peak current using a single exponential fit raised to a power of 4 (see Equation 3). I(t)=A1(1-e(-t/τ1))4(Eq. 3) Inactivation τ was calculated from the peak of the evoked current to a point corresponding to steady-state inactivation and deactivation τ from the peak of the tail current to steady-state. Exponential fits were used and calculated using the following equation. I(t)=A1e(-t/τ1)(Eq. 4) Plots of the voltage dependence of activation τ were fit using the following equation, τ(V)=A1e(Vq/kT)(Eq. 5) where q is apparent charge associated with τ. Plots of the voltage dependence of inactivation τ (τv) were fit using the following equation. τ(V)=A1e(-V/τv)(Eq. 6) The time course of recovery from inactivation was fit using a single exponential function (see the following equation). I(t)=A1(1-e(-t/τ1))(Eq. 7) Origin 7.1 (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) were used for fitting. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sample Student's t test. Average values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Current Activation and Deactivation—The majority of recordings were made in the whole-cell mode from AptKv3.3 channels expressed in CHO or HEK cells. Step commands from a holding potential of –90 mV in 10 mV depolarizing steps revealed an outward rectifying current that first became apparent for steps between –30 to –10 mV (Fig. 1A). Activation of the current in both expression systems was fast in exhibiting a τ for activation of <1.2 ms for steps from –90 to 30 mV (Table I). The τ for the rising phase of activation decreased with increasing voltage steps (Fig. 1B) but was significantly slower in CHO than HEK cells, with the greatest difference at low voltages. Once above activation voltage, plots of evoked current rose in a linear fashion with no reduction of current at higher voltages, as reported for some expressed Kv3 channels (9Vega-Saenz de Miera E.

The voltage for activation plots for AptKv3.3 in CHO and HEK cells could be superimposed (Fig. 1C), with a V ½ = 7.6 ± 0.8 mV for CHO cells and 8.2 ± 0.8 mV for HEK cells (Table I).Table IProperties of AptKv3.3 and AptKv3.3Koz when expressed in CHO or HEK cellsActivation τ (30 mV)Activation V ½ and kInactivation τ (30 mV)Inactivation V ½ and kτ recovery (-90 mV)γmsmVmsmVmspSKv3.3-CHO1.15 ± 0.06 (8)7.6 ± 0.8 (7)92.0 ± 14 (7)-22.5 ± 0.7 (5)255 ± 27 (5)37.8 ± 2.8 (6)k = 10.7 ± 0.7k = 6.7 ± 0.6Kv3.3-HEK0.33 ± 0.03 (8)8.2 ± 0.8 (9)τ1 = 96.8 ± 18-30 ± 0.9 (9)174 ± 21 (7)32.5 ± 2.0 (5)k = 11.2 ± 0.5τ2 = 1682 ± 526 (9)k = 7.9 ± 0.5Kv3.3Koz-CHO1.18 ± 0.07 (6)3.4 ± 0.9 (7)ap < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in CHO cells.55.7 ± 5.9 (9)ap < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in CHO cells.-21.1 ± 0.6 (5)352 ± 61 (4)32.3 ± 1.9 (4)k = 7.9 ± 0.6k = 5.5 ± 0.3Kv3.3Koz-HEK0.68 ± 0.06 (7)bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.-2.4 ± 1.4 (8)bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.27 ± 1.9 (10)bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.-21.5 ± 1.2 (7)bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.316 ± 65 (4)bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.35.0 ± 2.2 (7)k = 10.2 ± 1.0k = 5.7 ± 0.7bp < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells.a p < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in CHO cells.b p < 0.05 between data sets for AptKv3.3 in HEK cells. Open table in a new tab Deactivation was rapid in both CHO and HEK cells (CHO τ = 0.55 to 1.09 ms; HEK τ = 0.41 to 0.81 ms) and voltage-dependent between –80 and –30 mV (Fig. 1, D and E). As found for activation, the τ of deactivation in CHO cells was significantly slower than that in HEK cells. The single channel slope conductance measured under presumed equimolar K+ in the on-cell configuration ranged between 32 and 38 pS and was not significantly different for channels expressed in CHO or HEK cells (Fig. 1F; see also Table I). As reported previously for mammalian Kv3.1 (22Critz S.D. Wible B.A. Lopez H.S. Brown A.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), initial activation of AptKv3.3 in HEK cells could be accompanied by an early transient peak of current but less so when expressed in CHO cells. This early peak in HEK cells has been attributed to a transient shift in extracellular K+ concentration (22Critz S.D. Wible B.A. Lopez H.S. Brown A.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lower prevalence of this early peak in CHO cells may reflect the slower rate of activation, decreasing a putative increase in extracellular K+ ions. This was supported by preventing the early peak of current in HEK cells using a 5 ms voltage ramp command from –90 to 50 mV (28 mV/ms; data not shown). TEA Pharmacology—As found for other Kv3 subtypes, AptKv3.3 channels were highly sensitive to external TEA application (Fig. 2A) (16Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Rudy B. McBain C.J. TINS. 2001; 24: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In both cell types, substantial block was obtained for whole-cell currents in the range of 200 μm TEA or less (Fig. 2B), with a distinct decrease in single channel conductance (Fig. 2C). There was a significantly lower IC50 for whole-cell currents expressed in CHO compared with HEK cells (Fig. 2B) (CHO IC50 = 67.5 ± 4.2 μm, HEK IC50 = 152 ± 27 μm). The IC50 value for TEA obtained in HEK cells was equivalent to that reported for Kv3.3a expressed in oocytes at 140 ± 43 μm (9Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Moreno H. Fruhling D. Kentros C. Rudy B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). AptKv3.3 currents expressed in HEK cells were also highly sensitive to externally applied 4-AP (IC50 < 100 μm) (18Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current Inactivation—Expression of AptKv3.3 cDNA produced currents in CHO and HEK cells that differed dramatically in their inactivation properties. In CHO cells AptKv3.3 current reliably inactivated, with a rate of decay that could be fit well with a single exponential (Fig. 3, A and B). The τ of inactivation was voltage-dependent in decreasing at higher voltage steps from 251 ± 33.5 ms at 0 mV to 84 ± 14.0 ms at 50 mV (Fig. 3B). By comparison, the same cDNA expressed in HEK cells produced slower inactivating currents. Furthermore, there was a high degree of variability in the rate of inactivation, in that approximately half the transfected HEK cell population showed little or no inactivation within 10 s or required step commands to greater than 100 mV from a holding potential of –90 mV before any inactivation could be observed. Our analysis in HEK cells was restricted to those recordings reaching steady-state inactivation within 10 s for steps from –90 to 50 mV. This group presented a slow and voltage-independent inactivation that could only be fit with two exponentials (Fig. 3, D and E). An initial τ for inactivation in HEK cells ranged from 96.8 ± 17.7 to 132.8 ± 35 ms and a second τ from 1037.5 ± 215.7 ms to 1682.2 ± 526.2 (n = 9). The V ½ for inactivation in HEK cells was significantly left-shifted compared with CHO cells, with a value of –30.0 ± 0.86 mV compared with –22.5 ± 0.7 mV in CHO cells (Fig. 3, C and F) (Table I). The rate of recovery of AptKv3.3 also differed between CHO and HEK cells (Fig. 3G), with a τ of recovery after steady-state inactivation of 255 ± 27 ms in CHO cells and 174 ± 21 ms in HEK cells (Table I). The rate of inactivation of other mammalian K+ channels can vary depending on such factors as the cytosolic content of second messengers or redox environment (13Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Vyas T.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Velasco I. Beck E.J. Covarrubias M.

These factors might then explain the different kinetics of AptKv3.3 observed in the two cell lines. To test this hypothesis we recorded AptKv3.3 currents in CHO and HEK cells in the outside-out configuration to maximize intracellular washout and reduce differences in cytosolic factors. We found in outside-out recordings that single channels of AptKv3.3 expressed in HEK cells showed a high steady-state open probability over 5 s, while those expressed in CHO cells showed clear inactivation and an extremely low steady-state open probability within 1 s (Fig. 3H ; n = 10). In addition, macropatch recordings showed that large differences in the rate of inactivation persisted between CHO and HEK cells (Fig. 3I). These results indicate that the primary difference in the rate of inactivation between CHO and HEK cells does not likely arise from cytosolic factors. Effects of Modifying the Kozak Consensus Sequence—The efficiency of translation at a methionine start site has been shown to depend on the resemblance of the nucleotide sequence surrounding the AUG start site with respect to an optimal Kozak consensus sequence (29Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). A Kozak consensus sequence consists of a purine (A/G) at position –3 relative to adenine of the methionine mRNA codon (AUG) and/or a guanine at position +4. An ideal Kozak consensus sequence will incorporate both of these features, although only one is required to initiate translation at an AUG codon. mRNA sequences not corresponding closely to the Kozak consensus sequence can lead to leaky scanning, in which the ribosome does not begin translation at a given potential methionine start site (29Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 30Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The mRNA sequence for mammalian Kv3.3 channels has been shown to contain two putative methionine start sites at the 5′ end (9Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Moreno H. Fruhling D. Kentros C. Rudy B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Rae J.L. Shepard A.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that translation from the different start sites could explain the differences in inactivation observed between Kv3.3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK cells (16Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similarly, in AptKv3.3 a second methionine in the open reading frame can be found 29 amino acids downstream from the first methionine, at the end of the putative inactivation domain (Fig. 4A). If translation started from the second methionine codon, the resulting currents encoded by the truncated isoform would presumably be lacking fast NH2-terminal-mediated inactivation, potentially accounting for the slower rate of inactivation in HEK cells. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that the nucleotide sequence surrounding the first methionine codon in AptKv3.3 does not match the Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (29Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). To examine whether preferential translation from the first methionine codon could increase the rate of inactivation of AptKv3.3, the six nucleotides preceding the first methionine codon were replaced with the sequence (gcc gcc) to provide a closer fit to the Kozak consensus sequence (AptKv3.3Koz) (Fig. 4B). The cytosine nucleotide at position +4 was not changed to the Kozak consensus of guanine, because it would change the amino acid at this position from leucine to valine. A second cDNA without the coding region for the first 29 amino acids was also produced (AptKv3.3Δ1–29) to test the result of removing the NH2-terminal region on whole-cell currents. Inactivation of the Kozak-modified Constructs—Whole-cell recordings from AptKv3.3Koz expressed in CHO cells generated currents that inactivated with an average τ that was 40% faster at 30 mV than those generated from the unmodified AptKv3.3 expression vector (Fig. 5A). Expression from the AptKv3.3Koz vector in HEK cells now consistently produced a very fast inactivating current, exhibiting a τ that was 52% faster than even AptKv3.3Koz expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 5, A and B). By comparison, expression of AptKv3.3Δ1–29 resulted in a non-inactivating current with a similar profile to the original AptKv3.3 construct expressed in HEK cells, including a prominent transient peak of current often attributed to fast activation and extracellular K+ accumulation (Fig. 5A). The τ of AptKv3.3Koz inactivation was also voltage-dependent in both cell lines, ranging from 130 ± 12.0 ms at 0 mV to 52.9 ± 3.7 ms at 50 mV in CHO cells compared with 52.1 ± 5.0 ms at 0 mV to 25.4 ± 2.0 ms at 50 mV in HEK cells (Fig. 5B; see also Table I). AptKv3.3Koz in CHO cells showed a similar V1/2 of inactivation and k value to that of AptKv3.3 (cf. Figs. 5D and 3C). In HEK cells both the V ½ of inactivation and k value for AptKv3.3Koz were significantly altered compared with the unmodified AptKv3.3 (cf. Figs. 5E and 3F) but to final values that were not significantly different from tho"
https://openalex.org/W2019976653,"The Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm contains three distinct heavy chains (α, β, and γ) that exhibit different motor properties. The LC4 protein, which binds 1–2 Ca2+ with K Ca = 3 × 10–5m, is associated with the γ heavy chain and has been proposed to act as a sensor to regulate dynein motor function in response to alterations in intraflagellar Ca2+ levels. Here we genetically dissect the outer arm to yield subparticles containing different motor unit combinations and assess the microtubule-binding properties of these complexes both prior to and following preincubation with tubulin and ATP, which was used to inhibit ATP-insensitive (structural) microtubule binding. We observed that the α heavy chain exhibits a dominant Ca2+-independent ATP-sensitive MT binding activity in vitro that is inhibited by attachment of tubulin to the structural microtubule-binding domain. Furthermore, we show that ATP-sensitive microtubule binding by a dynein subparticle containing only the β and γ heavy chains does not occur at Ca2+ concentrations below pCa 6 but is maximally activated above pCa 5. This activity was not observed in mutant dyneins containing small deletions in the microtubule-binding region of the β heavy chain or in dyneins that lack both the α heavy chain and the motor domain of the β heavy chain. These findings strongly suggest that Ca2+ binding directly to a component of the dynein complex regulates ATP-sensitive interactions between the β heavy chain and microtubules and lead to a model for how individual motor units are controlled within the outer dynein arm.

These findings strongly suggest that Ca2+ binding directly to a component of the dynein complex regulates ATP-sensitive interactions between the β heavy chain and microtubules and lead to a model for how individual motor units are controlled within the outer dynein arm. Dyneins are microtubule-based motors required for many fundamental cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, mitosis, ciliary/flagellar motility, and embryonic development. In order to generate useful work, dynein motor function must be precisely controlled both in the cytoplasm and the cilium/flagellum. Signaling pathways involving cAMP and/or Ca2+ have been shown to modulate the activity of ciliary and flagellar dyneins. Indeed, Ca2+ signaling is crucial for waveform regulation of cilia and flagella in many organisms including Paramecium (1Naitoh K. Kaneko H. Science. 1972; 176: 523-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and sea urchin (2Brokaw C.J. Josslin R. Bobrow L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and mammalian (3Lindemann C.B. Goltz J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) sperm. In Chlamydomonas, two behavioral activities (phototaxis and the photophobic or avoidance response) that require alterations in flagellar waveform are mediated by changes in intraflagellar Ca2+ (4Witman G.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Ultimately, both of these responses must be controlled through modulation of inner and/or outer arm dynein function. The photophobic response occurs when Chlamydomonas are exposed to intense light and comprises two distinct events signaled by a rise in intraflagellar Ca2+ levels. During normal forward swimming, the two Chlamydomonas flagella beat with an asymmetric waveform. However, as intraflagellar Ca2+ increases from below pCa 6 to pCa 5, 1pCa refers to the negative log of the Ca2+ concentration (i.e. pCa 6 = 10–6m Ca2+). cells stop swimming and hold the quiescent flagella in a V-shaped configuration. Upon subsequent increase in Ca2+ to pCa 4, the flagella beat with a synchronized symmetric waveform that drives backward swimming (5Bessen M. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 6Kamiya R. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, the Chlamydomonas flagellum must contain at least two Ca2+ sensors that respond to different metal concentrations and control flagellar waveform conversion through alterations in dynein motor function. Several Ca2+-binding proteins have been identified within the Chlamydomonas flagellar axoneme. Centrin, which has two high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (K Ca = 1.2 × 10–6m) and two sites of lower affinity (K Ca = 1.6 × 10–4m), is a component of the inner dynein arms (7Piperno G. Mead K. Shestak W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and calmodulin has been located within the radial spoke stalk, where it may act as a signal transducer between the central pair MTs and the inner dynein arm system (8Yang P. Diener D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, reactivated axonemes lacking the radial spokes still display waveform conversion in response to changes in Ca2+ (9Wakabayashi K. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, Chlamydomonas mutants lacking outer dynein arms exhibit an aberrant or missing photophobic response (10Kamiya R. Okamoto M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 74: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1228-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Moss A.G. Morgan D.D. Microsc. Anal. 1999; 34: 7-9Google Scholar). Furthermore, reactivated cell models and axonemes from these mutants show little or no movement at pCa 4. These observations suggest that the outer dynein arm contains a Ca2+ sensor that is at least partly responsible for flagellar waveform conversion during the photophobic response. The current model for arrangement of the various components within the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm is illustrated in Fig. 1A. This dynein has a mass of ∼2 MDa and contains at least 13 different protein components (Fig. 1B). The three heavy chains (α, β, and γ HCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HC, heavy chain; DC, docking complex; IC, intermediate chain; LC, light chain; MT, microtubule; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. have different ATPase and motor properties in vitro (13Sakakibara H. Nakayama H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. 1982; 2: 525-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Pfister K.K. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12072-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutants that assemble outer dynein arms lacking either the entire α HC (oda11) or the β HC motor domain (oda4-s7) have been identified (16Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Sakakibara H. Takada S. King S.M. Witman G.B. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These strains exhibit different reductions in swimming velocity and flagellar beat frequency when compared with wild type (oda11, 119 μm·s–1, 52 Hz; oda4-s7, 65 μm·s–1, 30 Hz; wild type, 194 μm·s–1, 62 Hz), further indicating that individual outer arm HCs perform distinct functions in vivo. Cargo attachment by dynein requires a subcomplex of intermediate and light chain proteins and, in the case of flagellar outer arm dynein, is mediated in part through ATP-insensitive MT binding domains on the IC1 polypeptide (18King S.M. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8401-8407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the γ HC (13Sakakibara H. Nakayama H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The docking complex, consisting of proteins DC1–3, is an additional adaptor required for assembly and positioning of the outer dynein arm within the flagellar axoneme (19Takada S. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although interactions between the various components affect the enzymatic properties of the purified dynein particle (15Pfister K.K. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12072-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakamura K. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanisms of intradynein regulation. Within the outer dynein arm motor unit, each HC is associated with one or more LCs that apparently plays a regulatory role (reviewed in Ref. 21DiBella L.M. King S.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 210: 227-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The LC4 component is an EF-hand protein closely related to calmodulin. In vitro, LC4 binds 1–2 Ca2+ with a K Ca of 3 × 10–5m (22King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the only Ca2+-binding protein directly associated with an outer arm motor unit. LC4 interacts with the N-terminal stem domain of the γ HC possibly through one of the two IQ motifs 3The IQ motif has the consensus (I/V/L)QXXX(R/K)XXXX(R/K) and binds calmodulin-like proteins in a Ca2+-independent manner (41Rhoads A. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). that are specifically present in this HC. 4M. Sakato and S. M. King, unpublished observations. The docking complex protein DC3 also is predicted to have two Ca2+-binding domains (23Casey D. Inaba K. Pazour G. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C. Kamiya R. Witman G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, DC3 appears to bind both Ca2+ and Mg2+, and a DC3-null strain rescued with a mutant form of the protein incapable of Ca2+ binding showed normal swimming behavior. 5D. M. Casey and G. B. Witman, personal communication. Thus, LC4 is a strong candidate for an outer arm Ca2+ sensor. Here we characterize the Ca2+-dependent MT binding properties of outer arm dynein subparticles containing different HC combinations. We demonstrate that the -βγ HC subparticle exhibits a Ca2+-regulated ATP-sensitive interaction with MTs. Furthermore, we observed that the α HC displays a dominant Ca2+-independent ATP-sensitive MT binding activity. Together, our data support a model where, during the photophobic response, Ca2+ regulates ATP-sensitive interactions between the outer dynein arm and flagellar doublet MTs via the LC4 protein. Strains—Intact outer arm dynein was obtained from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant ida1, which lacks inner arm I1 (this dynein partly comigrates with the outer arm in sucrose density gradients). Outer arm dyneins containing only α-γ, -βγ, and –γ HC combinations were derived from mutant strains oda11 ida1, oda4-s7, and oda4-s7 oda11, respectively. We also examined dyneins from sup1-1, sup1-2, oda11 sup1-1, and oda11 sup1-2 strains. The sup1 mutations result in small deletions within the MT-binding stalk of the β HC (sup1-1 and sup1-2 lack residues 3190–3196 and 3158–3167, respectively) and restore motility to paralyzed strains lacking the radial spokes or central pair MT complex (24Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Gardner L.C. Mitchell D.R. Dutcher S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1495-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The β HC from sup1 strains is ≤1 kDa smaller than the wild type protein. This difference is difficult to detect by gel electrophoresis, so we ensured that the oda11 sup1 strains were indeed correct by employing the polymerase chain reaction to amplify small regions around the deletion from genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward and reverse primers used to test for the sup1–1 and sup1–2 deletions corresponded to nucleotides 14339–14355/14535–14551 and 14002–14018/14122–14138 of the β HC gene (U02963) (25Mitchell D.R. Brown K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 635-644PubMed Google Scholar) and generated wild type/mutant products of 212/191 and 136/106 bp, respectively. Dynein Purification—Flagellar axonemes were prepared by standard methods (26Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Outer arm dynein was purified as described previously (20Nakamura K. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added to all solutions. NaCl (0.6 m) was used in place of KCl to extract dynein from the axoneme, so that the subsequent dialysis step could be eliminated. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed at lower hydrodynamic pressure using an SW55 (Beckman Instruments) rotor for 10 h at 30,000 rpm. Peak sucrose gradient fractions containing outer arm dynein were concentrated in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Danvers, MA) that had previously been treated with 5% Tween 20 to prevent nonspecific protein binding. Microtubules—Bovine brain tubulin (0.65 mg/ml; Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) was polymerized in 100 mm Pipes, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.7 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm GTP, pH 6.9, at 37 °C for 30 min and stabilized by the addition of 10 μm taxol. To further elongate the MTs, they were mixed with additional tubulin to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and then kept at room temperature until use. These taxol-stabilized MTs were stable under all Ca2+ regimes used. Tubulin Pretreatment of Dynein—Dynein (0.1 mg/ml) and bovine brain tubulin (0.1 mg/ml) were mixed in HMED (30 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) (13Sakakibara H. Nakayama H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1 mm ATP and incubated on ice for 1 h. The sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Microsep 300 (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), washed three times with HMED containing 1 mm ATP, and finally washed three times in HMED without ATP. All incubation and wash buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The final retentate was used as tubulin-pretreated dynein. Dynein-Microtubule Binding Assay—The MT-binding assay was performed essentially as described by Moss et al. (27Moss A.G. Gatti J.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prior to use, MTs were washed and any aggregates removed from dynein samples by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay system (Pierce). Dynein (0.05 mg/ml) and MTs (1 mg/ml) were mixed in HMED buffer containing 50 μm taxol (100-μl final volume) and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged in an Airfuge at room temperature for 6 min. The supernatant (S1) was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of HMED containing 50 μm taxol and an ATP regeneration system (10 μm creatine phosphate and 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). Following the addition of 1 mm ATP, the resuspended pellet was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min and centrifuged a second time in the Airfuge. The second supernatant (S2) was retained, and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in 100 μl of HMED containing 50 μm taxol. To examine the effect of different cations, stock solutions of CaCl2, MgSO4, NiSO4, and LiCl were added to the desired final concentration. Free metal cation concentrations were calculated using an in-house modification of a program developed by Dr. S. A. Baba (Ochanomizu University) after Goldstein (28Goldstein D.A. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Association constants for metal-ligand complexes were from Sillén et al. (29Sillén L.G. Martell A.E. Bjerrum J. Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes. The Chemical Society, London1971Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was eliminated from all Ni2+-containing solutions as it formed a precipitate that disrupted the MT binding assay. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—The polypeptide composition of dynein samples was assessed by electrophoresis in 5–15% acrylamide gradient gels containing SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The HC content of these samples was determined in 3–5% acrylamide, 3–8 m urea gels lacking SDS in both the stacking and separating gels and silver staining. For the MT binding assays, samples were electrophoresed in 8% acrylamide SDS gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands was performed using an IS1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the γ HC-specific monoclonal antibody 12γB as described previously (30King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4717-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Harrison A. Olds-Clarke P. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ca2+ directly regulates MT-motor interactions, we first analyzed the MT-binding properties of both intact Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein and subparticles containing various HC combinations. Four different outer arm particles were employed to assess the contributions of individual HCs. Intact outer arm (containing α, β, and γ HCs) was obtained from the mutant ida1 that does not assemble inner arm I1, to avoid any possible contamination by this dynein. The α-γ, -βγ, and –γ HC subparticles were prepared from the mutants oda4-s7 (lacking the motor domain of the β HC (17Sakakibara H. Takada S. King S.M. Witman G.B. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), oda11 ida1 (lacking the entire α HC, the associated LC5 protein (16Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and I1 inner arm), and oda4-s7 oda11 (lacking functional α and β HCs and α HC-associated LC5), respectively. Neither oda4-s7 ida1 nor oda4-s7 oda11 ida1 strains were flagellated, so the α-γ and –γ HC samples potentially contained small amounts of inner arm I1. However, analysis of the -βγ HC subparticle from both oda11 and the oda11 ida1 double mutant yielded essentially identical results (data not shown), suggesting that the level of I1 dynein present was very small. Unfortunately, no mutants are currently available that assemble an outer arm lacking only the γ HC. Axonemal dyneins contain both ATP-sensitive (motor) and ATP-insensitive (cargo) MT-binding domains. The MT sedimentation assay utilized here has the advantage of enabling us to test simultaneously for both types of MT binding (the assay scheme is shown in Fig. 2A). Dynein was first mixed with MTs in the absence of ATP and MT-bound dynein recovered following sedimentation (P1); unbound dynein remained in the first supernatant (S1). The P1 MT pellet was subsequently resuspended in the presence of an ATP regeneration system, and the MTs resedimented. This yielded a second supernatant (S2) containing dynein that had originally been bound to MTs through an ATP-sensitive (motor) interaction and consequently was released by treatment with ATP. The second pellet (P2) contained dynein that had bound to MTs through the ATP-insensitive or cargo attachment site. Electrophoretic analysis of these fractions allowed us to determine the percentage of MT-bound dynein and assess whether or not bound enzyme was associated through the motor unit in an ATP-sensitive manner. In the absence of MTs, dynein did not sediment and remained in the S1 supernatant (Fig. 2A). Under very low Ca2+ conditions, 95% or more of the intact outer arm and α-γ HC subparticles bound MTs; ∼70% was released by the addition of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 2B). In contrast, considerable amounts (40–60%) of the -βγ and –γ HC subparticles failed to bind MTs under these conditions and remained in the S1 fraction. Approximately 30–40% of all dynein subtypes exhibited ATP-insensitive MT binding, which reflects attachment via the structural MT binding domain rather than the ATP-sensitive motor site. This indicates that structural MT binding is essentially unaffected by the lack of the α HC or the β HC motor domain. Results similar to those observed following the addition of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 2B) were obtained upon the addition of either 10 or 100 μm ATP (not shown). Overall, these observations suggest that at low Ca2+, the α HC exhibits a dominant ATP-sensitive MT binding activity, whereas the β and γ HCs are mostly inactive or incapable of forming a rigor bond. Next we tested the effects of increased Ca2+ on the MT binding properties of intact outer arm dynein (Fig. 3). The addition of Ca2+ in the range pCa 2–9 had no obvious effect on either ATP-sensitive or ATP-insensitive MT binding of intact outer arm dynein, with ∼70 and ∼30% of the protein being found in the S2 and P2 fractions, respectively. Previously, it has been demonstrated that ATP-insensitive MT binding by Chlamydomonas dynein could be blocked by preincubation with tubulin (32Haimo L.T. Fenton R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 9: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, to more accurately assess the effect of Ca2+ on ATP-sensitive MT binding, intact dynein or the -βγ and –γ HC subparticles were pretreated with tubulin and ATP to block ATP-insensitive MT binding sites prior to the assay (Fig. 4A). To achieve this, dynein was incubated with bovine brain tubulin (Fig. 4A, lane T) and ATP. Subsequently, unbound tubulin was separated from dynein-tubulin complexes by ultrafiltration, resulting in a filtrate (F1) containing excess tubulin (Fig. 4A, lane 1) and a retentate (R1) with the dynein-tubulin complex. The dynein-tubulin complex in the first retentate was then washed three times with ATP-containing buffer to further remove any free tubulin (electrophoretic analysis of the filtrates is shown in Fig. 4A, lanes 2–4). Subsequently, ATP was removed from the dynein-tubulin complex by washing with buffer lacking ATP. This yielded F2 filtrates (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–7) and a second retentate (R2) containing the dynein-tubulin complex in an ATP-free buffer. This procedure resulted in the attachment of mammalian brain tubulin to Chlamydomonas dynein (Fig. 4A, lane D-T). The Chlamydomonas flagellar tubulin present in the original sucrose gradient-purified dynein sample (Fig. 4A, lane D) was not dynein-associated, since it sedimented with the same S value even when the dynein particle was partially dissociated and migrated more slowly in the sucrose gradient (not shown).Fig. 4Effect of Ca2+ on microtubule binding by dynein pretreated with tubulin. A, diagram illustrating the tubulin pretreatment procedure used to block structural MT binding by dynein (left panel). Dynein was incubated with tubulin in the presence of ATP, and the sample was subjected to ultrafiltration, yielding a filtrate (F1) containing free tubulin and a retentate (R1) containing dynein plus associated tubulin. The R1 retentate was then washed three times with ATP-containing buffer. Subsequently, ATP was removed from the dynein-tubulin complex by washing three times with buffer alone. This yielded a second series of filtrates (F2) and an ATP-free dynein-tubulin complex in the second retentate (R2). The dynein-tubulin complex from the R2 retentate was then used to further assess MT-binding properties. Electrophoretic analysis of the seven filtrates from consecutive (F1 and F2) washes (lanes 1–7), the final retentate (R2) containing the dynein-tubulin complex (D-T), untreated dynein (D), and brain tubulin (T) is shown in the right panel. Note that endogenous Chlamydomonas tubulin in the untreated dynein sample (D) was exchanged for brain tubulin and that free tubulin was not detected in filtrates 3–7. B, C, and D, intact outer arm dynein (B) and the -βγ (C) and –γ (D) HC subparticles were pretreated with tubulin as described for A. The MT-binding properties of tubulin-pretreated dyneins were then assessed in the presence of Ca2+ (from pCa 9 to pCa 2) using the scheme illustrated in Fig. 2A. The percentage of total dynein present in the S1 (filled circles), S2 (filled squares), and P2 (open triangles) samples is shown for each Ca2+ concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MT-binding properties of the dynein-tubulin complexes described above were then assessed (Fig. 4, B–D) using the scheme shown in Fig. 2A. As observed previously by Haimo and Fenton (32Haimo L.T. Fenton R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 9: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), tubulin pretreatment selectively blocked ATP-insensitive MT binding such that almost no dynein (either intact or the -βγ or –γ HC subparticles) was found in the P2 fraction. Unexpectedly, the dominant ATP-sensitive interactions mediated by the α HC were also inhibited, and ∼90% of intact outer arm dynein did not bind MTs under any Ca2+ regime (Fig. 4B). This observation confirms that ATP-sensitive MT binding mediated by the α HC is not Ca2+-sensitive. In contrast, although the pretreated -βγ HC subparticle did not bind MTs at low Ca2+ and remained in the S1 supernatant, increasing Ca2+ above pCa 6 resulted in >60% of the enzyme attaching to MTs (Fig. 4C). Much of this dynein was released from MTs in an ATP-sensitive manner, indicating that it had bound via the motor domain. Thus, the -βγ HC subparticle contains ATP-sensitive MT-binding sites that are inactive at low Ca2+ but become activated above pCa 6. We also observed an increase in ATP-insensitive MT binding by the -βγ HC subparticle under high Ca2+ conditions (Fig. 4C). This increase was not found with intact dynein (Fig. 4B) and thus does not reflect Ca2+-dependent ATP-insensitive MT binding. The enhanced amount of the -βγ HC subparticle present in the P2 fraction above pCa 6 most likely results from dynein originally bound via an ATP-sensitive site that subsequently becomes associated through a structural binding domain (a possible mechanism is detailed under “Discussion”). To test whether the activation of ATP-sensitive MT binding by the -βγ HC subparticle was Ca2+-specific, we examined the effects of adding other divalent and monovalent cations on the MT binding properties of both this subparticle and intact dynein (Fig. 5). For intact outer arm dynein, the addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+ did not affect the amount of protein (∼65%) that bound MTs in an ATP-sensitive manner or the amount of unbound protein remaining in the S1 supernatant (2–4%) (Fig. 5, left panel). This is consistent with our observation that the α HC exhibits a dominant Ca2+-independent MT binding activity (Fig. 2). Approximately 25% of the -βγ HC subparticle failed to bind MTs under control conditions and was found in the S1 supernatant. When additional Mg2+ was added to the sample, no significant alteration in MT binding was observed (Fig. 5, right panel). In contrast, only ∼5% of this subparticle did not bind MTs when 1 mm Ca2+ was added. Furthermore, the amount of MT-bound -βγ HC subparticle released upon the addition of ATP increased concomitantly (from ∼30 to ∼50%) in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, we conclude that MT binding by the -βγ HC subparticle is activated by Ca2+ but not by Mg2+. This result is consistent with our previous observation that Ca2+ binding by LC4 is unaffected by millimolar levels of Mg2+ (22King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ni2+ causes the arrest of ciliary and flagellar motility (3Lindemann C.B. Goltz J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Naitoh Y. Kaneko H. J. Exp. Biol. 1973; 58: 657-676PubMed Google Scholar), and the addition of this cation resulted in 100% of both intact dynein and the -βγ HC subparticle becoming bound to MTs in an ATP-insensitive manner (Fig. 5). Li+ is thought to interrupt the Ca2+-regulatory machinery of sea urchin sperm flagella (34Gibbons B.H. Gibbons I.R. Nature. 1984; 309: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the addition of Li+ did not induce any significant changes in ATP-sensitive MT binding, although it did reduce the amount of protein that bound in an ATP-insensitive manner. These observations suggest that the activation of ATP-sensitive MT-binding observed for the -βγ HC subparticle is indeed Ca2+-specific. Since LC4 copu"

In this study, we identified an insoluble protein that was associated with the chromatin-depleted nuclear structure of proliferating human leukemia HL-60 cells.

A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that this protein bound to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Furthermore, it inhibited PP1 activity in vitro. We therefore named it scapinin (scaffold-associated PP1 inhibiting protein). cDNA cloning revealed that scapinin had two splicing variants of 448 amino acids (scapinin-S) and 518 amino acids (scapinin-L). Scapinin was down-regulated by differentiation in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that scapinin is a putative regulatory subunit of PP1 and is involved in transformed or immature phenotypes of HL-60 cells.

The catalytic subunit of PP1 binds to regulatory subunits that are critical for substrate specificity and spatial control of PP1 within the cell (4Cohen T.P. J.

It is thought that the nuclear nonchromatin structures, such as the nuclear matrix (NM) and nuclear lamina, are implicated not only in the spatial segregation of chromatins but also in the regulation of various nuclear processes associated with them (5Berezney R.

The α-catalytic subunit of PP1 is associated with NM during interphase, and PP1 is a mitotic lamin phosphatase (8Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J.

Recruitment of PP1 to the nuclear envelope by a PP1-binding protein, protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP-149, is a prerequisite for nuclear lamina assembly at the end of mitosis (10Steen R.L.

Identification of PP1-binding proteins associated with the nuclear nonchromatin structure will provide insights into the regulatory roles of PP1 in the nuclear structure and gene expression. Aberrant nuclear structures are hallmarks of neoplastic transformation (11Stein G.S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2067-2076PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear lamins alter during differentiation and transformation (12Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 847-853Google Scholar, 13Oguchi M. Sagara J. Matsumoto K. Saida T. Taniguchi S. Br. J.

The mechanisms and physiological importance of this phenomenon are not fully understood, and identification of the alterations may provide more insight into differentiation and transformation. HL-60 cells have been used as an in vitro model of differentiation because various compounds can cause differentiation of these cells into granulocytes or monocytes (19Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 20Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed differentiation-associated alterations of the chromatin-depleted nuclear structure, referred to as the NM-intermediate filament (IF) scaffold (21Fey E. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), of HL-60 cells. We then identified a novel protein, scapinin, which was tightly attached to the NM-IF scaffold of the nucleus and down-regulated by differentiation in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, we identified PP1 as a scapinin-binding protein by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Cell Culture—HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce differentiation, HL-60 cells (2 × 105/ml) were treated with 100 nm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Maximum reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (a differentiation marker) occurred after treating HL-60 cells with RA for 5 days. HL-60 cells (5 × 105/ml) were also treated with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate or 1.2% dimethyl sulfoxide. U937, K562, and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and HeLa, WM35, SKNSH, and GOTO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Preparation of the NM-IF Scaffold and IF Fraction of HL-60 Cells—The NM-IF scaffold was prepared as described previously (21Fey E. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 and cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 4 mm vanadyl riboside complex) on ice for 5 min before separating the particulate (P1) and soluble (Sol) fractions by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. The P1 fraction was incubated with 0.15 mg/ml DNase I at 23 °C for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate (1 m) was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.25 m, and the chromatin-depleted fraction (P2) was then collected by centrifugation. The P2 fraction was further extracted with a 2 m NaCl solution. Fey et al. (21Fey E. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) referred to this final particulate fraction as the NM-IF scaffold. The NM-IF scaffold was separated into the NM and IF fractions as described previously (23Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 121-125Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The NM-IF scaffold was dissolved in an 8 m urea solution containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.6, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.1, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.125 mm EGTA. The reassembled (IF fraction) and soluble (NM) proteins were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. To release RNA-containing matrix, the NM-IF scaffold was digested with RNase A in cytoskeleton buffer containing protease inhibitors; NaCl was then added to a final concentration of 2 m from a stock solution of 4 m NaCl in cytoskeleton buffer. 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in all solutions used in preparation of the NM-IF scaffold and RNase A digestion. RNase A (Sigma) was boiled for 20 min to destroy DNase and protease contaminants. The efficiency of RNase A treatment was monitored by the loss of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-U. Anti-hnRNP-U antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Development of a Monoclonal Antibody—The NM-IF scaffold proteins from proliferating or RA-treated HL-60 cells were mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and immunized to BALB/c mice (intraperitoneal, 0.4 mg of protein/mouse). After 3 weeks, mice were boosted with 0.2 mg of the NM-IF scaffold proteins mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (intraperitoneal). At 3 days after the boost, the spleen cells were collected, fused with myeloma cells, and selected in HAT medium (22Ayukawa K. Taniguchi S. Masumoto J. Hashimoto S. Sarvotham H. Hara A. Aoyama T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34465-34470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The NM-IF scaffold proteins from proliferating or RA-treated HL-60 cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline by sonication at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and each suspension was added to 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates at 0.1 ml/well. The anti-scapinin antibody exhibited a positive reaction in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate coated with the NM-IF scaffold proteins of proliferating cells but was negative in that of RA-treated cells. Cloning of Scapinin cDNAs—A λgt11 cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of HL-60 cells and immunoscreened as described (22Ayukawa K. Taniguchi S. Masumoto J. Hashimoto S. Sarvotham H. Hara A. Aoyama T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34465-34470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Positive clones were amplified by PCR with λgt11 forward primer 5′-GGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG-3′ and λgt11 reverse primer 5′-TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into the pBluescript SK- vector (Stratagene) and subjected to DNA sequencing. The 5′-region of the DNA fragment was cloned using a 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 3′-region of the DNA fragment was cloned by the 3′-RACE system (Invitrogen). The amplified fragment was ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. The coding regions of scapinin-S and scapinin-L were obtained by RT-PCR using a RT primer 5′-AATCTCTATGGCCTGTGGAA-3′, a reverse primer 5′-TCTCTATGGCCTGTGGAATCT-3′, a forward primer 5′-CTGGATGAGATGGACCAAACG-3′, a template poly(A)+ RNA of HL-60 cells, and a high fidelity RNA PCR kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The RT-PCR products of 1.35 and 1.55 kb were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, integrated into pBluescript SK- (SmaI site), and sequenced. Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence Analyses—Western blotting was performed as described previously (22Ayukawa K. Taniguchi S. Masumoto J. Hashimoto S. Sarvotham H. Hara A. Aoyama T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34465-34470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed as below. Whole HL-60 cells and the NM-IF scaffold of HL-60 cells were spread on glass slides using Cytospin II (Shandon Southern, Sewickly, PA), fixed with cold methanol for 15 min, and soaked with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% fetal bovine serum at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with culture medium from an antibody-producing hybridoma. After rinsing several times with TBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 1 μg/ml for 5 min. To visualize the morphology of the NM-IF scaffold, specimens were incubated for 10 min with a FITC-labeled anti-lamin B antibody at 1 μg/ml. The anti-lamin B antibody was labeled using a Fluoro-Tag™ FITC conjugation kit (Sigma). After rinsing with TBS, the specimens were observed using a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert S100, Carl Zeiss, Germany). HL-60 cells were also immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against the splicing factor SC35, promyelocytic leukemia protein, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Northern Blotting Analysis—Total RNAs of tumor cells were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, blotted onto Hybond™-N (Amersham Biosciences) membranes, and then cross-linked with 7000 J/cm2 ultraviolet light. A 3′-untranslated region of scapinin cDNA (0.5 kb), amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TGATACCAACACTGAACATT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AACAGGAATCAAAATGTTGCT-3′, was used as the probe. The probe was labeled using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and [32P]dCTP and hybridized with the blots in 5 × SSC overnight at 68 °C. Human multiple-tissue RNA blots (Clontech) were also examined. Expression of Scapinin—cDNAs for both scapinin-S and scapinin-L were integrated into pcDNA3 (EcoRV site) and transfected to COS-7 cells using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The coding regions of scapinin-S and scapinin-L were amplified by PCR using the following primers to introduce restriction enzyme sites: 5′-gggaattcCCAGCTCTGGATGAGATGGAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-gggctcgagATCTCCAACCACTTTCCAT-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR products were then inserted into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The pEGFP-C2-scapinin constructs were transfected into cells grown on glass coverslips. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Protein-protein interactions were analyzed with the MATCHMAKER™ two-hybrid system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length and fragmented cDNAs of scapinin-L were inserted into the EcoRI-PstI sites of pGBT9 in-frame with the GAL4 binding domain. The yeast strain HF7c was transformed by the bait plasmid and sequentially by pACT2 plasmid containing the human placenta MATCHMAKER™ cDNA library (Clontech). Cotransformants grown up in tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deprived SD media were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activities were measured according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). Recombinant yeast strains were incubated at 30 °C overnight in 5 ml of the appropriate SD medium. Then, 2 ml of the overnight culture was added to 8 ml of YPD medium and incubated at 30 °C until the A 600 > 0.5. After washing with Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4), 0.5 ml of the second culture was resuspended in 0.1 ml of Z buffer. Cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thawing and diluted with 0.7 ml of Z buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (100:0.27). The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 160 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and incubated at 30 °C. The A 420 was measured after stopping the reaction with 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. β-Galactosidase activity was determined from the values of A 420 and A 600 using Equation 1 U=(1,000×A420)/(0.5×t×A600)(Eq. 1) where t is the elapsed time of the reaction (min). U > 2. 0 was recognized as high (++), U = 0.2–2.0 as low (+), and U < 0.2 as negative (-). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—The α-catalytic subunit of PP1 was expressed as a HA-tagged protein using the pcDNA3 expression vector as described (24Tanji C. Yamamoto H. Yorioka N. Kohno N. Kikuchi K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36955-36961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 COS-7 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-scapinin (S or L) and pcDNA3-HA-PP1c. 1.25 μg of DNA of each plasmid was used for the transfection. For the control experiments, empty pcDNA3 plasmid was added to adjust the total DNA to 2.5 μg. Transfected cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) with the aid of sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The cell lysate was divided into two aliquots and incubated with either anti-scapinin antibody-conjugated Sepharose 4B or anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 1 min), washed three times, and eluted in SDS-sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using either anti-scapinin or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibodies. PP1 Binding Assay by Far-Western Analysis—Scapinin was purified from HL-60 cells. The NM-IF scaffold was dissolved in RIPA buffer (0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the clarified lysate was incubated with anti-scapinin antibody-conjugated Sepharose 4B for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with RIPA buffer (SDS concentration was reduced to 0.1%), scapinin was eluted in SDS-sample buffer. Purified scapinin was separated by SDS-PAGE and then blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Far-Western analysis was performed as described (25Shirato H. Shima H. Sakashita G. Nakano T. Ito M. Lee E.Y. Kikuchi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, blots were incubated with or without 0.2 μg/ml recombinant PP1c-α (Sigma) in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 0.5 mm MnCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. Bound PP1c was detected by incubation with rabbit anti-PP1c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h followed by incubation with goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody for 30 min. PP1 Inhibition Assay—Scapinin deletion mutants were expressed as fusion proteins with GST. The cDNA fragment of scapinin was amplified by PCR using a specific primer set, to which EcoRI (forward primer) or SalI (reverse primer) recognition sequences were added. After digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the PCR product was ligated into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved with EcoRI and SalI. GST fusion proteins were produced in BL21 bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The catalytic subunit of PP1 was purified from rabbit skeletal muscles, and PP1 activity was measured as described (25Shirato H. Shima H. Sakashita G. Nakano T. Ito M. Lee E.Y. Kikuchi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) Brij 35, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm caffeine, 10 μm [32P]phosphorylase a, and 100 ng/ml PP1 with various concentrations of GST or GST-scapinin fusion proteins. Association of Scapinin with the Nuclear Scaffold in HL-60 Cells—We developed monoclonal antibodies against NM-IF scaffold proteins of HL-60. We obtained a monoclonal antibody, an anti-scapinin antibody, which recognized two polypeptides, with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 75 kDa; both polypeptides were concomitantly concentrated in the NM-IF scaffold (Fig. 1A). The NM-IF scaffold was separated further into the NM and IF fractions by solubilization in an 8 M urea solution before reassembly in a physiological solution as described previously (23Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 121-125Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Reassembled proteins (IF fraction) were separated from soluble proteins (NM fraction) by centrifugation (Fig. 1B). The two polypeptides were mostly recovered in the IF fraction. The NM-IF scaffold includes a filament network composed of nuclear RNA and hnRNPs (21Fey E. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To examine the possible association of scapinin to the RNA-based filament network, we incubated the NM-IF scaffold of HL-60 cells with RNase A; RNase A-resistant NM-IF scaffold was then recovered and analyzed (Fig. 1C). We measured hnRNP-U to verify the efficacy of the RNase A digestion. About half of the scapinin was released from the NM-IF scaffold by RNase A digestion. However, about half of the population of scapinin was resistant to RNase A digestion. hnRNP-U was mostly released by such treatment. The result suggests that some scapinin is directly or indirectly associated with the RNA-based filament network. The anti-scapinin antibody strongly stained the nuclei of HL-60 cells (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining also showed association of the scapinin antigen with the NM-IF scaffold of the nucleus (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the scapinin antigen is a component of the nuclear scaffold of HL-60 cells. Immunostaining study showed a granular distribution pattern of scapinin in the nucleus of HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). We compared the distribution of scapinin with that of several other nuclear proteins and found that scapinin was not colocalized with the splicing factor SC35 (speckles), promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML bodies), or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (nucleoplasm and granules) (data not shown). Cloning of Two Splicing Variants of Scapinin—We obtained a cDNA fragment (∼1.0 kb) by immunoscreening of a λgt11 cDNA library and then cloned a 2.3-kb cDNA by 3′- and 5′-RACE. The 2.3-kb cDNA encoded a novel polypeptide of 518 amino acids (Fig. 3A). Prediction of the protein sorting signals and localization sites (PSORT; www.psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) of scapinin indicated nuclear localization at 94.1% reliability. To prepare the coding region, we performed RT-PCR using primer sets that were designed outside the start and stop codons. As a result, we obtained two RT-PCR products that encoded two splicing variant polypeptides of 448 (scapinin-S) and 518 (scapinin-L) amino acids, respectively (Fig. 3A). A search of the human genome databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) demonstrated that the scapinin gene was located in chromosome 20q13.32 (∼130 kb) and composed of 13 exons. Scapinin-S lacks exon 5 encoding 70 amino acids (shaded in Fig. 3A). Expression experiments revealed that scapinin-S and scapinin-L cDNAs encoded 60- and 75-kDa polypeptides, respectively, which comigrated with the authentic polypeptides of HL-60 cells (Fig. 3B). Homology Search—Standard protein-protein BLAST searches of nucleotide data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.hih.gov/blast) demonstrated that scapinin was highly homologous to functionally unknown proteins that have been predicted only from sequencing of cDNA libraries. This suggests that scapinin is a member of a novel protein family (see below). PSI-BLAST searches of protein data bases (SwissProtein), however, showed low, but significant, similarities to structural proteins, such as inner centromere protein (E value = 2e-85, identities = 19%, positives = 35%), nucleolar phosphoprotein p130 (E value = 3e-66, identities = 15%, positives = 33%), and heavy neurofilament subunit (E value = 1e-67, identities = 14%, positives = 29%). All of these proteins are cellular structural proteins and have no enzymatic activities (see “Discussion”). Some nucleotide polymerases exhibited similarities to scapinin, but the scores of similarities were lower than those of the structural proteins mentioned above. Scapinin Expression in Human Tumor Cell Lines and Normal Tissues—Northern blotting analyses showed that scapinin was expressed in HL-60 (leukemia), U937 (leukemia), and GOTO (neuroblastoma) cells, but not in K562 (leukemia), Jurkat (lymphoma), HeLa (uterine carcinoma), WM35 (melanoma), or SKNSH (neuroblastoma) cells (Fig. 4A). In normal human tissues, scapinin transcripts were abundant in the brain (Fig. 4B). When the same blot was exposed for longer, scapinin transcripts were detectable in the thymus, spleen, and placenta (data not shown). The high expression of scapinin in the brain was not anticipated. We then analyzed human EST clones. As shown in Table I, 21 of a total of 58 scapinin EST clones were derived from brain cDNA libraries. The other scapinin EST clones were derived from pooled tissues (mixtures of normal tissues or whole embryo) or tumor tissues.Table IHuman EST clone analysis of scapinin Scapinin ESTs were obtained by BLAST searches of the human EST data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using scapinin-L cDNA (≈2.3 kb) as a query sequence.Source of cDNA libraryNo. of ESTsBrainsaBrains include three primary cultures of neuron cells21Pooled tissuesbPooled tissues, which are mixtures of several adult tissues, also include whole embryos17TumorscTumors are divided into lung carcinomas, nervous tumors, and others20Lung carcinomas(7)Neural tumors(4)Other tumors(9)Total58a Brains include three primary cultures of neuron cellsb Pooled tissues, which are mixtures of several adult tissues, also include whole embryosc Tumors are divided into lung carcinomas, nervous tumors, and others Open table in a new tab Scapinin-S was the major form, and scapinin-L the minor form, in both U937 and GOTO cells, as in HL-60 cells. Immunostaining with the anti-scapinin antibody showed that scapinin was distributed mostly in the nuclei of U937 and GOTO cells (data not shown). Down-regulation of Scapinin in HL-60 Cells by Induction of Differentiation—Western and Northern blotting showed that scapinin was decreased by RA treatment of HL-60 cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, down-regulation of scapinin was induced by incubation with other differentiation-inducing agents, phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate and dimethyl sulfoxide (Fig. 5B). Immunostaining showed that the positive signals for scapinin antigen in the nucleus were reduced in HL-60 cells treated with differentiation-inducing chemical compounds (data not shown). Characterization of the Two Splicing Variants of Scapinin—The two splicing variants of scapinin were expressed in COS-7 cells using the pcDNA3 expression vector, and the cells expressing scapinin-S or -L were extracted with buffers containing detergents, nucleases, and high salt as in Fig. 1. The expressed scapinin-S and scapinin-L were both enriched in the NM-IF scaffold (Fig. 6A). The NM-IF scaffolds from scapinin-S- or -L-expressing cells were digested further with RNase A; RNase A-resistant insoluble NM-IF scaffolds were then analyzed as shown in Fig. 1C. Only about half of scapinin-S and -L was released from the NM-IF scaffold by RNase A digestion (Fig. 6B). hnRNP-U was mostly released by RNase A digestion. To examine the subcellular localization of the two variants of scapinin, we expressed them as GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 7). GFP-scapinin-S was localized in the nucleus. This result is consistent with the immunostaining study of HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). However, the GFP-scapinin-L expressed in HeLa cells was localized in some cytoplasmic extensions in addition to the nucleus. To exclude the possible influence of GFP, we expressed scapinin-L without GFP using the pcDNA3 expression vector and immunostained the transfected cells with the anti-scapinin antibody as in Fig. 2. Furthermore, we transfected the pcDNA3-scapinin-L construct to various cell lines (HeLa, WM35, SKNSH, NIH3T3, and GOTO cells) and examined the subcellular localizations. In all cell lines"

In primary cultured hepatocytes, tungstate showed insulin-like actions, which led to an increase in glycogen synthesis and accumulation. However, this compound did not significantly alter the insulin receptor activation state or dephosphorylation rate in cultured cells (CHO-R) or in primary hepatocytes, in either short or long term treatments. In contrast, at low concentrations, tungstate induced a transient strong activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) after 5–10 min of treatment, in a similar way to insulin. Moreover, this compound did not significantly delay or inhibit the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation triggered a cascade of downstream events, which included the phosphorylation of p90rsk and glycogen synthase-kinase 3β. Experiments with a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation and kinase assays indicate that these proteins were directly involved in the stimulation of glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis induced by tungstate without a direct involvement of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt).

In several animal models of type 1 and 2 diabetes, this compound reduces and, in most cases, normalizes glycemia when administered orally and does not cause hypoglycemia (1Barbera A.

In addition, several reports have also shown antidiabetic actions for other tungsten derivatives, paratungstate and pertungstate (5Palanivel R. Sundravel S. Ravichandran P. Govindasamy S. Med. Sci.

In vitro, tungstate or pertungstate treatment mimics most of the metabolic effects of insulin in primary cultured adipocytes, which include the stimulation of lipogenesis, hexose uptake, glucose oxidation, and inhibition of lipolysis (6Li J. Elberg G. Gefel D. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6218-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to other transition metal derivatives, sodium tungstate has a low toxicity profile in both short and long term treatments (for a review, see Refs. 9Ammerman C. Fontenot J. Spivey-Fox M.

This compound has been described as a phosphatase inhibitor (11Crans D.C. Simone C.M. Holz R.C. Que Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11731-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Lee J.Y.

Interestingly, Foster et al. (14Foster J.D. Young S.E. Brandt T.D. Nordlie R.C. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) described the inhibitory effects of this compound on glucose-6-phosphatase in vitro, an action that may contribute to a decrease in gluconeogenic activity in vivo.As described above, tungstate mimics most of the metabolic effects of insulin. The initial steps in insulin action involve the binding of this hormone to its receptor and the subsequent activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. This process results in the phosphorylation of several substrates, which, among other actions, ultimately trigger the activation of glycogen synthesis. Stimulation of glycogen deposition is one of the most significant consequences of insulin action in liver. Therefore, the analysis of the effects of tungstate on glycogen deposition may greatly contribute to identify its mechanism of action.Here we present the first analysis of tungstate action on several components of the insulin transduction cascade. Tungstate exerted insulin-like actions in primary cultured rat hepatocytes as it increased glycogen deposition. The actions of this compound were not mediated by the insulin receptor (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GS, glycogen synthase; GSK3β, GS kinase-3β; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MAPKAP-K1, MAPK-activated protein kinase-1; PKB, protein kinase B; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GS, glycogen synthase; GSK3β, GS kinase-3β; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MAPKAP-K1, MAPK-activated protein kinase-1; PKB, protein kinase B; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. as its phosphorylation state remained unchanged after treatment. In contrast, there was a clear transient phosphorylation and consequent activation of ERK1/2. These protein kinases triggered the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and p90rsk1, and ultimately, the activation of glycogen synthase (GS). These data indicate that ERK1/2 plays a key role in tungstate-stimulated glycogen synthesis in liver and therefore contributes to the antidiabetic action of this compound.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sodium tungstate was from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Tissue culture media and supplements were from Sigma and Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Biological Industries (Ashrat, Israel). ERK1/2 and phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). p90rsk antibody was from Sigma, GSK3α/β and c-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), phospho-p90rsk (Ser-380), PKB/Akt, phospho-PKB/Akt (Thr-308), and phospho-PKB/Akt (Ser-473) antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling. PD98059 was from Sigma. Enzymes and biochemical reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Cell Lines—CHO-R cells (17Reynet C. Caron M. Magre J. Cherqui G. Clauser E. Picard J. Capeau J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's-F12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.7 mg/ml Geneticin. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS.Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture—Collagenase perfusion was used to isolate hepatocytes from male Wistar rats (180–225 g) fasted for 24 h, as described previously (18Massague J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in DMEM, supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10% FCS, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) and then seeded onto plastic plates of 60-mm diameter treated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) at a final density of 8 × 104 cells/cm2. After cell attachment (4 h at 37 °C), the medium was replaced by DMEM without glucose, FCS, and hormones, or alternatively, by DMEM with 5 mm glucose, 10% FCS. Hepatocytes were incubated a further 14–20 h at 37 °C before starting the experiments.Glycogen and GS Measurement—To measure glycogen content, cell monolayers were scraped into 30% KOH, and the extract was then boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. Glycogen was measured in the cleared supernatants, as described (19Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).Glycogen synthesis was measured after incubation of primary cultured hepatocytes with 2 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h in DMEM with 10 mm glucose. On termination of the incubations, hepatocyte monolayers were washed three times with 150 mm NaCl and extracted in 0.1 m NaOH. Extracts were deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v) containing glycogen carrier, and the radioactivity incorporated into glycogen was measured.To measure GS activity, frozen cell monolayers were scraped using 100 μl of homogenization buffer, which consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenization was performed at 4 °C with a Polytron homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C; supernatants and sediments were recovered for determinations. Sediments were resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. GS activity was measured in the presence or absence of 6.6 mm glucose-6-phosphate (20Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The ratio of these two activities (–glucose-6-phosphate/+glucose-6-phosphate) is an estimate of the activation state of the enzyme.Cell Treatments and Phosphorylation Analysis—CHO-R cells were grown to confluence and then deprived of FCS for 14–16 h. Tungstate and insulin treatments were performed in serum-free medium unless otherwise indicated. Plates were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for protein extract preparation. Cells were scraped with 400 μl/60-mm plate of cold 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 20 nm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin. After 10 min on ice, extracts were centrifuged 10 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g. Protein concentration from the supernatants was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), and immunoblotted with selected antibodies; the immunoblots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. ERK1/2 activity was measured after immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody and assayed with recombinant ELK1 as substrate using the p44/42 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling).Transfection Experiments—These were performed as described in Ref. 21Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar. Briefly, 293T cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 3 × 105 cells/60-mm plate and transfected with empty plasmid pSG5 or the derived vector containing Pyst1 cDNA. Cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h and treated with 1 mm tungstate for 1 h. They were then treated with 100 nm epidermal growth factor for 5 and 10 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm tungstate, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot as described above.Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed for significance by analysis of variance and unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTungstate Induces Glycogen Deposition in Rat Primary Cultured Hepatocytes—Stimulation of hepatic glycogen deposition is one of the most characteristic metabolic actions of insulin. When primary cultured hepatocytes were incubated with insulin (100 nm) or increasing concentrations of tungstate (10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm) in the presence of glucose, they accumulated (Fig. 1A) and synthesized (Fig. 1B) higher amounts of glycogen as compared with untreated controls. These results indicate that tungstate exerts insulin-like actions in primary cultured hepatocytes. Therefore, we analyzed whether the key components of the insulin signaling cascade were modified by this compound.Tungstate Treatment Does Not Phosphorylate the Insulin Receptor in CHO-R Cells or Primary Cultured Hepatocytes— Our first approach was to compare the effects of insulin and tungstate on the tyrosine phosphorylation profile in Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress human wild type insulin receptor (CHO-R) (17Reynet C. Caron M. Magre J. Cherqui G. Clauser E. Picard J. Capeau J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is a suitable cellular model to study the downstream events of the insulin transduction cascade. CHO-R cells were treated with insulin or with increasing concentrations of sodium tungstate for 5, 10, 60 min, and overnight (14 h). Cell extracts were then analyzed by Western blot using antibodies that react to phospho-tyrosine residues. Insulin produced a rapid phosphorylation of the β-subunit of its receptor, and several higher molecular weight bands, one of which had a molecular weight compatible with the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, in cells treated with tungstate, there was no significant phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit at the concentrations assayed neither in short (Fig. 2B) nor in long term (Fig. 2C) treatments. Co-incubation with tungstate plus insulin did not increase the phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit above the levels observed when the cells were treated with insulin alone (not shown).Fig. 2Phospho-tyrosine pattern and insulin receptor dephosphorylation in CHO-R cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. A–C, CHO-R cells were treated with insulin (0.1 μm) or tungstate (0.1 and 1 mm) from 5 min to 14 h. Cells were lysed, and total protein was subjected to 8% (A) or 10% (B and C) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. A, 10-min treatments; B, short term treatments; C, long term treatments. As shown in D, hepatocytes were treated with medium with 25 mm glucose in the presence of 1 mm tungstate or 0.1 μm insulin for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and total protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the 4G10 antibody. E, CHO-R cells were pretreated with 1 mm tungstate or vehicle for 20 h in FCS-free medium. Then, cells were treated with 0.1 μm insulin for 10 min, the hormone was removed, and the phosphorylation state of IR β-subunit in the presence or absence of tungstate was evaluated at 60 and 180 min by Western blot with the 4G10 antibody.

In contrast, incubation with insulin, which also stimulated glycogen deposition to a similar extent, induced the phosphorylation of this receptor (Fig. 2D).Since tungstate is a phosphatase inhibitor, we tested whether this compound could prevent IR dephosphorylation in CHO-R cells stimulated by insulin and thus improve downstream insulin signaling. Briefly, CHO-R cells were treated with insulin for 10 min, the hormone was removed, and the effect of tungstate on the phosphorylation state of the IR β-subunit was evaluated by Western blot analysis at a range of time points. No significant differences were detected between tungstate-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that tungstate increased glycogen deposition without modifying the IR β-subunit phosphorylation.Tungstate Treatment Activates ERK1/2 in CHO-R Cells and Primary Cultured Hepatocytes—The tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in tungstate-treated CHO-R cells showed an additional protein band of 40–44 kDa, which was also present in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2F). The molecular mass of the phosphorylated band was compatible with MAPK family members.To check whether this protein corresponded to a MAPK, we performed a series of Western blots in extracts from CHO-R cells and primary cultured hepatocytes using antibodies that recognize ERK1/2 only when phosphorylated at conserved threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (numbering corresponding to human MAPK (Erk1)). Transient phosphorylation of ERK1 and 2 was observed when CHO-R cells were treated either with insulin or with tungstate; it peaked at 5–10 min, decreasing thereafter (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, analysis with antibodies against total ERK1/2 showed that these treatments did not significantly modify the total levels of these two kinases (Fig. 3A). We also observed an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in primary cultured hepatocytes incubated with 1 mm tungstate, which peaked at about 10 min, decreasing thereafter (Fig. 3B). There was no significant increase in the total amount of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3B). No synergistic effect was observed when CHO-R cells or primary cultured hepatocytes were simultaneously incubated with tungstate and insulin (not shown).Fig. 3ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activity in CHO-R cells and primary cultured hepatocytes treated with tungstate. A, CHO-R cells were treated with insulin (0.1 μm) or tungstate (0.1 and 1 mm) for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and total protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase and ERK1/2 antibodies. B, hepatocytes were treated with medium with 25 mm glucose plus 1 mm tungstate or 0.1 μm insulin for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and total protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with phospho-p44/42 MAPK and ERK1/2 antibodies. C, CHO-R cells were treated with 0.1 μm insulin and 0.1 and 1 mm tungstate for the times indicated. ERK activity was measured after immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated ERK1/2, incubation with ELK1, and detection with a phospho-specific ELK1 antibody. D, left panel, CHO-R cells were pretreated with 1 mm tungstate or vehicle for 20 h in medium without FCS. Then, cells were treated with 0.1 μm insulin for 10 min, the hormone was removed, and the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 in the presence or absence of tungstate was evaluated at 60 and 180 min by Western blot with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. Right panel, 293T cells transfected with empty pSG5 plasmid or pSG5 encoding Pyst1 were treated with 100 nm epidermal growth factor in the presence of 1 mm tungstate for the times indicated.

To confirm that these phosphorylated kinases were catalytically active, we assayed ERK1/2 activity in immunoprecipitates from CHO-R cells treated either with tungstate or with insulin. Recombinant transcription factor ELK-1 was used as substrate, and the phosphorylation was monitored by Western blot with antibodies that recognize this protein when phosphorylated by ERK1/2 at serine 383. Tungstate and insulin treatment increased ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 3C), a finding consistent with the phosphorylation data shown in Fig. 3, A and B.As a phosphatase inhibitor, the effect of tungstate on ERK1/2 phosphorylation may be related to the inhibition of a MAPK-phosphatase. Pyst1 (MKP-3, rVH6) is the main MAPK phosphatase involved in the inactivation of ERK1/2 (24Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S.

The putative inhibition of Pyst1 by tungstate would potentially lead to an increased phosphorylation of its substrates, i.e. ERK1/2.A first set of experiments was performed to compare the time-dependent dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 in tungstate-treated versus untreated cells. Briefly, CHO-R cells were treated with insulin for 10 min, the hormone was then removed, and the effect of tungstate on the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 was evaluated by Western blot analysis at a range of time points. No significant differences were detected between treated and untreated cells (Fig. 3D). To further study this point, we performed a second set of experiments in which Pyst1 was overexpressed in 293T cells. Cells were treated with 100 nm epidermal growth factor in the presence or absence of 1 mm of tungstate, and the ERK1/2 phosphorylation state was then visualized by Western blot. Pyst1 overexpression enhanced the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2. This effect was not significantly blocked or delayed by preincubation with 1 mm tungstate (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that no MAPK phosphatase is involved in tungstate-dependent ERK1/2 activation.Tungstate-induced Glycogen Deposition in Rat Primary Cultured Hepatocytes Is Dependent on ERK1/2 Activation—We tested whether tungstate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was involved in the stimulation of glycogen deposition triggered by this compound. For this purpose, we used PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Incubation of CHO-R cells and hepatocytes with this inhibitor completely blocked the tungstate-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, PD98059 also prevented tungstate-induced glycogen deposition in cultured hepatocytes, indicating that this process is dependent on active ERK1/2 (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Analysis of tungstate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation after treatment with PD98059. A, upper panel, CHO-R cells were pretreated with or without PD98059 (50 μm) for 30 min. They were then incubated in the presence of the inhibitor plus 1 mm tungstate or with 0.1 μm insulin for the times indicated. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was monitored by Western blot with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. Lower panel, primary cultured hepatocytes were pretreated with or without PD98059 (50 μm) for 30 min. They were then incubated in the presence of the inhibitor plus 1 mm tungstate or with 0.1 μm insulin for the times indicated. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was monitored by Western blot with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. They were then assayed in the various experimental conditions in the presence of 25 mm glucose. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was monitored by Western blot with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. B, hepatocytes were preincubated in the absence of glucose for 20 h. Glycogen was measured after 2 h of incubation in the various experimental conditions. PD98059-treated plates were preincubated for 30 min and during the experiment with the inhibitor. Glycogen content is expressed as μg of glucose/mg of protein. #, p < 0.001 as compared with 25 mm glucose + 1 mm tungstate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tungstate Treatment Leads to the Activation of p90rsk and Activation of Glycogen Synthesis in a PKB/Akt Phosphorylation-independent Way—The stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin is triggered by the phosphorylation of GSK3β at serine 9 and its concomitant inactivation. Therefore, we used specific antibodies to analyze whether tungstate treatment stimulates the phosphorylation of GSK3β in CHO-R and primary hepatocytes. Tungstate, like insulin, stimulated the phosphorylation of GSK3β at consensus serine 9 in both cell types, whereas no significant variations were observed in the total amount of this kinase (Fig. 5, A and E).Fig. 5Analysis of tungstate-induced GSK3β, PKB/Akt, and p90rsk phosphorylation in CHO-R cells and primary cultured hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2059490112,"We report the crystal structures and biophysical characterization of two stabilized mutants of the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain that have been engineered to minimize electrostatic repulsion. Four independent copies of each mutant occupy the crystal lattice, and comparison of these structures illustrates variation that can be partly ascribed to networks of correlated conformational adjustments. Central to one network is leucine 26 (Leu26), which occupies alternatively two side chain rotameric conformations (-gauche and trans) and different positions within the hydrophobic core. Similar sets of conformational substates are observed in other Engrailed structures and in another homeodomain. The pattern of structural adjustments can account for NMR relaxation data and sequence co-variation networks in the wider homeodomain family. It may also explain the dysfunction associated with a P26L mutation in the human ARX homeodomain protein. Finally, we observe a novel dipolar interaction between a conserved tryptophan and a water molecule positioned along the normal to the indole ring.

Finally, we observe a novel dipolar interaction between a conserved tryptophan and a water molecule positioned along the normal to the indole ring. This interaction may explain the distinctive fluorescent properties of the homeodomain family. The homeodomain is a simple fold common to many different DNA-binding proteins from diverse eukaryotes. The domain is found in transcription factors that regulate a variety of genes and so control key processes ranging from early developmental decision to homeostasis and general “housekeeping” (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell 3rd, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 2Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev.

The homeodomain fold comprises three helices, connected by a flexible loop and a β-turn, and has a small hydrophobic core that is remarkably well conserved (4Clarke N.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The side chains in this conserved core appear to be well packed, which is a hallmark of stable folds. However, homeodomain folds generally have poorer stabilities in comparison with other proteins of similar size (5Mayor U. Guydosh N.R. Johnson C.M. Grossmann J.G. Sato S. Jas G.S. Freund S.M.

The termini of homeodomains are disordered in solution (9Esposito G. Fogolari F. Damante G. Formisano S. Tell G. Leonardi A. Di Lauro R. Viglino P. Eur. J.

Biol. 1999; 288: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and structures of free- and DNA-bound forms illustrate that DNA binding is accompanied by a structural condensation of the termini (12Tsao D.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Possibly, the homeodomain core also undergoes subtle structural changes upon DNA binding. Thus, the homeodomain would appear to mold to the surface of specific DNA by induced fit. Despite the wealth of current stereochemical and functional data for homeodomains, the basis for their comparatively low stability and its relationship, if any, to their induced fit remains to be established. Sequence co-variance analysis of homeodomains highlights several strongly correlated residue pairs that form conserved interactions and that may affect stability and DNA binding (4Clarke N.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One pair identified was the surface residues 17 and 52, which forms, in the majority of cases, a salt bridge. However, in the transcriptional repressor Engrailed from Drosophila, two lysines are instead found in these positions. We have substituted lysine 52 for glutamate, to mimic the conserved Glu17-Arg52 salt bridge, and for alanine, to relieve the repulsion of the clustered positive charges. Standard equilibrium measurements demonstrate that both substitutions substantially increase the stability of the folded state. We have also determined the crystal structures of the Engrailed homeodomain (En-HD) 1The abbreviations used are: En-HD, Engrailed homeodomain; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; NOE, 15N-{1H} nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: En-HD, Engrailed homeodomain; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; NOE, 15N-{1H} nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid. mutants K52E and K52A, under similar crystallization conditions, to 2.1-Å resolution. These structures, together with solution data, suggest that the stabilization is because of the relief of electrostatic repulsion. There are four independent copies in the asymmetric unit, and for each mutant we observe significant conformational differences between the individual molecules that can be partly attributed to correlated orientations of side chains. The positional variations in the Leu26 network can account for backbone NMR relaxation data from the wild type protein, which indicates greatest conformational exchange in the intrahelical loop containing Leu26. The interactions within the Leu26 network may account for the observed co-variance of the participating residues among the diverse homeodomain family members. Our observations may also explain the dysfunctional phenotype associated with a P26L mutation in the human ARX homeodomain, which is found in cases of rare X-linked myoclonic epilepsy (13Scheffer I.E.

These results provide further structural insights into the determinants of stability and functional specificity for this highly conserved domain. Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange technique (Stratagene). Purification of the wild type protein has been described previously (15Mayor U. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13518-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and the mutants were purified in the same fashion. Protein purity and quality were corroborated by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. X-ray Crystallography—Crystals were grown at 20 °C by the vapor-diffusion method from hanging droplets by mixing 40 mg ml-1 protein (in water) in a 1:1 volume ratio with 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 100 mm CHES, pH 9.5. The crystals appeared within 1 week and were cryoprotected with 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol before flash freezing. Data were collected at 100 K at Daresbury Laboratory (station 14.2, λ = 0.9779 Å) and the ESRF (ID29, λ = 0.9792 Å). The data (Table I) were processed and scaled with DENZO/SCALEPACK (16Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structures were solved using molecular replacement (EMPR (17Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Smith B.A. Bouzida D. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar)) with the wild type structure (1ENH) as the search model. To minimize phase bias, only the peptide backbone was used for initial phase calculations and additional atoms were added or removed iteratively using arpWarp (19Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). Initially the structure was refined using CNS (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) including translation-libration-screw displacement refinement. The model was built using 2F o - F c maps, F o - F c maps, and composite omit maps. There were four copies in the asymmetric unit of crystals of both K52A and K52E mutants, and non-crystallographic symmetry was applied in the first stages of refinement and then released later on. This procedure gave the best R-free to R-factor ratio and meaningful crystal contacts. In parallel trials, refinement with non-crystallographic symmetry applied throughout gave inferior structures as judged by real space refinement scores, R-free/R-factor ratios, and map quality. The stereochemistry was validated using MOLPROBITY (22Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Differential scanning calorimetry experiments on wild-type En-HD, K52A, and K52E (in the range 300–350 μm) were performed in a VP-DSC instrument (MicroCal) with a cell volume of 0.52 ml, at 1°/min. All equilibrium data fitted well to the standard two-state equations. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out on a DRX 600 spectrometer equipped with inverse triple resonance probes and single axis gradients. Protein samples in the range of 0.5–2 mm were prepared in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.7, with 100 mm NaCl and 5% 2H2O. All data were processed in FELIX 98 (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). 15N T 1 and T 2 experiments incorporated spin-echo delay times of 500 μs, the relaxation times were set to 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 200, 240, 280, 320, and 360 ms. The recycle delays for the T 2 experiments were 3.0 s. Each spectrum comprised 512 × 128 complex points that were zero-filled 2-fold in both dimensions and multiplied by exponential window functions in both dimensions prior to analysis. Peak intensities were fitted to single exponential equations in KaleidaGraph 3.0 (Abelbeck Software) to determine R 2 (1/T 2) and R1 (1/T 1) rates for individual amides. The uncertainties of the R 2 and R 1 data were estimated from non-linear least squares fitting according to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Heteronuclear 15N-{1H} steady-state nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) enhancements were determined as previously described (5Mayor U. Guydosh N.R. Johnson C.M. Grossmann J.G. Sato S. Jas G.S.

Cross-correlation between 15N chemical shift anisotropy and 15N-1H dipolar coupling was measured according to Bax and co-workers (24Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

The durations for the dephasing delays were set according to 46.7, 68, and 132 ms. Resonance intensities were obtained from peak heights using three data point interpolations. The cross-correlation term, η, was calculated according to the equation I a/I b = tanh(2Δ η), where I a is the cross-correlation according to scheme A, I b the cross-correlation with omission of 1H90/180 pulse (scheme B), η are the dephasing delays, and Δ the cross-correlation between 15N chemical shift anisotropy and 15N-1H dipolar coupling (24Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Data were fitted using the Kaleidagraph software. Small differences in the relaxation losses in the two schemes because of potential pulse imperfections were not corrected. Computational—Structures were superimposed using Comparer (25Sali A.

Root mean square deviations were calculated with ProFit, side chain dihedrals with Dang. 4J. Michael Word, unpublished data. Angles between helices were calculated by building a fixed geometry α-helix (ϕ = -47° Ψ = -58°) in a standard frame of reference and superimposing this on each helix in the structure in turn. The transformation matrices required for superposition allowed calculation of the relative helix orientations. The figures were prepared using VMD (26Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol.

Stability of the En-HD Fold—The same denaturation m-value of 0.80 ± 0.05 kcal mol-1m-1 was obtained from urea denaturation curves (∂ΔG D-N/∂[Urea]) for the wild type and the mutants (data not shown). Apparent free energies of denaturation (ΔG D-N) were increased for K52A and K52E compared with the wild type by, on average, about 1.2 and 1.8 kcal mol-1, respectively (Table II). The apparent free energy of denaturation of the wild type protein was 2.1 kcal mol-1, as determined by calorimetric measurements, which is small for a protein of this size (28Jackson S.E. Fold Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). DNA-binding proteins tend to have lower stabilities than proteins of corresponding mass, with reported ΔG D-N ranging from 3.0 to 3.7 kcal mol-1 (29Huang G.S. Oas T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the wild type structure (1ENH), Lys52 is sandwiched between Phe20 and Trp48, and its charged amino group protrudes into solution. Lys55 and Lys17 are in close proximity with Lys52 (Fig. 2B), which possibly causes charge repulsion. The electrostatic surfaces of K52E and K52A show that mutation of residue 52 to a glutamate (Fig. 2C) or an alanine (Fig. 2D) reduces the amount of positive charge clustered on the surface, as expected. For the K52E mutant, we observe that the glutamate packs against the conserved residues Trp48 and Phe20 in all four copies, and it forms (in some copies) simultaneous salt bridges to Lys55 and Lys17 (Fig. 2E). In the crystal structures of both the wild type and K52A mutant, the third helix is disordered after residues 55–56, whereas in the K52E mutant this helix can be resolved for a further 1–2 residues. This is most likely because of the anchoring of Lys55 through its salt bridge with Glu52. The positions of the residues around Glu52 in the K52E mutant are shown in an animation, which highlights the positional variation of the lysines around the glutamate (E52.avi; see Supplementary Materials). For the K52A mutant, the methyl group of the alanine packs against Trp48 and Phe20 (Fig. 2F), but this interaction represents a fraction of the non-polar area of the lysine side chain in the wild type structure or the glutamate side chain in the K52E structure. The alanine is unable to make any interactions with the surrounding lysines; these consequently adopt different positions and in some cases appear completely disordered. As this mutation is substantially stabilizing, it seems that the relief of electrostatic repulsion must outweigh energetically the loss of favorable packing interactions and is likely to be the major driving force of the stabilization in both K52E and K52A mutants. A Conserved Indole-Water Polar Interaction—Tryptophan is often observed to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules that lie in the same plane as the indole ring. 5www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/∼mcdonald/atlas. The ring of aromatic residues can also act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor from a group oriented normal to the center of the aromatic ring (32Levitt M. Perutz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In the En-HD crystal structures, we find a water molecule lying along the normal to the indole plane, but importantly, the water is positioned directly above the heterocyclic nitrogen rather than the center of the ring (Fig. 3A). A water molecule is present at this position in 3 of the 4 copies of both K52A and K52E mutants, and it is oriented through a hydrogen bond from the backbone carbonyl of Trp48. In the case of K52E, the water molecule forms an additional hydrogen bond with the Glu52 side chain (Fig. 3A). The persistence of this water molecule at the same position in the wild type protein and its occurrence in the corresponding position in the MATa1 homeodomain structure (1MH3 (33Ke A. Wolberger C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) suggests that the water-indole interaction may be important. Water molecules are also found at corresponding positions in several homeodomain-DNA complexes, where the water molecule donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate backbone (34Remenyi A. Tomilin A.

In fact, a data base search has found hundreds of examples of similar water-indole interactions in protein structures (results not shown). Inspection of the hydrogen bonding patterns in the protein-DNA complexes suggests that neither the lone pair nor the protons of the water molecule are directed toward the indole nitrogen. The interaction may therefore be dipolar, which is supported by calculations that show that the interaction has favorable electrostatic and van der Waals components. 6E. J. Stollar, J. Luis, S. Velankar, A. Golovin, M. Orozco, B. F. Luisi, manuscript in preparation. The water-indole interaction could explain the distinctive fluorescence properties of homeodomains. With refolding, fluorescence quenching is observed for the En-HD, antennapedia, bicoid, and ubx homeodomains (39Subramaniam V. Jovin T.M. Rivera-Pomar R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21506-21511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as in paired, msx-1, oct-1, oct-2, and pit-1 homeodomains. 7U. Mayor and A. R. Fersht, unpublished results. It has been argued that the aromatic residue at position 8 is largely responsible for the quenching as a consequence of its π system receiving a H-bond from the indole nitrogen (40Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the fluorescence of the F8A mutant of En-HD has the same degree of quenching as the wild type (41Guydosh, N. R. (2002) A Protein-folding Study of Mutants of the Engrailed Homeodomain. M. Phil. thesis, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). In the case of En-HD, Trp48 is in close proximity of the terminal amino groups of Lys17 and Lys55, which are also potential quenchers. We have tested the fluorescence quenching of both K52A and K52E, where the positions of Lys17 and Lys55 are different (Fig. 2, E and F) and both, surprisingly, show the same magnitude as wild type (data not shown). We thus are lead to consider that the water molecule is responsible for the majority of the quenching. In fact the mutant K52L, which modeling suggests could displace this water, has 50% less quenching while, in the buffer conditions of the experiment, retains similar stability to wild type (data not shown). Based on these observations, we propose that the characteristic fluorescence quenching in homeodomains is caused by the dipolar interaction between the water and the excited transition state of the indole. Conformational Variation—The wild type structure superimposes onto all copies of both mutants with a backbone root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) range of 0.21–0.43 Å. The interhelical angles vary by less than 5°. Whereas the backbone positions do not vary appreciably in the K52A and K52E structures, the positions of the long side chains on the protein surface vary substantially (Fig. 4A). For many of these residues, the side chain positions correlate with alternative conformations of at least one neighboring side chain. Variations are also because of different direct crystal contacts and are indicated where relevant to the analysis. These crystal contacts are distributed over the surface of the proteins and are different for each of the copies and, even to some degree, between the corresponding copies of the two mutants (Fig. 4B). Many residues also differ in their χ1 side chain torsion angle for the different copies (Fig. 4C). The r.m.s.d. for each side chain have been ranked and color coded in the refined structure of the K52E mutant, as shown in Fig. 4D. Generally, the core residues (mostly blue in Fig. 4D) change position and χ1 to a lesser extent compared with the surface residues (mostly red and orange), with one major exception: Leu26. This residue also appears to make the most pairwise correlated adjustments, and we will focus further on this residue in the next section. The Core Residue Leu26—One of the greatest differences between copies is in the position and χ1 values of Leu26. This residue resides in the loop between helices 1 and 2 and is part of the hydrophobic core of the protein. Relative to the rest of the core, the Cα of Leu26 spans about 1.8 and 1.4 Å between copies for K52E and K52A, respectively. It switches between its two most favored χ1 rotameric states (-gauche and trans) as defined by Markly et al. (42Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These different conformations are large compared with the estimated coordinate error of the model of 0.2 Å. Residues Phe49, Arg30, Arg31, Ile45, and Lys46 create a hydrophobic enclosure for Leu26. In Fig. 5A, all the residues involved in Leu26 packing in the K52E mutant and the wild type structure (1ENH) are shown (except Ile45, for clarity). This view shows Leu26 to be distributed between the -gauche (copies B and C) and trans (copies A and D and wild type) rotameric states with a significant change in position. A similar change in position of Leu26 is seen between the two copies of the free MATa1 homeodomain (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the positional change can also be observed in the superposition of the wild type (3HDD) and Q50A (1DOU) En-HDs in their DNA bound states (Fig. 5, C and D). The van der Waals packing interactions between the residues in a Leu26 -gauche (copy B) and Leu26 trans (copy A) network for K52E are shown in Fig. 6, A and B. The packing interactions in the two states are quite different, highlighting the importance of the position of Leu26 to the network of its contacting residues. In the trans position Leu26 has 50% greater buried surface area (Fig. 6A). An animation of the substates of the Leu26 network for both K52A and K52E mutants (L26A.avi and L26E.avi, respectively) can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The animation makes more apparent the corre"

The intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying its actions remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of GHB on the activation (phosphorylation) of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), were investigated. Acute administration of GHB (500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) induced a fast and long lasting inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation in both frontal cortex and hippocampus. The reduced MAP kinase phosphorylation was observed in the CA1 and CA3 areas but not in the dentate gyrus. Pretreatment with the specific γ-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABAB), receptor antagonist CGP56999A (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) prevented the action of GHB, and the effect of GHB was mimicked by baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, whereas the high affinity GHB receptor antagonist NCS-382 (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) had no effect on GHB-inhibited MAP kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, the GHB dehydrogenase inhibitor valproate (500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), which inhibits the conversion of GHB into GABA, failed to block the effect of GHB on MAP kinase phosphorylation. Altogether, these data suggest that GHB, administered in vivo, reduces MAP kinase phosphorylation via a direct activation of GABAB receptors by GHB. In contrast, GHB (10 mm for 15 min) was found ineffective on MAP kinase phosphorylation in brain slices, indicating important differences in the conditions required for the second messenger activating action of GHB. γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) naturally occurs in the brain, but its exogenous administration induces profound effects on the central nervous system in animals and humans.

Mathivet P. Bischoff S. Marescaux C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Peripherally administered GHB can readily cross the blood-brain barrier and produces significant behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical effects. Clinically, GHB has been used as an anesthetic agent (2Kleinschmidt S. Schellhase C. Mertzlufft F. Eur. J. Anaesthesiol. 1999; 16: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and dependence (3Gallimberti L. Canton G. Gentile N. Ferri M. Cibin M. Ferrara S.D. Fadda F. Gessa G.L. Lancet. 1989; 2: 787-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), opiate withdrawal (4Rosen M.I. Pearsall H.R. Woods S.W. Kosten T.R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1996; 14: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in sleep disorders (5Mamelak M. Scharf M.B. Woods M. Sleep (Stuttg.). 1986; 9: 285-289Google Scholar). Recently GHB has emerged as a major recreational drug of abuse, and its abuse or intoxication has been associated with a mild euphoria, respiratory depression, headache, vomiting, agitation, seizures, and even death (6Timby N. Eriksson A. Bostrom K. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 518-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Okun M.S. Boothby L.A. Bartfield R.B. Doering P.L. J. Pharmacol.

GHB has been suggested to play a role as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in brain (9Maitre M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 10Cash C.D.

Although the precise mechanisms underlying GHB actions have not been established, accumulating evidence supports that GHB acts via GABAB receptors. For instance, the sedative/hypnotic effect of GHB is entirely mediated by the stimulation of GABAB receptors (17Carai M.A. Colombo G. Brunetti G. Melis S. Serra S. Vacca G. Mastinu S. Pistuddi A.M. Solinas C. Cignarella G. Minardi G. Gessa G.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 428: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and GHB can increase the concentrations of neurosteroids in the brain via a GABAB receptor-mediated mechanism (18Barbaccia M.L. Colombo G. Affricano D. Carai M.A. Vacca G. Melis S. Purdy R.H. Gessa G.L. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, little is known about intracellular signaling pathways possibly regulated by GHB in the central nervous system. The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAP kinase) pathway converts extracellular stimuli at many cell surface receptors including G-protein-coupled receptors into intracellular signals controlling nuclear events and thus plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes (19Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 20Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated the ERK pathway in the mechanisms underlying the actions of many types of substances of abuse (21Nestler E.J. Nat.

Interestingly, GABAB receptor agonists such as baclofen have been shown to promote abstinence and to reduce the use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and nicotine (7Okun M.S. Boothby L.A. Bartfield R.B. Doering P.L. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 4: 167-175Google Scholar, 30Cousins M.S. Roberts D.C. de Wit H. Drug Alcohol Depend. 2002; 65: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the use of GHB in treating alcohol dependence and opioid withdrawal (3Gallimberti L. Canton G. Gentile N. Ferri M. Cibin M. Ferrara S.D. Fadda F. Gessa G.L. Lancet. 1989; 2: 787-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 4Rosen M.I. Pearsall H.R. Woods S.W. Kosten T.R.

Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggest a possible interaction between the intracellular signaling cascades induced by GABAB receptor activation and some psychoactive drugs. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that GHB reduces neuronal excitability and synaptic activity in neocortical and hippocampal neurons via GABAB receptor activation (31Jensen K. Mody I. Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the actions of GHB on ERK1 and -2 (ERK1/2) following acute GHB administration to mice at a high dose (500 mg/kg). We present the first evidence for GHB significantly reducing MAP kinase phosphorylation in mouse cortex and hippocampus specifically via the activation of GABAB receptors. In Vivo Treatment and Slice Preparation—C57Black6 mice, purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN), were maintained in the UCLA Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) vivarium facilities on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The mice had free access to food and water. Six- to 10-week-old mice were used in the present experiments. All our experiments with mice were approved by the UCLA Chancellor's Animal Research Committee in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The dose of GHB (purchased from Sigma), 500 mg/kg (intraperitoneally), was chosen based on previous reports (11Nava F. Carta G. Bortolato M. Gessa G.L. Eur. J.

For abuse purposes, subjects can consume 10s of grams of GHB, which would give rise to millimolar concentrations in the volume of distribution for GHB (32Galloway G.P. Frederick S.L.

CGP56999A, NCS-382, and valproate were administered (intraperitoneal) 10 min prior to GHB administration. All drugs used for in vivo injections were dissolved in sterile saline. At various times following the injections, the mice were anesthetized by halothane and subsequently killed by decapitation. The brains were rapidly dissected, frozen on dry ice, and kept at –80 °C until use for Western blot analysis. For slice preparation, the brain was prepared as above and placed into a cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (mm): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 d-glucose, pH 7.3, while bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The brain was glued to a platform, and 600-μm-thick (for hippocampal subfield dissections after in vivo drug administrations) or 350-μm-thick coronal slices (for the in vitro drug experiments) were cut with a Leica VT1000S vibratome. The slices were incubated for 1 h at 32 °C in bubbled aCSF before further treatment with 10 mm GHB for 15 min (31Jensen K. Mody I. Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 10 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 min, which was used as a positive control (33Kanterewicz B.I. Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The slices were then microdissected into the respective regions under a microscope and/or directly frozen by putting on dry ice and finally kept at –80 °C for protein analysis. Western Blot Analysis—The frontal cortex and hippocampus, or the subregions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus), were homogenized at 4 °C in a lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min, and the supernatant was used for the measurement of protein concentration and phosphorylation analysis. The protein concentration was determined with a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). For phosphorylation analysis of MAP kinases, 5–10 μg of protein was boiled in the 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 12% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue), applied onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel, subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics Inc.), and blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Membrane was incubated with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), the immune complex was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The film was scanned, and the band intensity was analyzed by the NIH Image J software. For the visualization of total MAP kinases, the membrane was stripped with a stripping buffer (0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Tween 20) at 37 °C for 30 min, re-labeled with the primary antibody against total ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs), and detected as described above. In some cases, the membrane was stripped again and labeled with the primary anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Data Analysis—Paired and unpaired t tests were performed. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., with n indicating the number of animals or slices. Significance level was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed test).

We have observed similar behavioral effects of GHB in the mice used in our current experiments (data not shown), but our study focused on the effects of GHB (500 mg/kg) on the regulation of MAP kinase activation by using Western blot analysis. All of our measurements are expressed as the ratio (p/t) of phospho-MAP kinase (p) to total MAP kinase (t). No difference in the total MAP kinase levels was detected in mouse cortex or hippocampus at different times following GHB administration (as compared with β-actin, data not shown). First, we determined the time course of ERK1/2 activation (phosphorylation) after an acute intraperitoneal injection of GHB (500 mg/kg body weight). Control mice were injected with saline, and their brains were prepared at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, following the injection. As there was no difference in the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation between the control mice at the different time points, all control data were pooled. As shown in Fig. 1, a significantly reduced MAP kinase phosphorylation was observed in both frontal cortex and hippocampus (n = 5–7 for each time point of GHB treatment, and a total n = 16 for control). A significant effect of GHB on the MAP kinase phosphorylation in frontal cortex was detected as early as 15 min following GHB injection. Thirty minutes following GHB administration, the phosphorylation levels of MAP kinases were reduced to 52 ± 4% of control in frontal cortex (n = 7) and to 65 ± 6% of control in hippocampus (n = 7). We were able to observe a significant down-regulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation in frontal cortex and hippocampus (to 77 ± 9 and 67 ± 6% of control, respectively, n = 5–7) lasting for at least 2 h following GHB injection (Fig. 1). Possible regional differences in the GHB-dependent regulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation specific to various cortical and hippocampal subfields were identified by microdissecting the 600-μm-thick slices in ice-cold solution into the respective brain regions. The brain regions, including somatosensory cortex and CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus, were then subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, GHB-induced down-regulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation was detected only in CA1 (to 30 ± 3% of control, n = 6–8) and CA3 (to 45 ± 7% of control, n = 6–8) but not in DG (to 102 ± 10% of the control, n = 4–6). A clear GHB-induced decrease (to 70 ± 5% of control, n = 4–7) in MAP kinase phosphorylation was also detected in the somatosensory cortex. The Effect of GHB on MAP Kinase Phosphorylation Is Not Mediated through the High Affinity GHB Receptor—Because certain effects of GHB have been proposed to occur via high affinity GHB receptors (9Maitre M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 37Snead III, O.C. Brain Res. 1994; 659: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Snead III, O.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we addressed this point by using the specific GHB receptor antagonist NCS-382 in a separate set of experiments. We found that the phosphorylation levels of MAP kinases in frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals treated with GHB (500 mg/kg for 30 min) were 57 ± 8% of control and 60 ± 21% of control, respectively, whereas the phosphorylation levels of MAP kinases in frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals pre-treated with NCS-382 (200 mg/kg) were 50 ± 8% of control and 50 ± 13% of control (n = 5–7). There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups. By itself, NCS-382 (200 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of MAP kinase in the frontal cortex (85 ± 15% of control) or hippocampus (82 ± 10% of control; n = 5). Because pretreatment with NCS-382 (200 mg/kg) failed to reverse GHB-induced inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation, the proposed high affinity GHB receptors appear to play no role in mediating the GHB-induced inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation. GHB Affects MAP Kinase Phosphorylation by Acting GABAB Receptors—We next examined the role of GABAB receptors in the GHB-induced inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, a pretreatment with the specific GABAB receptor antagonist CGP56999A (20 mg/kg) administered 10 min before GHB prevented the inhibitory effect of GHB (500 mg/kg) on MAP kinase phosphorylation both in cortex and hippocampus, demonstrating that GABAB receptors are involved in diminishing MAP kinase phosphorylation by GHB. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, we also found that CGP56999A alone, at the dose used (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), significantly up-regulated the phosphorylation of MAP kinases in the hippocampus (170 ± 14.4% of control, n = 5) but not in the cortex (102 ± 17% of control, n = 5). We also used baclofen, a well known selective GABAB receptor agonist, as a positive control for GABAB receptor activation. Similar to GHB, baclofen (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) significantly decreased the phosphorylation of MAP kinases in the cortex (to 33 ± 3% of control, n = 5) and hippocampus (to 53 ± 12% of control, n = 5), further confirming the role of activation of GABAB receptors in MAP kinase signaling (Fig. 3). GABA Is Not an Intermediate in the GHB-induced Inhibition of MAP Kinase Phosphorylation—We sought to determine whether the inhibitory effect of GHB on MAP kinase phosphorylation was due to the activation of GABAB receptors by GABA that was converted from the exogenously administered GHB. We used valproate, a compound known to inhibit GHB dehydrogenase, hence preventing the conversion of GHB into GABA (9Maitre M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 39Hechler V. Ratomponirina C. Maitre M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation levels in GHB-treated animals were 57 ± 8% of control and 60 ± 21% of control in frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively (n = 5–7), whereas the phosphorylation levels in valproate plus GHB-treated animals were 40 ± 9% of control and 48 ± 29% of control in frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively (n = 5–7), indicating that blocking the conversion of GHB to GABA by valproate failed to prevent GHB-reduced MAP kinase phosphorylation. Thus, GHB-induced inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation most likely results from the direct activation of GABAB receptors by GHB. In addition, a significant inhibitory effect of valproate (n = 5) on MAP kinase phosphorylation was observed in the frontal cortex (52 ± 7% of control) and hippocampus (62 ± 13% of control). GHB Is Ineffective in Brain Slices—We finally compared the effects of GHB administration in vivo and in vitro (brain slices), because we have shown previously in brain slices that GHB activates GABAB receptors in neocortical and hippocampal neurons (31Jensen K. Mody I. Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the inhibitory effect of GHB on MAP kinase phosphorylation was remarkable in vivo (Figs. 1, 2, 3), GHB (10 mm for 15 min) caused no obvious change in MAP kinase phosphorylation in cortical and hippocampal slices (Fig. 4). To address whether MAP kinases could be phosphorylated in brain slices, we also included hydrogen peroxide as a positive control. We confirmed a previous report (33Kanterewicz B.I. Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that this compound induced a significant increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation in brain slices. We also wanted to find out whether the altered phosphorylation of MAP kinase could be maintained in vitro. The effect of GHB on MAP kinase phosphorylation in vivo was long lasting, as we were able to detect a significant down-regulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation in cortex and hippocampus (77 ± 9 and 67 ± 6% of control, respectively, n = 5–7) even 2 h following GHB injection (Fig. 1 and Fig. 5). In contrast to our in vivo findings, in vitro incubation in aCSF of brain slices prepared 30 min after animals were acutely treated with GHB (500 mg/kg) resulted in the recovery of the MAP kinase phosphorylation to control levels (Fig. 5). In addition, we also examined whether slice cutting procedure itself would affect MAP kinase phosphorylation. One whole brain was cut into two equal halves; half was immediately put on dry ice, and the other half was cut into slices in cold aCSF. No differences were observed in the level of MAP kinase phosphorylation between the intact and sliced brain (data not shown). Acute GHB administration in humans or animals induces profound physiological effects. Previously we have demonstrated that GHB, at millimolar concentration in vitro, reduces neuronal excitability and synaptic activity in both neocortical and hippocampal neurons mediated via GABAB receptors (31Jensen K. Mody I. Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our current experiments, we chose a high of dose of GHB (500 mg/kg), because the concentration of GHB in cerebrospinal fluid or brain in animals and in humans, after an exogenous administration at this dose, reached millimolar levels (14Gobaille S. Hechler V. Andriamampandry C. Kemmel V. Maitre M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 303-309PubMed Google Scholar, 40Snead III, O.C. Yu P.K. Huttenlocher P.R.

Pharmacol. 1979; 25: 241-256PubMed Google Scholar), compatible with the affinity of GABAB receptors for GHB (43Berton F. Brancucci A. Beghe F. Cammalleri M. Demuro A. Francesconi W. Gessa G.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Acute administration of GHB (500 mg/kg) in vivo caused a rapid and long lasting inhibition on MAP kinase phosphorylation in both frontal cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1). The mechanisms whereby GHB exerts its effects in the central nervous system are still poorly understood. In general, two modes of GHB action have been proposed: through GABAB receptors or via high affinity GHB receptors that have been suggested to exist in the brain (9Maitre M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 37Snead III, O.C. Brain Res. 1994; 659: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Snead III, O.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). According to binding studies, some actions of GHB may be mediated via highly specific membrane-binding sites (9Maitre M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) that appear to have a different regional distribution than GABAB-binding sites in rodent brain (37Snead III, O.C. Brain Res. 1994; 659: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More recently the high affinity GHB receptor has been suggested to be a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (38Snead III, O.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The overwhelming evidence favors GABAB-receptor-mediated actions of GHB, as many effects of GHB on the central nervous system show striking similarities to the effects produced by the selective GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen and can be attenuated by specific GABAB-receptor antagonists (11Nava F.

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41 complex, which is responsible for receptor attachment and membrane fusion, represents an extreme example of a coevolving complex as up to 35% amino acid sequence divergence has been observed in these proteins among HIV-1 isolates. In this study, the function of conserved gp120 contact residues, Leu593, Trp596, Gly597, Lys601, and Trp610 within the disulfide-bonded region of gp41, was examined in envelope glycoproteins derived from diverse HIV-1 isolates. We found that the gp120-gp41 association function of the disulfide-bonded region is conserved. However, the contribution of individual residues to gp41 folding and/or stability, gp120-gp41 association, membrane fusion function, and viral entry varied from isolate to isolate. In gp120-gp41 derived from the dual-tropic isolate, HIV-189.6, the importance of Trp596 for fusion function was dependent on the chemokine receptor utilized as a fusion cofactor. Thus, the engagement of alternative chemokine receptors may evoke distinct fusion-activation signals involving the site of gp120-gp41 association. An examination of chimeric glycoproteins revealed that the isolate-specific functional contributions of particular gp120-contact residues are influenced by the sequence of gp120 hypervariable regions 1, 2, and 3. These data indicate that the gp120-gp41 association site is structurally and functionally adaptable, perhaps to maintain a functional glycoprotein complex in a setting of host selective pressures driving the rapid coevolution of gp120 and gp41.

The chemokine receptor preference of HIV-1 isolates is determined largely by V3 sequences, with the CCR5 to CXCR4 switch being generally associated with increased positive charge in V3, often in conjunction with sequence changes in V1V2 and C4 (see Ref. 35Hoffman N.G.

The sites of gp120-gp41 contact have been mapped by in vitro mutagenesis to conserved residues within the disulfide-bonded region of gp41 and in the extremities of C1 and C5 of gp120 (Fig. 1A) (36Helseth E.

The reduction of one such covalently associated gp120-gp41 complex, linked through cysteines introduced at residues 501 of gp120 and 605 of gp41, led to the restoration of cell-cell fusion and entry function indicating that the engineered intersubunit disulfide had formed in a functional Env context (39Abrahamyan L.G.

Gp120-gp41 represents an extreme example of a coevolving protein-protein complex with V1, V2, and V3 amino acid sequences diverging by 77, 36, and 46%, respectively, over 7 years in an infected individual, whereas up to 35% sequence divergence has been observed in Env among HIV-1 pandemic strains (24Kuiken C.L.

In this study, we examined the functional contribution of 5 conserved gp120 contact residues of the gp41 disulfide-bonded region (37Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in the context of Env sequence evolution. Whereas the overall gp120-gp41 association function of the disulfide-bonded region was conserved in Envs from diverse HIV-1 strains, the relative contribution of the individual residues to gp120-anchoring and membrane fusion varied among the strains tested and depended on V1V2 and V3 sequences. These results suggest that the coevolution of gp120 and gp41 is associated with changes to the functional contribution of conserved amino acids in the gp120-gp41 association site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHIV-1 Env Expression Vectors—The following HIV-1 molecular clones were used for derivation of pCDNA3.1/myc-HisA+ (Invitrogen)-based env expression vectors: pAD8 (43Theodore T.S.

The env region was excised from pAD8 with EcoRI and EspI and this fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-EcoRV sites of pCDNA3.1 to give pCDNA3.1-AD8env. The env region of p89.6 was excised using HindIII and EcoRV and then cloned into the corresponding sites of pCDNA3.1 to give pCDNA3.1-89.6env. The KpnI env gene fragments of pSVIII-92UG024.2 and pSVIII-92UG037.8 were cloned into the KpnI sites of pCDNA3.1-89.6env. QH0515.1, QH1549.13, and QH1521.34 KpnI-XbaI env gene fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites in pCDNA3.1-89.6env. Finally, a BH8 env gene fragment was excised from pTMenv.2 using KpnI and SalI and ligated into the KpnI-XhoI sites of pCDNA3.1-89.6env. In vitro mutagenesis was carried out by standard overlap extension PCR techniques. For the sequential isolates, QH0515.1 and QH1549.13, the L593V, W596L, G597A, K601E, and W610F mutations were first introduced into QH1549.13 Env and the wild-type and mutagenized gene fragments encompassing gp41 residues Ser546 to Thr612 used to replace the corresponding region of QH0515.1. BH8-AD8 Env chimeras were made by replacing the V1V2-C2-V3 (DraIII-Bsu36I fragment, AD8V1-3), V1V2 (DraIII-StuI, AD8V1V2), or V3 (AseI-Bsu36I, AD8V3) regions of BH8 with those of AD8 in pcDNA3.1-BH8env. The AD8120 chimera contains AD8 gp120 linked to BH8 gp41 through the common subtilisin cleavage sequence Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg and was constructed using overlap extension PCR. The sequences of mutated Env regions were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using the ABI prism method.Cells—293T and BHK-21 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium). The cells (250,000 cells per 4.5-mm2 well of Linbro 12-well culture dishes, ICN Biomedicals Inc. Aurora, OH) were transfected by the FuGENE 6 procedure (Roche Applied Science).

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C prior to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose prior to Western blotting with mAb C8 or mAb 2F5 using the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Roche Applied Science).Biosynthetic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—At 16 h post-transfection, 293T cells were incubated for 30 min in cysteine- and methionine-deficient medium (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and then labeled for 45 min with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN). The cells were then washed and chased in complete medium for 4.5 h prior to lysis. In most experiments, incubations were performed at 37 °C. However, for 92UG037, QH1521#34, QH0515#1, and QH1549#13, the pulse and chase were performed at 35 °C for enhanced gp160 processing. Cell lysates and clarified culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described previously (51Poumbourios P. Wilson K.A. Center R.J. El Ahmar W. Kemp B.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2041-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using IgG#14.Surface Biotinylation—At 24 h post-transfection, 293T cells were chilled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with 1.25 mm sulfo-NHS long chain biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min on ice. The biotinylated cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and quenched with 50 mm glycine/PBS, pH 8.0 (500 μl), for 30 min on ice. The cells were lysed by the addition of 170 μl of ice-cold 4% Triton X-100, 2.4 m KCl, 0.2 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and precleared with bovine serum albumin-Sepharose CL-4B for 16 h at 4 °C. Envelope proteins were immunoprecipitated from the precleared cell lysates with IgG#14 and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylated Env proteins were visualized following SDS-PAGE on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions, transfer to nitrocellulose and blotting with neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science).Luciferase Reporter Assay for Cell to Cell Fusion—Luciferase reporter assays for cell to cell fusion were performed as described with minor modifications (37Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 293T effector cells were transfected with Env-expression constructs and then infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 at 5 h post-transfection for expression of T7 RNA polymerase (52Moss B.

At 24 h post-transfection, effectors and targets were resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium containing 1 μg/ml actinomycin D and 40 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside and cocultured for a further 3 (BHK-21) or 16 h (293T) at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega luciferase assay system.Single Cycle Infectivity Assays—Env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses were produced by cotransfecting 293T cells (350,000 cells per well of a 6-well Linbro culture plate) with 1 μg of Env expression vector and 1 μg of luciferase reporter virus vector pNL4.3.Luc.R-E- (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from N.

Supernatants containing pseudotyped virions were harvested at 72 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. The ability of wild type and mutated Env to mediate infection via CCR5 was assessed in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells. The cells (60,000 cells per well of a 48-well plate, Greiner Labtek) were infected with 200 μl of virus-containing supernatant for 18 h, after which the inoculum was replaced with 500 μl of complete medium. At 52 h postinfection, the cells were assayed with the Promega luciferase assay system using a Berthold Microlumat LB luminometer. The ability of wild-type and mutated Env to mediate infection via CXCR4 was assessed in 293T cells (250,000 cells per well of a 12 well plate) that had been transiently transfected with 1 μg of pc.FUSIN and 1 μg of pCDNA.T4 24 h previously (37Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with 800 μl of pseudotyped virus-containing supernatant for 18 h after which the virus inoculum was replaced with 2 ml of complete medium. The cells were assayed for luciferase activity at 50 h postinfection. The protein composition of pseudotyped virions was assessed by first pelleting the virions from 9 ml of culture supernatant through a 1.5-ml 25% (w/v) sucrose/PBS cushion (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor, 25,000 rpm, 2.5 h, 4 °C) followed by reducing SDS-PAGE in 7.5-15% polyacrylamide gradient gels and Western blotting with IgG#14 and DV-012.RESULTSPreviously, we identified five conserved residues, Leu593, Trp596, Gly597, Lys601, and Trp610, in the disulfide-bonded region of gp41 that are important for association with gp120 for a T cell line-adapted (TCLA) HIV-1 isolate BH8. We reasoned that these residues cluster in the gp120 association site and are likely to play a role in receptor-induced conformational changes in gp120-gp41, leading to gp41 fusion activation (Fig. 1A) (37Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The functional role of these residues may differ in primary strains as the gp120-gp41 complex of such strains exhibit greater stability and resistance to neutralization with soluble CD4 (sCD4) when compared with TCLA HIV-1 (54Moore J.P. McKeating J.A. Huang Y.X. Ashkenazi A. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 235-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subtle functional differences in gp120-gp41 of primary strains relating to chemokine receptor specificity have also been observed. For example, suboptimal sCD4 concentrations lead to enhanced entry by R5 virus"
https://openalex.org/W2045623105,"As part of a program for the development of synthetic vaccines against the pathogen Shigella flexneri, we used a combination of NMR and molecular modeling methods to study the conformations of the O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) of S. flexneri 5a and of four related synthetic pentasaccharide fragments. The NMR study, based on the analysis of 1H and 13C chemical shifts, the evaluation of inter-residue distances, and the measurement of one- and three-bond heteronuclear coupling constants, showed that the conformation of one of the four pentasaccharides is similar to that of the native O-SP in solution. Interestingly, inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that a protective monoclonal antibody specific for S. flexneri 5a has a greater affinity for this pentasaccharide than for the others. We carried out a complete conformational search on the pentasaccharides using the CICADA algorithm interfaced with MM3 force field. We calculated Boltzmann-averaged inter-residue distances and 3JC,H coupling constants for the different conformational families and compared the results with NMR data for all pentasaccharides. Our experimental data are consistent with only one conformational family. We also used molecular modeling data to build models of the O-SP with the molecular builder program POLYS. The models that are in agreement with NMR data adopt right-handed 3-fold helical structures in which the branched glucosyl residue points outwards.

The potential of CPSs as vaccine candidates against bacterial infections was demonstrated in the early 1930s, and several polysaccharide vaccines such as those targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella typhi are now commercially available (2Cadoz M. Vaccine. 1998; 16: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, these vaccines are ineffective in infants, thus polysaccharide:protein conjugate vaccines were developed, as illustrated by the Haemophilus influenzae b and N. meningitidis Group C vaccines that became available recently (3Wenger J.D.

Several laboratories are studying glycoconjugate vaccines derived from detoxified LPSs as protein conjugates involving the polysaccharide moiety of LPSs have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans (5Robbins J.B.

However, it would still be an advantage if we could improve the immunogenicity of such conjugates, although this may be difficult as we do not know much about the critical parameters.

We are currently trying to develop such an alternative, targeting a synthetic vaccine against Shigella flexneri infections. S. flexneri is a Gram-negative bacillus that is responsible for the endemic form of shigellosis, a dysenteric syndrome. The disease, characterized by bacterial invasion of the human colonic mucosa (6Sansonetti P. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: S285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), causes a high rate of mortality among infants, particularly in developing countries (7Kotloff K.L. Winickoff J.P. Ivanoff B. Clemens J.D. Swedlow P.J. Sansonetti P.J. Adak G.K. Levine M.M. Bull. W. H. O. 1999; 77: 651-666PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the O-specific polysaccharide moiety (O-SP) of the LPS is the major target of the protective immune response. Indeed, protein conjugates of the polysaccharide moiety of S. flexneri serotype 2a appear to be promising vaccine candidates (8Passwell J.H. Harlev E. Ashkenazi S. Chu C. Miron D. Ramon R. Farzan N.

There is a close relationship between the shape and biological function of polysaccharides, and it is assumed that knowledge of the conformational behavior of the bacterial surface polysaccharide in solution may help the mimic approach. Indeed, the pioneering work by Lemieux et al. (9Lemieux R.U. Bock K. Delbaere L.T.J. Koto S. Rao V.S. Can. J. Chem. 1980; 58: 631-653Crossref Google Scholar), and the development of powerful new NMR and molecular modeling methods for conformational analysis, have made it possible to study the conformation of bacterial polysaccharides in detail (10Bush C.A.

Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frame-shifted di-, tri-, tetra- and pentasaccharide fragments of the O-SP 5a, all bearing the characteristic EB segment, have been synthesized recently as their methyl glycosides with the natural anomeric configuration at their reducing end (13Mulard L.A.

Chem. 2002; 15: 2486-2498Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether short fragments have some of the conformational features of the O-SP 5a, we compared the conformations of the four possible pentasaccharides 1, 2, 3, and 4 specific for the O-SP 5a (Fig. 1) with that of the native O-SP. Given the putative flexible nature of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, we used a combination of NMR and molecular modeling to study the conformational properties of these molecules. We also used inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to investigate the recognition of a S. flexneri 5a-specific monoclonal antibody for these pentasaccharides. The NMR conformational study was based on the analysis of 1H and 13C chemical shifts, the calculation of inter-residue distances, and the measurement of heteronuclear 3JC,H coupling constants across the glycosidic linkages that are related to Φ and Ψ torsion angles in a Karplus-type relationship (18Tvaroska I. Hricovini M. Petrakova E. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 189: 359-362Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The 3JC,H coupling constants were determined by two different techniques, EXSIDE (excitation-sculptured indirect-detection experiments) (19Krishnamurthy V.V. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 121: 33-41Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and gradient-selected J-HMBC experiments (gs-J-HMBC) (20Willker W. Leibfritz D. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1995; 33: 632-638Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The molecular modeling of the pentasaccharides involved a complete conformational search with the CICADA algorithm (21Koca J. Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 137-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) interfaced with MM3 force field (22Allinger N.L. Yuh Y.H. Lii J.H. J. Am. Chem.

Boltzmann-averaged inter-residue distances and 3JC,H coupling constants were calculated for the conformers generated and compared with NMR data for all frame-shifted pentasaccharides. As the regular helical conformation of polysaccharides in their solid state (27Chandrasekaran R. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1997; 52: 311-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can be used as starting point for studying their behavior in solution, the possible helical shapes of the O-SP 5a were determined by means of a molecular builder, POLYS (28Engelsen S.B. Cros S. Mackie W. Pérez S. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 417-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which combines a data base of monosaccharide structures with conformational information on disaccharide fragments. Based on the comparison of the NMR and molecular modeling data described herein with those obtained for the S. flexneri variant Y polysaccharide (29Bock K. Josephson S. Bundle D.R. J. Chem. Soc., Perkins Trans. 1982; 2: 59-70Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (O-SP Y), the repeating unit of which is the tetrasaccharide I, we paid particular attention to the effect of the branched glucosyl residue E on the conformational properties of O-SP 5a. Material—Pentasaccharides 1, 2, 3, and 4 were dissolved in 600 μl of deuterium oxide to final concentrations of 28, 30, 24, and 12.7 mm, respectively. The O-SP 5a was prepared by acid hydrolysis of the LPS as described previously (30Taylor D.N. Trofa A.C. Sadoff J. Chu C. Bryla D. Shiloach J. Cohen D. Ashkenazi S. Lerman Y. Egan W. Schneerson R. Robbins J.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3678-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the purified O-SP was composed of an average of 15 repeating units. About 10 mg of O-SP 5a were dissolved in 400 μl of deuterium oxide. Nomenclature—The two torsion angles describing a glycosidic linkage are defined as Φ = O5-C1-O1-C′X and Ψ = C1-O1-C′X-C′X + 1 where the C′ atoms belong to the reducing side, and the sign is in agreement with the IUPAC nomenclature (31IUPAC-IUB Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 145: 405-621Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were recorded on Varian Inova spectrometers, operating at 1H frequencies of 500 and 600 MHz, equipped with a triple resonance pulsed field gradient probe with an actively shielded z gradient. Chemical shifts are given relative to an external standard of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5 sulfonate (DSS) at 0 ppm for both 13C and 1H chemical shifts. DQF-COSY (32Rance M. Sorensen O.W.

Tetrahedron. 2002; 58: 2593-2604Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Mulard L.A. Clément M.J. Imberty A. Delepierre M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 15: 2486-2498Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), at 35 or 38 °C for the pentasaccharides and at 50 °C for the O-SP 5a. The 3JH,H coupling constants were obtained from a one-dimensional spectrum with a digital resolution of 0.1 Hz/point or from the DQF-COSY experiment with a digital resolution of 0.5 Hz/point. The 1JC1,H1 coupling constants were measured from the gHMBC spectrum with a digital resolution of 0.5 Hz/point. The NOESY experiments were carried out at 10 °C with mixing periods of 100, 200, 400, and 600 ms for the pentasaccharides and at 50 °C with mixing periods of 80, 100, 200, and 300 ms for the O-SP to obtain build-up curves. Two different methods were used to measure long range heteronuclear 3JC,H coupling constants, EXSIDE (19Krishnamurthy V.V. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 121: 33-41Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and gs-J-HMBC (20Willker W. Leibfritz D. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1995; 33: 632-638Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). With EXSIDE, all proton band-selective π pulses were Gaussian cascade Q3 pulses (37Emsley L. Bodenhausen G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 135-148Google Scholar) with phase modulation to achieve off-resonance inversion. They were generated using the Pandora's Box pulse-shaping program available in the Varian software. Sixteen scans of 2048 complex points were collected for each of the 512 t1 increments. A J-scaling factor (N) of 15 was applied. A recovery delay of 2.5 s was used prior to each scan. The spectra were transformed after zero filling to 2048 × 4096 complex points using the unshifted Gaussian window function along the F1 and F2 dimensions. In EXSIDE spectra, the 3JC,H coupling constants were measured in the F1 dimension with a digital resolution of 0.3 Hz/point. For the gs-J-HMBC experiments, nine two-dimensional spectra were acquired with 16 and 96 scans per increment (356 t1 increments) for the pentasaccharides and the O-SP 5a, respectively. A constant time delay τmax of 230 ms and τ values from 50 to 220 ms were used. The 3JC,H coupling constant values were obtained by measuring cross-peak intensities as a function of τ and fitting them to the equation, y = A sin (πnJC,Hτ). Indeed, the intensity, s(t1,t2), of a particular correlation in a HMBC spectrum depends on the amplitude of the long range JC,H and can be described by the following equation (20Willker W. Leibfritz D. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1995; 33: 632-638Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38Clore G.M. Bax A. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar): s(t1,t2) = exp[–(Δ + τmax + t1 + t2)/T2]sin(πnJC,Ht2)[cos[πJHk(Δ + τmax + t1 + t2)]sin(πnJC,Hτ), where Δ = (2 1JC,H)–1. The 13C spin-lattice relaxation times of O-SP 5a were measured at 125 MHz by means of two-dimensional double-INEPT-type inverse-detected experiments with suppression of cross-correlations (39Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). Eight experiments were performed with relaxation delays, τ, ranging from 0.005 to 1 s. T1 values were deduced by measuring the cross-peak intensities as a function of T and fitting the volumes to the equation, y = A exp(–τ/T1). The estimated error on the data points was 5 noise root mean square deviation. All two-dimensional data, except for EXSIDE and HMBC data, were collected in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn method (40States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286Google Scholar). Calculation of Inter-proton Distances from Cross-peak Volumes—The cross-peak volumes from off-resonance ROESY (400-ms mixing time) and NOESY experiments were measured with the VNMR software. The distances between neighboring protons were calculated by use of the usual 1/r6 NOE/distance relationship (41Baleja J. Moult J. Sykes B.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 375Google Scholar). NOE-derived distances were obtained from initial NOE build-up rates, which were calculated by fitting NOE volumes at the different mixing times. The intra-residue distance of 2.52 Å between the H-1 and H-2 protons of the α-rhamnose unit B was used as a reference for distance calibration. Energy Calculations—All geometry optimization steps were performed using the molecular mechanics program, MM3 (22Allinger N.L. Yuh Y.H. Lii J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8551-8556Crossref Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 23Allinger N.L. Rahman M. Lii J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8293-8307Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The block-diagonal minimization method was used for geometry optimization, with the default energy-convergence criterion (0.00008*n kcal/mol per five iterations, n = number of atoms). The dielectric constant was set at 78 to attenuate the effect of hydrogen bonding on the potential energy surface. Starting Models—All the disaccharides and oligosaccharides were built using MONOBANK, a data base of the three-dimensional structures of monosaccharides (42Pérez S. Delage M.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 212: 523-529Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Relaxed Energy Maps of the Disaccharides—The five disaccharides constituting the O-SP 5a were the subject of a systematic grid search study for the conformation of the glycosidic linkage. The calculations were performed on disaccharide methyl glycosides. Starting from minimized disaccharides, the Φ and Ψ torsion angles were increased by 20° steps over the whole range, whereas the molecular mechanics program, MM3, provided full geometry relaxation. Several maps were calculated for each disaccharide to take into account several possible orientations of the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups. A maximum of 24 starting geometries were needed to take into account the two most stable staggered orientations of the hydroxymethyl groups, referred to as gg and gt, and the two possible networks of secondary hydroxyl groups around each ring referred to as clockwise and counterclockwise. For each disaccharide, the results of these calculations were projected on a so-called adiabatic map where only the conformer with the lowest energy for each (Φ,Ψ) value is considered. Iso-energy contours were then plotted by interpolation of 1 kcal/mol within an 8 kcal/mol window. CICADA Calculations—The potential energy surface of the pentasaccharides was explored with the CICADA program (43Koca J. J. Mol. Struct. (Theochem). 1994; 308: 13-24Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Input for the CICADA program, which is an interface to the MM3 force field, consists mainly of one or a few conformers in MM3 format and a file containing the list of torsion angles to be driven and/or monitored. During the CICADA calculations, each selected torsion angle is driven one after the other in each direction from the initial conformation at a given increment. For the pentasaccharides, the driven torsion angles were Φ and Ψ at each linkage and the torsion angle of each hydroxymethyl group (O5-C5-C6-O6), leading to a dimensionality of 10 for the potential energy surface to be explored. The torsion angles of the N-acetyl group (C1-C2-N-C8) and of all the secondary hydroxyl groups were monitored but not driven. The increment step was set at 20°, and two conformations were considered to be different when one of the driven or monitored angles differed by at least 30°. A relative energy cut-off of 50 kcal/mol was applied for exploring the potential energy surface. The search was stopped when no new conformers with energy lower than 5 kcal/mol could be detected. Analysis of the Potential Energy Surface—The conformations and transition states found by CICADA were analyzed by the PANIC program (44Koca J. J. Mol. Struct. 1993; 291: 255-269Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which explores the paths along the potential energy surface. Conformations were clustered into families within an energy window of 5 kcal/mol with the FAMILY program (45Imberty A. Pérez S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In our study, a conformer was considered to belong to a conformational family if at least one of its torsion angles differed by less than 10° from at least one of the conformers of the family. Their population was calculated as for the relative importance of each family. The relative population of the ith conformational state, Pi, with energy, Ei, is dictated by the Boltzmann distribution, Pi = exp(–Ei/kT)/ exp(–Ei/kT). Calculations of Theoretical Distances and Coupling Constants—For each pentasaccharide, Boltzmann-averaged interproton distance 〈r–6〉 matrices and 〈3JC,H〉 coupling constants were calculated for the two lowest energy conformational families and for the average of all conformational families with a population of more than 1% at 298 K. The 3JC,H coupling constants were calculated by use of a Karplus-type equation, 3JC,H = 5.7 cos2 θH – 0.6 cos θH + 0.5, for C-O-C-H segments (18Tvaroska I. Hricovini M. Petrakova E. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 189: 359-362Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We then used the fractional population (Pi) for each conformational microstate, to calculate the average interproton distances and coupling constants as follows: 〈r〉 = (Σ Pi.r–6)⅙ and 〈3JC,H〉 = Σ Pi.3JC,H. Construction of the O-SP 5a—Possible conformations of the O-SP 5a were modeled using the molecular builder, POLYS (28Engelsen S.B. Cros S. Mackie W. Pérez S. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 417-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different polysaccharide fragments containing six repeating units were constructed using all the combinations of the energy-minima obtained from adiabatic energy maps calculated on the disaccharides constituting it. The models that did not present serious steric conflicts were submitted to a POLYS procedure that optimized the values of Φ and Ψ at each glycosidic linkage to give the closest regular fold helical symmetry. Inhibition ELISA—A standard curve was established with IgGC20, a protective monoclonal antibody specific for S. flexneri 5a. 2A. Phalipon, unpublished data. Different concentrations of the antibody were maintained at 4 °C overnight and then placed in microtiter plates coated with purified S. flexneri 5a LPS at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in carbonate buffer at pH 9.6 and previously incubated with 1% PBS/bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was added at a dilution of 1:5000 (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%), the substrate was added (12 mg of p-nitrophenylphosphate in 1.2 ml of Tris, HCl buffer, pH 8.8, and 10.8 ml of 5 m NaCl). Once the color had developed, the plate was read at 405 nm (Dinatech MR 4000 microplate reader). A standard curve OD = f(antibody concentration) was fitted to the quadratic equation Y = aX2 + bX + c, where Y is the OD, and X is the antibody concentration. Correlation factors (r2) of 0.99 were routinely obtained. The amount of oligosaccharides that inhibited the binding of IgGC20 to LPS by 50% (IC50) was then determined as follows. A given concentration of IgGC20 (the minimal concentration of antibody that gave the maximal OD on the standard curve) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various concentrations of each of the oligosaccharides to be tested, in 1% PBS/bovine serum albumin. Unbound IgGC20 was measured as described above using microtiter plates coated with purified LPS from S. flexneri 5a, and the antibody concentration was deduced from the standard curve. IC50 was then determined. NMR Spectroscopy—The protons and carbons of the methyl glycosides 3 and 4 and those of the O-SP 5a were assigned as described previously for pentasaccharides 1 (16Mulard L.A. Clément M.J. Ségat-Dioury F. Delepierre M. Tetrahedron. 2002; 58: 2593-2604Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and 2 (17Mulard L.A. Clément M.J. Imberty A. Delepierre M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 15: 2486-2498Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra such as DQF-COSY, TOCSY, gHSQC, gHMBC and gHSQC-TOCSY, which are the only means of overcoming all ambiguities. Given that different references were used, the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the O-SP 5a determined here are in good agreement with those published previously (46Jansson P.E. Kenne L. Wehler T. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 166: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 47Jansson P.E. Kenne L. Wehler T. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Comparison of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the pentasaccharides with those of the O-SP 5a showed that the lack of a third branching sugar on residue B of pentasaccharides 1 and 3 affects not only residue B but also internal residues (see Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). For example, the chemical shifts of the H-2C, H-3C, and C-3C of 1 and of the H-4A, H-5A, and C-5A of 3 did not coincide with those of the corresponding atoms in the native O-SP. Moreover, all the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of internal residues of pentasaccharide 4 were similar to those of the O-SP 5a, with the exception of protons H-1B and H-5B (see Tables I and II). For pentasaccharide 2, many more proton and carbon differences were observed (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).Table I1H NMR chemical shiftsHydrogen atomsCompound4O-SP 5aO-SP YaData taken from Ref. 29.H-1A5.115.105.12H-2A4.124.124.13H-3A3.863.863.84H-4A3.313.303.31H-5A3.663.663.67H-6A1.231.221.22H-1B5.235.205.11H-2B4.254.244.04H-3B3.993.973.91H-4B3.583.583.46H-5B3.803.763.72H-6B1.301.311.29H-1C4.664.844.84H-2C3.973.833.85H-3C3.753.763.74H-4C3.543.533.53H-5C3.693.984.00H-6C1.281.211.22H-1D4.724.754.71H-2D3.683.803.82H-3D3.553.623.64H-4D3.393.463.50H-5D3.443.463.43H-6D3.913.923.90H-6′D3.713.723.74N-AcD2.042.04H-1E5.075.06H-2E3.583.57H-3E3.773.77H-4E3.433.42H-5E3.903.90H-6E3.823.81H-6′E3.763.75a Data taken from Ref. 29Bock K.

Previous work on PutP suggests an involvement of the region ranging from Asp-55 to Gly-58 in binding of Na+ and/or proline (Pirch, T., Quick, M., Nietschke, M., Langkamp, M., Jung, H. (2002) J. Biol.

Members of the SSSF share a common topological motif of 13 α-helical domains whereby N- or C-terminal extensions may occur (3Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

We use the Na+/proline transporter PutP of Escherichia coli as a model system to study the mechanism of sodium motive forcedriven substrate uptake. The putP gene has been cloned and sequenced and the gene product has been solubilized, purified, and shown to be solely responsible for sodium-coupled uptake of proline in a reconstituted system (8Hanada K.

Obviously, missing information on the three-dimensional structure is limiting access to the molecular mechanism of Na+-coupled substrate transport. Because NMR and crystallization approaches have proven unsuccessful for members of the SSSF until now, genetic and biochemical methods are used to elucidate structure-function relationships. Analyses of PutP have identified amino acid residues crucial for PutP function (11Jung H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Asp-187 in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains (TM) V and VI is one of these residues and has been proposed to participate in the coupling of Na+ and proline transport (12Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Particular attention has recently been paid to the role of amino acids in putative TM II in PutP function. Asp-55 in the TM has been identified as the only negatively charged amino acid of the N-terminal domain of PutP essential for function and has been proposed to participate in binding of the coupling ion (13Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetic and Cys accessibility analyses implicate Ser-57 and Gly-58 in Na+ and proline binding and suggest partly overlapping binding sites of both ligands (14Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, Arg-40 located at the cytoplasmic end of TM II is crucial for coupling of Na+ and proline transport (16Quick M. Stölting S. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To extend knowledge on the role of TM II for PutP function, a complete Cys scanning mutagenesis of the TM (amino acid positions 41 to 65) has been performed in this study. Analysis of the consequences of the amino acid substitutions for transporter function identified amino acids that are crucial for transport in addition to the previously analyzed residues at positions 55, 57, and 58. Furthermore, Cys accessibility analyses suggest a participation of TM II in the formation of a hydrophilic cleft or half-channel in the membrane and implicate the TM in ligand-induced conformational alterations.

E. coli WG170 (F– trp lacZ rpsL thi Δ(putPA)101 proP219) (18Stalmach M.E. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 481-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring the given plasmids were used for overexpression of the putP gene and transport assays. The following plasmids, derivatives of pT7-5 (19Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar), containing the lac promoter/operator for expression of the putP gene were used for all gene manipulations: pT7-5/putP and pT7-5/putP(ΔCys), each of which harbors a cassette version of the putP gene encoding PutP wild-type and an engineered transporter devoid of all five native Cys residues (PutP(ΔCys)), respectively, and a C-terminal attached amino acid sequence resembling the FLAG epitope and a His6 tag (5Jung H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Every amino acid of TM II was individually replaced with Cys by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pT7–5/putP(ΔCys) as a template and synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotides in one- or two-step PCR reactions using Taq-DNA polymerase. PCR fragments were digested with ApaI and XbaI and ligated with similarly treated plasmid pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) additionally incubated with alkaline phosphatase. Constructs were verified by sequencing the resulting plasmid DNA using an ABI 377 HT device. For overexpression, the mutated putP gene was cut out with restriction endonucleases NcoI and HindIII and ligated to the similar treated vector pTrc99a (20Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) additionally incubated with alkaline phosphatase. Proline Transport Assays—Transport was measured in E. coli WG170 transformed with plasmid pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) harboring the given mutations. The cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 25-fold and were allowed to grow up to an optical density (A 420 nm) of 1.0, followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 10 min and washed with 250 mm Tris/Mes buffer, pH 6.0, at 4 °C, resuspended in the same buffer, and adjusted to a total protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Sodium motive force-driven proline uptake was assayed under standard conditions with 10 μm l-[U-14C]proline (26 Ci/mol) in the presence of 20 mm d-lactate and 50 mm NaCl using the rapid filtration method as described previously (22Chen C.C. Tsuchiya T. Yamane Y. Wood J.M. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Initial rates of transport were calculated from the initial linear portion of the time course. Steady-state levels of proline accumulation were determined from time points after leveling out of the uptake curve. NEM Inhibition—NEM inhibition of active transport was measured in E. coli WG170 transformed with plasmid pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) carrying the given mutations. An aliquot of the cell suspension prepared as described above was incubated with 2 mm NEM for 20 min on ice, followed by addition of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol to stop the reaction. Initial rates of sodium motive force-driven proline uptake in NEM-treated and -untreated cells were measured as described above. NEM inhibition was expressed in % remaining activity after NEM treatment. All measurements were performed at least in triplicate. Cys Accessibility Analyses—To investigate accessibility of individual introduced Cys residues to the sulfhydryl-specific dye fluorescein 5-maleimide, 500 ml of E. coli WG170 transformed with pTrc99a/putP(ΔCys) harboring given mutations were grown aerobically to an A 420 nm of 1.5 before induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside and further growth for 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed in 100 mm Tris/Mes buffer, pH 7.0, and sonified 4× 30 s using a Branson sonifier. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,200 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 230,000 × g and 4 °C for 45 min. The resulting membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in 100 mm Tris/Mes buffer, pH 7.0. After protein determination membrane vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. For accessibility analyses, 150-μl aliquots of the membrane suspension containing 10 mg/ml total protein were incubated with or without Na+ and/or proline at given concentrations at 25 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 200 μm fluorescein 5-maleimide was added and incubation was continued at 25 °C for an additional 10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After labeling, PutP was solubilized by addition of 1.5% β-dodecylmaltoside under stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, samples were purified via Ni2+-NTA spin columns and eluted with 200 mm imidazole as described before (15Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After protein determination, equal amounts of protein were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent bands of PutP were visualized using the MultiImager™ device (Bio-Rad) and the software Quantity One™ or MultiAnalyst™ with the following settings: excitation wavelength 360 nm, UV illumination trans, high resolution mode. After analysis of fluorescent PutP bands, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to detect total amounts of protein. Immunological Analysis—Relative amounts of PutP with given amino acid replacements in membranes of E. coli WG170 were estimated by Western blot analysis as described (14Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For membrane preparation, remaining cells of the transport assay were disrupted and membranes were prepared as described above. Twenty μg of total membrane protein was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-FLAG IgG against the FLAG epitope at the C terminus of each PutP variant followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-(mouse IgG) antibody. Detection was carried out according to the enhanced chemiluminescense method. Protein Determination—Determination of protein was performed according to Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) for purified protein and a modified Lowry method (24Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) for total membrane protein with bovine serum albumin as standard. Transport Activities of Single Cys PutP Derivatives—A multiple alignment of members of the SSSF was performed to identify conserved amino acids in the N-terminal domain of PutP. The alignment showed that predominately polar amino acids in the region of TM II of PutP are conserved within pro- and eukaryotic members of the family (Arg-40, Ser-50, Gly-63) or within the PutP subfamily (Ala-53, Ser-54, Asp-55, Ser-57, Gly-58, Trp-59, Pro-65, Gly-66) (Fig. 1). Previous work on the role of amino acids Ser-54 to Gly-58 has demonstrated that Asp-55 and Ser-57 are of particular importance for PutP function (13Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Quick M. Stölting S. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further clarify the role of the N-terminal region of PutP in Na+/proline symport, a complete Cys scanning mutagenesis of TM II was performed. In a first step, each amino acid of TM II (Ser-41 to Pro-65) was individually replaced with Cys in a functional PutP molecule devoid of all five native Cys residues (PutP(ΔCys)). Active transport was measured under standard test conditions (50 mm Na+, 10 μm proline) by using E. coli WG170, which lacks PutP and PutA and therefore cannot metabolize proline. Most severe effects on transport were observed upon replacement of amino acids in the C-terminal (periplasmic) half of TM II (Ala-53 to Pro-65) (Fig. 2). In contrast, little or no effect on PutP function was detected upon substitution of amino acids in the N-terminal (cytoplasmic) half of TM II (Ser-41 to Gly-52, except for Ala-48). Furthermore, the levels of maximum accumulation of proline were generally less affected than the initial rates of transport. Besides the known residues, Arg-40, Asp-55, Met-56, Ser-57, and Gly-58, substitution of Ala-48 and Gly-63 had the most dramatic effect on transport (initial rates and steady-state levels of proline accumulation below 5 and 10%, respectively of PutP(ΔCys)) (Fig. 2). Significant but less dramatic effects were detected upon replacement of Ala-53, Trp-59, Leu-64, and Pro-65 (initial rates between 10 and 30% of PutP(ΔCys), steady-state levels of proline accumulation were not affected). Immunological Analysis—The effect of the amino acid replacements in TM II on the relative concentration of transporter molecules in membranes of E. coli WG170 was tested by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope at the C terminus of the transporter. Individual replacement of amino acids in TM II of PutP against Cys resulted in amounts of transporter molecules in the membrane as similarly observed for PutP(ΔCys), indicating that differences in proline uptake kinetics cannot be attributed to different amounts of transporter molecules in the membrane (Fig. 3). The only exception was PutP(ΔCys)-P65C, which was present in the membrane in reduced amounts because of an altered expression, membrane insertion, and/or stability of the protein. Therefore, the reduced initial rate of proline uptake into cells containing PutP(ΔCys)-P65C can at least partially be explained by the low amount of protein. Effect of NEM Labeling on the Activity of Single Cys PutP Derivatives—To further evaluate the role of amino acids in TM II, the influence of the sulfhydryl reagent NEM on the activity of the single Cys PutP derivatives was investigated in cells of E. coli WG170 (Fig. 4). The effect of NEM treatment of PutP(ΔCys) (about 10% inhibition of the initial rate of proline uptake) was probably a side effect because of labeling of other proteins that could, e.g. be important for the energetic status of the cells. Analysis of the effect of NEM on the initial rate of proline uptake of the single Cys PutP derivatives revealed an inhibitory effect of 50% and more at eight (PutP(ΔCys)-L42C, -T47C, -A51C, -S54C, -M56C, -S57C, -G58C, and -M62C) of 24 positions analyzed (Fig. 4). Most of the sites of NEM inhibition cluster on one phase of TM II (Thr-47, Ala-51, Ser-54, Gly-58, Met-62) (Fig. 6). However, the periodicity of inhibition was interrupted in the middle of TM II comprising the functionally important residues Ser-54 to Gly-58. Here, individual NEM labeling of every residue led to inhibition of transport. PutP-D55C could not be analyzed in the activity assay because the protein is completely inactive from the beginning.Fig. 6Schematic presentation of the Cys accessibility of TM II. The figure summarizes the Cys accessibility data shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Residues labeled with NEM are sensitive to inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. Residues in black ellipses are highly accessible to fluorescein 5-maleimide (fluorescence intensity > 10,000 arbitrary units); residues in gray ellipses show an intermediate accessibility (fluorescence intensity between 5,000 and 10,000 arbitrary units); residues in white ellipses are not or only slightly accessible (fluorescence intensity <5,000 arbitrary units).

To obtain a comprehensive picture of the accessibility of Cys at the various positions of TM II, a fluorescence approach was used. For this purpose randomly oriented membrane vesicles containing the corresponding single Cys PutP derivatives were labeled with fluorescein 5-maleimide. The maleimide is known to react with sulfhydryl groups in polar but not in apolar environments (25Zhou J. Fazzio R.T. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Poelarends G. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42891-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After vesicle labeling, the PutP derivatives were solubilized from the membranes, purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence of PutP labeled with fluorescein 5-maleimide was detected by UV excitation. PutP(ΔCys) was used as a negative control and was not modified by the fluorescent compound (Fig. 5). Despite the fact that amino acids Ser-41 to Pro-64 are supposed to form a membrane spanning domain (TM II), Cys placed at several positions within this region was modified by fluorescein 5-maleimide (Fig. 5). In general, positions in the N-terminal (cytoplasmic) half of TM II showed a higher accessibility than positions in the C-terminal (periplasmic) half of the TM (Fig. 6A). Cys in place of Ser-41, Leu-42, Thr-47, Ala-48, Ala-51, Ser-54, Asp-55, and Gly-63 was particularly well accessible to fluorescein 5-maleimide (fluorescence intensities >10,000 arbitrary units) (Fig. 5C). This region of the protein must therefore be well exposed to an aqueous environment. Except for Leu-42 and Gly-63 at the ends of TM II, the residues are all located on one face of the putative α-helix and might participate in the formation of a water-filled cavity or half-channel in the membrane (Fig. 6B). This idea is in good agreement with the proposed role of Asp-55 and Ser-57 in Na+ and/or proline binding. An intermediate accessibility was observed for Cys in place of Pro-44, Phe-45, Val-46, Leu-49, Ser-50, Met-56, Met-62, and Leu-64 (Fig. 5). PutP(ΔCys) derivatives containing a single Cys at the positions of Gly-43, Gly-52, Ala-53, Ser-57, Gly-58, Trp-59, Leu-60, and Pro-65 showed only a low reactivity toward fluorescein 5-maleimide or did not react at all (Fig. 5). The data indicate that these residues are either buried within the protein or exposed to the lipid environment. Although most of the inaccessible residues cluster on the phase of TM II that is located opposite to the well accessible positions at 41, 47, 48, 54, 51, and 55, there is no clear periodicity of fluorescein 5-maleimide accessibility (Fig. 6). For example, Leu-42 and Gly-63 are located on a face of low accessibility but were significantly modified by the sulfhydryl reagent. On the other hand, Cys in place of Gly-58 or Pro-65 are located on a face of high accessibility showed no or only little accessibility to fluorescein 5-maleimide. This inconsistency may be explained by structural perturbations caused by the replacement of the native amino acids at these positions with Cys, an idea supported by the fact that Gly and Pro residues frequently fulfill specific roles in protein structure (27Aurora R. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Science. 1994; 264: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Cordes F.S. Bright J.N. Sansom M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the results can be taken as an indication that the polypeptide chain comprising amino acids 41 to 65 of PutP has some irregular structure and does not form a straight α-helix. Influence of Ligand on Cys Accessibility—To further explore the role of TM II in PutP function, the influence of ligand (Na+, proline) on the accessibility of Cys individually introduced at every position in TM II of PutP(ΔCys) to the fluorescein 5-maleimide was tested. For this purpose, randomly oriented membrane vesicles containing the single Cys PutP derivatives were labeled posterior to incubation with or without ligand(s). Subsequently, PutP was isolated and fluorescence was detected as described above. The analysis revealed four groups of single Cys PutP derivatives with the following characteristics. (a) Cys residues individually introduced at the positions of Phe-45, Val-46, Thr-47, Leu-49, Ser-50, Ala-51, Ser-54, Gly-63, or Leu-64 were labeled by fluorescein 5-maleimide and the labeling reaction was inhibited by proline in the presence of Na+. Na+ alone did not affect labeling (Fig. 7II). (b) Cys in place of Ser-41, Leu-42, Ala-48, Ser-50, and Asp-55 was highly accessible to fluorescein 5-maleimide and the labeling reaction was neither significantly influenced by Na+ nor by proline (data not shown). (c) Cys at the positions of Gly-43, Pro-44, Gly-52, Ala-53, Met-56, Leu-60, Leu-61, Met-62, and Pro-65 showed only a low reactivity toward fluorescein 5-maleimide, and addition of Na+ and/or proline did not stimulate Cys reactivity (data not shown). (d) As demonstrated in a previous study (15Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Na+ stimulates the reactivity of Cys placed at positions 57 or 58, an effect that is prevented by the simultaneous addition of Na+ and proline. Analysis of the dependence of the reactivity of Cys at position 57 on the Na+ concentration demonstrates that high Na+ concentrations (50 mm) are required to see a significant stimulatory effect (Fig. 7I). In the case of PutP-G58C a significant stimulatory effect is already observed at a Na+ concentration of 5 mm that is in the order of the Na+ binding constant of PutP. Most of the amino acid positions protected by proline (group A substitutions) cluster on the phase of TM II at which Ser-57 and Gly-58 reside (15Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). However, also residues at the opposite phase of the putative α-helix (e.g. Phe-45 and Gly-63) were protected from modification by fluorescein 5-maleimide. The observed substrate protection can be explained by direct steric hindering and/or by ligand-induced conformational alterations, which either bury the corresponding residue within the protein or move it from an aqueous into an apolar environment. In any case, the results indicate that residues of TM II are of particular functional importance. Identification of the sites of Na+ and substrate binding and translocation is a central issue of ongoing studies on members of the SSSF. Analysis of human SGLT1 shows that a fragment comprising the last five TMs of the transporter is sufficient to catalyze Na+-independent facilitated diffusion of the sugar (29Panayotova-Heiermann M.

For PutP of E. coli it has previously been demonstrated that TM II of the protein harbors amino acid residues (Asp-55, Ser-57, Gly-58) of special functional importance (13Quick M. Jung H.

https://openalex.org/W2070957833,"We report here the characterization of Cha, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. The basic region of Cha shares DNA-interacting amino acids with members of class C bHLH transcription factors. In addition, the HLH region of Cha presents a Myc-type dimerization domain signature required for heterodimer formation between members of this class. Cha protein and mRNA were ubiquitously expressed in many human tissues. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Cha and upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1 formed a complex that specifically bound to E-box DNA elements. Moreover, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed an interaction between Cha and USF-1. Cha did not bind to E-box DNA elements and required USF-1 for protein-DNA complex formation. Moreover, Cha inhibited USF-1-stimulated transcription of CD2 (a USF-1-dependent gene) and E-box promoter reporter plasmids. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Cha occupied the CD2 promoter in resting, but not in mitogen-stimulated, T cells. Finally, Cha mRNA and protein expression were high in resting T cells and absent in mitogen-activated T cells and inversely correlated with CD2 expression. Contrarily, overexpression of Cha in T cells significantly reduced CD2 expression. In summary, our results indicated that Cha is a new bHLH transcription factor that negatively regulates USF-dependent transcription.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Cha occupied the CD2 promoter in resting, but not in mitogen-stimulated, T cells. Finally, Cha mRNA and protein expression were high in resting T cells and absent in mitogen-activated T cells and inversely correlated with CD2 expression. Contrarily, overexpression of Cha in T cells significantly reduced CD2 expression. In summary, our results indicated that Cha is a new bHLH transcription factor that negatively regulates USF-dependent transcription. A great number of transcription factors have been described and classified in several families according to the structural properties of their DNA binding domain (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Among those, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WCE, whole cell extract; Io, A23187 calcium ionophore; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAS, protein-A-Sepharose; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ChIP, chromosomal immunoprecipitation; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. DNA-binding proteins are a family of proteins characterized by their ability to recognize specific DNA sequences, termed E-boxes (CANNTG) through their basic region. They are able to form homo or heterodimers via their HLH domain (2Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). E-box elements were first identified in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) intronic enhancer and have since then been found in a large number of pancreatic, lymphoid, and muscle-specific promoter and enhancer elements (3Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). These proteins have originally been grouped into three classes based upon structural characteristics and pattern of expression (4Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. et al.Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The class A proteins are ubiquitously expressed and readily bind DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers, with some of them implicated in cellular differentiation (5Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 6Neuhold L.A. Wold B. Cell. 1993; 74: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7French B.A. Chow K.L. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2439-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Class B proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and form heterodimers with class A bHLH proteins. Some of these factors, such as MyoD, myogenin, and myf-5, are implicated in muscle development (8Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 9Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 10Buckingham M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 144-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The last group, class C, forms homo- and heterodimers with class C but not with class A or B bHLH proteins. Class A and B proteins recognize CAGCTG, and class C proteins recognize the CACGTG sequence (11Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among class C are factors such as Myc, Max, and Mad that are implicated in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. USF is another member of this class ubiquitously expressed in mammals. There are two isoforms, USF-1 and USF-2, that play an essential role during embryonic development and have pleiotropic effects in adult animals (12Henrion A.A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides are very similar in their C-terminal regions, which contain the bHLH-zip domain, and consequently display identical dimerization and DNA-binding specificities (15Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H. Sawadogo M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). USF has been described in most tissues and cell lines as USF-1/USF-2 heterodimers. USF-1 homodimers are less abundant, and USF-2 homodimers are usually quite scarce (13Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M.

USF-1 and USF-2 bind to E-boxes in the promoter regions of several genes, some involved in the metabolism of the glucose response (lipidogenic and glycolytic enzymes), as fatty acid synthase (18Moon Y.S.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2707-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, USF-1 or USF-2 knockout mice have a diminished glucose response (21Nicolas G. Bennoun M.

Additionally, USF overexpression has been found to inhibit growth in a number of cancer cell lines (27Koskinen P.J. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar, 28Luo X.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 2394-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of a novel transcription factor named Cha. Our study strongly suggests that Cha is a ubiquitously expressed member of class C bHLH transcription factors. Cha was found to interact with USF-1 and was capable of binding to E-boxes as Cha·USF-1 dimers in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, Cha was able to inhibit USF-1-dependent promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of Cha and Cha occupancy of the E-box CD2 promoter region negatively correlated with CD2 expression in T cells after mitogenic stimulation, whereas overexpression of Cha inhibited CD2 expression. Our results suggest that Cha is a new bHLH transcription factor that negatively regulates USF-dependent transcription. Cell Cultures—Jurkat, Jurkat J77cl-20 clone, and COS-7 cells were grown in RPMI and Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, UK), respectively. The medium contained 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine plus non-essential amino acids supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C in a 7% CO2-in-air atmosphere, water vapor-saturated incubator. Resting T lymphocytes were purified from blood drawn from healthy volunteers and centrifuged through Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, UK) as described previously (35Pimentel-Muiños F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24424-24429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of adherent and B cells by plastic adherence and nylon wool columns. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium-10% fetal bovine serum and stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 μm A23187 calcium ionophore (Io) (Sigma). Cloning of Cha—Cha cDNA was isolated as described previously (36Girones N. Rodriguez C.I. Carrasco-Marin E. Hernaez R.F. de Rego J.L. Fresno M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A partial sequence (pBKCMVCha) was isolated from the screening of a human cDNA library with sera from chagasic (Trypanosoma cruzi-infected) patients. Later, the 5′-end sequence was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNAs ends. Oligonucleotides Comp (5′-GGGAACCATGTGCTCCGGGTGG-3′) and NGFL3′ (5′-GCACAGGTCACGAAGGAATGGCTGTT-3′) were used to amplify the complete coding sequence from cDNA of Jurkat cells. The complete coding sequence was cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing was performed utilizing the fmol kit (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer or automatically with an Applied Biosystems sequencer. The GenBank™ accession number for the Cha gene is AJ271337. Nucleic acid and protein sequences were analyzed by the University of Wisconsin Genetics Group Sequences Analysis Software Package (37Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Plasmids—pGEX4T3sCha was created by subcloning a BamHI/SmaI fragment amplified from the complete cDNA cloned in pGEM-T with oligonucleotides BamHI-sCha (5′-AATCGGGGATCCATGCGTCAGTTGGACACAAATGTA-3′) and SmaI-sCha (5′-TGTTCACCCGGGTCACTTGATCTCCATCGAGGGGCT-3′) into the pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) plasmid. pcDNA3Cha and pcDNA3sCha were created by subcloning the PCR products amplified from pBKCMV with oligonucleotides T7pBKCMV (5′-GTAAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), Euca (5′-ATATATGGATCCACTATGAATGTTCCTCTTCAGCAACAAAACAAATGT-3′), and sCha Euca (5′-TATCTCGGATCCAGAATGCGTCAGTTGGACACAAATGTAGAGCGAAGA-3′), respectively, into BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). pcDNA3USF-1 was created by subcloning USF cDNA from pcXUSF, kindly provided by Dr. Robert G. Roeder (Rockefeller University, New York, NY), as a HindIII and XhoI fragment into the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). pCMV-Max was also provided by Dr. Robert G. Roeder. pGEXUSF-1 was generously donated by Dr. Colin Goding (Marie Curie Research Institute, Oxted, UK). The CAT reporter plasmid driven by the CD2 promoter element named CM2.5 was supplied by Dr. J. Owen (29Outram S.V. Owen M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26525-26530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-kB Luc reporter contained three tandem repeats of the NF-κB enhancer upstream of the conalbumin minimal promoter and the luciferase reporter gene (pNF3ConA Luc) (38Martin A.G. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24383-24391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pGL3p4E-boxCD2 was constructed as follows: 5′-TCGAGGCACGTGCCTCTCTAACCACGTGCCTCTCTAACCACGTGCCTCTCTAACCACGTGTA-3′ and 5′-CGCGTACACGTGGTTAGAGAGGCACGTGGTTAGAGAGGCACGTGGTTAGAGAGGCACGTGCC-3′ primers (E-boxes are underlined) containing four E-box sequences, which were annealed and cloned into M1uI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). The luciferase and β-galactosidase reporters under control of the minimal promoter of the thymidine kinase or the cytomegalovirus promoter (TK-luc and CMV β-galactosidase, respectively) were used to monitor transfection efficiency. mRNA Detection—Total RNA was isolated from T lymphocytes with TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was synthesized from 1.75 μg of total RNA in 35 μl of each reaction mixture, and Cha DNA fragment (nucleotides 844–1317) was amplified by PCR from 10 μl of each cDNA sample. The amplification program consisted of 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for Cha fragment and 25 cycles for GAPDH. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Tissue Expression Analysis—Expression of Cha protein in different human tissues was analyzed in InstaBlot membrane (Imgenex). Different cDNA libraries from eight human tissues (QUICK-Screen™ cDNA library panel, Clontech), and a cDNA library from Jurkat T cells were assayed for Cha expression by PCR. The amplification program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 2 min at 68 °C using the Advantage™ Klentaq polymerase mix (Clontech). The Cha-specific primers used were (5′-CACCAGGATATTGGATTGCCTAGAGC-3′) and (5′-GTGGCACCTTCGCCCACATTCTGAA-3′), which amplified a fragment of 230 bp. The PCR products were separated on agarose gels and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. As a control, a 593-bp fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified using GAPDH sense (5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′) and GAPDH antisense (5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′) oligonucleotides. Recombinant Proteins—Native rCha protein was obtained from in vitro translated pcDNA3sCha using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of pcDNA3sCha was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), T7 RNA polymerase, 20 mm of a combination of amino acids without methionine, 40 μCi of [35S]methionine, and 40 units of ribonuclease inhibitor in a final volume of 50 μl. The resulting product was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to monitor translation efficiency. In Vitro Protein Interaction Analysis—Protein expression in pGEX4T3, pGEX4T3-sCha, and pGEXUSF-1 transformed Escherichia coli DH5α strain was induced in a 20-ml culture with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Subsequently, the lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatants containing the expression proteins glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-sCha were coupled to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with 10 bed volumes of ice-cold PBS/1% Triton X-100. Recombinant proteins were purified either with reduced glutathione or thrombin cleavage, as indicated, following instructions of the manufacturer. A whole cell extract (WCE) from 15 × 106 Jurkat cells lysed in TnT (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors) was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B coupled with GST for 1 h at 4 °C and then coupled with GST-sCha for 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TnT, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti USF-1 antibody. Antibodies—Specific anti-Cha antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a peptide of Cha (SLVTCPAQGSLQSSPSMEI) as described and were purified by affinity-chromatography as described (36Girones N. Rodriguez C.I. Carrasco-Marin E. Hernaez R.F. de Rego J.L. Fresno M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Anti-Cha antibodies showed no cross-reactivity against recombinant USF-1 or USF-2 or protease activity (not shown). The affinity-purified antibodies used in supershifting assays directed against: USF-1, USF-2, and E12#E47 were made against the recombinant proteins and generously provided by Dr. Carmelo Bernabéu (Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas, Madrid).

Cell Transfection—Jurkat cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 106 cells/ml) and transfected with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, UK) preparing the LipofectAMINE-plasmid mixtures according to the instructions supplied by manufacturers. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 incubator for 3 h before washing with fresh medium and incubated further for 24 or 48 h. When indicated, cells were washed once with fresh medium and cultured in wells containing medium alone or 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm Io. After 6 h the cells were harvested and assayed for either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase activity as described previously (39Sambrook J.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was always normalized with respect to the activity of the luciferase reporter under control of the TK minimal promoter, TK-luc. COS-7 cells were seeded (105/well) in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection of plasmids (as indicated) with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent following the directions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in 100 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 24 h after transfection. 20 μl of lysate was incubated with 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate for 10 s, and relative luciferase units were measured in a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Luciferase activities were normalized, with respect to the protein and β-galactosidase activity of co-transfected β-galactosidase vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate plus 20 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (1.33 mg/ml) for 10 min. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in an EL340 microplate reader at 405 nm (Biotek Instruments). Co-immunoprecipitation—WCE from Jurkat cells and COS-7 cells were obtained by lysis in TnT supplemented with protease inhibitors as described before (see in vitro protein interaction analysis). WCE were immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-USF-1 antibody (200 μg/0.1 ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) previously coupled to 50 μl of protein-A-Sepharose (PAS) (Amersham Biosciences), and, after washing five times with lysis buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot utilizing anti-Cha and anti-USF-1 antibodies, as indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells or peripheral blood T lymphocytes were prepared basically as described (35Pimentel-Muiños F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24424-24429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded CD2 oligonucleotide (which contains an E-box element from human CD2 promoter 5′-GATCAAAGAGAGGCACGTGGTTAAGCTC-3′) was used as a probe. The irrelevant oligonucleotide (5′-CCCGGAGAATACAAAAAGGTCCCTGACGG-3′) was used as control. For binding reactions, 3 μg of nuclear extract proteins, 1 μl of in vitro translated rCha, and 0.2 μg of purified USF-1 and Cha were mixed with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), poly(dA-dT), poly(dCdG), and TATA4 oligonucleotide (kindly provided by A. Nieto, Centro de Biología Molecular “Severo Ochoa,” Madrid), in the presence or absence of competitors (in an excess of 30-fold molar as indicated) or antibodies in a final volume of 20 μl for 15 min on ice, as indicated. These mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with radioactive DNA probe. Protein-DNA complexes were fractionated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.4× Tris borate EDTA. After drying the gel, the results were recorded by autoradiography. Western Blotting—WCE was made using TnT and nuclear extracts as described in previous sections. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (35Pimentel-Muiños F.X. Mazana J.

Briefly, 15 μg of Jurkat cell lysate or 10 μg of T lymphocytes nuclear extract protein were fractionated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Problot membrane (Applied Biosystems). The membranes were incubated, either with anti-Cha polyclonal antiserum at 1:1000 dilution in the absence and presence of recombinant sCha as indicated, or with polyclonal anti-USF-1 antibody. Then, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) as secondary antibody. Detection was carried out with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (40Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 12 × 106 resting and PMA/Io-stimulated purified T cells (see “Cell Cultures”) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Glycine 0.125 m was added to stop the cross-linking for 5 min at room temperature. T cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in 5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer for 10 min. Nuclei were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS buffer for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated on ice five times (25 s each time) to an average chromatin length of about 600 bp and diluted 1:10 in 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl buffer. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated, and pellets were washed twice with 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% sodium lauryl sarcosinate buffer, and four times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid buffer. All above buffers were supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were eluted from PAS by incubation with 50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were incubated with RNase A and proteinase K. DNA was isolated with QuiaexII gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were performed with Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), 100 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA, and 0.2% of the total input chromatin from antibody-free samples as the positive control. Oligonucleotides derived from the CD2 promoter, EboxCD2F (5′-GTGTGAGAATTAAAATGCAGC-3′) and EboxCD2R (5′-CTTAGGGGTTGGTTTCCTCTT-3′), oligonucleotides derived from the p53 promoter (as negative control), p53F (5′-GCTTTGTGCCAGGAGGAGCCTCCGC-3′), and p53R (5′-CGTCGTGGAAAGCACGCTCCC-3′) were used. The amplification program consisted of 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C for the CD2 fragment and 60 °C for the p53 fragment, and 30 s at 68 °C. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Flow Cytometry—J77cl-20 cells (105/ml) were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid (CMVGFP) and increasing amounts of pCDNA3Cha. After 48 h, cells were stained with biotinylated anti-human CD2 and st"
https://openalex.org/W2076254319,"The discovery of germ cell-specific general transcription factor and coactivator variants has suggested that reproductive tissues control gene expression somewhat differently than somatic tissues. One of these factors, ALF (TFIIAτ), was first described as a testis-specific counterpart of the large (α/β) subunit of TFIIA. Here we characterize endogenous ALF and TFIIA activities in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. ALF is present in both testis and ovary in this organism, and it completely replaces TFIIA in immature oocytes. When oocytes undergo progesterone-induced maturation, ALF activity disappears, and TFIIA activity is restored. Reactivation occurs through the translational up-regulation of two maternal TFIIAα/β mRNAs and involves polyadenylation of a conserved 3′-untranslated region module. The effects of ALF overexpression and ALF immunodepletion on a thymidine kinase promoter construct demonstrate that this factor serves as an active replacement for TFIIA. In contrast, overexpression of TFIIA inhibits transcription, indicating that the somatic factor fails to function properly in the context of the oocyte transcription machinery. Overall, the results show that the translationally regulated reciprocal expression of ALF and TFIIA allows for the production of an active TFIIA-like general transcription factor throughout oogenesis.

Overall, the results show that the translationally regulated reciprocal expression of ALF and TFIIA allows for the production of an active TFIIA-like general transcription factor throughout oogenesis. Accurate initiation from the promoters of eukaryotic genes requires assembly of RNA polymerase II and a set of general transcription factors (GTFs 1The abbreviations used are: GTF, general transcription factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; RT, reverse transcription; TK, thymidine kinase; UTR, untranslated region.; TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, and -H). Recent studies have revealed genes that encode variants of some GTF and coactivator subunits (1Veenstra G.J.C. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Aoyagi N. Wassarman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F45-F49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These variants are typically expressed in male or female germ cells and are members of a large class of germ cell-specific genes whose functions span a variety of metabolic processes (3Eddy E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 4Kleene K.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To investigate why alternate core promoter factors exist and what functions they might serve, we have been studying the germ cell-specific transcription factor ALF (TFIIAτ) (5Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This factor is a counterpart of the large (α/β) subunit of TFIIA. Like TFIIAα/β, ALF is able to interact with the small TFIIA subunit (γ) to form a heterodimeric complex that stabilizes binding of TBP to promoter DNA (7Upadhyaya A.B. Khan M. Mou T.-C. Junker M. Gray D.M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34208-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the expression of ALF is restricted to male germ cells in the testis of mice and humans (5Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that it is up-regulated during the pachytene stage of meiosis I along with a number of other transcription factors (8Han S. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, biochemical characterization of recombinant ALF-TFIIAγ and TFIIAα/β-TFIIAγ complexes did not reveal significant differences in vitro (7Upadhyaya A.B. Khan M. Mou T.-C. Junker M. Gray D.M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34208-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it remains unclear what specific role ALF might play during germ cell development. Disruption of the genes that encode several other GTF and coactivator variants or reduction of their levels results in a failure to complete gametogenesis or embryogenesis. For instance, TLF/TRF2, a factor related to TBP, is required for spermatogenesis in mice (9Martianov I. Fimia G.-M. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Mol.

Science. 2000; 290: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, targeted knockouts of the tissue-specific coactivator TAFII105 gene in mice reveals a function essential for oogenesis (15Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W.C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Google Scholar). In addition, some factors (e.g. TAF1L) are expressed to compensate for the meiotic silencing of their somatic counterparts located on the X chromosome (e.g. TAFII250) (16Wang P.J. Page D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Together with studies on the expression and function of ALF (5Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and TAF2Q (18Wang P.J. McCarrey J.R. Yang F. Page D.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), the results suggest that germ cell isoforms will have an important role in directing meiotic or gametogenic patterns of gene expression, including the production of other germ cell-specific genes. However, there is still very little data on endogenous germ cell factors in reproductive tissues that would help understand their biochemical functions and their regulatory relationships with somatic factors. In this report we describe the characterization of ALF and TFIIA activities from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. As in mammals, we find that ALF is expressed in male germ cells of this organism. Unexpectedly, we also observe that ALF completely replaces TFIIA in immature oocytes in Xenopus females. The production of ALF compensates for the maternal storage and inactivation of TFIIAα/β mRNAs, thereby maintaining a constant level of a TFIIA-like activity. ALF activity is lost when oocytes undergo maturation and fertilization, and TFIIA reappears. Overall, the results reveal an interplay between ALF and TFIIA during germ cell development and early embryogenesis and suggest a model where ALF serves as a functional substitute for its somatic counterpart. Cloning—Partial Xenopus clones for ALF and TFIIA were identified by expressed sequence tag analysis (GenBank™ accession numbers BE188680, BE575947, AW767376, BE679537, and BM004702) and cloned by RT-PCR using Xenopus RNA. Antibody Production—Rabbit polyclonal sera were prepared against recombinant ALF (amino acids 70–302) or TFIIAα/β (amino acids 97–252) produced in Escherichia coli and purified on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system using a HiTrap Protein A affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Oocyte and Embryo Preparations—The ovaries were removed surgically and treated with 0.2% collagenase (Roche Applied Science) in OR2 medium (19Kay B.K. Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Staged (stages I–VI) oocytes were incubated overnight at 18 °C with antibiotics. Maturation was induced with 2 μg/ml of progesterone (Sigma) and monitored by germinal vesicle breakdown (>95% GVBD). For preparation of embryos, the females were primed with 500 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma), and eggs were collected the next day for fertilization with minced testis (19Kay B.K. Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Development was monitored according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (20Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar). The eggs and embryos were dejellied with 0.1× MBS containing 2% cysteine, pH 8.0, for preparation of proteins and RNA. Injections (5–50 nl) were performed with a Drummond Nanoject II and an Olympus SZ40 stereomicroscope (19Kay B.K. Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). In some experiments nocodazole was added to visualize the nucleus. Preparation of Extracts—Tissues from adult Xenopus were homogenized in HS buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) that contained 1/1000 (v/v) proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain clarified lysates. TBP-dependent mobility shift assays were performed as described (7Upadhyaya A.B. Khan M. Mou T.-C. Junker M. Gray D.M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34208-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends Poly(A) Test—Rapid amplification of cDNA ends poly(A) test assays (21Salles F.J. Richards W.G. Strickland S. Methods. 1999; 17: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were performed with total RNA from control and progesterone-treated oocytes using primer T7/dT (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and Superscript II RNase H- RT (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed with T7 and TFIIAα/β1-specific primers in the presence of 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and visualized by autoradiography. Antibody Purification and Injection—ALF- and TFIIA-specific antibodies used for nuclear injections were purified on a HiTrap protein A column followed by HiTrap NHS-activated affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) to which recombinant ALF or TFIIAα/β polypeptides had been coupled. A TK promoter-luciferase plasmid DNA (pTK-LUCGL3; 20 pg) was coinjected into the nucleus with each antibody, and luciferase assays were used to measure transcription activity. Factor Overexpression—Full-length ALF, TFIIAα/β, and TFIIAγ cDNAs were subcloned into pGEMHE (22Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Constructs were used to generate in vitro transcribed mRNAs using mMessage mMachine (Ambion). mRNAs were resuspended in water at 1 μg/μl and were injected into ∼30 oocytes. Expression was verified by bandshift or Western blot analysis. To assess the effects of overexpression on transcription, the oocytes were injected with 2–16 ng of mRNA and incubated for 12 h to allow translation. The pTK-LUCGL3 DNA was then injected, and 12 h later whole cell extracts were prepared. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Turner TD-20e luminometer. The experiments were performed at least three times using oocytes from different frogs. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase constructs for translational regulation experiments were subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pGEMHE. The constructs were linearized with SphI and transcribed in vitro. Some transcripts were polyadenylated in vitro with a poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion). Luciferase activity was measured in whole cell extracts as described above. In Vivo Polyadenylation—The constructs were prepared by PCR using primers for xTFIIAα/β1, xTFIIAα/β2, c-mos, xTFIIAγ, human TFIIAα/β, and a mutant TFIIAα/β1 in which AATTAAA was changed to CAGCAAA. The constructs were linearized with NheI and transcribed in vitro using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) in the presence of 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Labeled RNAs (4 ng) were injected into control and matured groups of oocytes (23De Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, purified RNAs were visualized by autoradiography. Nycodenz Gradients—Up to 200 oocytes were homogenized in 800 μl of polysome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 400 units/ml RNasin. The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was supplemented with 40 units of RNasin and loaded onto a nycodenz step gradient (60, 50, 40, 30, and 20%) in a TSL-55 centrifuge tube (25Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 42,000 rpm for 20 h in a Beckman TSL-100, 75-μl samples were removed from the top down. Each fraction was loaded in its entirety on formaldehyde gels for Northern analysis. The proteins were prepared from the phenol phase as described in the TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen). Identification of Multiple ALF and TFIIA Genes in Xenopus—Xenopus cDNAs for TFIIAα/β (TFIIAα/β1 and TFIIAα/β2), ALF, and TFIIAγ were identified by data base searches, RT-PCR, and sequence analysis (Fig. 1A). Although it is not clear whether TFIIAα/β1 and TFIIAα/β2 are functionally distinct, the presence of three large subunits (TFIIAα/β1, TFIIAα/ β2, and ALF) is the most observed in any organism to date. The 3′-UTR of TFIIAα/β1 predicts an unusual double-stranded stem that is not present in TFIIAα/β2 (Fig. 1A). In addition, comparison of the 3′-UTR from Xenopus TFIIAα/β with human TFIIAα/β revealed homology only within a ∼300-nucleotide region at the end. This module is very AU-rich and contains an AUUAAA poly(A) addition signal (Fig. 1B). ALF Replaces TFIIA in Immature Oocytes—Northern analysis showed ALF was expressed in both ovary and testis (Fig. 2A). This result revises the earlier conclusion that ALF is strictly testis-specific (5Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Han S. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting instead that it might be involved in meiosis or another process that occurs in both male and female reproductive tissues. Like ALF, the TFIIAγ gene was highly expressed in testis and ovary but was also present at lower levels in somatic tissues. In contrast, TFIIAα/β was expressed to a high level in ovary and at reduced levels in other tissues. To determine whether ALF and TFIIA activities were present in the tissues predicted by the Northern results, TBP-dependent mobility shift assays were performed with the adeno-virus major late core promoter. The results showed that all of the tissues tested contained complexes that could be supershifted with an antibody that recognizes both ALF and TFIIA (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the complex in ovary migrated slightly faster than those in somatic tissues, suggesting that it might contain ALF (7Upadhyaya A.B. Khan M. Mou T.-C. Junker M. Gray D.M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34208-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, mobility shift assays were performed with antibodies specific for the nonhomologous internal regions of ALF and TFIIAα/β. The complex in somatic tissues could be supershifted by the TFIIA-specific sera (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6), showing that these contain TFIIA and were not supershifted with ALF-specific sera (lanes 7–12). In contrast, the complex in ovary and oocytes was supershifted only with ALF-specific sera (Fig. 2D, lanes 5–12). The results demonstrate the mutually exclusive expression of these two factors, with TFIIA restricted to somatic tissues and ALF completely replacing TFIIA in oocytes. Consistent with this observation, testis contained a major complex supershifted with TFIIA-specific sera and a minor complex supershifted with ALF-specific sera (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–4), presumably reflecting the mixed somatic and germ cell composition of this tissue. ALF and TFIIA Are Exchanged during Oocyte Maturation and Early Embryogenesis—The exclusive expression of ALF and TFIIA in oocytes and somatic tissues implies that they must be exchanged (TFIIA → ALF and ALF → TFIIA), probably at the onset of meiosis and again when embryonic cell divisions begin. In support of this idea, mobility shift assays of oocytes treated with progesterone to induce maturation showed that ALF activity fell by nearly 80% and TFIIA activity emerged (Fig. 3A). The transition was partially complete in eggs released by human chorionic gonadotropin-injected females and was finished in stage 10 embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (19Kay B.K. Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar, 20Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Curiously, the switch begins prior to fertilization, continues during a period in which the zygote is transcriptionally silent and undergoing synchronized cell cleavages, and is complete at the mid-blastula transition when zygotic gene expression and asynchronous mitotic cell division begin (26Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). ALF was also present in oocytes as early as stage I (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the transition from TFIIA to ALF occurs prior to diplotene arrest, possibly in the pachytene stage of prophase I (8Han S. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which the transition in Fig. 3 (A and B) occurs, we characterized protein and RNA levels in detail. We first showed that ALF activity partially purified over a Q-Sepharose column cofractionated with immunoreactive bands corresponding to intact (70 kDa) and processed (α, 45 kDa; β, 30 kDa) species (Fig. 3C) (27DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). During maturation the level of the ALFα and TFIIAα subunits correlated with ALF and TFIIA activity, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels). RT-PCR analysis revealed that TFIIAα/β1, TFIIAα/β2, TFIIAγ, and ALF mRNAs were abundant in immature oocytes (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–5) and were roughly constant over the period of the transition (up to embryonic stage 6.5) (lanes 5–8). TFIIAα/β1, TFIIAα/β2, and TFIIAγ mRNAs continued to be present through embryonic stage 35/36 (lanes 9–12), whereas ALF mRNA diminished to undetectable levels by stage 10 (lane 9). The loss of ALF mRNA is consistent with the decline in factor activity. In contrast, the presence of TFIIAα/β mRNAs in immature oocytes was surprising because TFIIA activity was not present in these cells and suggested that these mRNAs might not be translated. TFIIAα/β mRNA Is Maternally Stored and Regulated by a Conserved 3′-UTR Module—To test whether TFIIAα/β mRNAs were sequestered into ribonucleoprotein particles and excluded from ribosomes, a hallmark of maternally stored transcripts, we centrifuged oocyte extracts over 20–60% nycodenz gradients (25Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis of the recovered fractions showed that ALF was present in fractions 14–24 that contained ribosomal RNAs, whereas TFIIAα/β mRNAs was present in earlier fractions 11–13 (Fig. 4A). The results support the idea that TFIIA mRNA is stored and translationally inactive in immature oocytes. Sequences within the 3′-UTR of other mRNAs are known to play a role in regulating their translation (28Richter J.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 446-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the conserved 3′-UTR module within TFIIAα/β (Fig. 1) might have a similar role. To test this idea, we linked a luciferase reporter to the 3′-UTRs of TFIIAα/1, ALF, and a β-globin control (Fig. 4B) and injected transcribed mRNAs into control and progesterone-treated oocytes (22Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 23De Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results showed that LUC-TFIIAα/β1 mRNA was repressed ∼6-fold in control oocytes compared with LUC-ALF or LUC-β-globin mRNAs and that the addition of a poly(A) tail prior to injection reversed this effect (Fig. 4B). When oocytes were induced to mature, translation of the LUC-TFIIAα/β1 mRNA increased 11-fold, whereas control constructs only increased ∼2.5-fold (Fig. 4B). The data show that the conserved 3′-UTR can regulate a heterologous reporter in a manner similar to that of the endogenous transcript. Translation of TFIIAα/β Is Associated with Polyadenylation—The maturation-dependent translation of maternal transcripts such as c-mos and cyclin B involves cytoplasmic polyadenylation and is required for meiotic progression (28Richter J.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 446-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine whether poly(A) extension of the conserved module in TFIIAα/β also occurred during maturation. 3′-UTR constructs from TFIIAα/β1, TFIIAα/β2, and a c-mos control (Fig. 5A) were transcribed in vitro in the presence of [32P]UTP and injected into oocytes (23De Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Each transcript was shifted to heterogeneous higher molecular weight species in maturing oocytes (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–6). Mutation of the ATTAAA poly(A) addition signal to AGCAAA completely abolished this modification (lanes 7–10), showing that it depends critically on this element and that the assay is sequence-dependent. To demonstrate that polyadenylation occurs on the endogenous transcript, we used rapid amplification of cDNA ends poly(A) test (21Salles F.J. Richards W.G. Strickland S. Methods. 1999; 17: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to show extension of cellular TFIIAα/β1 mRNA (lanes 11 and 12). The results, together with the in vivo assays shown in Fig. 4B, confirm that control over TFIIA activity is mediated by the conserved 3′-UTR module and involves a maturation-dependent increase in the poly(A) tail. Interestingly, the Xenopus factors that mediate polyadenylation were also able to recognize and modify the conserved 3′-UTR from the human transcript (lanes 13 and 14), suggesting that translational regulation of this GTF might be conserved across species. Altered Levels of ALF and TFIIA Do Not Affect Oocyte Maturation—We wanted to know whether the switch from ALF to TFIIA was of direct importance for oocytes to advance through the maturation program. To test this question, we first showed that ALF and TFIIA subunits could be overexpressed in oocytes and that they would assemble into active factors. As determined by bandshift assays, the expression of TFIIA resulted in the appearance of a TFIIA-dependent TBP complex (Fig. 6A, lane 2). The amount of ALF complexes was unchanged when TFIIA was expressed, suggesting that the endogenous factor is quite stable. Expression of ALF caused a modest increase in ALF-dependent TBP complexes in immature oocytes (lane 5) and prevented the appearance of TFIIA that was normally observed when oocytes were treated with progesterone (lanes 4 and 6). Oocytes that overexpressed TFIIA showed no sign of early or accelerated maturation compared with control oocytes injected with water (Fig. 6B). Likewise, oocytes in which the appearance of TFIIA was prevented by overexpression of ALF also displayed maturation kinetics that were similar to controls. Thus, unlike factors such as c-mos and CPEB that have a direct influence on maturation, the exchange of TFIIA for ALF appears to be one of the many events that occur in anticipation of embryonic development. This observation is consistent with the fact that transcription is silenced during maturation and the fact that pre-existing pools of oocyte mRNA are sufficient for maturation even when transcription is inhibited (26Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ALF Reduces Polymerase II-dependent Transcription in Oocytes—The replacement of ALF for TFIIA in immature oocytes predicts that it would play an essential role in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription similar to that which TFIIA plays in somatic cells. To test this hypothesis, the ALF protein was inactivated in immature oocytes by the injection of affinity-purified ALF-specific antibodies. As judged by mobility shift assays, injection eliminated or supershifted nearly all the ALF-TBP-DNA complexes that were normally observed (Fig. 7A, lanes 4–6). When a thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase reporter construct was coinjected with the antibodies, transcription was reduced in an antibody dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 7B). Inhibition was factor-specific, because ALF antibodies could diminish TK promoter activity 11.1-fold, whereas an affinity-purified TFIIA-specific antibody reduced expression only 1.3-fold (Fig. 7C). ALF and TFIIA Have Opposite Effects on Transcription in Oocytes—To further establish the idea that ALF is an active replacement for TFIIA in oocytes, we asked whether overexpression would up-regulate transcription. ALF and TFIIAγ mRNAs were injected into oocytes and incubated for 12 h to allow for their production. Afterward, the oocytes were injected with the TK promoter construct to provide a platform for the assembly of an active preinitiation complex. The results showed that the activity of the luciferase reporter increased ∼3-fold under this protocol (Fig. 8). In contrast, activity was slightly reduced when TFIIAα/β or ALF antisense RNAs were injected and was unchanged when ALF RNA was injected (Fig. 8A). The results are consistent with the results of the immunodepletion experiments shown in Fig. 7 (B and C) and confirm that ALF is an active and positively acting transcription factor in oocytes. Earlier results had suggested that ALF and TFIIA were similar with respect to their ability to interact with TBP (7Upadhyaya A.B. Khan M. Mou T.-C. Junker M. Gray D.M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34208-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and that both could support RNA polymerase II activity in vitro (5Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Even though TFIIA is not normally present in oocytes, we wanted to evaluate whether it could function in this system. Surprisingly, overexpression of TFIIA caused luciferase activity to drop in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). This result suggests that although TFIIA activates transcription in somatic cell systems, it fails to function properly in the context of an in vivo system composed of oocyte-specific transcription factors. This behavior provides at least one rationale for why it would be silenced during oogenesis and why ALF would be up-regulated. Taken together, the results of the immunodepletion and overexpression assays demonstrate that ALF is an RNA polymerase II transcription factor that compensates for the translational inactivation of TFIIA. The reciprocal expression of ALF and TFIIA maintains a constant supply of this GTF in transcriptionally active somatic and germ line tissues (Fig. 9). There are three major conclusions in this report. First, the expression patterns for ALF and TFIIA during Xenopus oogenesis shows that RNA polymerase II uses one set of factors in somatic cells and another set of factors in germ cells (Fig. 9). In particular, the results reveal that the role of TFIIA is assumed by ALF during meiosis but is returned to TFIIA once embryonic cell divisions begin. Thus, the germ cell-specific ALF isoform provides a functional substitute for the maternal storage and translational inactivation of the somatic TFIIA isoform. Interestingly, the mouse TAF1L gene is up-regulated during male germ cell development, presumably to compensate for meiotic inactivation of the X-linked somatic cell-specific TAFII250 gene (16Wang P.J. Page D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether the transcriptional and translational control of separate genes or separate transcripts in germ cells will apply to all or only some of the core transcription factors. Second, the negative effect of the somatic factor TFIIA on the oocyte transcription machinery suggests that the germ cell transcription system is operationally distinct from the somatic system. Although previous studies have shown that ALF and TFIIA function in vitro and interact with TBP, the results here show that TFIIA represses the expression of a coinjected TK promoter construct in an in vivo system composed entirely of endogenous oocyte factors. Interestingly, germ cell-specific genes tend to evolve at a higher rate than somatic genes, and this includes ALF and TFIIA (8Han S. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that rapidly coevolving germ cell factors have maintained a working complementarity and that the introduction of a factor optimized for the somatic cell system results in a failure to support PIC assembly and function. Other studies in which somatic and germ cell factors have been swapped, including those of ACE, tubulins, and TBP variants, have also revealed a basic and perhaps intentional incompatability between systems (29Moore P.A.

Third, the exchange of ALF and TFIIA during oocyte development in X. laevis is due to transcriptional control of ALF and translational control of TFIIAα/β. Transcriptional control of ALF in male germ cells of mice involves DNA methylation (33Xie W.S. Han S.Y. Khan M. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17765-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but we do not know whether this mechanism also controls its expression in oocytes. Translational control of TFIIA is mediated by polyadenylation of a discrete 3′-UTR module present in both the Xenopus TFIIAα/β1 and TFIIAα/β2 transcripts. The relatively large size of the module (∼300 nucleotides) suggests that its function may depend on CPE elements or other sites for RNA-binding proteins and perhaps on the formation of a particular secondary structure. This module is similar to one in human TFIIAα/β, raising the possibility that translational regulation of these and perhaps other pairs of germ and somatic cell GTFs (including TFIIAγ; see Ref. 34Kashiwabara S.-I. Noguchi J. Zhuang T. Ohmura K. Honda A. Sugiura S. Miyamoto K. Takahashi S. Inoue K. Ogura A. Baba T. Science. 2002; 298: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) might be a phylogenetically conserved mechanism for controlling transcription factor activity. Like TFIIA, TBP is also absent from Xenopus oocytes (35Veenstra G.J.C. Destree O.H.J. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7972-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Bell P. Scheer U. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription in these cells might rely on a core promoter recognition complex composed of ALF, TLF/TRF2, or other factors. In fact, transcription factor variants in Drosophila (TRF2/TLF) and mouse (TAFII105) associate with proteins different from those that associate with TBP (15Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W.C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Nature. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Google Scholar, 37Hochheimer A. Zhou S. Zheng S. Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Nature. 2002; 420: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Given that TFIIA plays a role in the control of cell cycle regulated genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (38Ozer J. Lezina L.E. Ewing J. Audi S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Upadhyaya A.B. DeJong J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), it may be that ALF- and TFIIA-containing complexes have specific roles in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycle programs, respectively. The expression of new core promoter-associated transcription factor factors might also be related to the changes in DNA packaging and nuclear architecture that occur during germ cell development (40Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Experiments to address these issues will be an important focus of future studies. In conclusion, our work here shows that gene expression during oogenesis involves the mutually exclusive expression and translationally regulated exchange of germ- and somatic cell-specific GTFs. We appreciate the technical assistance of Lindsey B. Lutz."

In contrast to the earlier report, we demonstrate that water potential does affect oxygen affinity of trout hemoglobin I in the presence of inert solutes like betaine. Moreover, we show that upon oxygenation electrophoretically anodic hemoglobin from trout and eel bind a similar number of water molecules as does human hemoglobin A, whereas the cathodic hemoglobins of trout and eel bind smaller, but mutually similar, numbers of water molecules. Addition of cofactors strongly increases the number of water molecules bound to eel hemoglobin A (as in human hemoglobin) but only weakly affects water binding to eel hemoglobin C.

Addition of cofactors strongly increases the number of water molecules bound to eel hemoglobin A (as in human hemoglobin) but only weakly affects water binding to eel hemoglobin C. It is well established that changes in water activity regulate oxygen binding in adult human hemoglobin (HbA). 1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; R, relaxed; T, tense.1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; R, relaxed; T, tense. Upon oxygen binding, human HbA becomes more hydrated, taking up 60–70 water molecules; an increase in water activity thus increases oxygen affinity (1Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Colombo M.F. Bonilla-Rodriguez G.O. J. Biol.

Biopolymers. 2002; 63: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The greater hydration of the R (“relaxed” oxygenated) state of HbA compared with the T (“tense” deoxygenated) state is consistent with the (500–800 Å2) greater surface exposed to the solvent in the R state (5Chothia C. Wodak S. Janin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3793-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Lesk A.M. Janin J. Wodak S. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). How do other tetrameric Hbs respond to changes in water activity? Despite extensive data on the water sensitivity of human HbA, very little is known about how water affects oxygen binding in other tetrameric vertebrate Hbs. Fish Hbs that show a remarkably broad range of oxygen binding properties and allosteric effects and are well characterized from functional and structural points of view (7Brunori M. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1975; 9: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8di Prisco G. Tamburrini M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 102: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are excellent candidates for such analysis. In contrast to mammals that often have only one major Hb component, fish commonly have several isoHbs with marked functional differentiation, indicating an in vivo division of labor to ensure adequate O2 loading and unloading under various physiological and environmental conditions (7Brunori M. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1975; 9: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fish Hbs fall into two major categories (9Feuerlein R.J. Weber R.E. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1996; 165: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) based on their electrophoretical mobility at alkaline pH: 1) anodic Hbs found in all fish, whose oxygen affinities are strongly decreased by heterotropic ligands such as protons (Bohr and Root effects) and organic phosphates, and 2) cathodic Hbs encountered in eels, salmonids, and catfish, which show no or little Bohr and highly variable phosphate effects. Because of their higher O2 affinities and lower pH sensitivities, the cathodic Hbs are well suited for O2 transport under hypoxic, hypercapnic, or acidotic conditions (9Feuerlein R.J. Weber R.E. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1996; 165: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A feature distinguishing anodic fish Hbs from other pH-sensitive tetrameric Hbs, such as human HbA, is the Root effect, where drastic reductions in oxygen-carrying capacity and cooperativity at acidic pH marks stabilization of the low affinity T state with loss of the oxygen-driven, cooperative T-R transition (10Brittain T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1987; 86: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study is to analyze the water effect in various Hbs with different oxygen affinities and sensitivities to allosteric effectors, including human HbA and the cathodic and anodic Hbs from trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) and eel (Anguilla anguilla). Whereas the anodic Hbs from trout and eel are functionally similar, both showing Bohr and Root effects (11Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp.

Human HbA and cathodic and anodic Hbs from eel and trout were stripped from organic phosphates, and purified as described (9Feuerlein R.J. Weber R.E. J. Comp. Physiol.

The Hb solutions were stored at –80 °C in aliquots that were thawed immediately before oxygen binding studies. Water activity was varied by addition of inert solutes (which do not interact with the protein surface and therefore only have an indirect effect on oxygen affinity through changes in the water activity). In this “osmotic stress” method (1Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), changes in the Hb oxygen affinity are related to changes in water activity that can be converted to changes in protein hydration by use of linkage equations. To Hb solutions (0.1 mm heme) at pH 7.3 in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, appropriate aliquots of standard sucrose, betaine, or glycine stock solutions were added in order to achieve different water activities (aw). Sucrose was used to replicate the conditions adopted by Bellelli et al. (18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4742-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on trout HbI. Betaine was chosen because it was found to be preferentially excluded from protein surfaces (20Courtenay E.S. Capp M.W. Anderson C.F. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4455-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Glycine is conveniently used as inert solute in osmotic stress studies because it does not show significant interaction with protein (including Hb) surfaces (2Colombo M.F. Bonilla-Rodriguez G.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4895-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). O2 equilibria of 4-μl Hb subsamples were recorded using a modified gas diffusion chamber fed by cascaded Wösthoff gas-mixing pumps that produce stepwise increases in O2 tension by mixing air or O2 with ultrapure (>99.998%) N2 while absorbance at 436 nm was recorded continuously (21Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A BMS 2 MK 2 thermostated microelectrode (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to measure pH in 100-μl subsamples. All equilibria measurements were carried out at 15 °C. O2 affinity (P 50, half-saturation O2 tension) and the cooperativity (Hill) coefficient at half saturation (n 50) were interpolated from Hill plots [log (Y/(1–Y) versus log P O2, where Y is the fractional saturation and P O2 is the O2 tension] constructed from data points between 30 and 70% saturation. Osmolalities were measured in 150-μl samples on a Semi-Micro Osmometer (Knauer, Kiel, Germany), and water activities were calculated according to Ref. 2Colombo M.F. Bonilla-Rodriguez G.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4895-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar as shown in Equation 1lnaw=-OsmMw(Eq. 1) where Osm is the solution osmolality (mol Kg–1) and Mw is the molality of pure water (55.56 mol Kg–1). To analyze the effect of water as a single heterotropic ligand on oxygenation, we used the Wyman linkage equation (1Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 22Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; : 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 23Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage: Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990: 123-163Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2dln(P50)dln(aw)=-Δnw4=-(nwoxy-nwdeoxy)(Eq. 2) where aw is the activity of water. The slope of the linkage plot ln(P 50) versus ln(aw) gives the apparent difference in number of water molecules bound to the oxy and deoxy structures of Hb, Δnw. This analysis is based on the assumption that the activity of only a single heterotropic ligand, in this case water, varies. If the activity of more than one heterotropic ligand (e.g. solute and water) varies, the number of oxygen-linked water molecules will be overestimated. An extended linkage equation based on the Gibbs-Duhem relationship allows quantification of the separate contributions of solute and water to the regulation of O2 binding. Starting from the Gibbs-Duhem relation one can show (2Colombo M.F. Bonilla-Rodriguez G.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4895-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), as in Equation 3, that dln(Pm)dln(as)=4msmwΔnw-Δns(Eq. 3) where ms and mw are solute and water molality, respectively, and Pm is the median oxygen tension. For a reasonably symmetric oxygen equilibrium curve, Pm can be replaced by P 50. and realizing that dln(as) = dln(ms) Equation 3 can be integrated to yield, as shown in Equation 4, lnP50P500=4Δnwmw(eln(ms)-1)-Δnsln(ms)(Eq. 4) where P0,50, is P 50 at 1000 mosm. The (P50/P050) data were plotted as function of ln(aw) or ln(ms) and fitted by least-squares procedures to either the Wyman (Equation 2) or the Gibbs-Duhem (Equation 4) equations in order to obtain Δnw and Δns, the apparent number of oxygen-linked water and solute molecules, respectively. For detailed analysis of the allosteric interactions, oxygen equilibrium measurements were carried out at extreme (low and high) fractional saturations and fitted according to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (24Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6105) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 5Y=LKTPO2[1+KTPO2]3+KRPO2(1+KRPO2)3L(1+KTPO2)4+(1+KRPO2)4(Eq. 5) where L is the allosteric constant in the absence of ligand defined as [T 0]/[R 0], K T and K R are the intrinsic ligand affinities of the T and R states, respectively. The parameters of the equation were estimated from non-linear least-squares curve fitting. In human HbA and the anodic trout and eel Hbs, an increase in water activity increases oxygen affinity (Fig. 1), as evident from the slopes of plots of (P50/P050) versus ln(aw) (Fig. 1A) and (P50/P050) versus ln(Osm) (Fig. 1B). The effect of changes of water and solute activity is identical for all three Hbs, and analysis of the data according to the Wyman and Gibbs-Duhem equations shows binding of 42–43 additional water molecules in the T-R transition (Table I). Moreover, the different solutes tested have a similar effect on oxygen binding independent of their physical and chemical properties (Fig. 1). This indicates that they only affect oxygen affinity indirectly through changes in water activity, which validates their use in osmotic stress experiments. Increasing water activity also increases O2 affinity of the cathodic Hbs (trout HbI and eel HbC) to the same extent and independently of the use of betaine or glycine (Fig. 2) but to a lesser degree than in the anodic Hbs. Curve fitting of the data shows binding of 17–31 water molecules bound upon oxygenation (Table I), reflecting lower water sensitivity than in human HbA and the anodic fish Hbs. However, the addition of sucrose does not affect the oxygen affinity of trout HbI as previously reported (18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol.

Addition of KCl and GTP increases the number of water molecules involved in the deoxy to oxy transition from 42–43 to 118–129 per tetramer (Table I). An analogous effect of KCl and GTP was not seen in cathodic eel HbC (Fig. 4; Table I). Eel cathodic HbC is clearly less sensitive to changes in water activity than eel anodic HbA, both in the presence and absence of cofactors. However, for all Hbs investigated here oxygen affinities increase with increasing water chemical potential. Extended Hill plots derived from precise oxygen equilibrium measurements over a wide saturation range were carried out on human HbA, eel HbA, and HbC in the absence and presence of 1 m betaine to obtain insight into the allosteric control mechanism underlying the effect of water activity. Decreasing water activity affects human HbA and anodic and cathodic eel Hbs in different ways (Fig. 5, A–C). Whereas an increased solute level decreases only K T in human HbA (Fig. 5A), it decreases both K T and K R in eel HbA and HbC, decreasing L more strongly in HbC than in HbA (Fig. 5, B and C; Table II).Table IIMWC and derived parameters for human HbA, eel HbA, and eel HbC at 15 °C in the absence and presence of 1 m betaineSpeciesEffectorP50Pmn50nmaxLog K T ± S.E.Log K R ± S.E.Log L ± S.E.ΔGHuman HbABetaine1.020.972.552.57-0.66 ± 0.0230.99 ± 0.0483.95 ± 0.1878.930.910.882.332.34-0.54 ± 0.0320.91 ± 0.0493.41 ± 0.1897.69Eel HbABetaine4.745.011.451.48-1.29 ± 0.113-0.46 ± 0.0350.93 ± 0.1633.403.023.041.281.28-0.78 ± 0.087-0.23 ± 0.0660.98 ± 0.3282.17Eel HbCBetaine0.991.091.791.87-0.99 ± 0.1280.30 ± 0.0261.32 ± 0.09235.630.780.791.641.65-0.39 ± 0.0560.49 ± 0.0531.56 ± 0.2024.30 Open table in a new tab We found only slight differences in the number of oxygen-linked water molecules when fitting the Wyman linkage equation and the Gibbs-Duhem equation, respectively. Such differences have been previously reported (2Colombo M.F. Bonilla-Rodriguez G.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4895-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and reflect the intrinsic assumption of the Wyman equation in osmotic stress experiments that oxygen affinity responds only to water activity changes and that solutes do not undergo functionally significant interaction with the protein surface. This assumption is supported by the finding that the number of oxygenation-linked, bound solute molecules estimated with the Gibbs-Duhem equation is close to zero and independent of the chemical nature, size, and charge of the solutes. Accordingly, the closer Δns is to zero, the better the agreement between the Δnw values calculated using the two equations (Table I). However, the agreement between Δnw values calculated by the two equations may not be uniquely related to the absence of solute binding, as indicated by the similar values for eel HbA, which shows apparent oxygen-linked solute binding in the presence of GTP + KCl (Table I). Only ∼25 additional water molecules bind to human HbA during the deoxy to oxy transition in the absence of anions, in contrast to ∼72 molecules in the presence of saturating levels of Cl– or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (3Colombo M.F. Seixas F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11741-11748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of 45–50 water molecules was ascribed either to local dehydration of the anion binding site upon complex formation or to global change in the protein conformation induced by anion binding, although a release of 45–50 water molecules was assumed to be too large an effect to be attributed only to the reorganization of bound water molecules at the phosphates binding site (3Colombo M.F. Seixas F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11741-11748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our value of 42–43 water molecules that are bound to human HbA during oxygenation is intermediate between the values of ∼25 molecules found for stripped, deionized HbA in weak (10 mm Hepes) buffer (3Colombo M.F. Seixas F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11741-11748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and ∼60–70 found for HbA (1Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m NaCl and 0.05 m Tris buffer, suggesting sensitivity to different buffer conditions. We here show that the physiological effectors GTP and Cl– increase the number of water molecules bound to eel HbA from 40–43 in stripped Hb to 118–129 (Table I). The structural basis for this increase in hydration is not known or whether the increase can be related to the strong phosphate and pH effects observed in anodic fish Hbs. The cathodic fish Hbs studied here (trout HbI and eel HbC) analogously respond to an increase in water activity with an increased oxygen binding, indicating preferential binding of water molecules to the R state. These Hbs bind a mutually similar but smaller number of water molecules than the anodic Hbs during the deoxy to oxy transition (∼17–31, when betaine is used as solute; Table I) despite marked differences in their sensitivity to organic phosphates, which is lacking in trout HbI and pronounced in eel HbC (9Feuerlein R.J. Weber R.E. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1996; 165: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Giardina B. Giacometti G.M. Coletta M. Brunori M. Giacometti G. Rigatti G. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Bellelli et al. (18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4742-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that addition of sucrose to trout HbI solutions had no effect on oxygen binding, suggesting that trout HbI may be insensitive to changes in water activity. To test this, we examined the effects of sucrose and of betaine, which is the solute least likely among a range of tested solutes to interact with protein surfaces (20Courtenay E.S. Capp M.W. Anderson C.F. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4455-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In agreement with the observation of Bellelli et al. (18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4742-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trout HbI showed almost no response to varying sucrose concentrations but did show similar responses as the other tetrameric Hbs investigated in the presence of betaine, binding ∼17–31 additional water molecules upon oxygenation (Fig. 2; Table I). The results obtained with betaine may thus represent a general response to changes in water activity among tetrameric Hbs. A possible explanation for the lack of a water effect in trout HbI in the presence of sucrose may be that sucrose has a 2-fold effect on this Hb, one on water activity (stabilizing the R state) and one on the dielectric constant of the medium (stabilizing the T state; Ref. 18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4742-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two effects may act in opposite directions and obliterate each other. This can be compared with the Cl– effect on human HbA that involves both direct interaction with the protein and an indirect effect exerted through a change in water activity (26Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10517-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Rand R.P. Parsegian V.A. Rau D.C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1018-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sucrose and Cl– would thus be poor choices for investigating osmotic stress in trout HbI or human HbA, respectively. In contrast to trout HbI, sucrose and betaine have superimposable effects on trout HbIV and are in this case inert solutes. Sucrose, glycerol, and glucose also have superimposable effects on the oxygen affinity of the clam Scapharca inaequivalvis HbI (28Royer Jr., W.E. Pardanani A. Gibson Q.H. Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14526-14531Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), supporting the view that the apparent sucrose insensitivity in trout HbI is due to specific properties of this Hb molecule. The highly consistent results obtained with betaine in the proteins investigated here confirm the inference of Courtenay et al. (20Courtenay E.S. Capp M.W. Anderson C.F. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4455-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) that betaine may be the most appropriate solute in osmotic stress experiments and in protein hydration studies. In studies on solvation effects in proteins, differences in the size of the solvent-accessible area between conformational states are determining factors (1Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of trout HbI is that compared with human HbA it has a larger buried surface area in the R state than in the T state (17Tame J.H. Wilson J.C. Weber R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless it binds water molecules upon oxygenation, albeit to a lesser extent than human HbA. This indicates that factors other than surface accessible area influences protein hydration. One possibility is that upon oxygenation of trout HbI the ratio of polar to hydrophobic amino acid surface residues increases even though the overall solvent-accessible area decreases. Taken together, human and anodic and cathodic fish Hbs show similar overall sensitivities to changes in water activity despite the diversity in their pH and phosphate effects. This suggests that the amino acid residues responsible for allosteric effects, such as the Bohr effect and phosphate and anion sensitivities, do not necessarily contribute to water sensitivity. This seems logical because water sensitivity may be expected to rely on the presence/absence of hydrophilic residues on the protein surface, whereas the requirements for Bohr groups are more stringent and relate to their precise spatial distribution and changes in proton binding affinity in response to ligand binding. In the highly phosphate-sensitive eel HbC, addition of GTP and KCl does not alter the allosteric water binding, suggesting that the central cavity at the phosphate-binding site does not contribute to differential hydration between T and R states (Fig. 4). This is the opposite of anodic eel HbA where addition of allosteric cofactors increases the number of water molecules bound upon oxygenation almost 3-fold (Fig. 3; Table I), resembling the situation in human HbA discussed above. As also concluded by Colombo and Seixas (3Colombo M.F. Seixas F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11741-11748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that this strong interplay between allosteric anions and water binding should reflect reorganization of bound water molecules at the anion binding sites alone and may reflect more radical conformational changes. Clearly, some basic structural differences seem to exist in phosphate-induced conformational changes between eel Hbs C and A. In conclusion, we show that all the tetrameric Hbs investigated here respond to an increase in water activity by stabilizing the R state conformation and that the number of oxygen-linked water molecules is similar among anodic Hbs (human HbA, eel HbA, and trout HbIV) and among cathodic ones (eel HbC and trout HbI), ∼43 and ∼17–31, respectively. The only data on fish Hbs that hitherto were available (showing absence of hydration effects on trout HbI, Ref. 18Bellelli A. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4742-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) thus cannot be considered representative of fish Hbs and may have been influenced by the specific experimental conditions and solute choice."
