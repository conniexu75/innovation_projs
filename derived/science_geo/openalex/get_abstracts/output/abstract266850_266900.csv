https://openalex.org/W2014239858,"The mass of extraterrestrial material accreted by the Earth as submillimeter particles has not previously been measured with a single direct and precise technique that samples the particle sizes representing most of that mass. The flux of meteoroids in the mass range 10(-9) to 10(-4) grams has now been determined from an examination of hypervelocity impact craters on the space-facing end of the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite. The meteoroid mass distribution peaks near 1.5 x 10(-5) grams (200 micrometers in diameter), and the small particle mass accretion rate is (40 +/- 20) x 106 kilograms per year, higher than previous estimates but in good agreement with total terrestrial mass accretion rates found by geochemical methods. This mass input is comparable with or greater than the average contribution from extraterrestrial bodies in the 1-centimeter to 10-kilometer size range."
https://openalex.org/W2030348009,"Arctic tundra has large amounts of stored carbon and is thought to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) (0.1 to 0.3 petagram of carbon per year) (1 petagram = 10(15) grams). But this estimate of carbon balance is only for terrestrial ecosystems. Measurements of the partial pressure of CO(2) in 29 aquatic ecosystems across arctic Alaska showed that in most cases (27 of 29) CO(2) was released to the atmosphere. This CO(2) probably originates in terrestrial environments; erosion of particulate carbon plus ground-water transport of dissolved carbon from tundra contribute to the CO(2) flux from surface waters to the atmosphere. If this mechanism is typical of that of other tundra areas, then current estimates of the arctic terrestrial sink for atmospheric CO(2) may be 20 percent too high."
https://openalex.org/W2052832664,"The melting curves of two compositions of (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskite, the likely dominant mineral phase in the lower mantle, have been measured in a CO2 laser-heated diamond cell with direct temperature measurements and in situ detection of melting. At 625 kilobars, the melting temperature is 5000 ± 200 kelvin, independent of composition. Extrapolation to the core-mantle boundary pressure of 1.35 megabar with three different melting relations yields melting temperatures between 7000 and 8500 kelvin. Thus, the temperature at the base of the lower mantle, accepted to lie between 2550 and 2750 kelvin, is only at about one-third of the melting temperature. The large difference between mantle temperature and corresponding melting temperature has several important implications; particularly the temperature sensitivity of the viscosity is reduced thus allowing large lateral temperature variations inferred from seismic tomographic velocity anomalies and systematics found in measured velocity-density functions. Extensive melting of the lower mantle can be ruled out throughout the history of the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2093409889,"A novel open antimony sulfide framework of composition [Sb(3)S(5)](-) has been synthesized hydrothermally, in the presence of tetramethyl ammonium ions. Determination of the crystal structure demonstrates that the (Me(4)N)(+) molecules (Me, methyl) occlude a system of intersecting channels at 90 degrees to one another. The three-dimensional framework is assembled from a new building unit, flat s-shaped buckled sheets of edge-linked 4-rings containing Sb(2)S(2) moieties. These are cross-linked in two directions to form the system of channels."
https://openalex.org/W1978077434,"Studies of food remains from the Preceramic monumental site of E1 Paraíso, Peru (1800 to 1500 B.C.), have shed new light on a debate regarding the relative importance of seafood versus terrestrial resources and the role of cultigens in subsistence economies during the early development of Peruvian civilization. Fish was the primary animal food at the site whereas plant foods consisted of a mixture of cultivated resources (squashes, beans, peppers, and jicama) with an additional reliance on fruits (guava, lucuma, and pacae). Wild plants, especially the roots of sedges and cat-tail, also may have accounted for a substantial part of the diet. Cotton was a chief crop, used in making fishing tackle and the textiles that served as clothing and items of high value and status. As an example of the beginnings of civilization, El Paraíso is a case in which impressive architecture was built on a relatively simple subsistence economy and energy was expended in the production of resources useful in local and regional exchange systems."
https://openalex.org/W1993930384,"Ants of the ponerine genus Odontomachus use a trap jaw mechanism when hunting fast prey. When particular trigger hairs, located on the inner edge of the mandibles, are touched by prey, the jaws close extremely rapidly and trap the target. This trap jaw response lasts only 0.33 to 1 millisecond. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the trigger hairs function as mechanoreceptors. Associated with each trigger hair are large sensory cells, the sensory axons of which measure 15 to 20 micrometers in diameter. These are among the largest sensory neurons, and their size implies that these axons conduct information very rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1996462955,"Thin films of monatomic fluid constrained between two plane-parallel structured solid walls have been modeled by Monte Carlo simulation under conditions (fixed temperature, chemical potential, and normal stress or load) prevailing in high-precision measurements of surface forces. Several states of the film, corresponding to different numbers of layers of fluid parallel with the walls, are generally consistent with these conditions, but only one is thermodynamically stable; the others are metastable. When the walls are properly aligned, epitaxial solid phases are stable. These melt under shear, eventually becoming metastable, whereupon a drainage (or imbibition) transition occurs, leading to a stable phase with fewer (or more) layers."
https://openalex.org/W2051861515,"Most of the earth's mantle is made up of high-pressure silicate minerals that contain octahedrally coordinated silicon (Si(VI)), but many thermodynamically important details of cation site ordering remain unknown. Silicon-29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is potentially very useful for determining short-range structure. A systematic study of silicon-29 chemical shifts for Si(VI) has revealed empirical correlations between shift and structure that are useful in understanding several new calcium silicates. The observed ordering state of a number of high-pressure magnesium silicates is consistent with the results of previous x-ray diffraction studies."
https://openalex.org/W2090396214,"Two vertebrates from the Colorado Formation are known to have acellular bone and dentine, tissues found in heterostracan fishes and proposed as the primitive exoskeleton. High-resolution optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicate that a third vertebrate is represented by a quite distinct exoskeleton of denticles, with many cell and cell process spaces throughout, tissue that resembles that of osteostracans more than heterostracans. Cellular bone coexists with cellular dentine in this Ordovician vertebrate, demonstrating that these skeletal tissues are as old as acellular bone. Both are proposed to come from neural crest because denticles are considered homologous with teeth."

https://openalex.org/W2002452083,"The evolution of disorder in response to period adaptation in a hexagonal magnetic bubble array is shown to arise from the proliferation of dislocations and to proceed by means of intermediate states of steadily decreasing hexatic order to an amorphous final state. Remarkably, each dislocation core imposes a size adjustment on bubbles decorating its constituent pair of five- and sevenfold coordinated sites. Topological disorder thus induces intrinsic polydispersity and converts the initially unimodal size distribution into a trimodal one. This intimate interplay between geometry and topology provides an explicit mechanism by which structural disorder arises as a result of frustration."
https://openalex.org/W2086908568,"Climatologists cannot agree whether or not the world is experiencing a greenhouse warming. James Hansen is confidant that the warming is taking place. According to three major measures, 1990 was the hottest year on record (globe was 0.45{degrees}C warmer than normal) with Greenland being the only place below normal. Ocean surface temperatures were measured to be 0.39{degrees}C above normal, and air temperatures at altitudes of 1.5 and 9 kilometers were 0.02{degrees}C above the previous record set in 1988. Hansen claims that the surface temperature elevations measured roughly conform with projections made by his climate model."

https://openalex.org/W2055390617,"A recent work of Spencer and Christy (1990) on precise monitoring of global temperature trends from satellites is critically examined. It is tentatively concluded in the present comment that remote sensing using satellite microwave radiometers can in fact provide a means for the monitoring of troposphere-averaged air temperature. However, for this to be successful more than one decade of data will be required to overcome the apparent inherent variability of global average air temperature. It is argued that the data set reported by Spencer and Christy should be subjected to careful review before it is interpreted as evidence of the presence or absence of global warming. In a reply, Christy provides specific responses to the commenters' objections."
