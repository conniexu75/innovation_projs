https://openalex.org/W2096791516,"By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations."
https://openalex.org/W2025981493,"The ability to design and assemble three-dimensional structures from colloidal particles is limited by the absence of specific directional bonds. As a result, complex or low-coordination structures, common in atomic and molecular systems, are rare in the colloidal domain. Here we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogues of atoms with valence: colloidal particles with chemically distinct surface patches that imitate hybridized atomic orbitals, including sp, sp2, sp3, sp3d, sp3d2 and sp3d3. Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization. These features allow the particles to self-assemble into ‘colloidal molecules’ with triangular, tetrahedral and other bonding symmetries, and should also give access to a rich variety of new microstructured colloidal materials. A general method of creating colloidal particles that can self-assemble into ‘colloidal molecules’ is described: surface patches with well-defined symmetries are functionalized using DNA with single-stranded sticky ends and imitate hybridized atomic orbitals to form highly directional bonds. Chemists routinely use atoms that can form directional bonds to assemble complex and useful molecular structures. But larger colloidal particles have proved less conducive to rational assembly because they lack specific directional bonds. David Pine and colleagues now report a way around this problem that could lead to the creation of a rich variety of new micro-structured colloidal materials with technologically useful properties. Using microsphere clusters as intermediates, they create colloidal particles with chemically distinct and precisely located 'sticky patches' on the surface — up to 7 per particle — that enable specific and highly directional bonding. Using this system, they assemble 'colloidal molecules' exhibiting a wide range of bonding symmetries."
https://openalex.org/W2115470184,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo constant fusion and fission that are essential for maintaining physiological functions of cells. Although dysfunction of mitochondria has been implicated in tumorigenesis, little is known about the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in metastasis, the major cause of cancer death. In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes. Compared with non-metastatic breast cancer cells, mitochondria also were more fragmented in metastatic breast cancer cells that express higher levels of total and active Drp1 and less mitochondrial fusion protein 1 (Mfn1). Silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 resulted in mitochondria elongation or clusters, respectively, and significantly suppressed metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. In contrast, silencing Mfn proteins led to mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, these manipulations of mitochondrial dynamics altered the subcellular distribution of mitochondria in breast cancer cells. For example, silencing Drp1 or overexpression of Mfn1 inhibited lamellipodia formation, a key step for cancer metastasis, and suppressed chemoattractant-induced recruitment of mitochondria to lamellipodial regions. Conversely, silencing Mfn proteins resulted in more cell spreading and lamellipodia formation, causing accumulation of more mitochondria in lamellipodia regions. More importantly, treatment with a mitochondrial uncoupling agent or adenosine triphosphate synthesis inhibitor reduced lamellipodia formation and decreased breast cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting a functional importance of mitochondria in breast cancer metastasis. Together, our findings show a new role and mechanism for regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion by mitochondrial dynamics. Thus targeting dysregulated Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission may provide a novel strategy for suppressing breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2137529507,"The ability to control and tune interactions in ultracold atomic gases has paved the way towards the realization of new phases of matter. Whereas experiments have so far achieved a high degree of control over short-ranged interactions, the realization of long-range interactions would open up a whole new realm of many-body physics and has become a central focus of research. Rydberg atoms are very well-suited to achieve this goal, as the van der Waals forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than for ground state atoms. Consequently, the mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are transferred to Rydberg states. A key example are quantum crystals, composed of coherent superpositions of different spatially ordered configurations of collective excitations. Here we report on the direct measurement of strong correlations in a laser excited two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator using high-resolution, in-situ Rydberg atom imaging. The observations reveal the emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns in the high-density components of the prepared many-body state. They have random orientation, but well defined geometry, forming mesoscopic crystals of collective excitations delocalised throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of Rydberg gases to realise exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for quantum simulations of long-range interacting quantum magnets."
https://openalex.org/W2169977305,"In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cell cultures secrete exosomes containing amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and the APP-processing products, C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and amyloid-β (Aβ). We investigated the secretion of full-length APP (flAPP) and APP CTFs via the exosome secretory pathway in vivo. To this end, we developed a novel protocol designed to isolate exosomes secreted into mouse brain extracellular space. Exosomes with typical morphology were isolated from freshly removed mouse brains and from frozen mouse and human brain tissues, demonstrating that exosomes can be isolated from post-mortem tissue frozen for long periods of time. flAPP, APP CTFs, and enzymes that cleave both flAPP and APP CTFs were identified in brain exosomes. Although higher levels of both flAPP and APP CTFs were observed in exosomes isolated from the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing human APP (Tg2576) compared with wild-type control mice, there was no difference in the number of secreted brain exosomes. These data indicate that the levels of flAPP and APP CTFs associated with exosomes mirror the cellular levels of flAPP and APP CTFs. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from the brains of both Tg2576 and wild-type mice are enriched with APP CTFs relative to flAPP. Thus, we hypothesize that the exosome secretory pathway plays a pleiotropic role in the brain: exosome secretion is beneficial to the cell, acting as a specific releasing system of neurotoxic APP CTFs and Aβ, but the secretion of exosomes enriched with APP CTFs, neurotoxic proteins that are also a source of secreted Aβ, is harmful to the brain. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cell cultures secrete exosomes containing amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and the APP-processing products, C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and amyloid-β (Aβ). We investigated the secretion of full-length APP (flAPP) and APP CTFs via the exosome secretory pathway in vivo.

Exosomes are small membranous vesicles formed by the invagination of the membrane of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) 3The abbreviations used are: MVBmultivesicular bodyAβamyloid-βADAlzheimer diseaseflAPPfull-length amyloid-β precursor proteinCTFC-terminal fragmentAChEacetylcholine esterasePrPprion protein. around cytoplasmic materials, including proteins and RNAs. Mature exosomes remain inside the lumen of the MVB until they are secreted into the extracellular space when the MVB fuses with the cytoplasmic membrane (1.Stoorvogel W. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Raposo G. The biogenesis and functions of exosomes.Traffic. 2002; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Secreted exosomes are taken up by target cells, and exosome content is delivered into the recipient cell (2.Février B. Raposo G. Exosomes: endosomal-derived vesicles shipping extracellular messages.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The composition of the double-layer membrane renders exosomes more stable in the extracellular environment compared with soluble proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W.

Secreted exosomes were first isolated from the conditioned medium of immature sheep reticulocytes (4.Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, in vitro studies have shown that exosomes are secreted by various cell types (3.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W. Proteomic profiling of exosomes: current perspectives.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 4083-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The presence of exosomes in the nervous system in vivo has not been demonstrated, but tissue culture studies have shown that neurons and astrocytes release exosomes (5.Fauré J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Exosomes are released by cultured cortical neurones.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Rat and mouse cortical neurons secrete exosomes in culture that have the typical features of size, density, and saponin sensitivity (5.Fauré J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Exosomes are released by cultured cortical neurones.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Using proteomic methods, it was shown that these exosomes resemble exosomes isolated from other non-neuronal cell types, containing typical exosomal markers such as alix, flotillin, and TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene-101) but also containing neuron-specific components (5.Fauré J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Exosomes are released by cultured cortical neurones.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Exosome secretion was originally described as a complementary process to the lysosomal and proteasomal degradative pathways for shedding obsolete membrane and cytosolic proteins in differentiating reticulocytes (4.Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. Vesicle formation during reticulocyte maturation. Association of plasma membrane activities with released vesicles (exosomes).J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of neuron-specific components associated with exosomes (5.Fauré J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J.

Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) suggested that secreted exosomes have roles also in cell signaling functions (6.Record M. Subra C. Silvente-Poirot S. Poirot M. Exosomes as intercellular signalosomes and pharmacological effectors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 81: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), shuttling cargo between cells and tissues (7.Smalheiser N.R. Exosomal transfer of proteins and RNAs at synapses in the nervous system.Biol. Direct. 2007; 2: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), regulating neurotransmitter receptor levels at the synapse, controlling the production and turnover of myelin membrane proteins, and participating in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases by relieving the cell from infectious and cytotoxic materials that accumulate in the MVBs (8.Gould S.J.

HIV and mature dendritic cells: Trojan exosomes riding the Trojan horse?.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000740Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A pathogenic function of exosomes was proposed suggesting that it is a pathway for transfer of pathogens between cells. One such pathogen that exploits this pathway is the prion, the infectious particle responsible for transmissible neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (9.Vella L.J. Sharples R.A. Nisbet R.M. Cappai R. Hill A.F. The role of exosomes in the processing of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A pathogenic role for exosomes was also proposed for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposited in the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Exosomes isolated from the conditioned medium of neuronal cell cultures transport the full-length amyloid-β precursor protein (flAPP), APP metabolites, and the enzymes that cleave both flAPP and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) to the extracellular space (11.Vingtdeux V. Hamdane M. Loyens A. Gelé P. Drobeck H. Bégard S. Galas M.C. Delacourte A. Beauvillain J.C. Buée L. Sergeant N.

Chem. 2007; 282: 18197-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the basis of these in vitro studies, we undertook to determine the effect of higher levels of APP expression in the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing human APP with the K670N/M671L Swedish double mutation (Tg2576) (12.Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Correlative memory deficits, Aβ elevation, and amyloid plaques in transgenic mice.Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3688) Google Scholar) on the number of exosomes secreted and exosomal levels of flAPP and APP CTFs. Although exosomes were isolated from conditioned culture media and bodily fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine (13.Keller S. Sanderson M.P. Stoeck A. Altevogt P. Exosomes: from biogenesis and secretion to biological function.Immunol. Lett. 2006; 107: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), exosomes secreted into the extracellular space of tissues have not been described. Therefore, we designed a novel protocol to isolate exosomes from either fresh or frozen brain tissue. We show here that in accordance with the high levels of flAPP and APP CTFs in the brains of Tg2576 mice, exosomes secreted into the extracellular space of these mice contain higher levels of flAPP and APP CTFs than exosomes secreted in the brains of wild-type control mice. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the ratio of APP CTFs to flAPP is higher in brain exosomes compared with brain homogenates in both Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice. These data show that the amount of flAPP and APP CTFs secreted out of the cell by brain exosomes is proportional to their brain levels but that brain exosomes are specifically enriched with APP CTFs regardless of levels of APP expression. We isolated exosomes from the brains of 16–17-month-old APP transgenic mice (Tg2576) and age- and gender-matched wild-type controls. Either freshly removed or frozen brains were used. In each experiment, exosomes were simultaneously isolated from the brains of a transgenic and a wild-type littermate non-transgenic control mice. For each brain, the right hemi-brain was processed for exosome isolation, and the left hemi-brain was homogenized in cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (P8340, Sigma) for protein analysis by Western blotting. All animal procedures were performed following the National Institutes of Health guidelines with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research. All efforts have been made to minimize animal suffering and the numbers of mice used. We isolated exosomes from Brodmann area 9 of human tissue obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (Belmont, MA). The tissues were obtained from an AD patient, Braak V (14.Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological staging of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar), a 73-year-old female (post-mortem interval of 17.67 h), and a neuropathologically normal control, a 70-year-old male (post-mortem interval of 25.83 h). Fresh or previously frozen murine hemi-brains were dissected and treated with 20 units/ml papain (Worthington) in Hibernate E solution (3 ml/hemi-brain; BrainBits, Springfield, IL) for 15 min at 37 °C. The brain tissue was gently homogenized in 2 volumes (6 ml/hemi-brain) of cold Hibernate E solution. The brain homogenate was sequentially filtered through a 40-μm mesh filter (BD Biosciences) and a 0.2-μm syringe filter (Thermo Scientific). Exosomes were isolated from the filtrate as described previously (15.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the filtrate was sequentially centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to discard cells, membranes, and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C to pellet exosomes. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of cold PBS (Invitrogen), and the exosome solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The washed exosome pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.95 m sucrose solution and inserted inside a sucrose step gradient column (six 2-ml steps starting from 2.0 m sucrose up to 0.25 m sucrose in 0.35 m increments, with the 0.95 m sucrose step containing the exosomes). The sucrose step gradient was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. One-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and fractions flanking the interphase separating two neighboring sucrose layers were pooled together for a total of seven fractions (a, top 1-ml fraction; b, 2-ml; c, 2-ml; d, 2-ml; e, 2-ml; f, 2-ml; and g, bottom 1-ml fraction). These fractions were diluted in cold PBS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 70 min. Sucrose gradient fraction pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of cold PBS. Two μl were used to measure acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, and 2-μl were used for EM. Exosome lysate was prepared by mixing 16 μl of the leftover solution with an equal volume of 2× radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. We used 2 μl of the lysate to quantify exosomal protein content (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) and 10 μl of the lysate (31% of the exosome lysate total volume) for protein analysis by Western blotting. The AChE activity assay was based on the Ellman assay described previously (16.Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. A new and rapid colorimetric determination of acetylcholinesterase activity.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21368) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of exosome resuspended in PBS were diluted in 298 μl of AChE assay working solution (1.25 mm acetylthiocholine (A5751, Sigma) and 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (D8130, Sigma) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 412 nm to quantify AChE activity in the exosome solution. Brain homogenates (10 μg of protein) and exosomal proteins (10 μl of the lysate corresponding to 31% of the exosome lysate total volume) were separated by 4–20% Tris/glycine gel electrophoresis (Criterion precast gel, Bio-Rad). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-flotillin (1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-APP (C1/6.1, 1:1000) (17.Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Grbovic O.M. Mercken M. Nixon R.A. Calpain activity regulates the cell surface distribution of amyloid precursor protein.

Protein bands were quantified using NIH ImageJ. Two μl of exosome solutions were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in PBS. Fractions collected from the sucrose gradient column were subjected to analysis by EM. Immuno-EM analysis of these fractions does not work due to residual sucrose in the samples. Aliquots of the exosome solution, retrieved prior to purification on a sucrose step gradient column, were immunostained as described previously (15.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with antibodies to TSG101 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); flotillin (BD Biosciences); flAPP and APP CTFs (C1/6.1); flAPP, APP CTFs, and Aβ (4G8, Covance Antibody Services, Dedham, MA); and flAPP, APP CTFs, and Aβ (6E10, Signet). Images were captured on a Hamamatsu digital camera (model C4742-95) attached to a Philips CM10 electron microscope using Advantage CCD camera system software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp.). Student's t test and analysis of variance were performed using SPSS 15.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). All results are the combination of data collected from at least three independent experiments. We have developed a protocol designed to isolate exosomes from the extracellular space of freshly removed murine brain tissue (Fig. 1). Exosomes were isolated from one-hemi-brain of each mouse, and the other hemi-brain was homogenized for Western blot analysis. Murine hemi-brains were treated with papain in Hibernate E solution to loosen the hemi-brain extracellular matrix and to release extracellular material, including brain exosomes in solution. This procedure is widely used for harvesting viable primary neurons from fresh brain tissue (18.Tizon B. Ribe E.M. Mi W. Troy C.M. Levy E. Cystatin C protects neuronal cells from amyloid-β-induced toxicity.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 19: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mild papain treatment does not trigger cell lysis and thus prevents the contamination of the extracellular fluid with intracellular organelles and vesicles. Filtration of the brain extracellular material is performed to discard brain cells and debris, followed by a series of centrifugation steps to isolate brain exosomes (15.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brain exosomes were further purified by fractionation on a sucrose step gradient. EM imaging of exosome samples before and after sucrose step gradient purification showed that this procedure yields a pure exosome preparation free of non-exosomal vesicles, subcellular organelles, or debris (Fig. 2A). These observations further indicate that the exosomes isolated using this protocol are secreted into the brain extracellular space rather than contaminating intracellular vesicles released during the experimental procedure. Exosomal content depends on the cell type or tissue it is secreted from (3.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W. Proteomic profiling of exosomes: current perspectives.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 4083-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar); however, all exosomes contain specific markers such as TSG101, an element of the ESCRT protein complex controlling exosome formation (19.Babst M. A protein's final ESCRT.Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and the endosomal flotillin (3.Simpson R.J. Jensen S.S. Lim J.W. Proteomic profiling of exosomes: current perspectives.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 4083-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 20.Théry C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Exosomes: composition, biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). Measurements of the levels of these exosomal markers and AChE activity levels in exosomes are commonly used tools to quantify exosomes (15.Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. The exosome pathway in K562 cells is regulated by Rab11.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of exosomes and the amount of exosomes in each sucrose gradient fraction (fractions a–g) were determined by measuring the protein content and AChE activity level, by Western blot analysis using antibodies to exosomal markers and by EM.FIGURE 2Characterization of exosomes isolated from murine hemi-brains. A, wide-field EM imaging showed multiple mouse brain exosomes of sizes ranging from 50 to 150 nm and no other structures or cellular debris. Scale bar = 100 nm. B and C, exosomes isolated from the brains of WT and APP transgenic (Tg2576) mice were found in sucrose step gradient fractions b–d. Exosomal protein content (B) and exosomal AChE activity levels (C) standardized to total brain protein content were not different between transgenic and non-transgenic brain exosomes collected from fractions b–d. D, Western blotting demonstrated the presence of the exosomal marker flotillin in fractions b–d. The enzymes α-secretase (ADAM10), β-secretase (BACE1), and γ-secretase (nicastrin) were also detected in exosomal fractions. E, immuno-EM showed that exosomes isolated from mouse brains were identified by antibodies to the exosomal markers flotillin and TSG101 and were immunoreactive to antibodies that react with flAPP and APP β-CTF (C1/6.1) and with flAPP, APP β-CTF, and Aβ (4G8). Scale bar = 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EM analysis of the content of the sucrose step gradient fractions identified typical exosome-like cup-shaped vesicles ranging in size from 50 to 150 nm in three of the fractions (b–d), but not in the other fractions (a and e–g) (data not shown). The brain exosomes were collected from sucrose layers where material with density higher then 1.07 (0.60 m glucose fraction layer) and lower than 1.17 (1.30 m glucose fraction layer) segregated during the fractionation procedure. The three fractions contained proteins that accounted for 94.92% of the total exosomal protein content (Fig. 2B) and for 97.97% of the total exosomal AChE activity (Fig. 2C) and were immunoreactive with anti-flotillin antibody (Fig. 2D). Immuno-EM studies of isolated exosomes, prior to their purification on a sucrose step gradient column, showed that the isolated exosomes contained the exosomal protein markers flotillin and TSG101 (Fig. 2E). Using this procedure, we found that isolation of exosomes from mouse brain tissue frozen and kept at −80 °C for 8 months yielded the same number of exosomes with the same morphology as isolation of exosomes from freshly removed brain. Using the same procedure designed for isolating exosomes from mouse brain tissue, we isolated exosomes from Brodmann area 9 of brain tissue from an AD patient and a neuropathologically normal control (frozen and kept at −80 °C for long periods of time). EM analysis showed exosomes with the same morphology as exosomes isolated from freshly removed mouse brain (Fig. 3). Western blot analysis of brain exosomes (Fig. 2D) showed that an α-secretase (ADAM10), a β-secretase (BACE1), and nicastrin (a component of the γ-secretase complex) were present in fractions also containing flotillin and AChE activity, but not in fractions lacking either flotillin (Fig. 2D) or AChE activity (Fig. 2C). These data confirm in vitro studies showing that exosomes secreted by cultured cells contain the three APP-cleaving enzymes (11.Vingtdeux V. Hamdane M. Loyens A. Gelé P. Drobeck H. Bégard S.

Immuno-EM imaging analysis of Tg2576 and wild-type control brain exosomes showed immunoreactivity with antibodies that identify flAPP, APP CTFs, and Aβ in exosomes that were immunoreactive with antibodies to the exosomal markers flotillin and TSG101 (Fig. 2E). In addition, Western blot analysis of brain exosomes (Fig. 4A) showed that flAPP and APP CTFs were present in fractions b–d, which also contained flotillin and AChE activity, but not in fractions a and e–g, which lacked either flotillin (Fig. 2D) or AChE activity (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis confirmed the immuno-EM observation (Fig. 2E) that Aβ was associated with exosomes (Fig. 4B). These results show that brain exosomes transport flAPP, APP CTFs, and Aβ to the extracellular space in vivo. To test the effect of APP overexpression in Tg2576 mice on the number of exosomes secreted, we quantified exosomal protein content and AChE activity levels standardized to total brain protein content in all of the sucrose gradient fractions and did not find a difference between Tg2576 and wild-type control mice (Fig. 2, B and C). These data reveal that Tg2576 and wild-type control mice secrete the same number of exosomes into the brain extracellular space. Western blot analysis of flAPP and APP CTFs in brain homogenates and in brain exosomes of Tg2576 and littermate non-transgenic mice was conducted to characterize the effect of APP overexpression in the Tg2576 brain on exosomal flAPP and APP CTFs levels. Quantitation of protein bands revealed that the brains of Tg2576 mice contain 5.8 times more flAPP and 5.6 times more APP CTFs than the brains of littermate non-transgenic mice (Fig. 4, C and C′) and that Tg2576 brain exosomes contain 4.9 times more flAPP and 4.0 times more APP CTFs than littermate non-transgenic brain exosomes (Fig. 4, A and A′). These data show that higher exosomal flAPP and APP CTFs levels rather than greater number of secreted exosomes with normal flAPP and APP CTFs levels are responsible for the higher levels of flAPP and APP CTFs secreted into the extracellular space via exosomes in the brains of Tg2576 mice. A difference in the ratio of APP CTFs to flAPP in exosomes compared with brain homogenates was demonstrated by Western blot analysis with antibody C1/6.1 (17.Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D.

Exosomes retrieved prior to purification on a sucrose step gradient column showed low levels of flAPP and APP CTFs compared with fractions b–d collected from the sucrose gradient column because smaller volumes were loaded on the gel compared with the volumes loaded from the fractions collected from the sucrose gradient column. Comparison of the ratio of APP CTFs to flAPP in brain homogenates and in brain exosomes showed that the ratio was higher in brain exosomes compared with brain homogenates in both Tg2576 and wild-type non-transgenic mice. The APP CTF:flAPP ratios were similar in samples obtained from Tg2576 and wild-type control mice (Fig. 5), indicating that the cellular levels of flAPP and APP CTFs do not regulate the ratio between the full-length protein and it"
https://openalex.org/W1971677273,"The microtubule-associated protein Tau is mainly expressed in neurons, where it binds and stabilizes microtubules. In Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, Tau protein has a reduced affinity toward microtubules. As a consequence, Tau protein detaches from microtubules and eventually aggregates into β-sheet-containing filaments. The fibrillization of monomeric Tau to filaments is a multistep process that involves the formation of various aggregates, including spherical and protofibrillar oligomers. Previous concepts, primarily developed for Aβ and α-synuclein, propose these oligomeric intermediates as the primary cytotoxic species mediating their deleterious effects through membrane permeabilization. In the present study, we thus analyzed whether this concept can also be applied to Tau protein. To this end, viability and membrane integrity were assessed on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and artificial phospholipid vesicles, treated with Tau monomers, Tau aggregation intermediates, or Tau fibrils. Our findings suggest that oligomeric Tau aggregation intermediates are the most toxic compounds of Tau fibrillogenesis, which effectively decrease cell viability and increase phospholipid vesicle leakage. Our data integrate Tau protein into the class of amyloidogenic proteins and enforce the hypothesis of a common toxicity-mediating mechanism for amyloidogenic proteins."

Until now, no report has addressed the coordinate action of these miRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we performed a comprehensive molecular and functional analysis of the miRNA cluster regulatory network. First, we evaluated proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth and chemoresistance in the colon tumor cell lines after miR-143 and miR-145 restoration. Then, we assessed the contribution of single genes targeted by miR-143 and miR-145 by reinforcing their expression and checking functional recovery. Restoring miR-143 and miR-145 in colon cancer cells decreases proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. We identified cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) as proteins targeted by miR-143 and miR-145. Their re-expression can partially revert a decrease in transformation properties caused by the overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145. In addition, we determined a set of mRNAs that are diminished after reinforcing miR-143 and miR-145 expression. The whole transcriptome analysis ascertained that downregulated transcripts are enriched in predicted target genes in a statistically significant manner. A number of additional genes, whose expression decreases as a direct or indirect consequence of miR-143 and miR-145, reveals a complex regulatory network that affects cell signaling pathways involved in transformation. In conclusion, we identified a coordinated program of gene repression by miR-143 and miR-145, in CRC, where either of the two miRNAs share a target transcript, or where the target transcripts share a common signaling pathway. Major mediators of the oncosuppression by miR-143 and miR-145 are genes belonging to the growth factor receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase network and to the p53 signaling pathway."

A major Aβ clearance pathway in the brain is cellular uptake and degradation. However, how Aβ traffics through the endocytic pathway and how AD risk factors regulate this event is unclear. Here we show that the majority of endocytosed Aβ in neurons traffics through early and late endosomes to the lysosomes for degradation. Overexpression of Rab5 or Rab7, small GTPases that function in vesicle fusion for early and late endosomes, respectively, significantly accelerates Aβ endocytic trafficking to the lysosomes. We also found that a portion of endocytosed Aβ traffics through Rab11-positive recycling vesicles. A blockage of this Aβ recycling pathway with a constitutively active Rab11 mutant significantly accelerates cellular Aβ accumulation. Inhibition of lysosomal enzymes results in Aβ accumulation and aggregation. Importantly, apolipoprotein E (apoE) accelerates neuronal Aβ uptake, lysosomal trafficking, and degradation in an isoform-dependent manner with apoE3 more efficiently facilitating Aβ trafficking and degradation than apoE4, a risk factor for AD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Aβ endocytic trafficking to lysosomes for degradation is a major Aβ clearance pathway that is differentially regulated by apoE isoforms.

Endocytosis, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluid phase pinocytosis, is an efficient pathway by which extracellular proteins gain entry into intracellular compartments. The majority of endocytosed proteins traffic through several endocytic compartments before being delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Selected ligands can also be delivered to specialized organelles or recycled back to extracellular space. Rab GTPase family members play critical roles in mediating vesicular transport to different compartments. In particular, endocytic vesicles acquire Rab5 for their fusion with early endosomes, from where specific cargo proteins are either delivered to recycling endosomes through the function of Rab11 or transported to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies in a manner that depends on the function of Rab7 (10.Stenmark H. Rab GTPases as coordinators of vesicle traffic.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar).

Thus, we systematically dissected the itinerary of Aβ endocytic trafficking in neuronal cells using various organelle markers. We also assessed the effects of altered endocytic trafficking and function on cellular Aβ distribution using both wild-type and mutant forms of Rab proteins (Rab5, Rab11, and Rab7). The effects of lysosomal enzyme inhibitors on Aβ degradation and aggregation were also assessed. Finally, we compared the differential roles of apoE3 and apoE4 on Aβ uptake and degradation. Our studies established a primary trafficking pathway of Aβ to lysosomes for degradation, revealed a previously undefined recycling pathway through Rab11-positive compartments, and defined differential functions of apoE isoforms in regulating Aβ cellular uptake and endocytic trafficking.

Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were cultured in DMEM/Opti-MEM I (1:1) (Gibco) medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Primary cortical neurons were obtained from 17-day-old embryos of wild-type C57BL/6 mice and grown in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 0.5 mm GlutaMAX (Gibco), 2% B27 (Gibco), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), in cell culture dishes precoated with poly-d-lysine solution (100 μg/ml). At 5 days in vitro, neurons were treated with 10 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 2 days to remove glial cells, and media were changed to fresh Neurobasal medium containing B27 and penicillin-streptomycin at 7 days in vitro. In some experiments, cells were cultured on 8-well chambered cover glasses (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and observed by a confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (model LSM 510 invert; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The pinhole size was set to 1 airy unit. Co-localization in the images was quantified by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), and the Manders' coefficient was calculated with JACoP (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/jacop.html). N2a cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 by adding prepared complexes directly to a suspension of cells in the plate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Medium was changed on the following day. Cells were used 36 h after the start of transfection. After incubation with Aβ42 (500 nm) and/or apoE (500 nm) in serum-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by incubating with trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After washing two times with PBS, cells were dissolved in 5 m guanidine in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To measure human Aβ42, samples were captured with mAb 2.1.3 antibody followed by detection with HRP-conjugated Ab5 antibody (16.Chakrabarty P. Ceballos-Diaz C. Beccard A. Janus C. Dickson D.

In some experiments, lysosomal inhibitors (pepstatin A, 10 μm; leupeptin, 100 μm; E-64d, 50 μm) were added during incubation with Aβ42 and/or apoE. After incubation with Aβ42 (500 nm) in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors in serum-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by trypsin, washed twice with PBS, and homogenized in 2% SDS in PBS.

Briefly, freshly prepared TMR-Aβ42 (100 nm) was incubated with cell homogenates on 8-well chambered cover glasses for 48 h, and amyloid aggregates were observed using a confocal microscope. For each chamber, the fluorescence intensity of Aβ aggregates in nine randomly selected fields (140 × 140 μm) was quantified by ImageJ software. Cells were plated onto 12-well plates, allowed to grow to 90% confluency and then detached from the plates using cell dissociation solution (Sigma), and incubated with FAM-Aβ42 (2 μm), together with vehicle control and recombinant apoE3 or apoE4 protein (500 nm), in the presence or absence of heparin (30 units/ml) at 4 °C for 2 h in PBS with 1.5% heat-inactivated FBS and 0.1% sodium azide. Then cells were washed twice with PBS/FBS. Samples (1 × 104 cells/sample) were analyzed for fluorescence on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Control cells without any exposure to fluorescence were used to assess background fluorescence. All quantified data represent an average of triplicate samples. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To assess Aβ endocytic trafficking, we examined the cellular localization of TMR-Aβ42 in N2a cells transiently transfected with GFP vector control, GFP-Rab5-WT, a GFP-Rab5-dominant negative mutant (Rab5-DN, S34N), or a GFP-Rab5-constitutively active mutant (Rab5-CA, Q79L). After a 24-h incubation of cells with TMR-Aβ42, 6.3 ± 1.1% of Aβ was co-localized with Rab5-WT-positive early endosomes (Fig. 1, A and B). Aβ42 was more diffusely distributed and less co-localized with Rab5-DN mutant (0.4 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 1, A and B). In the case of the Rab5-CA mutant, Aβ42 was accumulated in Rab5-CA-positive compartments, in particular in enlarged endosomes. The co-localization of Aβ42 was higher in Rab5-CA-positive compartments (15.1 ± 1.8%) (Fig. 1, A and B) when compared with Rab5-WT. When the amounts of cell-associated Aβ42 were quantified by ELISA after a 24-h incubation with native, unlabeled Aβ42, expression of Rab5-DN and Rab5-CA, but not Rab5-WT, significantly increased cell-associated Aβ42 when compared with control (Fig. 1C). To further define Aβ42 endocytic trafficking, we used similar approaches to assess the trafficking of Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated Tf, which traffics through early and recycling endosomes. When compared with Aβ42, more Tf was detected in Rab5-WT-positive compartments (48.2 ± 6.8%) (Fig. 1, D and E). Tf was also captured in Rab5-CA-positive compartments (59.2 ± 6.5%) (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar to Aβ42, expression of Rab5-DN mutant decreased Tf co-localization in these compartments (6.4 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 1, D and E). These results indicate that cell-internalized Aβ42 traffics through Rab5-positive early endosomes. A disturbance of endosomal functions, as observed in AD brains (18.Cataldo A.M. Peterhoff C.M. Troncoso J.C. Gomez-Isla T. Hyman B.T. Nixon R.A.

Aging. 2004; 25: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), will likely lead to Aβ42 accumulation in these intracellular compartments. Next, we analyzed the effects of overexpressing GFP-fused WT or a DN mutant (T22N) of Rab7 on cellular localization of internalized Aβ42. When DiI-labeled LDL, which is transferred from early to late endosomes/lysosomes, was used as a control, Rab7-DN expression resulted in a disturbed trafficking of LDL (data not shown). In the case of Aβ, 45.8 ± 3.9% of TMR-Aβ42 was co-localized with Rab7-WT-positive late endosomal compartments, indicating that Aβ traffics mainly to Rab7-positive late endosomes, whereas only 10.4 ± 1.6% of Aβ was transferred to Rab7-DN-positive compartments. ELISA showed that expression of neither Rab7-WT (1.09 ± 0.06-fold) nor Rab7-DN (1.10 ± 0.17-fold) affected the amounts of cell-associated Aβ42 when compared with control, suggesting that Aβ might traffic to other endocytic pathways when the late endocytic pathway is perturbed. To investigate whether recycling endosomes participate in the endocytic trafficking of Aβ, we examined the effects of expressing GFP-fused Rab11-WT, Rab11-DN (S25N) or Rab11-CA (Q70L) mutant on Aβ42 trafficking in N2a cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Approximately half of internalized Tf was transported into Rab11-WT-positive endosomes, whereas Rab11-CA facilitated and Rab11-DN suppressed Tf accumulation in Rab11-positive compartments (Fig. 2, D and E). A small portion of internalized TMR-Aβ42 was co-localized with Rab11-WT (6.7 ± 0.9%), and the expression of Rab11-CA increased this co-localization up to 17.4 ± 2.5% (Fig. 2, A and B). A negligible amount of Aβ42 was co-localized with Rab11-DN (Fig. 2, A and B). ELISA showed that cell-associated Aβ42 level was significantly increased in cells expressing Rab11-CA when compared with control (Fig. 2C), confirming that some Aβ42 indeed traffics through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. These results indicate that despite a primary endocytic trafficking pathway through early and late endosomes, a portion of cell-internalized Aβ42 can traffic through the recycling endosomes. To confirm that Aβ traffics through endosomal/lysosomal pathways in neurons, we performed immunostaining with antibodies against Rab5A, Rab11, Rab7, or LAMP1 in mouse primary cultured cortical neurons after incubations with FAM-Aβ42 (500 nm) (Fig. 3). We found that Aβ42 partially co-localized with Rab5A in neurites and cell body after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 3A). After a 3-h incubation, Aβ42 was detected in Rab11- and Rab7-positive compartments (Fig. 3, B and C). Finally, Aβ42 was co-localized with lysosomal marker LAMP1 in the cell body, but not in the neurites, after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3D). These results confirm that internalized Aβ42 is transported to either the endosome/lysosome degradation pathway or the recycling pathway in neurons. To assess lysosomal trafficking and degradation of Aβ, we tested the effects of lysosomal inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, and E-64d), which block lysosomal enzyme activities (20.Iwabu Y. Fujita H. Kinomoto M. Kaneko K. Ishizaka Y. Tanaka Y. Sata T. Tokunaga K. HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu internalizes cell-surface BST-2/tetherin through transmembrane interactions leading to lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35060-35072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). N2a cells were transfected with Rab5-WT, Rab7-WT, Rab11-WT, or vector (control) and then incubated with Aβ42 in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors for 24 h. ELISA showed that the presence of lysosomal inhibitors significantly increased cell-associated Aβ42 under all conditions (Fig. 4A), indicating that lysosomal degradation of Aβ42 is a significant event following cellular Aβ42 uptake. Expression of Rab5-WT, Rab7-WT, or Rab11-WT did not affect cell-associated Aβ42 levels in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors. However, in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, expression of Rab5-WT and Rab7-WT, but not Rab11-WT, further increased cell-associated Aβ42 when compared with control (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that up-regulation of Rab5 or Rab7 expression enhances Aβ transport to lysosomes where Aβ is efficiently degraded. They also suggest that a disturbance of lysosomal enzyme functions could lead to intracellular Aβ accumulation. To examine whether cell accumulated Aβ42 possesses “seeding effect” to further facilitate Aβ42 aggregation, we tested the ability of cell-associated Aβ42 to seed aggregates in vitro. N2a cells transfected with vector (control), Rab5-WT, Rab7-WT, or Rab11-WT were incubated with Aβ42 (500 nm) in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors for 24 h, homogenized, and incubated with freshly prepared TMR-Aβ42 (100 nm) for 48 h. When fluorescent amyloid aggregates were observed and quantified by confocal microscopy, cell lysates from Rab5-WT- and Rab7-WT-expressing, but not Rab11-WT-expressing, cells induced more Aβ aggregates when compared with controls (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that lysosomal accumulated Aβ42 has sufficient ability to seed amyloid aggregates. ApoE4 is a strong risk factor for AD (4.Bu G. Apolipoprotein E and its receptors in Alzheimer's disease: pathways, pathogenesis and therapy.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of apoE isoforms in neuronal Aβ endocytic trafficking, we incubated N2a cells with Aβ42, together with vehicle control, apoE3, or apoE4 for 24 h, in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors. Cell-associated Aβ42 levels were significantly increased in the presence of apoE, with apoE3 showing a greater effect than apoE4 (Fig. 5A). In the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, cell-associated Aβ42 levels were further increased by apoE3 and apoE4 (Fig. 5A), again with apoE3 having a greater effect than apoE4. When lysosomal degradation of Aβ42 was calculated by subtracting the cell-associated Aβ in the absence of inhibitors from that in the presence of inhibitors, apoE3 enhanced Aβ42 lysosomal degradation by 1.75-fold when compared with apoE4 (Fig. 5B). In addition, confocal microscopy also revealed that internalized FAM-Aβ42, which was largely co-localized with LysoTracker, was greatly increased in the presence of apoE (Fig. 5C). Upon quantification, we confirmed that the amounts of Aβ42 in lysosomes were higher in apoE3-treated cells than apoE4-treated cells (Fig. 5D). To address whether apoE isoforms differentially affect Aβ42 binding to the cell surface, we carried out a FACS-based binding assay in the presence or absence of apoE3 or apoE4. Both apoE isoforms enhanced Aβ42 binding to the cell surface; however, apoE3 increased cell surface-bound Aβ42 more than apoE4 (1.7-fold versus 1.4-fold when compared with that of control, respectively) (Fig. 6). Consistent with our previous finding that Aβ42 binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (13.Kanekiyo T. Zhang J. Liu Q. Liu C.C. Zhang L. Bu G. Heparan sulphate proteoglycan and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 constitute major pathways for neuronal amyloid-β uptake.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1644-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the differential effects of apoE isoforms on Aβ42 binding were eliminated in the presence of heparin (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that apoE facilitates Aβ42 binding to cell surface HSPG in an isoform-dependent manner. To further dissect the mechanisms underlying the effects of apoE isoforms on Aβ42, we analyzed apoE lysosomal trafficking and degradation. We found that apoE3 was transported into lysosomes and degraded more efficiently than apoE4 (Fig. 7, A and B). The more efficient trafficking of apoE3 than apoE4 was confirmed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 7, C and D). These results suggest that apoE isoforms likely facilitate Aβ42 lysosomal trafficking a"

The aim of this study was to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of galloylated catechins in the tea plant. The results suggested that galloylated catechins were biosynthesized via 1-O-glucose ester-dependent two-step reactions by acyltransferases, which involved two enzymes, UDP-glucose:galloyl-1-O-β-D-glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and a newly discovered enzyme, epicatechin:1-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose O-galloyltransferase (ECGT). In the first reaction, the galloylated acyl donor β-glucogallin was biosynthesized by UGGT from gallic acid and uridine diphosphate glucose. In the second reaction, galloylated catechins were produced by ECGT catalysis from β-glucogallin and 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ol. 2,3-cis-Flavan-3-ol and 1-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose were appropriate substrates of ECGT rather than 2,3-trans-flavan-3-ol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose. Purification by more than 1641-fold to apparent homogeneity yielded ECGT with an estimated molecular mass of 241 to 121 kDa by gel filtration. Enzyme activity and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the native ECGT might be a dimer, trimer, or tetramer of 60- and/or 58-kDa monomers, and these monomers represent a heterodimer consisting of pairs of 36- or 34- of and 28-kDa subunits. MALDI-TOF-TOF MS showed that the protein SCPL1199 was identified. Epigallocatechin and epicatechin exhibited higher substrate affinities than β-glucogallin. ECGT had an optimum temperature of 30 °C and maximal reaction rates between pH 4.0 and 6.0. The enzyme reaction was inhibited dramatically by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, HgCl(2), and sodium deoxycholate."

https://openalex.org/W1999060556,"Serotonin and glutamate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) neurotransmission affects cognition and perception in humans and rodents. GPCRs are capable of forming heteromeric complexes that differentially alter cell signaling, but the role of this structural arrangement in modulating behavior remains unknown. Here, we identified three residues located at the intracellular end of transmembrane domain four that are necessary for the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor to be assembled as a GPCR heteromer with the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor in the mouse frontal cortex. Substitution of these residues (Ala-677(4.40), Ala-681(4.44), and Ala-685(4.48)) leads to absence of 5-HT(2A)·mGlu2 receptor complex formation, an effect that is associated with a decrease in their heteromeric ligand binding interaction. Disruption of heteromeric expression with mGlu2 attenuates the psychosis-like effects induced in mice by hallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) agonists. Furthermore, the ligand binding interaction between the components of the 5-HT(2A)·mGlu2 receptor heterocomplex is up-regulated in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects as compared with controls. Together, these findings provide structural evidence for the unique behavioral function of a GPCR heteromer."
https://openalex.org/W2056735204,"Atg9 is a transmembrane protein that is essential for autophagy. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has recently been revealed that Atg9 exists on cytoplasmic small vesicles termed Atg9 vesicles. To identify the components of Atg9 vesicles, we purified the Atg9 vesicles and subjected them to mass spectrometry. We found that their protein composition was distinct from other organellar membranes and that Atg9 and Atg27 in particular are major components of Atg9 vesicles. In addition to these two components, Trs85, a specific subunit of the transport protein particle III (TRAPPIII) complex, and the Rab GTPase Ypt1 were also identified. Trs85 directly interacts with Atg9, and the Trs85-containing TRAPPIII complex facilitates the association of Ypt1 onto Atg9 vesicles. We also showed that Trs85 and Ypt1 are localized to the preautophagosomal structure in an Atg9-dependent manner. Our data suggest that Atg9 vesicles recruit the TRAPPIII complex and Ypt1 to the preautophagosomal structure. The vesicle-tethering machinery consequently acts in the process of autophagosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2013045624,"Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an integral membrane, scaffolding protein found in plasma membrane invaginations (caveolae). Cav1 regulates multiple cancer-associated processes. In breast cancer, a tumor suppressive role for Cav1 has been suggested; however, Cav1 is frequently overexpressed in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, suggesting an oncogenic function in advanced-stage disease. To further delineate Cav1 function in breast cancer progression, we evaluated its expression levels among a panel of cell lines representing a spectrum of breast cancer phenotypes. In basal-like (the most aggressive BC subtype) breast cancer cells, Cav1 was consistently upregulated, and positively correlated with increased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration and invasion. To identify mechanisms of Cav1 gene regulation, we compared DNA methylation levels within promoter ‘CpG islands’ (CGIs) with ‘CGI shores’, recently described regions that flank CGIs with less CG-density. Integration of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles (‘methylomes’) with Cav1 expression in 30 breast cancer cell lines showed that differential methylation of CGI shores, but not CGIs, significantly regulated Cav1 expression. In breast cancer cell lines having low Cav1 expression (despite promoter CGI hypomethylation), we found that treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor induced Cav1 expression via CGI shore demethylation. In addition, further methylome assessments revealed that breast cancer aggressiveness associated with Cav1 CGI shore methylation levels, with shore hypermethylation in minimally aggressive, luminal breast cancer cells and shore hypomethylation in highly aggressive, basal-like cells. Cav1 CGI shore methylation was also observed in human breast tumors, and overall survival rates of breast cancer patients lacking estrogen receptor α (ERα) negatively correlated with Cav1 expression. Based on this first study of Cav1 (a potential oncogene) CGI shore methylation, we suggest this phenomenon may represent a new prognostic marker for ERα-negative, basal-like breast cancer."

We have identified gene sets associated with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks at transcription start sites in a high-grade ovarian serous tumour and examined their association with epigenetic silencing and malignant progression. This revealed novel silenced bivalent marked genes, not described previously for ES cells, which are significantly enriched for the PI3K (P<10(-7)) and TGF-β signalling pathways (P<10(-5)). We matched histone marked gene sets to gene expression sets of eight normal fallopian tubes and 499 high-grade serous malignant ovarian samples. This revealed a significant decrease in gene expression for the H3K27me3 and bivalent gene sets in malignant tissue. We then correlated H3K27me3 and bivalent gene sets to gene expression data of ovarian tumour 'stem cell-like' sustaining cells versus non-sustaining cells. This showed a significantly lower expression for the H3K27me3 and bivalent gene sets in the tumour-sustaining cells. Similarly, comparison of matched chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant ovarian cell lines showed a significantly lower expression of H3K27me3/bivalent marked genes in the chemo-resistant compared with the chemo-sensitive cell line. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that bivalent marks are associated with epigenetic silencing in ovarian cancer. However it also suggests that additional tumour specific bivalent marks, to those known in ES cells, are present in tumours and may potentially influence the subsequent development of drug resistance and tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W2062956368,"We demonstrate that at least three different promoter variant strains of HIV-1 subtype C have been gradually expanding and replacing the standard subtype C viruses in India, and possibly in South Africa and other global regions, over the past decade. The new viral strains contain an additional NF-κB, NF-κB-like, or RBEIII site in the viral promoter. Although the acquisition of an additional RBEIII site is a property shared by all the HIV-1 subtypes, acquiring an additional NF-κB site remains an exclusive property of subtype C. The acquired κB site is genetically distinct, binds the p50-p65 heterodimer, and strengthens the viral promoter at the levels of transcription initiation and elongation. The 4-κB viruses dominate the 3-κB ""isogenic"" viral strains in pairwise competition assays in T-cell lines, primary cells, and the ecotropic human immunodeficiency virus mouse model. The dominance of the 4-κB viral strains is also evident in the natural context when the subjects are coinfected with κB-variant viral strains. The mean plasma viral loads, but not CD4 counts, are significantly different in 4-κB infection suggesting that these newly emerging strains are probably more infectious. It is possible that higher plasma viral loads underlie selective transmission of the 4-κB viral strains. Several publications previously reported duplication or deletion of diverse transcription factor-binding sites in the viral promoter. Unlike previous reports, our study provides experimental evidence that the new viral strains gained a potential selective advantage as a consequence of the acquired transcription factor-binding sites and importantly that these strains have been expanding at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W2076304893,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) control numerous physiological and pathological processes. Typically, the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are processed by nuclear Drosha complex into ∼70-nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA), which are further cleaved by cytoplasmic Dicer complex into ∼21-nucleotide mature miRNAs. However, it is unclear how nascent pre-miRNAs are protected from ribonucleases, such as MCPIP1, that degrade pre-miRNAs to abort miRNA production.

In many RNA maturation processes, the precursor molecules are often bound by RNA-binding proteins or chaperones to protect them from nuclease-mediated decay and to ensure the correct processing by specific ribonucleases. In the current model, however, newly synthesized pri-/pre-miRNAs are described as unprotected and delivered directly to Drosha or Dicer enzymes for processing. It has recently been suggested that the processing of pri-miRNAs by Drosha occurs co-transcriptionally on chromatin (29Morlando M. Ballarino M. Gromak N. Pagano F. Bozzoni I. Proudfoot N.J.

In contrast, nascent pre-miRNAs embark a long and perilous journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, in which they are vulnerable to degradation by many nucleases. For example, the monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1)/ZC3H12A, a ribonuclease and deubiquitinase that suppresses inflammatory response (31Matsushita K. Takeuchi O. Standley D.M.

Sjögren syndrome antigen B (SSB), also known as autoantigen La, is commonly associated with autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (34Mattioli M. Reichlin M.

Description of a cytoplasmic nonribosomal antigen.Arthritis Rheum. 1974; 17: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The La/SSB protein is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human, exists abundantly in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and plays fundamental roles in diverse processes of RNA metabolism (35Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. The La protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A well known function of La/SSB is its association with nascent transcripts of RNA polymerase III, including precursors of tRNAs (pre-tRNAs), through recognition of the characteristic 3′ UUU termini. The binding of La/SSB protects pre-tRNAs from nonspecific exonuclease digestion and ensures correct processing of the 5′ and 3′ leader sequences of pre-tRNAs by specific ribonucleases, such as RNase P and RNase Z (36Chakshusmathi G.

Both Drosophila and human La/SSB contain three RNA-binding motifs, a highly conserved La motif (LAM) (39Bousquet-Antonelli C. Deragon J.M.

The molecular basis for this discrepancy is currently unclear. Here, we have uncovered an important function for La/SSB in promoting global miRNA expression by binding and stabilizing pre-miRNAs. Moreover, we showed that La/SSB interacts with pre-miRNAs by stem-loop recognition rather than 3′ UUU recognition. These significant findings provide fresh insights into the basic process of miRNA biogenesis, the diverse functions of La/SSB in RNA metabolism, and possibly the pathogenesis of cancer and autoimmune diseases. General RNA reagents were purchased from Ambion and Promega, and DNA oligos or siRNAs were synthesized by IDT. Both Dicer and human La/SSB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas actin, tubulin, and anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant Drosophila Dicer-1·Loqs-PB and human Dicer·TRBP complexes were generated in insect cells as previously described (12Jiang F. Ye X. Liu X. Fincher L. McKearin D. Liu Q.

Recombinant Drosophila and human La/SSB were produced in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. Recombinant FLAG-tagged MCPIP1 and Drosha·DGCR8 complex was affinity purified from 293T cells following transient transfection (47Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N.

After a 30-min, 20,000 × g centrifugation step, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight in Buffer A (10 mm KOAc, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2.5 mm DTT), loaded onto a Mono S column, and eluted with a 300–600 mm NaCl gradient. The fractions with peak activity were dialyzed for 4 h, loaded onto a Mono Q column, and eluted with a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient. Finally, the peak fractions were directly loaded on a Smart Mono S column and eluted with a 300–600 mm NaCl gradient. HeLa cell extract was prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors. HeLa extract was incubated with anti-human La/SSB monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, and protein G-Sepharose beads were added and rotated for another 4 h. After extensive wash of the beads (4 times in RIPA buffer, 3 times in RIPA buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, and once with buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), associated RNA was extracted from the beads by TRIzol and precipitated by ethanol. To demonstrate in vivo association between La and pre-miRNAs, we transfected HeLa cells with a empty vector or FLAG-hLa/SSB expression construct. Thirty-six hours after transfection, HeLa cells were either untreated or treated with 1.0% formaldehyde before making protein extracts in RIPA buffer (49Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R.

The FLAG-La RNP complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysates using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated affinity gel (Sigma). After extensive washing in a highly stringent condition (RIPA buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 4 m urea), the beads were resuspended in reversal buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 1% SDS) and cooked at 70 °C for 1 h.

After 2 days, transfected cells were replated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish followed by a second siRNA transfection. Three days later, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted by TRIzol. To generate the Teton-inducible La knockdown cells, we stably integrated a transgene that encodes four copies of a small hairpin RNA (shLa, same target sequence as siLa 2, Table 1) under control of an inducible H1 promoter, into U2OS cells expressing Tet repressor (Oligoengine). Doxycycline was added to the medium (2 μm final concentration) to induce the expression of small hairpin RNA (shLa). The U2OS/shLa (FLAG-dLa) rescue cell line was constructed by stable integration of a FLAG-tagged Drosophila La cDNA transgene into the U2OS/shLa cell line. Both HeLa and U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Northern blotting for pre-miRNA and miRNA detection was performed essentially as described (50Liu X. Park J.K. Jiang F. Liu Y. McKearin D. Liu Q. Dicer-1, but not Loquacious, is critical for assembly of miRNA-induced silencing complexes.RNA. 2007; 13: 2324-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Typically, 30 μg of total RNA was resolved by 12% urea-PAGE and transferred to GT membrane (Bio-Rad) followed by UV cross-linking. All miRNA probes are 21-nt ssDNA or RNA oligos (IDT) that are complementary to miRNA sequences provided by miRBase. The 5S, 5.8S, and U6 probe sequences are listed in Table 1. All probes were 5′ radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Hybridization was conducted in ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (Ambion) at 40 °C overnight. The membrane was washed 3 times at 40 °C in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and exposed to x-ray film. For RT-PCR, cDNAs were generated using the reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1. TaqMan qPCR was performed to measure the levels of specific miRNAs or pri-miRNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantities were calculated using the ΔΔCt method. 18S rRNA served as a loading control. Global miRNA profiling was performed using MegaPlex RT Primers and TaqMan Array microRNA Cards (Applied Biosystems, Human Pool A version 2.1 MegaPlex RT primers and Human MicroRNA A Cards version 2.0) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 750 ng of total RNA was used in Megaplex RT without pre-amplification. U6 snRNA served as the endogenous control as the average Ct varied by ≤0.2 between control and experimental treatments. Threshold was held constant at 0.2 ΔRn and baseline was set from cycles 3 to 16 for all miRNA. miRNA with average Ct ≥35 or abnormal amplification curves in control and experimental treatments were omitted and considered as not expressed. Average relative quantities were calculated among replicates and a t test was used to identify miRNA differentially expressed based on a p value threshold of p ≤ 0.05. Synthetic pre-miRNAs were 5′ radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase followed by G-25 column (Ambion) purification. The pri-let-7a-1 construct, a gift from Dr. Narry Kim, was used to generate uniformly radiolabeled pri-miRNA substrate by in vitro transcription followed by PAGE purification. Typically, recombinant proteins and radiolabeled RNA were incubated at 37 (human proteins) or 30 °C (Drosophila proteins) for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction (100 mm KOAc, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was resolved by a 5% native PAGE and exposed to x-ray film. Gene expression profiling data of breast cancer patients were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE7390) and bioinformatics.nki.nl/data.php. The expression levels of Dicer, La/SSB, or MCPIP1 were evaluated by the corresponding probes. Genes negatively or positively associated with Dicer expression (“Dicer high/low down-regulated or up-regulated genes”) were defined as 200 of the most differentially expressed genes between the top 30 cases with high and low Dicer expression. After dividing all cases into halves according to La expression, GSEA was performed with GSEA software available from the Broad Institute (51Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S.

Survival analysis was performed using the survival package of R, the survfit function, and the survdiff function. Classification of high or low expression of Dicer, La/SSB, and MCPIP1 was performed as previously described (52Martello G. Rosato A. Ferrari F. Manfrin A. Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Enzo E. Guzzardo V.

We took an unbiased biochemical approach to identify new regulators of miRNA biogenesis by supplementing recombinant Dicer-1·Loqs-PB complex (Fig. 1A) with the fractions of cytoplasmic extract (S100) of Drosophila S2 cells. We observed an inhibitory activity of pre-miRNA processing in the supernatant after 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate precipitation of S2/S100 (Fig. 1B). This factor was further purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatographic fractionation (Fig. 1C). At the final purification step, only a single protein of ∼50 kDa appeared on the silver-stained polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), and correlated closely with the miRNA regulatory activity (Fig. 1C). This protein was identified as the Drosophila homolog of La/SSB by mass spectrometric analysis. We generated His-tagged Drosophila (dLa) and human (hLa) La/SSB recombinant proteins (Fig. 1D). Addition of dLa efficiently suppressed the ability of the recombinant Dicer-1·Loqs-PB complex to process pre-miRNA into miRNA in vitro (Fig. 1E). Likewise, hLa could inhibit pre-miRNA processing by the recombinant Dicer·TRBP complex (Fig. 1F). Intriguingly, we obtained a strikingly different result when performing pre-miRNA processing assays using crude cell extracts. Addition of La/SSB could instead stabilize pre-miRNA and enhance miRNA production in both S2 and H"
https://openalex.org/W2087619670,"Ankyrin-G (AnkG) coordinates protein composition of diverse membrane domains, including epithelial lateral membranes and neuronal axon initial segments. However, how AnkG itself localizes to these membrane domains is not understood. We report that AnkG remains on the plasma membrane in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown in low calcium, although these cells lack apical-basal polarity and exhibit loss of plasma membrane association of AnkG partners, E-cadherin and β(2)-spectrin. We subsequently demonstrate using mutagenesis and mass spectrometry that AnkG is S-palmitoylated exclusively at Cys-70, which is located in a loop of the first ankyrin repeat and is conserved in the vertebrate ankyrin family. Moreover, C70A mutation abolishes membrane association of 190-kDa AnkG in MDCK cells grown in low calcium. C70A 190-kDa AnkG fails to restore biogenesis of epithelial lateral membranes in MDCK cells depleted of endogenous AnkG. In addition, C70A 270-kDa AnkG fails to cluster at the axon initial segment of AnkG-depleted cultured hippocampal neurons and fails to recruit neurofascin as well as voltage-gated sodium channels. These effects of C70A mutation combined with evidence for its S-palmitoylation are consistent with a requirement of palmitoylation for targeting and function of AnkG in membrane domain biogenesis at epithelial lateral membranes and neuronal axon initial segments."

They are composed of a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin (1.Van Melderen L. Saavedra De Bast M. Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems. More than selfish entities?.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000437Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). When the short-lived antitoxin gets degraded, the stable toxin is no longer neutralized and causes cell death. Their abundance and presence in multiple copies indicate that they provide benefits for bacterial growth and survival, involved not only in ordinary physiology but also in bacterial pathogenicity (2.Yamaguchi Y. Park J.H. Inouye M. Toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria and archaea.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Three types of TA modules have been described. Type I TA pairs consist of a toxic peptide and a convergent antisense RNA that inhibits toxin translation (3.Fozo E.M. Hemm M.R. Storz G. Small toxic proteins and the antisense RNAs that repress them.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The protein toxin and RNA antitoxin are usually encoded on opposite strands, with the overlap occurring at either the 5′ or the 3′ end of the mRNA. Type II TA systems consist of an antitoxin protein that binds to and inactivates a toxin protein. Type III TA pairs encode protein toxins inhibited by an RNA antitoxin encoded by tandem repeats upstream of the toxin gene (4.Fineran P.C. Blower T.R. Foulds I.J. Humphreys D.P. Lilley K.S. Salmond G.P. The phage abortive infection system, ToxIN, functions as a protein-RNA toxin-antitoxin pair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Their functions, however, remain hypothetical and controversial (5.Magnuson R.D. Hypothetical functions of toxin-antitoxin systems.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, the clarification of their cellular functions and regulations is essential to better understand bacterial physiology under diverse stress conditions. In this report, the focus is on Type I TA modules in which the expression of the toxin is regulated by an antisense RNA transcribed in reverse orientation. To date, type I TA loci have been experimentally shown only in a few lineages of Enteroproteobacteria and Firmicutes (Bacillus and Enterococcus), but computer predictions suggest that they are widely scattered among bacteria, including in Staphylococcus aureus (6.Fozo E.M. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S.A. Yutin N. Koonin E.V. Storz G. Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria.

S. aureus is an opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium responsible for nosocomial and community-acquired infections in humans, ranging from localized to life-threatening diseases. The adaptability of this bacterium to drastic environmental changes depends on complicated interplays between two component systems, transcription regulatory proteins and nearly a hundred regulatory RNAs. These small RNAs includes cis- and trans-acting RNAs, antisense RNAs, noncoding RNAs and small mRNAs-encoding peptides (1.Van Melderen L. Saavedra De Bast M. Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems. More than selfish entities?.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000437Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 7.Felden B. Vandenesch F. Bouloc P. Romby P.

Fechter P. Current knowledge on regulatory RNAs and their machineries in Staphylococcus aureus.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this bacterium, however, the demarcation between cis- and trans-tRNAs can sometimes be fuzzy, as recently shown for the SprA1/SprA1AS pair, in which SprA1 expresses a peptide that is repressed, in trans, by cis-SprA1AS (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SprA1 translation is inhibited through pairing interactions with SprA1AS hiding the SprA1 translation initiation signals. The genetic locus containing sprA1/sprA1AS lies on a pathogenicity island and produces two tRNAs, SprA1 and SprA1AS, transcribed in opposite directions from a bidirectional terminator. Additional copies of the RNA pair are detected within the core genomes of numerous strains from the Staphylococcus genus, in some plasmids, and in several strains of the Enterococcus genus. Sequence comparisons have suggested that this tRNA pair might form a type I toxin-antitoxin module (6.Fozo E.M. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S.A. Yutin N. Koonin E.V. Storz G. Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria. Searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3743-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this report, experimental data are provided to support the existence of a functional Type I TA module expressed in S. aureus, in which the toxin is a 30-amino acid-long peptide named PepA1. Cell fractionation assays indicate that PepA1 localizes at the S. aureus membrane. Based on mutational analysis and cell mortality experiments, PepA1 but not SprA1 causes cell death by affecting S. aureus membrane organization. Oxidative and acidic stresses trigger PepA1 expression by lowering SprA1AS levels, in turn relieving the constitutive translational repression of SprA1. The PepA1 structure was solved by NMR spectroscopy and adopts a slightly bent, interrupted, helix fold. It represents the first atomic resolution structure of a type I TA module in S. aureus. CD spectra were collected in both aqueous and nonpolar environments and indicate that when the lipid content increases, the helical content of PepA1 rises. These structural data, together with molecular dynamics simulations computed in an artificial lipid bilayer, suggest that PepA1 compaction and helical content both vary according to its cytoplasm or membrane location. Our structural investigations indicate that when PepA1 is inserted into a membrane bilayer, it adopts an extended, continuous helix as for the “pore-forming” peptides, consistent with its membrane positioning in vivo. The primers used for all the constructions are listed in supplemental Table S1. Strains and plasmids are listed in supplemental Table S2. S. aureus strains were grown at 37 °C in brain-heart infusion broth (Oxoid) or in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (GlutaMAXTM; Invitrogen). When necessary, chloramphenicol was added at 10 μg ml−1. To generate the anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible construct for SprA1 (pAT12ΩsprA1), the SprA1 sequence (from nucleotides +1 to +208) was amplified from Newman genomic DNA and inserted into PstI/EcoRV-digested pAT12 vector. To generate an inducible construct containing the SprA1-STOP mutant (pAT12ΩsprA1 STOP), nucleotides T64 and C65 were mutated into two adenines to create a premature termination codon. In pCN35ΩsprA1FLAG/sprA1AS, both RNAs are expressed from their endogenous promoters. Three PCRs allowed the amplification of sprA1/sprA1AS locus from Newman genomic DNA (with 171 nucleotides upstream and 105 nucleotides downstream) with 3× FLAG incorporated in frame at the C-terminal end of SprA1 ORF. 3× FLAG (66-bp, 22 amino acids) is detected using monoclonal anti-FLAG® M2-Peroxidase (HRP). The resulting amino acid sequence of the SprA1 fusion peptide is MLIFVHIIAPVISGCAIAFFSYWLSRRNTKDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK. RNA extractions and Northern blots were performed as described (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the RNA half-life measurements, S. aureus was cultured overnight, and the cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Rifampicin was added to the culture at a final concentration of 200 μg ml−1. Samples (2 ml each) were taken after rifampicin addition at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 200 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RNAs were then extracted, and Northern blot assays were performed. Strains containing the relevant plasmids were grown overnight in brain-heart infusion broth. Overnight cultures were diluted 1/100 in brain-heart infusion broth containing 1 μm of aTc and grown in 96-well plate. A600 nm were measured at 5-min intervals for 20 h in Synergy HT (Bioteck). For the viability assays, the S. aureus strains were cultured and induced with aTc for 1 h. The cultures were then washed with PBS and stained with LIVE/DEAD bacterial viability kits (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. That strain contains SYTO 9 (green fluorescent) and propidium iodide (red fluorescent), both binding DNAs. When used alone, the SYTO 9 stains all the bacteria with intact or damaged membranes. In contrast, propidium iodide only penetrates bacteria with damaged membranes, causing a reduction in the SYTO 9 stain green fluorescence. Pictures of fluorescence-labeled cells were captured with a DMRXA2 Leica microscope and a COOLSNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera, using Metavue software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine the effect of SprA1 WT or mutant induction on growth, staphylococcal cultures were prepared as follows: 2-fold serial dilutions of exponential cultures were spotted on brain-heart infusion broth plates containing 1 μm aTc and 10 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Protein extracts are performed as described previously (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the secreted protein preparation, culture supernatants are collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates are washed with ice-cold acetone and dissolved into a Tris-Tricine loading buffer. For fractionated cell wall, cytoplasm, or membrane proteins, bacterial pellets were resuspended into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 30% sucrose and lysostaphin (0.1 mg/ml). The suspension was incubated 10 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 8 min. The supernatant contains the cell wall protein fraction. The pellet (protoplasts) was dissolved into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2 and sonicated for a 10-s pulse and centrifuged at 19,000 rpm for 60 min. The supernatant contained the cytoplasmic protein fraction, whereas the pellet included the membrane protein fraction. The membrane fraction was dissolved into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2. The samples were separated on Tricine-SDS-PAGE 16% gel, transferred onto Westran S PVDF membrane (Whatman), revealed using the Amersham Biosciences ECLTM Plus detection kit, and scanned with the LAS4000 imager (GE Healthcare). Strains were grown overnight in RPMI. The cultures were diluted 1/100 in RPMI and grown until an A600 nm of 1. For the acid stress, hydrochloric acid was added to the culture to reach a pH of 4.5. For the saline stress, sodium chloride was added to the culture at a final concentration of 2 m. For the oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide was added to the culture at a final concentration of 10 mm. After the addition of the stress agents, samples (2 ml each) were taken at 15 and 30 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were stocked at −80 °C until use. PepA1 peptide synthesis was performed by Proteogenix (France). All of the dilutions of PepA1 in trifluoroethanol (TFE) and SDS and in the ternary NMR mixtures were freshly prepared from dissolving the weighed dry peptide into the adequate buffer. Far ultraviolet CD spectra were recorded in a 0.1-cm-path length quartz cell at 21 °C on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectrometer over a 185–260-nm range, with a 2-nm bandwidth, a step size of 1 nm, and an integration time of 2 s/point. The spectra were averaged over five records. Buffer contributions were removed by subtracting the CD spectra of the control samples. PepA1 aggregates in aqueous solutions below 40% (v/v) TFE and concentrations of SDS below the critical micellar concentration (CMC of ∼8 mm). PepA1 CD spectra were recorded in SDS solutions with concentrations well above the CMC. NMR spectra were recorded on a 600MHz Avance Bruker spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cryo-probe and Z-axis gradient capability. Weighed peptide was dissolved in CD3OH/CDCl3/H2O buffer at pH 3.8 for a final concentration of 5 mm. The signal was field locked on CD3OH. All of the spectra were recorded in Shigemi 5-mm tubes, plugged, and sealed to avoid buffer evaporation, at temperatures ranging from 283 to 293 K. TOCSY (tm = 80 ms), NOESY (tm = 60, 90, 200, and 350 ms), and COSY experiments were collected using the Watergate pulse sequence for water signal suppression. The data were processed using Topsin 3.1 (Bruker). The chemical shift of the water signal was used as a reference (4.91 ppm at 288 K). Cross-peaks assignments were carried out in an iterative way using the network anchorage procedure and distance conversions provided by the CCPN software (10.Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J.

Dihedral and J-coupling were not restrained in the computations. Me2SO is an aprotic and nonbiomimetic solvent, and our mixed buffer contains water and methanol. Purified PepA1, however, is neither soluble in pure water, MeOH or Me2SO. So neither computational refinement in boxes of each of these three solvents is acceptable because we measured “interproton” distances in a mixed buffer with different biophysical properties. We thus decided to refine the top 20 structures of lowest energy in explicit Me2SO, because its dielectric constant is the closest to that of the NMR buffer. An energy-minimized average structure was computed. Violations were checked both with CCPN and MOLMOL (13.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. MOLMOL. A program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). The 10 best refined structures of lowest energy and with restraint violation of <0.2 Å were checked using MOLPROBITY 3.19 (14.Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X.

All-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). The structures were displayed in PYMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 4B19) and the proton chemical shifts to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (accession code r4b19nmr). The average energy-minimized structure was submitted to molecular dynamics using the GROMACS package (15.Berendsen H.J. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. GROMACS: A message-passing parallel molecular dynamics implementation.Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7193) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics (MD) was carried in a simulated lipid bilayer of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) according to the protocol described by Kandasamy and Larson (16.Kandasamy S.K. Larson R.G. Molecular dynamics simulations of model trans-membrane peptides in lipid bilayers. A systematic investigation of hydrophobic mismatch.Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2326-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The peptide was inserted perpendicularly to the DPPC bilayer and submitted to several cycles of energy minimization and positional restraints cycles using a modified GROMOS96 53A6 force field extended to include Berger lipid parameters. The simulation was carried out with periodic boundary conditions. The DPPC bilayer was solvated with SPC16 water molecules, and chloride ions were added to have a value of 0 as a net electrostatic charge of the system. The bond lengths were constrained by the all atoms LINCS algorithm. A particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used for the electrostatic interactions with a cut-off of 0.9 nm. The simulations were performed at neutral pH with runs of 50 ns at 323 K coupling the system to an external bath. GROMACS routines were utilized to check the trajectories and the quality of the simulations. The final structures were again checked using MOLPROBITY 3.19. Based on computer searches, sprA1 was proposed to be the toxic component of a type I TA pair (6.Fozo E.M. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S.A. Yutin N. Koonin E.V. Storz G.

Linder P. Gaspin C. Romby P. Schrenzel J. Francois P. Cartography of methicillin-resistant S. aureus transcripts. Detection, orientation and temporal expression during growth phase and stress conditions.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent data showed that a PepA1 fusion peptide, encoded by SprA1, is expressed in vivo and that a synthetic PepA1 lyses mammalian erythrocytes (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether PepA1 is a toxin that can influence S. aureus growth. To test that hypothesis, the SprA1 sequence, from G1889597 to U1889804 in strain Newman, was cloned into an aTc-inducible pAT12 vector (18.Bohn C. Rigoulay C. Chabelskaya S. Sharma C.M. Marchais A. Skorski P. Borezée-Durant E. Barbet R. Jacquet E. Jacq A. Gautheret D. Felden B. Vogel J. Bouloc P. Experimental discovery of small RNAs in Staphylococcus aureus reveals a riboregulator of central metabolism.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6620-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A SprA1 mutant with a termination codon replacing the fourth codon of the internal PepA1 coding sequence (pAT12ΩSprA1-STOP) containing two point mutations (T64A and C65A) to fabricate a premature UAA termination codon (supplemental Fig. S1) was also constructed. Without aTc, S. aureus cells containing the constructs expressing either SprA1 WT or SprA1-STOP grow perfectly well, as for the cells containing the empty vector (not shown). In the presence of aTc, the induced transcription of SprA1 inhibits S. aureus growth in liquid cultures (pAT12ΩSprA1; Fig. 1A). Such effect is also evident with the addition of aTc on a solid rich medium and by serial dilution assays (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, the aTc induction of the SprA1-STOP mutant that is unable to express PepA1 restores S. aureus growth near to WT levels in both liquid and solid cultures (Fig. 1). It provides experimental evidence that SprA1 inhibits S. aureus growth because it encodes and expresses PepA1. Is SprA1, via PepA1, able to trigger S. aureus death? To address that question, bacteria containing empty pAT12, pAT12ΩSprA1, or a pAT12ΩSprA1-STOP peptide mutant were stained with fluorescent dyes discriminating alive (intact membranes) from dead cells (disrupted membranes) and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Cells transformed with an empty pAT12 vector are intact (stained green) 1 h after the aTc induction, whereas about half the cells transformed with pAT12ΩSprA1 (stained red) die (Fig. 1C). Cells expressing SprA1-STOP display similar viability to wild type cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore, PepA1 causes S. aureus death by disrupting membrane integrity. Northern blots were performed to verify the expression of SprA1 (WT or mutated) in the three constructs, before and after aTc induction (Fig. 1D). The aTc induction increases ∼3-fold the SprA1 WT or mutated RNA levels. During S. aureus growth, PepA1 toxicity is constitutively repressed by a tight translation control of SprA1, performed by SprA1AS. If the SprA1AS RNAs were an antidote to PepA1 toxicity, acted as antitoxins, and were part of a type I TA system, their in vivo stability should be lower than SprA1. SprA1AS degradation should allow PepA1 expression, in turn inducing S. aureus cell death. To determine SprA1 and SprA1AS stabilities in vivo, total RNAs were purified from S. aureus strain Newman at various times after rifampicin exposure. SprA1AS levels continually decline after rifampicin addition, whereas SprA1 levels remain essentially constant (Fig. 2A). Half-life determinations of the two RNAs showed a ∼20-fold shorter half-life for SprA1AS (∼10 min) compared with that of SprA1 (∼3 h). During S. aureus growth, SprA1AS is produced at a ∼30–90-fold excess relative to SprA1 (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), probably to balance its instability. Therefore, it is anticipated that PepA1 translational derepression, in response to specific environmental signals, occurs by lowering SprA1AS levels. After determining SprA1 and SprA1AS expression levels (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and stabilities in vivo (this report), we aimed at following PepA1 expression levels during S. aureus growth. Despite several attempts, we were unable to produce polyclonal antibodies directed against chemically synthesized and purified PepA1, to monitor the in vivo expression of native, untagged, PepA1 peptide. Therefore, a reporter peptide construct was designed by adding, in frame, a 3× FLAG sequence ahead of the termination codon of the PepA1 ORF in strain Newman (supplemental Fig. S1). Flagged PepA1 expression in vivo might be less toxic than WT PepA1. S. aureus cells expressing pCN35-SprA1wt could not be obtained (9.Sayed N. Jousselin A. Felden B. A cis-antisense RNA acts in trans in Staphylococcus aureus to control translation of a human cytolytic peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 105-112Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed, a S. aureus Newman strain deleted for the native sprA1/sprA1AS locus and containing pCN35-SprA1FLAG could be successfully obtained (ΔsprA1-ΔsprA1AS pCN35ΩΔsprA1FLAG-sprA1AS). Immunoblots using anti-FLAG antibodies reveal that the SprA1 fusion peptide is expressed in vivo at all times during S. aureus growth (Fig. 2B), with an apparent molecular mass of ∼7 kDa, in agreement with the predicted 52-amino acid-long fusion peptides inferred from the SprA1 nucleotide sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). Flagged PepA1 is highly expressed very early during S. aureus growth in a rich medium (lag phase). Its production then decreases later on throughout growth. A similar PepA1 expression pattern was observed when growing S. aureus in a restricted, minimal medium (not shown). To rule out that the decrease of PepA1 expression over time might be due to a progressive reduction of plasmid number per cell caused by peptide toxicity, Northern blot analysis of SprA1-FLAG RNA levels over growth were performed and indicate that the SprA1 RNA levels do not decline over time (Fig. 2B). The sequence alignments and amino acid composition of PepA1 both suggest it is hydrophobic and contains a cationic domain. Because cationic peptides can interact with bacterial cytoplasmic membranes (19.Hancock R.E. Rozek A. Role of membranes in the activities of antimicrobial cationic peptides.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 206: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because PepA1 induces S. aureus membrane damage (this report), subcellular localization of flagged PepA1, within the S. aureus cells, was performed. Membrane, cell wall, cytoplasm and extracellular fractions were prepared from S. aureus Newman cells. The purity of our cell fractionations was then analyzed by western immunoblot analysis, using anti-SarA, anti-ATPase, and anti-protein A antibodies. SarA is a cytoplasmic transcription factor and is only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, as expected. The ATPase is a membrane protein and is indeed only identified in the membrane fraction. Protein A is a secreted protein and is mainly identified in the exoproteins fraction (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, immunoblots with anti-FLAG antibodies indicate that PepA1 is exclusively detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2C). It indicates that once PepA1 is translated from SprA1 within the cytoplasm, it goes into the S. aureus membranes. We cannot rule out, however, that the presence of a FLAG within PepA1 amino acid sequence could influence its cellular location. PepA1 three-dimensional structure was probed by NMR in a ternary mixture of CD3OH/CDCl3/H2O that mimi"

Ancestral precursors of circular proteins?.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cyclotides are characterized by a cyclic cystine knot motif, which comprises a circular peptide backbone and a cystine knot core formed from six conserved Cys residues (1.Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T.

Their native function has been believed to be plant defense-related since it was found that the growth of larvae of the major cotton pests, Helicoverpa punctigera and Helicoverpa armigera, was severely stunted when fed a diet that contained the cyclotide kB1 or kalata B2 (kB2) (23.Jennings C.

It is believed that the mechanism of action of cyclotides involves membrane interactions. This is supported by a recent study showing that cyclotides can bind to and disrupt the cell membranes of gut epithelial cells of cyclotide-fed H. armigera larvae (25.Barbeta B.L. Marshall A.T. Gillon A.D. Craik D.J. Anderson M.A. Plant cyclotides disrupt epithelial cells in the midgut of lepidopteran larvae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cyclotides can bind directly to phospholipid bilayers, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PE)-type lipids (26.Kamimori H. Hall K. Craik D.J. Aguilar M.I.

Chem. 2009; 284: 20699-20707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that cyclotide activity requires recognition by a chiral protein receptor because the all-d-enantiomer of kB1 is bioactive (30.Sando L. Henriques S.T. Foley F. Simonsen S.M. Daly N.L. Hall K.N. Gustafson K.R. Aguilar M.I. Craik D.J. A synthetic mirror image of kalata B1 reveals that cyclotide activity is independent of a protein receptor.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 2456-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that cyclotides primarily target the lipid components of cell membranes. A molecular description of how cyclotides interact with lipids has only recently been developed. Spin label experiments using dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) micelles identified a putative membrane binding surface that is composed mainly of hydrophobic residues and localized to one face of cyclotides (31.Shenkarev Z.O. Nadezhdin K.D. Lyukmanova E.N. Sobol V.A. Skjeldal L. Arseniev A.S. Divalent cation coordination and mode of membrane interaction in cyclotides.

NMR was further used to characterize a PE binding region on the surface of kB1 (27.Henriques S.T. Huang Y.H. Rosengren K.J. Franquelim H.G. Carvalho F.A. Johnson A. Sonza S. Tachedjian G. Castanho M.A. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Decoding the membrane activity of the cyclotide kalata B1.

Chem. 2011; 286: 24231-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, despite these findings in DPC membrane mimics, little is known about the structure of cyclotides bound to a lipid bilayer. It has been suggested that this structure may involve cyclotide oligomers following observations that kB1 and kB2 can self-associate in solution (33.Nourse A. Trabi M. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. A comparison of the self-association behavior of the plant cyclotides kalata B1 and kalata B2 via analytical ultracentrifugation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, there is currently no evidence for a mode of action involving oligomerization. In this study, we were interested in further understanding the molecular mechanism of action of cyclotides by focusing on the two prototypical cyclotides, kB1 and kB2. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we defined the thermodynamics of cyclotide binding to DPC micelles and PE-containing phospholipid bilayers. We assessed how thermodynamic parameters of binding are affected by mutations in kB1, PE content of the phospholipid vesicles, temperature, and the presence of metal ions, to identify the factors that mediate cyclotide-lipid binding. Finally, to help define the structure of the cyclotide-containing membranes, we studied the interaction of both kB1 and kB2 with supported lipid bilayers using dissipative quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) and neutron reflectometry. The results have helped to elucidate the pathway by which cyclotides insert into and disrupt cell membranes. Native kB1 and kB2 were extracted from O. affinis using a previously described protocol (24.Jennings C.V. Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Plan M. Stevens J. Scanlon M.J. Waine C. Norman D.G. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Isolation, solution structure, and insecticidal activity of kalata B2, a circular protein with a twist. Do Möbius strips exist in nature?.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, this involves an initial separation step where ground plant material is placed in 1:1 dichloromethane/methanol overnight, before repeated rounds of reverse phase C18 HPLC (1%/min gradient of 90% acetonitrile, 10% water, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). The purity of fractions was assessed using electron spray ionization-MS and analytical HPLC using the same gradient and solvent as described above. The masses of kB1 and kB2 were verified against the masses provided by CyBase, a database of circular proteins (4.Wang C.K. Kaas Q. Chiche L. Craik D.J. CyBase.

Wang C. Craik D.J. CyBase. A database of cyclic protein sequence and structure.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D192-D194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). t-Butoxycarbonyl-based solid phase peptide syntheses of cyclic ([E7A]kB1, [T16A]kB1, and [T27A]kB1) and acyclic (des-(16ψ17)-kB1 and des-(29ψ1)-kB1) variants of kB1 were carried out using a method described previously (35.Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Chemical synthesis and folding pathways of large cyclic polypeptides. Studies of the cystine knot polypeptide kalata B1.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The cyclic mutants were assembled on resin using a thioester linker that allowed subsequent cyclization by a modified form of native chemical ligation (36.Tam J.P. Lu Y.-A. Yu Q. Thia zip reaction for synthesis of large cyclic peptides: mechanisms and applications.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4316-4324Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hydrogen fluoride cleavage was conducted on the deprotected resin using standard protocols (0 °C, 90 min, 90% HF, 8% p-cresol, 2% p-thiocresol). Crude cleavage products were purified by reverse phase C18 HPLC to give linear, reduced, C-terminally thioester capped peptides. The cyclic mutants were cyclized, and both cyclic and acyclic mutants were oxidized overnight in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at pH 8.5 with 50% 2-propanol and purified as above. NMR was used to check the three-dimensional folds of the mutants. Synthetic mutants of kB1, des-(16ψ17)-kB1 and des-(29ψ1)-kB1, were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and the pH was adjusted using concentrated NaOH and HCl. Bruker ARX 500 or 600 NMR spectrometers were used to record spectra at 303K. DPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolimine (POPE), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE), chain-deuterated 1,2-d54-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (d54-DMPE), and deuterated 1,2 d54-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (d54-DMPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sphingomyelin, Tris-HCl, and D2O (>99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A defined amount of lipid in chloroform was dried under a nitrogen stream and left under high vacuum overnight to remove traces of solvent. A defined amount of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was then added to the lipid, and the dispersion was extensively vortexed. The lipid dispersion was placed in a water bath sonicator for 30 min at 40 °C. The screening of kB1 and kB2 binding to DPC micelles was performed using a VP ITC instrument (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Samples were degassed in a ThermoVac (Microcal) before use. Typically, 10 injections of 15 μl from a 300-μl syringe containing 15 mm lipid mixtures were injected into a ∼1.4-ml reaction cell loaded with 250 μm cyclotide while stirring at a speed of 300 rpm. Unless noted otherwise, all measurements were made at 30 °C in freshly prepared buffer solutions: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl. Lipid vesicles were suspended in the same buffer as the peptide. As a control, lipid vesicles were injected into pure buffer containing no peptide. All other ITC binding experiments were conducted using an iTC200 instrument (Microcal), equipped with a 70-μl syringe and a ∼300-μl reaction cell. For these binding experiments, typically 1.9 μl of 3 mm lipid was injected into 100 μm cyclotide solution every 3 min for 20 injections while stirring at 1000 rpm. The resulting titration data were analyzed and fitted to a one set of sites model using the Origin for ITC software package supplied by Microcal to obtain the number of bound ligand molecules (N), the association constant (Ka), and change in enthalpy (ΔH). Changes in entropy (ΔS) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) were calculated from the following equation. ΔG=ΔH−TΔS(Eq. 1) QCM-D measurements were carried out using a Qsense E4 instrument (Qsense Ltd.) on SiO2-coated quartz crystal sensors at 45 °C. Lipid bilayers were formed by flowing a 0.5 mg/ml solution of 3:1 DMPC/DMPE in 100 mm aqueous NaCl over the sensor surface for 10 min at 100 μl min−1 before a 20–30-min incubation and rinsing off with 100 mm aqueous NaCl at 100 μl min−1 until a stable baseline was reached. The peptide solutions (900 μl) at concentrations of 5–100 μm were introduced at 100 μl min−1, and incubated over the membrane until no more changes in frequency or dissipation were observed. The membrane surface coverage (ng cm−2) and the total mass of peptide, membrane, and associated water were estimated using the Saurbrey calculation. Above 50 μm kB1 and 25 μm kB2, the peptides led to very large dissipation values, indicating a highly hydrated and extended structure beyond the thickness range within which viscoelastic modeling can be used to estimate the membrane thickness and mass. The support surfaces (single crystal silicon 111 orientation) were cleaned by a 1:4:5 solution of H2O2/H2SO4/H2O at 80 °C followed by UV ozonolysis for 5–10 min before the experiment. This treatment generates a highly hydrophilic native SiO2 layer of 7–15-Å thickness and 5–10-Å roughness. Phospholipid bilayers were formed by adsorption of sonicated small unilamellar vesicles of d54-DMPE and d54-DMPC (∼0.5 mg/ml) in 100 mm NaCl to a silicon surface preheated to 45 °C with an incubation period of 20–30 min prior to rinsing off the excess vesicles with 100 mm NaCl. All peptide adsorption experiments were carried out at 45 °C because d54-DMPE and d54-DMPC are fully miscible only above 40 °C (37.Silvius J.R. Solid- and liquid-phase equilibria in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine mixtures. A calorimetric study.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 857: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specular neutron reflection was measured on the CRISP reflectometer (38.Penfold J. Instrumentation for neutron reflectivity.Physica B. 1991; 173: 1-10Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK), using neutron wavelengths λ of 0.5–6 Å to record reflectivity profiles in the range 0.01 < Q < 0.5 Å−1, where Q = 4πsinθ/λ is the momentum transfer vector of the neutrons in the direction (z) perpendicular to the membrane-water interface. Under these conditions, a typical measurement at three incident angles (0.35°, 0.8°, and 1.8°) to obtain the full reflectivity profile required 75 min. The phospholipid bilayers were formed in the neutron reflectometer sample chamber after measuring the structure of the supporting Si-SiO2 surface in D2O or H2O. Each lipid membrane structure was also measured before exposure to the peptides. Peptide solutions (5 ml) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl at concentrations of 5–100 μm were injected over the lipid membrane consecutively, and changes in membrane structure were recorded. Each contrast (D2O or H2O) was recorded on a separate membrane structure, but the results were fitted simultaneously, because the silicon support and membrane structures were found to be identical. Details of the analysis of supported lipid membrane structure (39.Vacklin H.P. Tiberg F. Fragneto G. Thomas R.K. Composition of supported model membranes determined by neutron reflection.Langmuir. 2005; 21: 2827-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and interaction with soluble proteins (40.Vacklin H.P. Tiberg F. Fragneto G. Thomas R.K. Phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of supported phospholipid bilayers. A neutron reflectivity and ellipsometry study.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using time-of-flight neutron reflection have been described previously. Briefly, the neutron scattering length density profile ρ(z) of a lipid bilayer can be divided into separate headgroup and acyl chain regions due to their chemical differences and water penetration. Reflectivity analysis is based on modeling the thickness, scattering length density, lipid volume fraction, and roughness of three layers corresponding to the lipid headgroups and the acyl chain region. In membranes containing lipids (L), water (W), and a peptide (P), the scattering length density ρlayer is the sum of the molecular scattering length densities ρi weighted by the volume fractions ϕi of each component and water (W). ρlayer=φLρL+φWρW+φPρP(Eq. 2) Thus, when there are significant differences in the molecular scattering length densities of lipid, peptide, and water, their individual volume fractions can be computed from the fitted scattering length density of the layer. In the present work, all experiments were done in both D2O and H2O subphases, in order to resolve the layer composition. The Motofit program (41.Nelson A. Co-refinement of multiple-contrast neutron/X-ray reflectivity data using MOTOFIT.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 273-276Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar) was used for optical matrix modeling (42.Heavens O.S. Optical properties of Thin Films. Dover Publications, London1955Google Scholar) to calculate specular reflectivity from model structures. The scattering length densities of the phospholipids were calculated from volume fractions of the lipid components obtained from molecular dynamics simulations (43.Armen R.S. Uitto O.D. Feller S.E. Phospholipid component volumes: determination and application to bilayer structure calculations.Biophys.

Protein volume in solution.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) listed in Table 1. The errors in the structural parameters for each sublayer were derived from the maximum acceptable variation in the fitted thickness and lipid volume fraction that allowed a fit to be maintained, subject to a constant molecular area constraint required to maintain a planar bilayer geometry. However, the errors in independent parameters of the model sublayers are coupled in such a way that the overall errors in membrane volume fraction and thickness are ±10% and ±2Å, respectively.TABLE 1Molecular volumes (V) and neutron scattering length densities (ρ) used in fitting data and calculating bilayer structureCompoundVρ (in D2O)aCalculated from the molecular component volumes and coherent nuclear scattering lengths.ρ (in H2O)aCalculated from the molecular component volumes and coherent nuclear scattering lengths.Å310−6 Å−210−6 Å−2d54-DMPCHeadgroups326bFrom molecular dynamics simulations (43).1.81.8Chains777.5bFrom molecular dynamics simulations (43).6.86.8d54-DMPEHeadgroups243bFrom molecular dynamics simulations (43).2.81.8Chains777.5bFrom molecular dynamics simulations (43).6.86.8Kalata B13313cCalculated from the sequence of kalata B1 and kalata B2, using values for aqueous protein solutions (43, 44), taking into account the number of exchangeable protons.3.72.2Kalata B23313cCalculated from the sequence of kalata B1 and kalata B2, using values for aqueous protein solutions (43, 44), taking into account the number of exchangeable protons.3.72.2D2O306.35H2O30−0.56a Calculated from the molecular component volumes and coherent nuclear scattering lengths.b From molecular dynamics simulations (43.Armen R.S.

https://openalex.org/W1976812770,"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of life-threatening infections in the United States. It requires iron to grow, which must be actively procured from its host to successfully mount an infection. Heme-iron within hemoglobin (Hb) is the most abundant source of iron in the human body and is captured by S. aureus using two closely related receptors, IsdH and IsdB. Here we demonstrate that each receptor captures heme using two conserved near iron transporter (NEAT) domains that function synergistically. NMR studies of the 39-kDa conserved unit from IsdH (IsdHN2N3, Ala326–Asp660) reveals that it adopts an elongated dumbbell-shaped structure in which its NEAT domains are properly positioned by a helical linker domain, whose three-dimensional structure is determined here in detail.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of lethal hospital- and community-acquired infections in the United States. These infections result in a range of life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis. Highly virulent methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus are now common, which annually cause more deaths in the United States (over 18,500) than any other single infectious agent (1Klevens R.M. Morrison M.A. Nadle J. Petit S. Gershman K. Ray S. Harrison L.H. Lynfield R. Dumyati G. Townes J.M. Craig A.S. Zell E.R. Fosheim G.E. McDougal L.K. Carey R.B. Fridkin S.K.

Iron is an essential nutrient required for S. aureus growth and is actively procured from its host during infections. As an innate defense mechanism, humans and other vertebrates exploit this dependence by sequestering the majority of the body's total iron within cells and by binding extracellular iron to transferrin and lactoferrin glycoproteins (2Papanikolaou G.

Iron-protoporphyrin IX (heme), found in the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin (Hb), contains ∼75% of the body's total iron. As a result, S. aureus and other microbial pathogens have developed elaborate heme acquisition systems to exploit this rich nutrient source.

Four Isd proteins are attached to the cell wall and capture Hb, extract its heme, and pass it across the peptidoglycan to the membrane. These proteins include IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH (also known as HarA), which are attached to the cell wall by the SrtA sortase enzyme (8Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E.

Biochemical and cellular localization studies indicate that heme capture is mediated by an ordered set of heme transfer reactions. This process is initiated when the IsdH and IsdB proteins exposed on the cell surface bind Hb and remove its heme (8Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E.

Heme is then transferred to IsdA, which, in turn, relays it to the IsdC protein buried within the cell wall (11Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A.

Holo-IsdC then passes heme to the IsdE-IsdF complex, a transporter that pumps heme across the membrane into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the heme oxygenase IsdG or its paralog, IsdI, degrades the tetrapyrrole ring to release free iron for use by the bacterium (15Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O.

In the Isd system, both Hb and heme are captured by near iron transporter (NEAT) domains that are located within the IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH proteins. These conserved binding modules are ∼125 residues in length and are named for the location of their genes, which are proximal to putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter genes (26Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D. Perez-Iratxeta C. Bork P. NEAT: a domain duplicated in genes near the components of a putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0047)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of isolated NEAT domains indicate that they have distinct binding specificities that enable interactions with one or more distinct ligands, including heme, Hb, haptoglobin, and other host proteins. The atomic structures of several isolated NEAT domains have now been determined, revealing the mechanism of heme and Hb binding (27Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E.

In addition, recent studies have shown that heme transfer from IsdA to IsdC occurs when their NEAT domains transiently associate via an ultra-low affinity hand clasp complex (30Villareal V.A.

The first step in heme acquisition is the capture of Hb and the extraction of its heme molecules by IsdH and IsdB. Both receptors are potential targets for the development of novel antibiotics because isdH and isdB mutant strains of S. aureus are reduced in their ability to infect mice (16Pishchany G. Dickey S.E.

IsdA and IsdB antibodies protect mice against Staphylococcus aureus abscess formation and lethal challenge.Vaccine. 2010; 28: 6382-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). IsdH and IsdB share a significant degree of primary sequence homology, and, unlike other components of the Isd system, they contain multiple NEAT domains. IsdB has been shown to bind Hb and capture its heme at least 150 times faster than the rate at which Hb spontaneously releases heme into the solvent, suggesting that the receptors capture heme via an activated receptor-Hb complex (14Zhu H. Xie G. Liu M. Olson J.S. Fabian M. Dooley D.M. Lei B. Pathway for heme uptake from human methemoglobin by the iron-regulated surface determinants system of Staphylococcus aureus.J. Biol.

Quaternary structure regulates hemin dissociation from human hemoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17385-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that heme capture by IsdB and IsdH is mediated by a conserved structured unit that contains two NEAT domains that are connected by an α-helical linker domain. We show, based on absorbance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements, that the linker domain in IsdH forms a three-helix bundle structure that is essential for efficient heme capture. NMR studies of a 39-kDa polypeptide containing the conserved unit from IsdH indicate that it adopts an extended but ordered structure. A model of the heme extraction process is presented in which IsdH dissociates the Hb tetramer to promote heme release. Plasmids were generated encoding IsdH and IsdB receptor constructs as small hexahistidine-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-tagged proteins under control of an inducible promoter: pRM208 coding for amino acids 326–660 in IsdH (IsdHN2N3), pRM213 coding for amino acids 326–466 in IsdH (IsdHN2), pRM214 coding for amino acids 466–660 in IsdH (IsdHlinker-N3), pRM234 coding for amino acids 326–543 in IsdH (IsdHN2-linker), pRM219 coding for amino acids 467–543 in IsdH (IsdHlinker), and pRM221 coding for amino acids 544–600 in IsdH (IsdHN3). Briefly, the DNA was amplified from the S. aureus RN4220 genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the vector pHis-SUMO using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes (35Senturia R. Faller M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Hwang D. Clubb R.T. Guo F. Structure of the dimerization domain of DiGeorge critical region 8.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pRM233 coding for amino acids 326–660 (IsdHN2-GS-N3) was generated from pRM208 using two-step PCR, such that the linker was replaced with a nine-amino acid artificial linker (GSGSGSGSG). The sequence of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of the plasmid pRM216 coding for amino acids 326–660 in IsdH with an alanine substitution of Tyr642 (IsdN2N3(Y642A)) has been described earlier (36Spirig T. Clubb R.T.

Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs) transformed with the overexpression plasmids in LB/kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 37 °C. For production of isotopically labeled [13C,15N]protein, the cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and ruptured by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the SUMO-tagged proteins was purified using a Co2+-chelating column (Thermo Scientific). After cleavage of the fusion proteins with ULP1 protease for 2 h at 4 °C, they were reapplied to the Co2+ chelating column to remove the protease and cleaved SUMO-affinity tag. The receptor proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Heme contents of holo- and apoproteins were determined with the pyridine hemochrome assay, and homogeneous apo forms of the heme-binding proteins were generated by extraction with methyl ethyl ketone (37Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Preparation and properties of apohemoglobin and reconstituted hemoglobins.Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of [U-2H,13C,15N]IsdN2N3(Y642A) was performed according to a previously published protocol (36Spirig T. Clubb R.T.

Human blood (30–40 ml) was collected with heparin anticoagulant by a health practitioner following appropriate institutional protocols. Red blood cells were collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl and bubbled with carbon monoxide (CO) for 5 min. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in five volumes of water, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.9%, resulting in aggregation of the membrane fractions into a gelatinous phase, which was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 9500 × g. The supernatant containing Hb was supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and bubbled with CO for 5 min. After adjusting the pH to 6.9, the hemolysate was applied to an SP Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.9, and Hb was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The fractions containing Hb were pooled, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, and bubbled with CO for 5 min. Subsequently, the sample was applied to a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Pure Hb was eluted with 30 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.9, with a yield of 100 mg of protein/ml of blood. Hb concentrations were determined using Drabkin's reagent (Sigma). Purified human Hb and IsdH proteins were prepared in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.9, subsequently mixed to concentrations of 10 and 20 μm, respectively, and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. MS measurements of protein samples were performed on a Waters Synapt G1 QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) (35Senturia R. Faller M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Hwang D. Clubb R.T. Guo F. Structure of the dimerization domain of DiGeorge critical region 8.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were electrosprayed using Proxeon glass capillary nanoelectrospray emitters at flow rates between 30 and 50 nl/min. Quantification of Hb and Hb-receptor complexes was performed based on the Waters Synapt data by comparing summed peak heights. Higher resolution mass spectrometry experiments were performed using a 15-tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instrument (SolariX hybrid Qq-FTMS, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Circular dichroism spectra of 0.2 mg/ml IsdBlinker and IsdHlinker in 10 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaF, pH 6.8, were recorded on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corp.) at 25 °C with a scan rate of 20 nm/min. Heme transfer reactions from Hb to IsdBN1N2 and various IsdH protein constructs were monitored by following absorbance changes using a conventional spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1700 PharmaSpec), as described previously (14Zhu H. Xie G. Liu M. Olson J.S. Fabian M. Dooley D.M. Lei B. Pathway for heme uptake from human methemoglobin by the iron-regulated surface determinants system of Staphylococcus aureus.J. Biol.

Briefly, 1 μm holo-Hb (expressed in tetrameric units) was mixed with 10 μm apo-receptor protein in 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Entire absorbance spectra were recorded for hemin transfer from holo-Hb to apo-IsdHN2N3 over time. To compare the heme transfer rates from Hb to the various acceptor proteins, changes in absorbance at 371 and 406 nm were recorded over time at 25 °C for up to 2 h. Apparent rate constants for the heme transfer reactions were obtained by fitting the time courses of the absorbance changes ΔA406–371 to single or double exponential curves with SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.). Affinities of IsdHN3 and IsdHN2N3 for heme were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy as described (38Pilpa R.M. Robson S.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T.

NMR spectra of IsdHlinker were acquired at 25 °C on cryoprobe-equipped Bruker Avance 500-, 600-, and 800-MHz spectrometers. Backbone and side-chain chemical shift assignments were obtained by analyzing the following experiments: 1H,15N HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY, HNCA, HNHA, HNHB, HBHA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, 15N-edited NOESY, and 13C-edited NOESY (reviewed in Ref. 39Cavanagh J.

The human ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1; also known as CHD1L (chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1-like) gene encodes a member of the SNF2 (sucrose non-fermenter 2) superfamily of ATPases. ALC1 was originally identified as a gene present on a short human chromosome 1q21 region that is amplified in hepatocellular carcinomas (1.Ma N.F. Hu L. Fung J.M. Xie D. Zheng B.J. Chen L. Tang D.J.

ALC1 is unique among SNF2 family members because it includes a macrodomain that is capable of binding selectively to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). 3The abbreviations used are: PARpoly(ADP-ribose)PARGpoly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. Previous studies from our laboratory and elsewhere revealed that ALC1 possesses cryptic DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding activities that are strongly activated in the presence of the catalytically active poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP1 and its substrate NAD+ (4.Ahel D.

Suggesting that binding of the macrodomain to PAR is essential for ALC1 activation, ALC1 macrodomain mutations that prevent PAR binding abolish ALC1 DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding. Nevertheless, we observed that binding of free PAR chains to the macrodomain is not sufficient to activate DNA-dependent ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activities, arguing that the ALC1 activation process is more complex (6.Gottschalk A.J.

In this study, we explored the mechanism by which PARP1 and NAD+ function together to activate ALC1 nucleosome remodeling and the role of PAR in this process. As described below, we demonstrate that ALC1 activation proceeds via formation of a stable ALC1·PARylated PARP1·nucleosome intermediate. In addition, through development and application of a novel PAR footprinting assay, we obtained evidence that ALC1 activation results from a direct and stable interaction of the ALC1 macrodomain with PAR conjugated to PARylated PARP1. Below, we present these findings, which are consistent with the model that PAR conjugated to PARP1 functions as an allosteric effector that activates ALC1 nucleosome remodeling activity. PARP1 (high specific activity, >95% pure) was obtained from Trevigen. FLAG-tagged ALC1 and ALC1 mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (6.Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G.

Lysates from 1 × 108 cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for at least 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1:500 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340), and bound proteins were eluted from the beads with elution buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1:500 protease inhibitor mixture, and 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Protein concentrations were estimated by comparing the intensities of Coomassie Blue-stained bands with that of BSA in SDS-polyacrylamide gels scanned using an Odyssey® imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Mononucleosomes were reconstituted by dilution transfer from HeLa cell oligonucleosomes on a 32P-end-labeled 216-bp DNA fragment (601-lat Gal4) generated by PCR from pGEM3Z-601-Gal4 (7.Owen-Hughes T.

ATP, NAD+, and benzamide were included in reactions as indicated in Fig. 1. Reaction products were incubated for a further 30 min with 10 units of HhaI and resolved on gels containing 7% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea, 45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3). 40 pmol of 5′-biotinylated 601-lat Gal4 DNA fragment or mononucleosomes assembled on the same DNA fragment were bound to 400 μl of streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads® (Invitrogen), washed, and resuspended in a final volume of 400 μl (100 fmol of DNA or mononucleosome/μl of beads). 0.5 pmol of PARP1, with or without 1 pmol of ALC1, was incubated with 0.5 pmol of immobilized nucleosomes or DNA in 40 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, and NAD+ as indicated in the figures. Nucleosome- or DNA-bound intermediates on Dynabeads® were collected using DynaMagTM magnets (Invitrogen), washed with 200 μl of the same buffer, and transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer. Template-bound intermediates were transferred to PVDF membranes and visualized using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to detect 32P-PARylated proteins or by Western blotting using an Odyssey® imaging system. ALC1·PARylated PARP1·nucleosome or PARylated PARP1·nucleosome intermediates were assembled in the presence of [32P]NAD+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described above. To isolate radiolabeled PAR, reaction products were digested in 60 μl of 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 μg of GlycoBlue (Ambion), and 10 μg of proteinase K (Sigma) at 60 °C for 12 h. Following proteinase K digestion, reactions were brought to 0.08 m KOH and incubated for a further 3 h at 60 °C to remove any remaining peptides bound to the PAR species. PAR was precipitated with 70% ethanol; resuspended in loading buffer consisting of 6 m urea, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol; and analyzed on gels containing 20 or 25% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea, 45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3). Reaction products were visualized using a Typhoon PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant TL software (Molecular Dynamics). To begin to investigate the mechanism by which PARP1 and NAD+ function together to activate ALC1, we sought to isolate and define intermediates in the process. Previous studies using the PARP1 inhibitor benzamide, which prevents PAR synthesis by PARP1 (9.Purnell M.R. Whish W.J. Novel inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase.Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), have provided information about the nature of the essential PARP1- and NAD+-dependent step(s) in ALC1 activation. In these experiments, benzamide was found to block ALC1 DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activities when added at the beginning of reactions (4.Ahel D. Horejsí Z.

This observation, together with evidence that free PAR is not sufficient to activate ALC1, argued that ALC1 activation depends on PARylation of one or more components of the nucleosome remodeling reaction. Indicating that ALC1 PARylation is not essential for ALC1 activation, preincubation of PARP1 and NAD+ with nucleosomes or with naked DNA prior to addition of benzamide and ALC1 rendered reactions resistant to benzamide (4.Ahel D.

Arguing that histone PARylation does not play an essential role in formation of this benzamide-resistant intermediate, we observed that either nucleosomes or naked DNA can support PARP1- and NAD+-dependent ALC1 DNA-dependent ATPase activity (6.Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Ladurner A.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Taken together, these findings indicate that a benzamide-resistant intermediate capable of supporting ALC1 activation and containing PARylated PARP1 can form in the absence of ALC1. To extend our understanding of ALC1 activation, we carried out similar benzamide challenge experiments to explore the kinetics of formation of the benzamide-resistant intermediate. To do so, we preincubated nucleosomes with PARP1 and NAD+ for varying lengths of time before adding benzamide and ALC1 and assayed for nucleosome remodeling by monitoring deprotection of an HhaI site located near the nucleosome dyad (diagrammed in Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous results, addition of benzamide at the beginning of the reaction completely blocked ALC1 activity (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Under the conditions of these assays, a benzamide-resistant intermediate that supports ALC1-dependent nucleosome remodeling formed very rapidly in the presence of PARP1 and NAD+, reaching near maximal levels within 2–4 min (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 with lanes 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, respectively, and Fig. 1C, which shows quantitation of the data from the experiment of Fig. 1B). To estimate the length of PAR chains synthesized during formation of the benzamide-resistant intermediate in the experiment of Fig. 1B, we performed a parallel experiment in which nucleosomes and PARP1 were incubated for varying lengths of time in the presence of [32P]NAD+. Reaction mixtures were then treated with proteinase K, and PAR chains were cleaved from the remaining PARP1 protein fragments by base treatment, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 1D, similar amounts of PAR species migrating more rapidly than the position of the asterisk (estimated length of 12–15 ADP-ribose units) were synthesized after 0.5 min, a time point at which only a small amount of benzamide-resistant intermediate had formed, and after 4 min, a time sufficient for formation of enough intermediate to support near maximal nucleosome remodeling (compare lanes 4 and 7). In contrast, longer species continued to accumulate during this time period (lanes 4–7), suggesting that formation of the benzamide-resistant intermediate that supports ALC1 activation requires synthesis by PARP1 of these longer PAR chains. We previously showed that that the binding of ALC1 to immobilized DNA or nucleosomes depends on PARP1 and NAD+ (6.Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Ladurner A.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation directs recruitment and activation of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13770-13774Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These experiments did not, however, address the fate of PARP1 during ALC1 activation. If PARylated PARP1 contributes to both ALC1 activation and subsequent ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling or DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, PARylated PARP1 might be predicted to remain as an integral component of an activated ALC1·nucleosome or ALC1·DNA intermediate throughout reactions. Alternatively, PARylated PARP1 might be required for the initial activation of ALC1 but then be displaced upon the binding of ALC1 to its substrates and/or hydrolysis of ATP. To address this issue, immobilized nucleosomes or DNA was incubated with PARP1 and NAD+ with or without ALC1 and ATP. Excess competitor DNA was added as a sink for unbound or disassociated PARP1 and ALC1 after a time sufficient for formation of the benzamide-resistant intermediate. At varying times after addition of competitor, the amounts of PARP1 and ALC1 remaining bound to immobilized nucleosomes and DNA or released were measured by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, PARP1 could be detected in the bound fraction after incubation with immobilized nucleosomes or DNA. Notably, retention of PARP1 on nucleosomes or DNA increased significantly in the presence of ALC1 (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6), suggesting that the binding of PARP1 and ALC1 to nucleosomes or DNA is cooperative. ALC1·PARP1·nucleosome or ALC1·PARP1·DNA complexes were stable, as they exhibited no apparent dissociation during a 30-min incubation following addition of competitor. Furthermore, the amount of bound PARP1 was not decreased when binding assays included ATP (compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 7–9), suggesting that PARP1 is not displaced from ALC1·PARP1·nucleosome or ALC1·PARP1·DNA intermediates upon ATP hydrolysis. PARylation of PARP1 has been shown to decrease its affinity for DNA or nucleosomes (reviewed in Refs. 10.D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G.

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1: ‘PAR-laying’ NAD+ into a nuclear signal.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between PAR synthesis and formation of the stable ALC1·PARP1·nucleosome intermediate, we manipulated the extent of PARP1 PARylation by varying the concentration of NAD+ included in the binding assays. Consistent with previous evidence that the binding of ALC1 to DNA or nucleosomes depends on PARP1 and NAD+, the amount of ALC1 binding depended on NAD+ concentration; at the lowest concentration of NAD+, less ALC1 remained associated with immobilized nucleosomes than when NAD+ was present at the highest concentrations used (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–9). There was little NAD+-dependent change in the amount of bound PARP1 when the binding reactions included ALC1 (lanes 6–9); however, when ALC1 was not included in the binding reactions, substantially less PARP1 remained associated with immobilized nucleosomes at high NAD+ concentrations, where the extent of [32P]NAD+ incorporation into PARylated PARP1 was greater (Fig. 2B, upper panels, compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 6–9). The NAD+-dependent decrease in PARP1 bound to nucleosomes depended on PAR synthesis because it was mitigated when benzamide was added to reactions along with competitor DNA (Fig. 2B, lower panels). We similarly observed that enhanced binding of PARP1 to DNA in the presence of ALC1 was most pronounced when reactions contained NAD+ (data not shown). Taken together, our findings are consistent with the model that ALC1 and PARylated PARP1 bind cooperatively to nucleosomes or DNA to form an intermediate that is stable in the presence or absence of ATP. We previously observed that the DNA-dependent ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activities of ALC1 were abolished by an ALC1 macrodomain point mutation (D723A) that interferes with its binding to free PAR, suggesting that binding of PAR to the ALC1 macrodomain is likely to play a role in ALC1 activation. To investigate potential ALC1-PAR interactions under nucleosome remodeling conditions, we developed a novel PAR footprinting assay in which we exploited the ability of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) to degrade PAR. PARG catalyzes hydrolysis of α(1″,2′) O-glycosidic linkages in PAR and can act as both an endo- and exoglycosidase (12.Miwa M. Tanaka M. Matsushima T. Sugimura T.

Structure of mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase reveals a flexible tyrosine clasp as a substrate-binding element.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PAR footprinting assays were performed as diagrammed in Fig. 3A. Bead-bound nucleosomes were incubated with PARP1 and [32P]NAD+ in the presence or absence of ALC1 for a time sufficient to allow formation of stable benzamide-resistant intermediates, and benzamide was added to block further PAR synthesis. After treatment of reaction mixtures with increasing concentrations of PARG, the beads were washed, and residual PAR associated with ALC1·PARylated PARP1·nucleosome or PARylated PARP1·nucleosome complexes was isolated and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3B, [32P]PAR chains in the PARylated PARP1·nucleosome complex were digested to near completion by PARG. In contrast, a nearly constant fraction of [32P]PAR chains in the ALC1·PARylated PARP1·nucleosome complex was resistant to digestion at all PARG concentrations used; notably, the size distribution of these protected digestion products (from ∼3 to >20 ADP-ribose units) was very similar over a 10-fold range of PARG concentrations. Whereas ALC1 carrying a mutation in its ATP-binding site behaved very similarly to the wild-type enzyme, PAR was not protected from digestion by ALC1 containing a macrodomain point mutation that prevents it from binding free PAR (Fig. 3C). These results argue that PAR binding by the ALC1 macrodomain is required for the observed PAR protection. ALC1 is an SNF2 family ATPase with a macrodomain. We and others previously demonstrated that ALC1 possesses cryptic DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activities that are activated in the presence of PARP1 and NAD+, its substrate for PAR synthesis (4.Ahel D.

Several lines of evidence argued that autoPARylation of PARP1, rather than PARylation of nucleosomal histones or ALC1, is the essential NAD+-dependent step in ALC1 activation. First, either nucleosomes or naked DNA can support PARP1- and NAD+-dependent ALC1 DNA-dependent ATPase activity, indicating that histone PARylation is not essential (6.Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Ladurner A.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Second, an intermediate that activates ALC1 and that is resistant to the PARP inhibitor benzamide can be formed by preincubation of PARP1 and NAD+ with nucleosomes or with naked DNA in the absence of ALC1 (4.Ahel D.

In this work, we have applied a combination of approaches to dissect in more detail the mechanism by which ALC1 nucleosome remodeling activity is activated by PARP1 and NAD+. In the course of our investigation, we considered two possible models for the mechanism of ALC1 activation. First, ALC1 activation might occur via a direct physical interaction between ALC1 and autoPARylated PARP1, leading to formation of a stable intermediate capable of catalyzing ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling. Alternatively, given that PARylation of PARP1 has been shown to reduce its affinity for DNA or nucleosomes (10.D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G.

NAD+-dependent modulation of chromatin structure and transcription by nucleosome binding properties of PARP-1.Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that ALC1 might be activated by a different mechanism, perhaps by interacting transiently with autoPARylated PARP1 in a way that renders ALC1 competent to bind and remodel nucleosomes. Our findings are most consistent with the model that activation of ALC1 occurs through direct and stable binding of ALC1 to autoPARylated PARP1. Our biochemical dissection of the mechanism of ALC1 activation argues that it proceeds with the formation of multiple intermediates: an initial complex of PARP1 bound to a nucleosome; a benzamide-resistant intermediate that contains nucleosome-bound PARylated PARP1; and a stable ternary intermediate that is composed of ALC1, autoPARylated PARP1, and nucleosome and that is capable of catalyzing nucleosome remodeling (Fig. 4). Importantly, the results of PAR footprinting assays argue that in the ternary intermediate, the ALC1 macrodomain is bound to PAR. Taken together with our evidence that ALC1 containing a macrodomain point mutation that abolishes its binding to PAR is inactive in nucleosome remodeling, our findings argue that PAR on PARylated PARP1 plays a unique role as an allosteric effector of ALC1 DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. Although a structure of the ALC1 macrodomain is not yet available, the structure of the macroH2A1.1 macrodomain in complex with ADP-ribose predicts that macrodomains bind at the distal ends of PAR chains and could, in principle, bind stably to polymers containing just two or three ADP-ribose units (15.Timinszky G. Till S. Hassa P.O. Hothorn M. Kustatscher G. Nijmeijer B. Colombelli J. Altmeyer M. Stelzer E.H. Scheffzek K. Hottiger M.O. Ladurner A.G. A macrodomain-containing histone rearranges chromatin upon sensing PARP1 activation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Our data suggest, however, that such short PAR chains may not be sufficient to recruit ALC1 to PARylated PARP1 and support ALC1 activation, because we observe that formation of the benzamide-resistant intermediate correlates with synthesis of PAR chains longer than ∼12–15 ADP-ribose units. In the ALC1·PARP1·nucleosome intermediates, PAR chains ranging in size from ∼3 to more than 20 ADP-ribose units are protected from endo- and exo-glycolytic digestion by PARG. Although the size of the smallest of these corresponds with what might be expected based on the model for PAR binding by macroH2A1.1, the largest are considerably longer, likely reflecting interactions between PAR and ALC1 that fall outside of the ADP-ribose binding pocket in its macrodomain and that contribute to ALC1 activation."

Here, we chemo-enzymatically synthesized various CS species with defined lengths and defined sulfate compositions, from chondroitin hexasaccharide conjugated with hexamethylenediamine at the reducing ends, using bacterial chondroitin polymerase and recombinant CS sulfotransferases, including chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1 (C4ST-1), chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase 1 (C6ST-1), N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), and uronosyl 2-sulfotransferase (UA2ST). Sequential modifications of CS with a series of CS sulfotransferases revealed their distinct features, including their substrate specificities. Reactions with chondroitin polymerase generated non-sulfated chondroitin, and those with C4ST-1 and C6ST-1 generated uniformly sulfated CS containing >95% 4S and 6S units, respectively. GalNAc4S-6ST and UA2ST generated highly sulfated CS possessing ∼90% corresponding disulfated disaccharide units. Sequential reactions with UA2ST and GalNAc4S-6ST generated further highly sulfated CS containing a mixed structure of disulfated units. Surprisingly, sequential reactions with GalNAc4S-6ST and UA2ST generated a novel CS molecule containing ∼29% trisulfated disaccharide units. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis using the CS library and natural CS products modified with biotin at the reducing ends, revealed details of the interactions of CS species with anti-CS antibodies, and with CS-binding molecules such as midkine and pleiotrophin. Chemo-enzymatic synthesis enables the generation of CS chains of the desired lengths, compositions, and distinct structures, and the resulting library will be a useful tool for studies of CS functions."

Regulation of AR homeostasis in prostate tumorigenesis has not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that p21-activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate tumorigenesis by regulating AR homeostasis. First, we demonstrated that in normal prostate epithelium, AR co-localizes with PAK6 in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus in malignant prostate. Furthermore, AR phosphorylation at Ser-578 by PAK6 promotes AR-E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) association, causing AR degradation upon androgen stimuli. We also showed that PAK6 phosphorylates Mdm2 on Thr-158 and Ser-186, which is critical for AR ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Moreover, we found that Thr-158 collaborates with Ser-186 for AR-Mdm2 association and AR ubiquitin-mediated degradation as it facilitates PAK6-mediated AR homeostasis. PAK6 knockdown promotes prostate tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, we found a strong inverse correlation between PAK6 and AR expression in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.

Androgen stimulation promotes AR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and initiates transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes associated with a distinct profile of cofactors.

As a well known negative regulator of AR, PAK6 is of great concern for the inhibition of prostate cancer growth. As a serine/threonine kinase, PAK6 was initially cloned from prostate cancer cells as an AR-interacting protein (17Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z.

PAK6 exists primarily in the cytoplasm, no matter whether AR is present or not, whereas AR down-regulation is dependent on PAK6 kinase activity but is not related to AR cofactors (25Schrantz N. da Silva Correia J.

Although PAK6 is a tumor suppressor, its expression was increased in primary and metastatic prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium (26Kaur R. Yuan X. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Increased PAK6 expression in prostate cancer and identification of PAK6 associated proteins.Prostate. 2008; 68: 1510-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, no correlation between PAK6 and AR was observed in normal prostatic tissue and prostate cancer. Understanding how PAK6 regulates AR is vital for understanding prostate tumorigenesis. In this present study, we aimed to assess how PAK6 regulates AR ubiquitin-mediated degradation through phosphorylation of AR and Mdm2 and its implication in the inhibition of prostate cancer growth in vivo. HEK293 and COS7 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The prostate cell line CWR22Rv1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 10% charcoal-stripped serum (Hyclone, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection. Cells at ∼60% confluence were transfected for 6 h and incubated with phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared following another 16 h treatment with 10 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). pcDNA-EGFP-PAK6 wild-type (WT)/K436A (KA; kinase-dead) were gifts from Dr. G. M.

Burgering (University Medical Centre Utrecht, Molecular Cancer Research, The Netherlands). AR and ARE-luc were gifts from Dr. Y. Zhao (China Medical University). His/Myc/GST-tagged PAK6 and Mdm2 were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc-HisA, pcDNA3.1-HisC (Invitrogen) and pGEX-5X-1/2 (GE Healthcare) vectors, respectively. AR/Mdm2 deletions were obtained using PCR and subcloned into pGEX-5X-2/1. Site-directed mutagenesis was generated from AR/Mdm2 WT using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PKC inhibitor (sc-3007) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz). Cycloheximide (CHX), DHT, and MG132 were from Sigma. The GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST and GST fusion proteins immobilized by GST-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with in vitro-translated protein prepared by TnT-coupled translation system (Promega). Bound proteins were incubated and washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) and stained by Ponceau or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bound proteins were then visualized by Western blot. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). Denatured proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Samples were incubated and detected with the indicated antibodies. Anti-AR, anti-prostate-specific antigen, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)/paxillin antibodies were from Neomarkers, Thermo Fisher Scientific. Anti-PAK6 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), anti-FLAG antibody was from Shanghai Genomics, Inc. (Shanghai, China), and anti-GAPDH antibody was from Shanghai KangChen (Shanghai, China). Remaining antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were washed with PBS prior to cell lysis in 500 μl of IP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were collected, washed, and incubated at 4 °C. Then, 30 μl of protein A-agarose slurry (GE Healthcare) preloaded with antibodies or normal IgG was added to equal amounts of cell extracts and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Washed precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Commercialized PAK6 kinase (Invitrogen) or immunoprecipitated synthesized PAK6 kinase was used for kinase assay in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mm DTT) added to 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol) and 2.5 μm cold ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Histone H3/H4 (Invitrogen) was used as the positive control. Ponceau staining indicated the loading amounts of GST fusion proteins. COS7 cells were transfected using plasmids with or without Myc-ubiquitin for 16 h in charcoal-stripped serum and treated with 10 nm DHT and 5 μm MG132 for 6 h. Cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and denatured with 1% SDS. AR proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-AR antibodies and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or anti-AR antibodies after stripping. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with normal goat serum. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C, washed with PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with green or red dye. DNA was stained using To-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes. Invitrogen) or DAPI (Roche Applied Science). Confocal scanning analysis was performed using a Leika/Olympus laser confocal scanning microscope. hu6-MCS-CMV-puromycin enhanced GFP-tagged vector was used to construct RNAi lentivirus system. Silence RNA sequences targeting PAK6 was produced by the GENECHEM company (Shanghai, China). shRNA PAK6 sequences is 5′-GCAGGCUAUUCCGAAGCAUTT-3′ and shRNA control sequences is 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′. Commercial control silencing/shPAK6 virus was used to infect CWR22Rv1 cells in a 12-well plate with 3 mg/ml Polybrene. Infected CWR22Rv1 cells were then subjected to sorting by enhanced GFP expression. Among our tissue specimens, 24 specimens were from the PR481 tissue microarray purchased from Alenabio Co. (Beijing, China), and 13 specimens were procured from surgical specimens of patients with prostate cancer for which complete information on clinical metastatic status was available. All human tissues were collected and used according to protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of the China Medical University Health Science Center. After antigen retrieval, specimens were subjected to normal immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. PAK6 and AR co-localization score or AR localization score were determined by intensity (0 to 3) and fraction of stained cells (0 to 4). A total score (ranging from 0 to 12) was obtained by multiplying the staining intensity and fraction scores (27Hörnberg E. Ylitalo E.B. Crnalic S. Antti H. Stattin P. Widmark A. Bergh A. Wikström P. Expression of androgen receptor splice variants in prostate cancer bone metastases is associated with castration resistance and short survival.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e19059Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 0.2 ml of CWR22Rv1 cells (2 × 106) in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was inoculated into the dorsal side of 6- to 7-week-old NOD SCID nude male mice with an average weight of 20 to 25 g. Tumor size was measured using a caliper and recorded twice a week. At the end of the treatment, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were removed, photographed, and weighed. Standard tumor was a subcutaneous nodule ≥0.5 cm. 5 × 105 shRNA control/PAK6 lentivirus-infected CWR22Rv1 cells were plated in a 12-well plate. Cell amounts in each sample was measured daily in triplicates. Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance were performed to determine the statistical significance among values for in vitro experiments. Data derived from the immunostaining analysis of human prostate tissue specimens were analyzed using the unpaired t test. Comparisons were performed using two-tailed paired t test. All continuous data are presented as the mean values ± standard error of the mean. PAK6 and AR are highly expressed in prostate cancer (2Buchanan G. Irvine R.A. Coetzee G.A. Tilley W.D.

Increased PAK6 expression in prostate cancer and identification of PAK6 associated proteins.Prostate. 2008; 68: 1510-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between PAK6 and AR in prostate and cancer tissues, 14 normal prostatic tissues and 23 prostatic adenocarcinoma samples were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. There was a remarkable co-localization of PAK6 and AR in cytoplasm in normal prostate epithelium, although no co-localization in malignant prostate was observed. AR translocated into the nucleus in malignant prostate cells (Fig. 1A). Because nutrient depletion is a common event during tumor growth and PAK6 is increased in primary and metastatic prostate cancer (26Kaur R. Yuan X. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Increased PAK6 expression in prostate cancer and identification of PAK6 associated proteins.Prostate. 2008; 68: 1510-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we treated CWR22Rv1 cells with serum starvation to mimic nutrient depletion and found that PAK6 was increased, and AR was decreased (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that nutrient deprivation induces PAK6 expression and inhibits AR expression. To further assess the relationship between PAK6 and AR, CWR22Rv1 cells were transfected with Myc-PAK6, and AR protein levels were reduced upon DHT stimulation (Fig. 1C). In this regard, PAK6 might suppress AR expression in cytoplasm. To elucidate how PAK6 negatively modulates AR, we focused on PAK6 kinase activity. Multiple lines of evidence indicate PAK6 negatively regulates AR through phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S1) (25Schrantz N. da Silva Correia J. Fowler B. Ge Q. Sun Z. Bokoch G.M. Mechanism of p21-activated kinase 6-mediated inhibition of androgen receptor signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1922-1931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PAK6 phosphorylates AR in its DNA binding domain (amino acids 505–676) (25Schrantz N. da Silva Correia J. Fowler B. Ge Q. Sun Z. Bokoch G.M. Mechanism of p21-activated kinase 6-mediated inhibition of androgen receptor signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1922-1931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST-AR deletion constructs were used to map the shorter phosphorylation domain, which is between amino acids 559 and 624 of AR, by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2A). Six candidate phosphorylation sites in this short region were chosen for single-site mutation from serine/threonine to alanine, which is resistant to phosphorylation. Further in vitro kinase assays screened out Ser-578 as a novel phosphorylation site for PAK6 (Fig. 2B). As the Ser-578 site is also a PKC phosphorylation site on the AR (11Ponguta L.A. Gregory C.W. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Site-specific androgen receptor serine phosphorylation linked to epidermal growth factor-dependent growth of castration-recurrent prostate cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20989-21001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a PKC inhibitor (sc-3007) was used in subsequent experiments to avoid nonspecific results. To test the function of PAK6-mediated AR phosphorylation, phospho-AR Ser-578 antibody was used, and its quality and availability were verified (supplemental Fig. S2). Because AR and PAK6 are highly expressed in prostate cancer, AR and PAK6 constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, which have no endogenous expression of AR and PAK6. Because AR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is the key step to initiate transcription of its downstream target genes, Western blot analysis was performed with cytoplasmic and nuclear protein separately. It was demonstrated that wild-type PAK6 (PAK6 WT) but not kinase-dead (PAK6 KA) PAK6 phosphorylated AR mainly in the cytoplasm and reduced nuclear AR translocation, leading to down-regulation of the AR downstream target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (Fig. 2C). These results were obtained upon androgen stimulation, indicating that PAK6-mediated AR regulation is androgen-dependent and that PAK6 might obstruct AR nuclear translocation. PAK6 and AR co-localization was further examined by immunofluorescence staining. DHT-induced AR was shown to be retained in the cytoplasm by PAK6 WT but not by PAK6 KA (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of AR nuclear translocation by PAK6 relied on Ser-578 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and D). Because the PAK6 kinase activity inhibitory effect on AR is triggered by DHT, the following results were obtained in the presence of androgen. It was demonstrated that pcDNA3.1-His-PAK6 localized in the cytoplasm, regardless of the presence of androgen, avoiding the obstructive effect of the GFP tag on PAK6 nuclear translocation (supplemental Fig. S3). These results reveal that PAK6 inhibits AR nuclear translocation through Ser-578 phosphorylation. Because the inhibition of androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation by PAK6 contributes to accumulation of phosphorylated AR in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C), it became very interesting to further investigate the fate of AR in the cytoplasm. The amount of AR protein levels in cells is the result of equilibrium between synthesis and degradation. By using cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis (28Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Chiao J.W. Repression of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells by phenethyl isothiocyanate.Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 2124-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), PAK6 induced a reduction in AR protein levels upon DHT stimulation (Fig. 3A). Because phosphorylation plays a crucial role in proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins, such as the cyclin E and p27Kip1 protein (29Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. SKP2 is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 30Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X.

Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of cyclin E by the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase.Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that PAK6-mediated phosphorylation regulates AR degradation. We showed that PAK6 induced a reduction of the wild-type AR (AR WT) rather than S578A mutant protein levels under DHT stimulation (Fig. 3B). To validate whether PAK6-dependent phosphorylation mediates AR proteasome-dependent degradation, we used MG132, a 26 S proteasome inhibitor (31Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Proteasome inhibitors. Valuable new tools for cell biologists.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination assay showed that PAK6 markedly enhanced AR WT but not AR S578A ubiquitination (Fig. 3C). Because PAK6 regulates AR and Estrogen Receptor (ER) (18Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. AR and ER interaction with a p21-activated kinase (PAK6).Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), CWR22Rv1 cells were used, which express only AR but not ER (32Hartel A. Didier A. Pfaffl M.W. Meyer H.H. Characterisation of gene expression patterns in 22RV1 cells for determination of environmental androgenic/antiandrogenic compounds.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stable knockdown of PAK6 by shRNA in CWR22Rv1 cells showed impairment of the endogenous ubiquitination of AR when treated with MG132 and DHT (7th lane from left, Fig. 3D). Interestingly, PAK6-mediated AR ubiquitination is androgen-dependent, indicating that PAK6 modulates endogenous ubiquitination of AR in vivo upon androgen stimulation. The above data indicate that the accumulated AR in cytoplasm was further degraded in a proteasome pathway prompted by PAK6-mediated phosphorylation of AR. E3 ligase is necessary for protein degradation, but PAK6 is not an E3 ligase. We examined several E3 ligases targeting AR for degradation, such as Mdm2 and CHIP, and Mdm2 seems effective in AR degradation. To test whether E3 ligase participation was affected by AR Ser-578 phosphorylation, we compared Mdm2 interaction with AR WT and AR S578A mutant in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4A, Mdm2 interacted strongly with AR WT but much more weakly with AR S578A mutant. This result is also validated by immunoprecipitation in vivo (Fig. 4B). Mdm2 associated stronger with AR WT than AR S578A mutant in the presence of PAK6 (Fig. 4B), indicating that PAK6-mediated phosphorylation of AR is involved in the recruitment of Mdm2 to AR and further enhances the AR-Mdm2 association. This finding led us to presume that Mdm2 may be associated with PAK6 and forms a complex with AR, thus targeting AR for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. GST pulldown assay showed that PAK6 and Mdm2 interact with each other in vitro (Fig. 4C). Immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that PAK6 associates with Mdm2 in CWR22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4D), which express endogenous PAK6, Mdm2, and AR. Because Mdm2 has been shown to interact with AR (14Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of androgen receptor by Akt require Mdm2 E3 ligase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), our results indicate that PAK6, Mdm2, and AR form a complex. Therefore, these results suggest that PAK6 associates with Mdm2 to recruit AR for its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. As PAK6 is a protein kinase and interacts with Mdm2, Mdm2 is a potential phosphorylated substrate of PAK6. The in vitro kinase assay verified this postulation and showed that amino acids 121–300 were the phosphorylation domain by PAK6 (Fig. 5, A and B). In this region, eight candidate mutants were constructed. Two novel sites in Mdm2, Thr-158 and Ser-186, were identified by in vitro kinase assay as the phosphorylation sites by PAK6 (Fig. 5C). Because PAK6-mediated AR phosphorylation was shown to enhance AR-Mdm2 interaction (Fig. 4, A and B), we postulated that PAK6 phosphorylates AR in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, PAK6 phosphorylates and recru"
https://openalex.org/W2047788639,"Control of gene transcription by glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) is important for many physiological processes. Like other steroid hormone receptors, the regulation of target genes by GR is mediated by two transactivation domains: activation function 1 (AF1) in the N-terminal domain and AF2 in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Full receptor activity requires both AF1 and -2 plus assorted coregulatory proteins. Crystal structures of the ligand-bound LBD have provided insight regarding how AF2 interacts with specific coactivators. However, despite its being the major activation domain of GRs, knowledge of AF1 structure/function has languished. This is mainly because of the highly disorganized structure of the GR N-terminal domain. This lack of AF1 structure is shared by all members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily for which it has been examined and AF1 is thought to allow productive interactions with assorted cofactors via protein-induced changes in secondary/tertiary structures. To date, there are no reports of a classical coactivator altering the secondary/tertiary structure of the GR AF1 domain. Earlier, we reported an N-terminal fragment of the p160 coactivator TIF2, called TIF2.0, that binds the GR N-terminal domain and alters GR transcriptional activity. We therefore proposed that TIF2.0 binding to AF1 changes both its conformation and transcriptional activity. We now report that TIF2.0 interacts with the GR AF1 domain to increase the amount of α-helical structure in the complex. Furthermore, TIF2 coactivator activity is observed in the absence of the GR LBD in a manner that requires the AF1 domain. This contrasts with previous models where TIF2 receptor interaction domains binding to GR LBD somehow alter AF1 conformation. Our results establish for the first time that coactivators can modify the structure of the AF1 domain directly via the binding of a second region of the coactivator and suggest a molecular explanation for how coactivators increase the transcriptional activity of GR-agonist complexes."

As predicted, the addition of heavy chains to HA cables enhanced leukocyte adhesion to these cables, but it also had several unexpected effects. (i) It produced thicker, more pronounced HA cables.

In a previous study, we tested the hypothesis that leukocyte-adhesive HA cables produced by murine airway smooth muscle (MASM) cells are substituted with HCs from IαI (17Lauer M.E. Fulop C.

The rationale for this hypothesis was that HA-HC derived from the synovial fluid of arthritis patients promoted leukocyte binding more than HA alone (4Kida D. Yoneda M. Miyaura S. Ishimaru T.

Furthermore, there was evidence that HA cables produced by human intestinal smooth muscle cells in response to poly(I:C) treatment promoted leukocyte adhesion in a HC-dependent manner (16de la Motte C.A.

Surprisingly, we were unable to find HCs attached to leukocyte-adhesive HA cable structures produced by MASM cell cultures in response to poly(I:C) and concluded that if HCs were present, they were below the limit of detection (17Lauer M.E.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the artificial addition of HCs to HA, by adding recombinant TSG-6 to the culture medium, would enhance leukocyte binding to HA cables.

MASM cell cultures were either not treated or treated with poly(I:C) (10 μg/ml; P0913, Sigma-Aldrich), recombinant human TSG-6 (0.250 μg/ml; 2104-TS, R&D Systems), or a combination of poly(I:C) and TSG-6. Endotoxin levels in the recombinant TSG-6 preparation were <1.0 enzyme unit/1 μg of protein as determined by the Limulus amebocyte lysate method (as reported by the manufacturer). Unless stated otherwise, the cells were treated for 18 h, and TSG-6 was added at the same time as poly(I:C) for the full 18 h. Unless stated otherwise, these treatments were done in DMEM/F-12 medium with 5% FBS. The treatment volume was 0.25 ml/cm2 area of tissue culture well.

U937 cells (2 million/ml, 0.5 million/cm2 of culture area) were applied to the MASM cells at 4 °C for 30 min and allowed to settle, by gravity, onto the surface of the MASM cells for 30 min, during which time they had the opportunity to come into contact with HA at the cell surface. Unbound cells were gently washed away with DMEM/F-12 medium at 4 °C. U937 cells bound to HA were then removed by the application of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (0.5 turbidity units/ml; 100740-1, Seikagaku America Inc., East Falmouth, MA) at 4 °C for 5 min. The U937 cells remaining bound to the MASM cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The U937 cells released by hyaluronidase were lysed by the addition of 10 μl Triton X-100 to each 1 ml extract and incubation at room temperature for 5 min (final concentration of 1%). Aliquots of the detergent and hyaluronidase extracts were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the cell number was quantified with a fluorometer (excitation and emission at 520 and 590 nm, respectively) by comparing the relative fluorescence intensities of extracts with a known number of CM-DiI-labeled U937 cells.

The labeled HA disaccharides were electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad mini-PROTEAN Tetra system. The gel composition consisted of 20% acrylamide (37.5:1; Bio-Rad), 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 2.5% glycerol, 10% ammonium persulfate, and 0.1% TEMED. After electrophoresis at 500 V (constant voltage) for 50 min at 4 °C, the gels were imaged in their plates on a UV transilluminator at 365 nm using a CCD camera. The HA disaccharide band was quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer® version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). All statistics (Student's t tests) were done using Excel (2011 for MAC). MASM cells were fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, air-dried for 1 h, and rehydrated in PBS for 20 min. After blocking for 30 min in PBS with 1% BSA, HA was labeled with a biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP; 5 μg/ml; 385911, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) in the blocking solution, and streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (S-11223, Invitrogen) was applied at 1:500. In some slides, CD44 was stained with the simultaneous incubation of a mouse monoclonal antibody against CD44 (1:100; C7923, Sigma-Aldrich) and HABP using an Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:250; A-21203, Invitrogen) for CD44. In some slides, antibodies against HC1 (1:50; sc-33944, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and HC2 (1:50; sc-21978, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied simultaneously with HABP using Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:250; A-11058, Invitrogen) as a secondary antibody for the anti-HC antibodies. Imaging was done by either confocal microscopy or standard fluorescence microscopy (as indicated in the figure legends). HCs were extracted from HA cables by the addition of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (10 turbidity units/ml; 40 μl/cm2 for 5 min on ice). These extracts were then transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to further remove HA from the HA-bound HCs before electrophoresis. Samples were electrophoresed on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted using a Bio-Rad nitrocellulose and Trans-Blot Turbo system. The blots were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (catalog no. 927-40000, LI-COR) and probed with the antibodies against HC1 and HC2 in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The blots were washed five times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with IRDye 800CW donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (catalog no. 926-32214, LI-COR) at 1:15,000 dilution in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% lauryl sulfate for 45 min. The blots were washed as described above and imaged on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). We used the same mouse primer sets for double-labeled HAS2, and HAS3 as reported previously (22Cheng G. Swaidani S. Sharma M. Lauer M.E. Hascall V.C. Aronica M.A. Hyaluronan deposition and correlation with inflammation in a murine ovalbumin model of asthma.Matrix Biol. 2011; 30: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We used the SYBR Green method (Invitrogen) for real-time PCR on a thermal cycler 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to GAPDH for each treatment. Linear regression of efficiency was used to model PCR amplification as described previously (23Leigh D.R. Mesiha M. Baker A.R. Walker E. Derwin K.A.

A kinetic-based sigmoidal model for the polymerase chain reaction and its application to high-capacity absolute quantitative real-time PCR.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This method uses a universal standard (λ genomic DNA) to calculate an optical calibration factor that allows for the calculation of absolute copy number of the HAS enzymes without the need for standard curves. This absolute copy number was expressed as the ratio of the absolute copy number of the HAS genes to the absolute copy number of GAPDH. We tested the hypothesis that the artificial addition of HCs to HA, by adding recombinant TSG-6 to the culture medium, would enhance leukocyte binding to HA cables. Fig. 1 (A, C, and E) shows that MASM cells treated with poly(I:C) synthesized HA cables without detectable HCs. However, when TSG-6 was added to the culture medium at the same time as poly(I:C), HC staining colocalized with HA staining (Fig. 1 B, D, and F). In parallel cultures, Streptomyces hyaluronidase was applied in serum-free medium to digest HA cables and solubilize the HCs. Western blots of the digests probed with the same anti-HC antibodies used for the confocal microscopy analyses of Fig. 1 (A and B) showed a single band slightly over 75 kDa only when TSG-6 was present (Fig. 1G). The quantification of this gel is shown in Fig. 1H. In Fig. 2, we confirmed that the MASM cells did not secrete their own HC donor (IαI and/or pre-IαI) into the conditioned medium, demonstrating that the sole source of these HC donors is the FBS in the culture medium.FIGURE 2MASM cells do not make their own HC donor. The Western blots of MASM cell-conditioned media show the absence of endogenous HC donors IαI and/or pre-IαI. Conditioned media from untreated MASM cells (lanes 2–4) and cells treated with poly(I:C) + TSG-6 (lanes 5–7) for 12 h were compared with unconditioned medium alone (M; lane 8) or an aliquot of mouse serum (lanes 9 and 10) as a positive control. Some samples were treated with chondroitinase ABC (c′ABC; lanes 3, 6, and 10) to release free HCs from IαI and/or pre-IαI (shown as a single 83-kDa band in lane 10). Other samples were incubated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (HAase); lanes 4 and 7 to release free HCs from high molecular mass HA-HC that may have been in the conditioned media (which was not observed). The blot was probed with the simultaneous incubation of antibodies against the HC1 and HC2 isotypes. These antibodies are species-specific for only mouse HCs and do not cross-react with the HC epitopes of bovine origin (as supplied by FBS in the medium). Thus, IαI and/or pre-IαI from FBS is truly present in lanes 2–8, but the antibodies are unable to detect it. This is different from the situation in Fig. 1, where the culture medium was supplemented with mouse serum as the IαI source instead of FBS, which was used throughout the rest of this work.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, in addition to transferring HCs to HA cables (Fig. 1), TSG-6 also greatly enhanced the thickness and possibly the number of the cables when added with poly(I:C) but had no effect beyond that of the untreated control when added in the absence of poly(I:C) (Fig. 3). This also demonstrates the lack of possible proinflammatory cytotoxins in our TSG-6 preparation that could influence HA synthesis. As expected, the addition of HCs to HA cables, by adding recombinant TSG-6 with poly(I:C) to the culture medium of MASM cells, significantly increased the number of leukocytes that bound to the HA cables (Fig. 4). Whereas poly(I:C) induced the formation of single HA cables that were leukocyte-adhesive (Fig. 4, D–F), the addition of TSG-6 promoted leukocyte adhesion to the extent that the appearance was more sheet-like than cable-like (Fig. 4, G–I). This was more likely because TSG-6 promoted a greater HA cable density in a given area rather than promoting the actual formation of HA sheet structures. TSG-6 enhanced leukocyte binding by 41% (p < 0.0001) compared with poly(I:C) alone (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Quantification of leukocytes bound to HA cables formed in the presence of TSG-6. MASM cells were either not treated (NT) or treated with only recombinant TSG-6, poly(I:C), or the simultaneous incubation of poly(I:C) + TSG-6 for 18 h. U937 monocytic cells were labeled with CM-DiI and applied to the MASM cells for 30 min at 4 °C, gently washing away unbound cells in 4 °C medium. Streptomyces hyaluronidase was added to the cultures in 4 °C medium for 5 min to release U937 cells bound to HA cables. The number of U937 cells remaining bound to the MASM cells with or without hyaluronidase treatment was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”( n = 16). Error bars represent S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although a TSG-6-mediated increase in leukocyte adhesion to HA cables was expected, we were surprised to find that TSG-6 also stimulated HA synthesis by MASM cells (Fig. 6). Induction of HA synthesis by poly(I:C) was observable in the cell layer 4 h after its addition to the culture medium, peaking at 18 h (Fig. 6A). The addition of recombinant TSG-6 to the culture medium demonstrated similar kinetics and also a greatly increased HA synthesis over poly(I:C) treatment alone (3.58-fold increase at 18 h; p = 0.0013). By 24 h, the amount of HA in the cell layer was significantly reduced (65% for poly(I:C) alone and 58% for poly(I:C) + TSG-6; p = 0.018 and 0.0034, respectively), indicating significantly increased catabolism and decreased synthesis after 18 h. Cultures that were not treated or treated only with TSG-6 showed similar kinetics but at much lower levels. Although poly(I:C) induced HA synthesis in the cell layer, it did not induce the accumulation of HA in the conditioned medium beyond the levels for untreated cells and for cells treated with TSG-6 alone (Fig. 6B). In these cultures, the HA concentrations in the media steadily increased, peaking at 18 h, and diminished by 24 h, similar to HA kinetics in the cell layers. In contrast, when TSG-6 was added with poly(I:C), the amount of HA in the conditioned medium was significantly lower than in the other treatment groups and was not decreased at 24 h, possibly because the cells were preoccupied with removing the much larger amounts of HA present in the cell layer of these cultures compared with the amount of HA synthesis induced by the other treatments. Although this decrease in HA in the medium could contribute to the increase in the cell layer for the combined TSG-6 and poly(I:C) cultures, the amount in the medium at 18 h (0.01 μg) was very small compared with the amount in the cell layer (0.25 μg). Because TSG-6 increased HA synthesis in combination with poly(I:C), we tested the hypothesis that this induction was by increased transcription of the HAS enzymes (Fig. 7). Real-time PCR showed a respective 6.51- and 1.79-fold 4 h induction of HAS1 and HAS2 mRNA levels by poly(I:C) treatment (p < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 7, A and B), but the addition of TSG-6 did not have an additive effect. In contrast, HAS3 mRNA levels actually decreased by 58% upon treatment with TSG-6 alone and by 63% with poly(I:C) alone (Fig. 7C). This decrease in HAS3 mRNA levels was additive when TSG-6 was combined with poly(I:C), giving a further 57% decrease compared with poly(I:C) alone. Using the linear regression of efficiency method to model PCR amplification (23Leigh D.R. Mesiha M. Baker A.R. Walker E. Derwin K.A.

These data demonstrate that the amplification of poly(I:C)-induced HA synthesis by TSG-6 does not occur by increased transcription of the HAS genes and also demonstrate that HAS3 is not likely to be one of the enzymes mediating this process.

https://openalex.org/W2021812886,"TAF15 (formerly TAFII68) is a member of the FET (FUS, EWS, TAF15) family of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins whose genes are frequently translocated in sarcomas. By performing global gene expression profiling, we found that TAF15 knockdown affects the expression of a large subset of genes, of which a significant percentage is involved in cell cycle and cell death. In agreement, TAF15 depletion had a growth-inhibitory effect and resulted in increased apoptosis. Among the TAF15-regulated genes, targets of microRNAs (miRNAs) generated from the onco-miR-17 locus were overrepresented, with CDKN1A/p21 being the top miRNAs-targeted gene. Interestingly, the levels of onco-miR-17 locus coded miRNAs (miR-17-5p and miR-20a) were decreased upon TAF15 depletion and shown to affect the post-transcriptional regulation of TAF15-dependent genes, such as CDKN1A/p21. Thus, our results demonstrate that TAF15 is required to regulate gene expression of cell cycle regulatory genes post-transcriptionally through a pathway involving miRNAs. The findings that high TAF15 levels are needed for rapid cellular proliferation and that endogenous TAF15 levels decrease during differentiation strongly suggest that TAF15 is a key regulator of maintaining a highly proliferative rate of cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2058471388,"Bradykinin is not only important for inflammation and blood pressure regulation, but also involved in neuromodulation and neuroprotection. Here we describe novel functions for bradykinin and the kinin-B2 receptor (B2BkR) in differentiation of neural stem cells. In the presence of the B2BkR antagonist HOE-140 during rat neurosphere differentiation, neuron-specific β3-tubulin and enolase expression was reduced together with an increase in glial protein expression, indicating that bradykinin-induced receptor activity contributes to neurogenesis. In agreement, HOE-140 affected in the same way expression levels of neural markers during neural differentiation of murine P19 and human iPS cells. Kinin-B1 receptor agonists and antagonists did not affect expression levels of neural markers, suggesting that bradykinin-mediated effects are exclusively mediated via B2BkR. Neurogenesis was augmented by bradykinin in the middle and late stages of the differentiation process. Chronic treatment with HOE-140 diminished eNOS and nNOS as well as M1-M4 muscarinic receptor expression and also affected purinergic receptor expression and activity. Neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and neural migration were altered during differentiation of neurospheres isolated from B2BkR knock-out mice. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed the presence of B2BkR mRNA throughout the nervous system in mouse embryos, and less β3-tubulin and more glial proteins were expressed in developing and adult B2BkR knock-out mice brains. As a underlying transcriptional mechanism for neural fate determination, HOE-140 induced up-regulation of Notch1 and Stat3 gene expression. Because pharmacological treatments did not affect cell viability and proliferation, we conclude that bradykinin-induced signaling provides a switch for neural fate determination and specification of neurotransmitter receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1997252922,"The metabolism of the storage polysaccharides glycogen and starch is of vital importance to organisms from all domains of life. In bacteria, utilization of these α-glucans requires the concerted action of a variety of enzymes, including glycoside hydrolases, glycoside phosphorylases, and transglycosylases. In particular, transglycosylases from glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) and GH77 play well established roles in α-glucan side chain (de)branching, regulation of oligo- and polysaccharide chain length, and formation of cyclic dextrans. Here, we present the biochemical and tertiary structural characterization of a new type of bacterial 1,4-α-glucan 4-α-glucosyltransferase from GH31. Distinct from 1,4-α-glucan 6-α-glucosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.24) and 4-α-glucanotransferases (EC 2.4.1.25), this enzyme strictly transferred one glucosyl residue from α(1→4)-glucans in disproportionation reactions. Substrate hydrolysis was undetectable for a series of malto-oligosaccharides except maltose for which transglycosylation nonetheless dominated across a range of substrate concentrations. Crystallographic analysis of the enzyme in free, acarbose-complexed, and trapped 5-fluoro-β-glucosyl-enzyme intermediate forms revealed extended substrate interactions across one negative and up to three positive subsites, thus providing structural rationalization for the unique, single monosaccharide transferase activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2129867927,"Signal peptide peptidase (SPP), its homologs, the SPP-like proteases SPPL2a/b/c and SPPL3, as well as presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex, are intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases of the GxGD type. In this study, we identified the 18-kDa leader peptide (LP18) of the foamy virus envelope protein (FVenv) as a new substrate for intramembrane proteolysis by human SPPL3 and SPPL2a/b. In contrast to SPPL2a/b and γ-secretase, which require substrates with an ectodomain shorter than 60 amino acids for efficient intramembrane proteolysis, SPPL3 cleaves mutant FVenv lacking the proprotein convertase cleavage site necessary for the prior shedding. Moreover, the cleavage product of FVenv generated by SPPL3 serves as a new substrate for consecutive intramembrane cleavage by SPPL2a/b. Thus, human SPPL3 is the first GxGD-type aspartyl protease shown to be capable of acting like a sheddase, similar to members of the rhomboid family, which belong to the class of intramembrane-cleaving serine proteases."

https://openalex.org/W2058777736,"Focal adhesion turnover is a complex process required for cell migration. We have previously shown that the Ste20-like kinase (SLK) is required for cell migration and efficient focal adhesion (FA) turnover in a FA kinase (FAK)-dependent manner. However, the role of SLK in this process remains unclear. Using a candidate substrate approach, we show that SLK phosphorylates the adhesion adapter protein paxillin on serine 250. Serine 250 phosphorylation is required for paxillin redistribution and cell motility. Mutation of paxillin serine 250 prevents its phosphorylation by SLK in vitro and results in impaired migration in vivo as evidenced by an accumulation of phospho-FAK-Tyr397 and altered FA turnover rates. Together, our data suggest that SLK phosphorylation of paxillin on serine 250 is required for FAK-dependent FA dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2117918205,"The interaction between α2β1 integrin (GPIa/IIa, VLA-2) and vascular collagen is one of the initiating events in thrombus formation. Here, we describe two structurally similar sulfonamide derivatives, BTT-3033 and BTT-3034, and show that, under static conditions, they have an almost identical effect on α2-expressing CHO cell adhesion to collagen I, but only BTT-3033 blocks platelet attachment under flow (90 dynes/cm(2)). Differential scanning fluorimetry showed that both molecules bind to the α2I domain of the recombinant α2 subunit. To further study integrin binding mechanism(s) of the two sulfonamides, we created an α2 Y285F mutant containing a substitution near the metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif in the α2I domain. The action of BTT-3033, unlike that of BTT-3034, was dependent on Tyr-285. In static conditions BTT-3034, but not BTT-3033, inhibited collagen binding by an α2 variant carrying a conformationally activating E318W mutation. Conversely, in under flow conditions (90 dynes/cm(2)) BTT-3033, but not BTT-3034, inhibited collagen binding by an α2 variant expressing E336A loss-of-function mutation. Thus, the binding sites for BTT-3033 and BTT-3034 are differentially available in distinct integrin conformations. Therefore, these sulfonamides can be used to study the biological role of different functional stages of α2β1. Furthermore, only the inhibitor that recognized the non-activated conformation of α2β1 integrin under shear stress conditions effectively blocked platelet adhesion, suggesting that the initial interaction between integrin and collagen takes place prior to receptor activation."

This activity is conserved in the second PHD finger of MLL4, the closest homolog to MLL1 but not in MLL2 or MLL3.

https://openalex.org/W2013644920,"Signaling via growth factor receptors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, is key to various cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell survival, and cell migration. In a variety of human diseases such as cancer, aberrant expression and activation of growth factor receptors can lead to disturbed signaling. Intracellular trafficking is crucial for proper signaling of growth factor receptors. As a result, the level of cell surface expression of growth factor receptors is an important determinant for the outcome of downstream signaling. BAR domain-containing proteins represent an important family of proteins that regulate membrane dynamics. In this study, we identify a novel role for the F-BAR protein PACSIN2 in the regulation of EGF receptor signaling. We show that internalized EGF as well as the (activated) EGF receptor translocated to PACSIN2-positive endosomes. Furthermore, loss of PACSIN2 increased plasma membrane expression of the EGF receptor in resting cells and increased EGF-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. As a consequence, EGF-induced activation of Erk and Akt as well as cell proliferation were enhanced in PACSIN2-depleted cells. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel role for the F-BAR-domain protein PACSIN2 in regulating EGF receptor surface levels and EGF-induced downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2030700229,"Inside-out activation of integrins is mediated via the binding of talin and kindlin to integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tails. The kindlin FERM domain is interrupted by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain within its F2 subdomain. Here, we present data confirming the importance of the kindlin-1 PH domain for integrin activation and its x-ray crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å revealing a C-terminal second α-helix integral to the domain but found only in the kindlin protein family. An isoform-specific salt bridge occludes the canonical phosphoinositide binding site, but molecular dynamics simulations display transient switching to an alternative open conformer. Molecular docking reveals that the opening of the pocket would enable potential ligands to bind within it. Although lipid overlay assays suggested the PH domain binds inositol monophosphates, surface plasmon resonance demonstrated weak affinities for inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(3,4,5)P(3); K(D) ∼100 μM) and no monophosphate binding. Removing the salt bridge by site-directed mutagenesis increases the PH domain affinity for Ins(3,4,5)P(3) as measured by surface plasmon resonance and enables it to bind PtdIns(3,5)P(2) on a dot-blot. Structural comparison with other PH domains suggests that the phosphate binding pocket in the kindlin-1 PH domain is more occluded than in kindlins-2 and -3 due to its salt bridge. In addition, the apparent affinity for Ins(3,4,5)P(3) is affected by the presence of PO(4) ions in the buffer. We suggest the physiological ligand of the kindlin-1 PH domain is most likely not an inositol phosphate but another phosphorylated species."

Here, we assessed whether γ-synuclein shares the ability of α-synuclein to bind synaptic vesicles and ameliorate neurodegeneration caused by CSPα deficiency in vivo. Although the N-terminal lipid-binding domains of the two synucleins showed similar affinity for purified synaptic vesicles, the C-terminal domain of γ-synuclein was not able to interact with synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2. Consequently, overexpression of γ-synuclein did not have any noticeable effect on the phenotype of CSPα null mutant mice.

Although the N-terminal lipid-binding domains of the two synucleins showed similar affinity for purified synaptic vesicles, the C-terminal domain of γ-synuclein was not able to interact with synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2. Consequently, overexpression of γ-synuclein did not have any noticeable effect on the phenotype of CSPα null mutant mice. Our data suggest that the functions of α- and γ-synucleins in presynaptic terminals are not fully redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2052524483,"Myocilin is a protein found in the trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix tissue of the eye that plays a role in regulating intraocular pressure. Both wild-type and certain myocilin variants containing mutations in the olfactomedin (OLF) domain are linked to the optic neuropathy glaucoma. Because calcium ions are important biological cofactors that play numerous roles in extracellular matrix proteins, we examined the calcium binding properties of the myocilin OLF domain (myoc-OLF). Our study reveals an unprecedented high affinity calcium binding site within myoc-OLF. The calcium ion remains bound to wild-type OLF at neutral and acidic pH. A glaucoma-causing OLF variant, myoc-OLF(D380A), is calcium-depleted. Key differences in secondary and tertiary structure between myoc-OLF(D380A) and wild-type myoc-OLF, as well as limited access to chelators, indicate that the calcium binding site is largely buried in the interior of the protein. Analysis of six conserved aspartate or glutamate residues and an additional 18 disease-causing variants revealed two other candidate residues that may be involved in calcium coordination. Our finding expands our knowledge of calcium binding in extracellular matrix proteins; provides new clues into domain structure, function, and pathogenesis for myocilin; and offers insights into highly conserved, biomedically relevant OLF domains."
https://openalex.org/W2036222981,"ΔNp63 is a transcription factor that is critical for the development of stratified epithelia and is overexpressed or amplified in >80% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We identified the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase PIR2/Rnf144b as a direct transcriptional target of ΔNp63α and showed that its expression parallels that of ΔNp63α in keratinocytes, SCC cell lines and SCCs. We used primary keratinocytes as a model system to investigate the function of PIR2/Rnf144b in stratified epithelia. Depletion of PIR2/Rnf144b severely impaired keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, associated with accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1; a known target of PIR2/Rnf144b. More importantly, we found that PIR2/Rnf144b binds and mediates proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α, generating a hitherto unknown auto-regulatory feedback loop. These findings substantiate PIR2/Rnf144b as a potentially critical component of epithelial homeostasis, acting downstream of ΔNp63α to regulate cellular levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and ΔNp63α."

https://openalex.org/W2091453599,"The accurate replication of genetic information is critical to maintaining chromosomal integrity. Cdc6 functions in the assembly of pre-replicative complexes and is specifically required to load the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase complex at replication origins. Cdc6 is targeted for protein degradation by multiple mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although only a single pathway and E3 ubiquitin ligase for Cdc6 has been identified, the SCF(Cdc4) (Skp1/Cdc53/F-box protein) complex. Notably, Cdc6 is unstable during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, but the ubiquitination pathway has not been previously identified. Using a genetic approach, we identified two additional E3 ubiquitin ligase components required for Cdc6 degradation, the F-box protein Dia2 and the Hect domain E3 Tom1. Both Dia2 and Tom1 control Cdc6 turnover during G(1) phase of the cell cycle and act separately from SCF(Cdc4). Ubiquitination of Cdc6 is significantly reduced in dia2Δ and tom1Δ cells. Tom1 and Dia2 each independently immunoprecipitate Cdc6, binding to a C-terminal region of the protein. Tom1 and Dia2 cannot compensate for each other in Cdc6 degradation. Cdc6 and Mcm4 chromatin association is aberrant in tom1Δ and dia2Δ cells in G(1) phase. Together, these results present evidence for a novel degradation pathway that controls Cdc6 turnover in G(1) that may regulate pre-replicative complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1988364150,"More than 50% of adults and ∼20% of children with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse following treatment. Dismal outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory disease mandate novel approaches to therapy. We have previously shown that the combination of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine increases the survival of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immuno-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice bearing human ALL xenografts. We have also shown that 16 μM RAD001 synergized with agents that cause DNA damage or microtubule disruption in pre-B ALL cells in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that RAD001 has dose-dependent effects on the cell cycle in ALL cells, with 1.5 μM RAD001 inhibiting pRb, Ki67 and PCNA expression and increasing G0/1 cell cycle arrest, whereas 16 μM RAD001 increases pRb, cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA, with no evidence of an accumulation of cells in G0/1. Transition from G2 into mitosis was promoted by 16 μM RAD001 with reduced phosphorylation of cdc2 in cells with 4 N DNA content. However, 16 μM RAD001 preferentially induced cell death in cells undergoing mitosis. When combined with vincristine, 16 μM RAD001 reduced the vincristine-induced accumulation of cells in mitosis, probably as a result of increased death in this population. Although 16 μM RAD001 weakly activated Chk1 and Chk2, it suppressed strong vincristine-induced activation of these cell cycle checkpoint regulators. We conclude that RAD001 enhances chemosensitivity at least in part through suppression of cell cycle checkpoint regulation in response to vincristine and increased progression from G2 into mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2044477449,"Precise mapping and unraveling the mechanism of interaction or degradation of a certain type of collagen triple helix requires the generation of short and stable collagenous fragments. This is a great challenge especially for hetero-trimeric collagens, where chain composition and register (stagger) are important factors. No system has been reported that can be efficiently used to generate a natural collagenous fragment with exact chain composition and desired chain register. The NC2 domain (only 35–50 residues) of FACIT collagens is a potent trimerization domain. In the case of type IX collagen it provides the efficient selection and hetero-trimerization of three distinct chains. The ability of the NC2 domain to determine the chain register of the triple helix is studied. We generated three possible sequence combinations (α1α1α2, α1α2α1, α2α1α1) of a type I collagen fragment (the binding region for the von Willebrand factor A3 domain) attached to the NC2 domain. In addition, two control combinations were produced that constitute homo-trimers of (α1)3 or (α2)3. For the hetero-trimeric constructs, α1α1α2 demonstrated a higher melting temperature than the other two. Binding experiments with the von Willebrand factor A3 domain revealed the homo-trimer of (α1)3 as the strongest binding construct, whereas the homo-trimer of (α2)3 showed no binding. For hetero-trimers, α1α1α2 was found to be the strongest binding construct. Differences in thermal stability and binding to the A3 domain unambiguously demonstrate that the NC2 domain of type IX collagen determines not only the chain composition but also the chain register of the adjacent triple helix.

https://openalex.org/W2034613587,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of Aβ, which is generated from the amyloid precursor protein through its cleavage by β- and γ-secretases. The γ-secretase complex component nicastrin (NCT) plays significant roles in the assembly and proper trafficking of the γ-secretase complex and in the recognition of amyloid precursor protein. NCT is incorporated into the γ-secretase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and glycosylated in the Golgi. In contrast, unassembled NCT is retrieved or retained in the ER by the protein Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (Rer1). We reported previously that synoviolin (Syvn), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, degrades NCT and affects the generation of Aβ. Here, we examined in more detail the effect of Syvn on the generation of Aβ. We found that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Syvn (C307A mutant) and a Syvn-RNAi decreased the generation of Aβ. These results indicate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Syvn up-regulates the generation of Aβ. We hypothesized, therefore, that Syvn regulates the assembly or localization of the γ-secretase complex by ubiquitinating Rer1, resulting in its subsequent degradation. Our findings that the level of Rer1 was increased in Syvn knockout fibroblasts because of inhibition of its degradation support this hypothesis. Moreover, we found that Rer1 interacts with Syvn in the ER, is ubiquitinated by Syvn, and is then degraded via the proteasome or lysosomal pathways. Finally, we showed that localization of mature NCT to the plasma membrane as well as γ-secretase complex levels are decreased in fibroblasts of Syvn knockout mice. Thus, it is likely that Syvn regulates the assembly of the γ-secretase complex via the degradation of Rer1, which results in the generation of Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2017301597,"The notochord is an important organ involved in embryonic patterning and locomotion. In zebrafish, the mature notochord consists of a single stack of fully differentiated, large vacuolated cells called chordocytes, surrounded by a single layer of less differentiated notochordal epithelial cells called chordoblasts. Through genetic analysis of zebrafish lines carrying pseudo-typed retroviral insertions, a mutant exhibiting a defective notochord with a granular appearance was isolated, and the corresponding gene was identified as ngs (notochord granular surface), which was specifically expressed in the notochord. In the mutants, the notochord started to degenerate from 32 hours post-fertilization, and the chordocytes were then gradually replaced by smaller cells derived from chordoblasts. The granular notochord phenotype was alleviated by anesthetizing the mutant embryos with tricaine to prevent muscle contraction and locomotion. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ngs encodes a new type of intermediate filament (IF) family protein, which we named chordostatin based on its function. Under the transmission electron microcopy, bundles of 10-nm-thick IF-like filaments were enriched in the chordocytes of wild-type zebrafish embryos, whereas the chordocytes in ngs mutants lacked IF-like structures. Furthermore, chordostatin-enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion protein assembled into a filamentous network specifically in chordocytes. Taken together, our work demonstrates that ngs encodes a novel type of IF protein and functions to maintain notochord integrity for larval development and locomotion. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms of notochord structural maintenance, as well as the evolution and biological function of IF family proteins."
