Previous studies suggested this negative regulation is a consequence of Keap1 controlling the subcellular distribution of Nrf2. We now report that Keap1 also controls the total cellular level of Nrf2 protein. In the RL34 non-transformed rat liver cell line, Nrf2 was found to accumulate rapidly in response to oxidative stress caused by treatment with sulforaphane, and the accumulation resulted from inhibition of proteasomal-mediated degradation of the bZIP protein. By heterologously expressing in COS1 cells epitope-tagged Nrf2 and an Nrf2ΔETGE mutant lacking the Keap1-binding site, in both the presence and absence of Keap1 we demonstrate that Nrf2 is subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation independently of both Keap1 and the redox environment of the cell. In oxidatively stressed cells, this is the sole mechanism responsible for Nrf2 degradation. However, under homeostatic conditions Nrf2 is subject to a substantially more rapid mode of proteasomal degradation than it is in oxidatively stressed cells, and this rapid turnover of Nrf2 requires it to interact with Keap1. Within Nrf2, the N-terminal Neh2 domain is identified as the redox-sensitive degron. These data suggest that Keap1 negatively regulates Nrf2 by both enhancing its rate of proteasomal degradation and altering its subcellular distribution.

Under homeostatic conditions, cells maintain their redox environment at a higher reducing potential than their surroundings (1Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3616) Google Scholar). This is essential for correct biological function, and changes in the redox environment of the cell toward a more oxidized potential is referred to as oxidative stress. This can arise from exposure to pro-oxidant phytochemicals such as isothiocyanates, which react with GSH, and quinones, which can decouple mitochondrial electron transfer reactions, generating the superoxide anion (2Cadenas E. (Ahmad S. Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defenses in Biology. Chapman & Hall, New York1995: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar, 3Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Puga A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 67-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Regardless of the source, oxidative stress, if prolonged, results in perturbation of cellular biochemistry and aberrant covalent modification of macromolecules, leading to tissue damage and DNA mutations. Being disteleological, cells sense oxidative stress and respond by transcriptionally up-regulating numerous cytoprotective genes. These encode proteins with a variety of functions. For example, glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, glutathione reductase, malic enzyme 1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin MSP23, heme oxygenase 1, and the cystine/glutamate exchange transport system (4Inamdar N.M.

Genes encoding DNA damage repair enzymes might also be induced (8Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, in response to oxidants, the cell alters its biochemistry in many ways to reduce the potential for further oxidative stress, restore its redox balance, and repair damage accumulated during the stress. The antioxidant response element (ARE), a cis-acting element present in the promoters of many of the genes encoding the proteins listed above, provides a mechanism to explain their coordinated transcriptional regulation (for review, see Ref. 13Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Nrf2, a member of the “cnc” subfamily of bZIP transcription factors (for review, see Ref. 14Motohashi H. O'Connor T. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), is an essential transactivator of genes containing an ARE, as evidenced by the marked impairment in the expression of genes encoding a number of detoxication enzymes and GSH biosynthetic enzymes in the liver and gastrointestinal tract of nrf2–/– mice (11McMahon M.

Nrf2 is highly conserved from mammalian species to chicken and Zebra fish, particularly within six regions designated the Neh1–6 (Nrf2-ECH homology) domains (17Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The Neh1 domain contains the cnc-bZIP region, which dictates dimerization partners and confers DNA binding specificity. The Neh4 and Neh5 domains act cooperatively to bind the coactivator CREB-binding protein, thereby activating transcription (18Katoh Y. Itoh K. Yoshida E. Miyagashi M. Fukamizu A. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the N-terminal region of ∼100 amino acids, called the Neh2 domain, which negatively regulates Nrf2 function under homeostatic conditions (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar) by mechanisms that are not fully understood. The negative regulation of Nrf2 requires the interaction of the Neh2 domain with an actin-bound cytosolic protein, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). This appears to be a direct interaction as bacterially expressed and purified mKeap1 interacts in vitro with the Neh2 domain of mNrf2 (20Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). A tetrapeptide motif, ETGE, that resides close to the C-terminal boundary of Neh2 is critical for this phylogenetically conserved interaction (17Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Itoh et al. (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar) proposed that Keap1 negatively regulates Nrf2 function by controlling its subcellular localization. According to this model, Keap1 sequesters the bZIP protein in the cytoplasm under homeostatic conditions, leading to low expression of ARE-driven genes. During oxidative stress, a signal that involves phosphorylation and/or redox modification is transduced to the Keap1·Nrf2 complex (19Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar, 20Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), leading to its disruption and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. The increased level of nuclear Nrf2 results in enhanced occupancy of ARE enhancers by Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers, recruitment of CREB-binding protein, and transactivation of cytoprotective genes (18Katoh Y. Itoh K. Yoshida E. Miyagashi M. Fukamizu A. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A drawback of this model is that it does not account for the apparent accumulation of total cellular Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress (22Kwak M.-K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kwak M.-K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen T.

Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2396-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Two research groups demonstrated that the accumulation of Nrf2 results from inhibition of its degradation by the 26 S proteasome (24Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.-C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 25Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2396-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), a feature common to many transcription factors including p53, c-Myc, c-Jun, and β-catenin (26Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6829) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that endogenous Nrf2 is subject to 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation and that its rate of degradation depends upon the redox environment of the cell. Importantly, we demonstrate that although Nrf2 is constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, a direct interaction between the transcription factor and Keap1 confers redox sensitivity upon its half-life. Thus, under homeostatic conditions, Keap1 interacts with Nrf2 and increases its rate of proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to a reduction in the cellular levels of the bZIP protein. Oxidative stress, by antagonizing this interaction, stabilizes Nrf2, leading to its rapid accumulation within the cell. We identify the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 as the redox-sensitive degron. Mouse Nrf2-expressing Plasmids—pcDNA3.1/V5HisBmNrf2 was generated by PCR amplification of the murine Nrf2 coding sequence and 50 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region (27Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) using the primer pair 5′-CACAGCGTCCGCCCTCAGCATG-3′ and 5′-GTTTTTCTTTGTATCTGGCTTCTTGC-3′. The product was ligated into EcoRV-digested pcDNA3.1/V5HisB (Invitrogen), allowing expression of mNrf2-V5-his fusion protein from a CMV promoter. The pcDNA3.1/V5mNrf2, encoding mNrf2-V5, was generated from pcDNA3.1/V5HisBmNrf2 by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5′-GATTCTACGCGTACCGGTTAGCATCATCACCATCACCATTG-3′. Expression vectors pcDNA-3.1/V5HisBmNrf2ΔETGE and pcDNA3.1/V5mNrf2ΔETGE for mutant Nrf2, which lacks the ETGE tetrapeptide motif between residues 79 and 82 required for interaction with Keap1, were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5′-TTTTCGCTCAGTTTCAACTGGATGAATTCCTCCCAATTCAGCCGGCCC-3′. The pET15bmNrf2 plasmid encoding a hexahistidine-mNrf2 fusion protein was generated by PCR amplification of the mNrf2 coding sequence with the primer pair 5′-CCGCCCTCCATATGATGGACTTGGA-3′ and 5′-CTAAGAAATTAACTCGAGAGTTAAA-3′. The product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET15b (Novagen). The pCG-GAL-(HA)mNeh2 plasmid, which expresses a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GAL4 DNA binding domain-mNeh2 fusion protein from a CMV promoter, was generated by PCR-amplification of the mNeh2 coding sequence (defined as the first 96 amino acids) using the primer pair 5′-CCTACCACAGCGTCCGCCTCTAGAATGATGGACTTGGAGTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGAGTAGCTGGCGGATCCTCAGGTGTCTGTCTGGATATGCTG-3′. The resulting product was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into similarly digested pCG-GAL(HA) (Ref. 28Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. William P. Tansey, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY). The pCG-GAL(HA)mNeh2ΔETGE vector was generated in an identical fashion, but a template expressing mNrf2ΔETGE was utilized for the PCR reaction. Mouse Keap1-expressing Plasmids—A mKeap1 cDNA was generated by splice-overlap-extension of the PCR products amplified from two IMAGE consortium clones (315799, 5′-AGGCCCCTAACGGCTAGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTATAGCAGCCCACCC-3′; 988252, 5′-ACGCTGCACAAGCCCACG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGTCAGTGCTCAGG-3′). The splice-overlap-extension product was cloned into pCRBlunt (Invitrogen) to generate pCRBluntmKeap1. The mKeap1 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from this template using two primers, 5′-TATGCAGCCCGAACCCAAGCTT-3′ and 5′-ATGCAGGTACAGTTTTGTTGATC-3′, and cloned into EcoRV-digested pcDNA3.1/V5HisC to generate pcDNA3.1/V5HisCmKeap1, which expresses a mKeap1-V5-his fusion protein. The pcDNA-3.1/mKeap1 plasmid was generated from pcDNA3.1/V5HisCmKeap1 by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5′-CAAAACTGTACCTGCTGAATATCCAGCACAGTG-3′; this encodes mKeap1.

Pickett (Schering Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) and have been described previously (29Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCMVβ-gal (Clontech) expresses β-galactosidase under the control of a CMV promoter. pHisUb, which expresses hexahistidine-tagged octameric ubiquitin precursor protein from a CMV promoter (30Treier M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), was provided by Prof. David P. Lane (University of Dundee). Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the GeneEditor kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were sequence-verified. The pET15bmNrf2 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)RIL (Novagen) and selected on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. One colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The next morning it was diluted 1:200 into 200 ml of LB broth containing 500 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.4. Thereafter, the bacteria were harvested, and hexahistidine-mNrf2 was induced by resuspension in 200 ml of LB broth containing 500 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, harvested, washed once with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, and resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Bacteria were lysed by the addition of 1 mg of lysozyme followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The lysate was flash-frozen, thawed by adding 20 ml of pre-warmed binding buffer, sonicated to reduce viscosity, and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was sterile-filtered and applied to a 1-ml pre-charged Hi-Trap® Ni-chelate column (Amersham Biosciences). Hexahistidine-mNrf2 was eluted from the column in binding buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and flash-frozen and stored at –70 °C. Both the RL34 non-transformed rat liver epithelial cell line (31Moramitsu Y. Nakagawa Y. Hayashi K. Fujii H. Kumagai T. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. Horio F. Itoh K. Iida K. Yamamoto M. Uchida K. J. Biol.

Cells were seeded into either 6-well plates or 60-mm tissue culture dishes at least 18 h before transfection and were either 50% (RL34) or 90% (COS1) confluent at the time of transfection. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As an internal control, pCMVβ-gal was included in all transfections. Cells were chemically challenged not less than 40 h after plating. Sulforaphane (Sul) was obtained from LKT laboratories. Cycloheximide (CHX) was obtained from Sigma. Epoxomicin, clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone, and MG132 were obtained from Calbiochem. The β-galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter assays were carried out as previously described (32Bonneson C. Eggleston I.M. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6120-6130PubMed Google Scholar). During this study, a rabbit anti-mNrf2 antiserum was generated by immunization of a female New Zealand White rabbit with bacterially expressed hexahistidine-mNrf2 protein and was used at a dilution of 1:4000. Other antibodies were used at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-rNQO1, 1:3,000 (10Kelly V.P. Ellis E.M. Manson M.M. Chanas S.A. Moffat G.J. McLeod R. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D.

Paine, University of Dundee); mouse anti-V5, 1:2000 (Invitrogen); mouse anti-HA, clone 12CA5, 0.4 μg/ml (Roche Applied Science). For immunoblots, whole-cell lysates were prepared by scraping cell monolayers into ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Nuclear and 1000 × g supernatant fractions were prepared as follows. Monolayers in 60-mm dishes were trypsinized, and the cell suspension was washed with 3 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by repeated centrifugation (500 × g, 2 min, 4 °C.) The cell pellet was gently resuspended in 300 μl of STM-N buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). After 5 min on ice, the nuclei were pelleted (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C.) The resulting supernatant was harvested and is referred to as the 1000 × g supernatant. The nuclei were gently resuspended in 1 ml of STM buffer (STM-N, but lacking the Nonidet P-40) and layered onto 200 μl of a sucrose cushion (40% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) Nuclei were pelleted (1000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold radio-immune precipitation assay buffer on ice for 15 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was harvested and is referred to as the nuclear fraction. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and protein determination were carried out as previously described (11McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I.

Total RNA was isolated from RL34 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 1.5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers (Promega) and the SuperScript™ II RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the real-time PCR analysis, the following matching oligonucleotide primers and probes, designed using PrimerExpress™ software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), were used as follows: rNQO1, forward primer, 5′-GCAGGATTCGCCTACACGTATG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GGTGATGGAAAGCAAGGTCTTC-3′; Probe 5′-(6-carboxyfluorescein)CACCATGTATGACCAAGGTCCTTTCCAGAATA(6-carboxyl tetramethylrhodamine)-3′; rNrf2, forward primer, 5′-TTTGGCAGAGACATTCCCATT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GGGTGGTGAAGACTGAGCTCTCA-3′, Probe 5′-(6-carboxyfluorescein)AGATGACCATGAGTCGCTTGCCCT(6-carboxyl tetramethylrhodamine)-3′. The PCR mixes were prepared and amplified as described previously (16Chanas S.A. Jiang Q. McMahon M. McWalter G.K. McLellan L.I. Elcombe C.R. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Moffat G.J. Itoh K. Yamamoto M.

The expression of 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control and was quantitated by TaqMan® chemistry using the TaqMan® ribosomal RNA control reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data acquisition and analysis utilized the ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The relative gene expression levels in different samples was calculated using the Comparative CT Method as outlined in the ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System User Bulletin 2. This was carried out using the method of Treier et al. (30Treier M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were transfected with pHisUb along with either pcDNA3.1/V5mNrf2 or pcDNA3.1/V5mNrf2ΔETGE and other expression vectors as described in Fig. 7. Approximately 24 h later, the transfected cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 2 h before the monolayers were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.36 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. A whole-cell lysate was prepared from 50 μl of the cell suspension and is referred to as the “input” fraction. His-tagged protein was purified from the remainder of the cell suspension as follows; the cell suspension was lysed by the addition to 2.2 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidine, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The resulting lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity before 50 μl of Ni-CAM® HC resin (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were washed sequentially with buffer A supplemented with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), buffer B (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 mm 2-ME, buffer C (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.3) supplemented with 10 mm 2-ME and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and finally, buffer C supplemented with 10 mm 2-ME and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Bound material was eluted from the beads by suspension in 50 μl of modified Laemmli sample buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.8% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.72 m 2-ME, and 300 mm imidazole) followed by boiling for 4 min. The suspension was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 1 min, 20 °C), and the resulting supernatant was collected and is referred to as the “pull-down” fraction. Sulforaphane Transcriptionally Activates rNQO1 in RL34 Cells—Previous workers have shown that NQO1 genes are regulated by agents that cause oxidative stress, and evidence suggests that this is mediated by Nrf2 through an ARE (11McMahon M.

In the present study, we sought to provide further information about how the function of Nrf2 is controlled by oxidative stress. To this end, the isothiocyanate Sul, which causes oxidative stress by reacting with GSH to form dithiocarbamates, (35Kirlin W.G. Cai J. Thompson S.A. Diaz D. Kavanagh T.J. Jones D.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), was chosen as the oxidative stressor. As a model system we chose the non-transformed rat RL34 cell line over the more commonly utilized human HepG2 and mouse Hepa1c1c7 cell lines because its phenotypic response to Sul more closely recapitulates that observed in rodent liver. Specifically, untreated RL34 cells express an undetectable level of rNQO1 protein that is highly inducible by Sul treatment (Fig. 1A). By contrast, HepG2 and Hepa1c1c7 cell lines both express high basal levels of NQO1 with little or no induction observed after treatment with Sul (data not shown). The accumulation of rNQO1 protein in the RL34 cell line is paralleled by a rapid (significantly increased after 1 h, p < 0.05) elevation in the level of its cognate mRNA (Fig. 1B). As CAT activity expressed from the pARE-164CAT construct, but not p-164CAT, is induced by Sul (Fig. 1C), the increase in NQO1 protein is a consequence of transcriptional activation of rNQO1 promoter, presumably mediated by Nrf2 through the ARE in the promoter of the oxidoreductase gene. Sulforaphane Causes a Rapid Nuclear Accumulation of rNrf2 Protein—To determine how Sul controls rNrf2 activity in RL34 cells, whole-cell lysates were prepared at different times after Sul treatment and blotted with a rabbit anti-mNrf2 antiserum (Fig. 2A).

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this inhibition is poorly understood. Here we report that the mammalian Numb protein promotes the ubiquitination of membrane-bound Notch1 receptor. Furthermore, Numb expression resulted in the degradation of the Notch intracellular domain following activation, which correlated with a loss of Notch-dependent transcriptional activation of the Hes1 promoter as measured by a Hes1 luciferase reporter assay. The phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of Numb was required for both Notch1 ubiquitination and down-regulation of Notch1 nuclear activity. Numb-mediated ubiquitination of Notch1 was not dependent on the PEST region, which was previously shown to mediate Sel10-dependent ubiquitination of Notch in the nucleus, suggesting a distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved. In agreement we demonstrate that Numb interacts with the cytosolic HECT domain-containing E3 ligase Itch and that Numb and Itch act cooperatively to promote ubiquitination of membrane-tethered Notch1. These results suggest that Numb recruits components of the ubiquitination machinery to the Notch receptor thereby facilitating Notch1 ubiquitination at the membrane, which in turn promotes degradation of the intracellular domain circumventing its nuclear translocation and downstream activation of Notch1 target genes.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Notch signaling plays an important role in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptotic events at all stages of development, functioning as an essential communication mechanism to direct cell fate selection of neighboring cells (Refs. 16Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar and 17Miele L. Osborne B. J. Cell Phys. 1999; 181: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and references therein). Genetic abnormalities in components of the Notch signaling pathway have been implicated in a number of disease states including leukemia and neurogenerative disorders (18Dievart A. Beaulieu N.

The Notch1 receptor, the most extensively studied of the four mammalian Notch receptors, is a 300 kDa type I integral membrane protein that undergoes at least three critical proteolytic steps required for its maturation and signal transmission (21Kopan R. Turner D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Notch is first processed in the trans-Golgi network by a furin-like convertase into two distinct fragments that interact to form a functional heterodimeric receptor on the cell surface (23Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artivanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 24Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidaah N.G. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In this heterodimeric form, Notch is able to bind transmembrane ligands of the DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag2) family presented on neighboring cells. Upon ligand binding, a second cleavage event occurs by the metalloproteinase TACE (TNF-α-converting enzyme, also know as ADAM 17) releasing the Notch extracellular domain (25Brou C. Logeat F.

A third cleavage event by a γ-secretase whose activity is strongly dependent on the presenilins, releases the active intracellular fragment of Notch (22Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The precise cellular compartment in which this activation cleavage occurs is still unclear. The released intracellular domain of Notch (NotchIC) then translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a cotransactivator with transcription factors of the CSL (CBF1/RBPjκ, Suppressor of Hairless Su(H), Lag-1) family to modulate transcription of downstream target genes such as Hes1, the mammalian homologue of the Hairy and Enhancer of Split gene complex in Drosophila (16Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway in controlling Notch signaling (30Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R74-R78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination pathway is essential for cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, protein transport, DNA repair, and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Protein ubiquitination is a multistep process in which free ubiquitin is first attached to an ubiquitinactivating enzyme (E1) and subsequently transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which in partner with an ubiquitin ligase (E3), transfers ubiquitin to the specific protein substrate (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6904) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase provides specificity by functioning as an adaptor to selectively bind substrates (32Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 33Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284 (603–604): 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While ubiquitin often targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome, it can also serve as a signal for receptor internalization and trafficking to multivesicular bodies and the lysosome (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6904) Google Scholar, 34Hicke L.

Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several distinct classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases appear to directly regulate the Notch receptor. In Drosophila, genetic evidence suggests the HECT (Homologous to E6-AP C Terminus) domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase Suppressor of Deltex negatively regulates Notch receptor signaling (36Cornell M. Evans D.A. Mann R. Fostier M. Flasza M. Monthatong M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The related mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch has been shown to ubiquitinate membrane-tethered Notch1 in vivo and in vitro (37Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), although the consequence of this ubiquitination event is unknown. Furthermore Sel10, an F-box-containing protein that interacts with a SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, also functions as a negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway (38Hubbard E.J. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) by specifically targeting the active nuclear form of Notch for ubiquitination (39Gupta-Rossi N.

Whereas the importance of Notch and Numb function during development is recognized, there remains a limited understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms through which Numb exerts its regulatory effect on Notch signaling. In this report, we demonstrate that mammalian Numb expression promotes the ubiquitination of membranetethered Notch1 and the degradation of the intracellular domain following receptor activation. Furthermore Numb interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch to cooperatively enhance Notch1 ubiquitination and down-regulate Notch1-dependent signal transduction. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—All Notch1 mutant constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector and were constructed from the full-length Notch1 cDNA (FL-Notch). ΔEC-Notch was constructed by ligating amino acids 1–21 of Notch1 obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to a fragment of FL-Notch containing nucleotides from the SspI restriction enzyme site to the stop codon. The NICD mutant was amplified by PCR and encodes amino acids Val1744 to the stop codon. ΔECΔRV was generated by digestion of ΔEC-Notch construct with EcoRV, and in-frame ligation to a C-terminal Myc tag. The Numbp66 cDNA was cloned into pEF. NumbΔPTBC was constructed using PCR-amplified fragments of amino acids Met1 to Lys85, and Lys174 to the stop codon, and fused in-frame to the pEF parental vector. NumbΔC deletes the last forty-one amino acids. All GST-Itch fusion constructs were generated by PCR amplification of Itch cDNA template and ligated into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The Itch GST fusions used were GST-WW1/2 (amino acids Pro276–Glu357), WW3 (amino acids Glu392–Leu43), WW4 (amino acids Gly432–Asp476), and WWHECT (amino acids Pro276–Glu862). All cDNAs generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24–48 h before lysing. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum and transfected using LipofectAMINE2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For siRNA silencing experiments, a 21-nucleotide siRNA oligomer (Dharmacon Research) was designed to a region homologous to the Numb C-terminal coding sequence. As a negative control for siRNA activity, the Scramble II duplex from Dharmacon (d-001205-20) was used. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected cells were grown to confluency and lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride containing COMPLETE protease inhibitors tablets (Roche Applied Science)). For cells lysed in 1% SDS buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1% SDS containing COMPLETE protease inhibitors tablets), lysates were boiled for 5 min then diluted to 0.1% SDS prior to immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitations, an equivalent amount of protein was incubated with anti-Notch and 20% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose bead slurry for 3 h and then washed with PLC lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Numb-specific antisera were as previously described (9Verdi J.M. Schmandt R. Bashirullah A. Jacob S. Salvino R. Craig C.G. Program A.E. Lipshitz H.D. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Anti-Notch (M-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-6015) was used for immunoprecipitations. Anti-Notch cytoplasmic domain from Upstate Biotechnology Institute (06–808) and anti-ICD from Cellular Signaling (2421) were used for immunoblots. Anti-HA (clone 12CA5) (Roche Applied Science) and anti-AIP4/Itch (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Myc 9E10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) were obtained from commercial sources. For proteasome inhibition, transfected cells were incubated for 4 h prior to lysis at 37 °C with either 50 μm MG132 or Me2SO as a control in DMEM-containing serum. Cells were lysed in PLC lysis buffer containing 10 μm MG132. For coimmunoprecipitation reactions and GST pull-down experiments, transfected HEK293T cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride) containing protease inhibitors. GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (42Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Activation of Notch1—To activate the Notch1 receptor, transfected C2C12 cells were washed with 1× PBS, and incubated for 0 min or 15 min with prewarmed 5 mm EDTA in 1× PBS. Treated cells were then washed with PBS and chased for indicated time points in regular culture medium. Cells were lysed in PLC lysis buffer as described above. Hes1 Luciferase Reporter Assays—NIH 3T3 cells seeded on 6-well plates were cotransfected with ΔEC-Notch (400 ng) and Hes1 luciferase reporter construct (200 ng) in the presence or absence of pEF-Numb construct (400 ng) as described above. Included in each transfection was a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-β-galactosidase reporter (100 ng) to control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was equalized with empty parental vector. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantitated using firefly luciferin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). β-galactosidase activity was quantitated using the chemiluminescent substrate Galacto-PLUS according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity and represented as fold activation. Protein expression was monitored by Western blot. Each condition was performed in triplicate and experiments repeated at least three times. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Transfected C2C12 cells were grown to confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in serum-free DMEM without methionine and cysteine (depletion medium). Cells were pulsed for 1.5 h in depletion medium containing 200 μCi ProMix l-[35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Biosciences), washed extensively with unlabeled DMEM, and chased at 37 °C for up to 6 h in DMEM containing serum and supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine (Sigma). At indicated time points cells were washed with PBS and lysed in PLC lysis buffer. Protein lysates were quantified, and equal amounts of lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Notch. Immunoprecipitates were washed with PLC lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed to visualize labeled protein. For pulse-chase analysis of the NICD mutant, HEK293T cells were pulsed for 30 min and chased over a period of 3 h. Ubiquitinated Notch1 Protein Accumulates in the Presence of Numb—Ubiquitination of the Notch receptor and components of the Notch signaling pathway is thought to play a key regulatory role in Notch signal transmission. Given that Numb has recently been shown to interact with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and is implicated as a regulator of receptor endocytosis, we examined whether Numb might affect Notch1 receptor down-regulation by ubiquitination. The effect of Numb expression on the ubiquitination of a constitutively active membrane-tethered Notch1 mutant, ΔEC-Notch consisting of the transmembrane domain and the entire intracellular domain of Notch1, but lacking most of the extracellular (EC) domain was examined (Fig. 1A). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with HA-epitope tagged ubiquitin and ΔEC-Notch in the presence or absence of exogenous Numb. HA-reactive proteins were detected upon coexpression of ΔEC-Notch and HA-tagged ubiquitin suggesting that ΔEC-Notch is ubiquitinated by an endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 1B). Coexpression of Numb resulted in an increase in the level of ubiquitinated proteins detected in ΔEC-Notch immunoprecipitations. To determine if these proteins represented Notch itself, ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and anti-Notch immunoblots were used to specifically detect ubiquitinated Notch1. Only a very low level of ubiquitinated Notch immunoprecipitated with anti-HA in the absence of Numb, however there was a dramatic increase upon Numb overexpression (Fig. 1C). As Notch1 has been shown to interact with a number of intracellular proteins including Numb that are themselves substrates for ubiquitination, cells were lysed in 1% SDS lysis buffer and boiled to disrupt protein complexes. Ubiquitinated Notch was detected in immunoprecipitates from boiled lysates indicating the HA reactive proteins observed was Notch1 and not associated ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 1D). Numb expression resulted in an increase in the levels of Notch1 ubiquitination under these conditions, indicating that Numb enhanced ubiquitination of Notch1 itself. Finally, we examined the effect of Numb on the ubiquitination of another cell surface receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to assess the specificity of Numb with respect to Notch1 ubiquitination. Coexpression of Numb with EGFR had no effect on its ubiquitination in transiently transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1E) indicating Numb has a specific effect on the Notch1 receptor, rather than affecting membrane proteins in general. A Functional PTB Domain of Numb Is Required to Promote Notch1 Ubiquitination—Previous studies have demonstrated that the Numb PTB domain and sequence motifs near the C terminus are important for Numb function by mediating its interaction with other proteins (8Guo M.

To determine the region of Numb required to promote Notch1 ubiquitination, two Numb mutants were generated. NumbΔPTBC lacks eighty-eight amino acids at the C-terminal end of the PTB domain and is similar to a deletion that abolishes dNumb function in Drosophila (Fig. 2A and Ref. 46Frise E. Knoblich J.A. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11925-11932Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). NumbΔC lacks the C-terminal forty-one amino acids including the EH domain binding site. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with ΔEC-Notch and HA-Ub in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of wild-type or mutant forms of Numb. In the presence of increasing amounts of NumbWT, increasing amounts of ubiquitinated ΔEC-Notch species were observed (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). Coexpression of NumbΔC enhanced Notch1 ubiquitination as efficiently as wild-type Numb (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5); however the effect of NumbΔPTBC on Notch1 ubiquitination was dramatically attenuated (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that an intact PTB domain is required to mediate Notch1 ubiquitination. The PEST Region of Notch1 Is Not Required for Numb-mediated Ubiquitination—Recently, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Sel10 has been shown to associate with and ubiquitinate the NotchIC domain within the nucleus and target it for proteasomal degradation (39Gupta-Rossi N.

Chui I. Deshaies R.J. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7403-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Notch contains a PEST sequence that is required to mediate Sel10 binding and ubiquitination of nuclear Notch. To determine if the PEST region of Notch1 is required for Numb to promote ubiquitination, a C-terminal deletion mutant that removes the last 483 amino acids of Notch1, ΔECΔRV, was constructed (see Fig. 1A). An increase in the amount of ubiquitination of ΔECΔRV was observed upon coexpression of ΔECΔRV and Numb in HEK293T cells as compared with coexpression with empty vector (Fig. 3). In addition, deletion of the same region in a non-membrane-tethered Notch1 mutant, NICDΔRV had no effect on Numb-mediated ubiquitination (data not shown). Therefore the C terminus of Notch1 is dispensable for Numb-mediated ubiquitination and suggests that an E3 ubiquitin ligase other than Sel10 is required for Numb-mediated ubiquitination of Notch1. Numb Interacts with the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Itch in Vitro and in Vivo—Numb itself does not possess intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (data not shown), and therefore likely mediates Notch ubiquitination through recruitment of components of the ubiquitination machinery to the Notch1 receptor. To date, three E3 ubiquitin ligases Sel10, Itch, and Cbl, target different forms of Notch1 for ubiquitination. Similar to Numb-mediated ubiquitination of Notch, the HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch was shown to ubiquitinate membrane-tethered Notch1 independent of the C-terminal PEST sequence (37Qiu L.

In the present study, we investigated whether human wild type ABCG2 transports estrone 3-sulfate (E1S) using membrane vesicles from cDNA-transfected mouse lymphoma cell line (P388 cells). The uptake of [3H]E1S into ABCG2-expressing membrane vesicles was stimulated by ATP, and the Km value for [3H]E1S was determined to be 16.6 μm. The ABCG2-mediated transport of [3H]E1S was potently inhibited by SN-38 and many sulfate conjugates but not by glucuronide and glutathione conjugates or other anionic compounds. Other sulfate conjugates such as [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and [35S]4-methylumbelliferone sulfate (Km = 12.9 μm) and [35S]6-hydroxy-5,7-dimethyl-2-methylamino-4-(3-pyridylmethyl)benzothiazole (E3040) sulfate (Km = 26.9 μm) were also transported by ABCG2. Although [3H]methotrexate, [3H]17β-estradiol-17β-D-glucuronide, [3H]2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, and [14C]4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide were transported by ABCG2, this took place to a much lesser extent compared with [3H]E1S. It was suggested that ABCG2 preferentially transports sulfate conjugates and that E1S and DHEAS are the potential physiological substrates for this transporter."

We speculated that specialized structures named lipid rafts, known as important platforms for the delivery of proteins to the cell membrane, might be involved in the unknown mechanism ensuring membrane association and secretion of Hsp70. Lipid rafts are sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich structures that have been mainly characterized in polarized epithelial cells and can be isolated as detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs). Analysis of soluble and DRM fractions prepared from unstressed Caco-2 epithelial cells revealed that Hsp70, and to a lesser extent calnexin, were present in DRM fractions. Increased expression of Hsps, through heat shock or by using drugs acting on protein trafficking or intracellular calcium level, induced an efficient translocation to DRM. We also found that Hsp70 was released by epithelial Caco-2 cells, and this release dramatically increased after heat shock. Drugs known to block the classical secretory pathway were unable to reduce Hsp70 release. By contrast, release of the protein was affected by the raft-disrupting drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin.

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LDH, lactase dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LDH, lactase dehydrogenase. are a family of highly conserved proteins found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In normal unstressed cells, Hsps are expressed constitutively and bind transiently to nascent polypeptides to assist their appropriate folding, assembly, and intracellular trafficking. Following stress, Hsps serve to protect proteins from denaturation and assist them in renaturation or degradation. Although the stress response is widely observed in all cell types, some tissues such as the gut have a robust response to stress, and following in vivo hyperthermic shock, the intestine is one of the first organs to synthesize Hsp70 that confers protection to gut (1Bush K.T. George S.K. Zhang P.L. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F211-F218PubMed Google Scholar). Different Hsps are found in different cellular compartments and organelles. Among the major Hsps currently identified, the stress-inducible 72-kDa Hsp70 or the constitutively expressed 73-kDa Hsc70 are mainly found in the cytosol, but following stress they migrate to the nucleus and associate to nuclear proteins (2Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2035-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 3Welch W.J. Phys. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Hsps also include a group of analogous proteins confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Among these are the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) located in the ER lumen and the calcium-binding proteins calreticulin and calnexin, the luminal and transmembrane-associated ER Hsps, respectively. There is recurrent evidence suggesting that several Hsps (ER-resident and cytosolic) are also expressed at the cell membrane (4Xiao G. Chung T.F. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. J. Neurosci.

Membrane-associated or secreted Hsps (Hsp70 in particular) have been suggested to exert a necessary, but still poorly understood, role in the immune response and signal transduction (7Multhoff G.

Since Hsp70 and some other Hsps are intracellular proteins and lack any secretory signal sequence, one should hypothesize that these proteins are not released through the classical exocytic pathway. Our initial studies, aimed at defining the nature of the membranes to which Hsp70 may attach, have suggested that specialized membrane microdomains may be involved. These microdomains, also termed lipid rafts, are formed within the exoplasmic leaflet of the Golgi membrane (14Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 15Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are characterized by their resistance to non-ionic detergent extraction at low temperature combined with their ability to float during density gradient centrifugation (16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). These detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, and some other acylated or transmembrane proteins (16Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). In the present study, a model of cultured human intestinal cells, namely Caco-2, was used to study the expression and membrane association of Hsps. Different Hsps were found to associate with DRMs to a variable extent depending on the particular Hsp considered, and association of Hsps with these microdomains could be modulated by stress. DRM fractions obtained from unstressed cells contained consistent levels of Hsp70, while Hsc70 and ER chaperone levels were very low or undetectable. The stress response (heat shock, depletion of ER calcium, and inhibition of protein trafficking) resulted in an increased accumulation of some Hsps into DRM fractions as compared with unstressed cells. Notably, in stressed Caco-2 cells, the amount of Hsp70 was selectively increased in DRMs, and this was correlated with a robust stimulation of Hsp70 release. Manipulating the lipid composition of DRMs resulted in a concomitant modulation of Hsp70 release, thus suggesting that lipid rafts may represent a cellular mechanism for membrane delivery and release of Hsps.

The Hsp70 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (catalog no. EKS-700) was from StressGen. Human colonic adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells (passage 50–80) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids. Cells were plated 21 days before experiments and maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2. These conditions allow differentiation of epithelial membrane into apical (brush border) and basolateral domains. Some experiments were performed with a non-tumoral epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney, cultured as confluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were exposed to thermal stress for 30 min in culture flasks partially immersed in a thermostatically regulated water bath. Cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C in 10% CO2 to allow the synthesis of Hsps. Tunicamycin (25 μg/ml), monensin (25 μm), brefeldin A (15 μm), and thapsigargin (0.5 μm) were added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 18 h before experiments in supplemented culture medium. DRM preparation was adapted from a procedure described previously (17Sapin C. Colard O. Delmas O. Tessier C. Breton M. Enouf V. Chwetzoff S. Ouanich J. Cohen J. Wolf C. Trugnan G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4591-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adherent cells (1–2 × 107/25-cm2 culture flask) were washed twice in PBS, lysed with 2 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 1 mm) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were scraped from the flasks, sheared by 20 passages through a 22-gauge needle, left for 20 min before mixing with OptiPrep® density gradient medium (final concentration, 40% (v/v)), and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous Optiprep gradient was formed by overlaying 4 ml of 30% Optiprep and 4 ml of 5% Optiprep (prepared by dilution of OptiPrep in extraction buffer). Gradients were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). A distinct Triton X-100-insoluble whitish band that floated to the 5–30% interface was designated as the DRM fraction. The last 4 ml of the gradient tube were mixed and designated as the soluble fraction. The whole procedure was performed at 0-4 °C. DRM and soluble fractions were collected and subjected to electrophoresis, Western blot, and ELISA analysis. Cell proteins (5 μg/lane) were separated electrophoretically on one-dimensional SDS, 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Proteins of the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, 0.45 μm, Amersham Biosciences) and probed with antibodies against Hsps (anti-Hsp70 diluted to 1:5,000, anti-Hsc70 diluted to 1:5,000, anti-KDEL diluted to 1:250, and anti-calreticulin and anti-calnexin diluted to 1:2,000 followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibodies diluted to 1:20,000). Blots were developed using ECL detection reagents according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Immunoblots were scanned with a densitometric scanner (Arcus II, Agfa, Mortsel, Belgium) and quantified using Scion Image software. Analysis by flow cytometry was performed in cells detached with trypsin-EDTA, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized by 0.3% saponin. Primary antibodies were added for 18 h at 4 °C diluted at 1:100 (anti-Hsp70, anti-Hsc70, anti-calreticulin, and anti-calnexin) or diluted to 1:50 (anti-KDEL) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature in the dark: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were diluted to 1:50 in PBS-bovine serum albumin. In nonspecific controls, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. Fluorescence and light scatters were analyzed in a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell sorter for green fluorescence detected through a 525-nm filter. Data are expressed as the percentage of positive cells above nonspecific controls. ELISA—Quantitative comparisons between the expression of Hsp70 in DRM and soluble fractions of different preparations from normal and stressed cells were performed using a commercial ELISA kit as recommended by the manufacturer. This assay was also used to quantify Hsp70 expression in cell supernatants. Proteins—Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol Depletion—To deplete cholesterol cells (1–2 × 107) were treated by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (10 mm) and rocked for6hat37 °C. To estimate cholesterol depletion cells were pretreated with 3 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 16 h in complete culture medium. At the end of the incubation, aliquots of the supernatants were collected, and their radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation (LS 6000 SC, Beckman). Cells were then washed twice in PBS and lysed for DRM preparation. The ability of methyl-β-cyclodextrin to deplete cholesterol from different fractions obtained was estimated according to their radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation. Alkaline Phosphatase and Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV Activities—Alkaline phosphatase and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 410 nm using p-nitrophenyl phosphate and glycyl-l-proline p-nitroanilide as substrate, respectively. LDH—LDH was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a commercial kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Wilcoxon's signed ranked test. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. Expression of Hsps in Control and Stressed Epithelial Cells— Preliminary experiments were conducted to analyze the heat shock response in Caco-2 epithelial cells by measuring Hsp70 expression as a function of temperature and recovery time after heat shock. Heat shock response increased as a function of temperatures (40, 42, 43, 44, and 45 °C) to reach maximal expression, without loss of viability, at 44 °C (Fig. 1A). The expression of Hsp70 was maximal by 6 h postheat shock and declined thereafter (Fig. 1B). Kinetic and dose-response experiments were also performed using flow cytometry to determine optimal effects of drugs that interfere with protein folding and trafficking by perturbing Golgi or ER functions. Maximal induction of Hsps occurred after an incubation period of 18–24 h with 25 μm monensin (that blocks the transport out of the Golgi apparatus), 15 μm brefeldin A (the fungal metabolite that blocks the anterograde transport from ER to Golgi), 25 μg/ml tunicamycin, the inhibitor of N-glycosylation, or 0.5 μm thapsigargin (the ATPase inhibitor that depletes calcium from the ER). At the end of each experiment, LDH activity was measured to test cell viability and indicated that, at the concentrations used, none of the drugs had significant cytotoxic effects (Table I). As shown in Table II, Caco-2 cells expressed significant levels of all the Hsps tested even in their resting state. Although usually restricted to cells experiencing stress, the presence of Hsp70 in unstressed cells is not unique to Caco-2 because in humans and primates inducible Hsp70 has also been detected in normally growing cells (3Welch W.J. Phys. Rev. 1992; 72: 1063-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Hsp70 was the major protein induced by heat shock (44 °C for 30 min), and low induction was observed for other Hsps. Agents perturbing Golgi or ER functions such as monensin or brefeldin A elicited preferentially classical ER-resident Hsps, while the calcium-binding proteins calnexin and calreticulin were particularly sensitive to thapsigargin that depletes calcium from the ER. Exposure of epithelial cells to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin also led to a specific induction of the expression of ER Hsps. Results qualitatively similar to those described by flow cytometry were observed using Western blot (data not shown).Table IRelease of LDH from Caco-2 cellsControlHeat shockMonensinBrefeldin ATunicamycinThapsigarginn = 644 °C, 30 min25 μM15 μM25 μg/ml0.5 μMn = 6n = 4n = 4n = 5n = 43.8 ± 0.74.2 ± 0.74.9 ± 1.44.5 ± 0.44.7 ± 0.95.1 ± 1.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIExpression of Hsps in Caco-2 cells: modulation by heat shock and drugs that interfere with trafficControlHeat shockMonensinBrefeldin ATunicamycinThapsigarginn = 644 °C, 30 min25 μM15 μM25 μg/ml0.5 μMn = 6n = 4n = 4n = 5n = 4Hsp703.3 ± 0.852.5 ± 4.1ap < 0.01 versus control.6.8 ± 2.86.9 ± 1.95.4 ± 1.02.8 ± 1.1Hsc702.0 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.63.8 ± 0.84.0 ± 1.05.0 ± 1.81.8 ± 0.3Grp781.3 ± 0.53.7 ± 1.85.3 ± 0.9bp < 0.05.7.4 ± 0.8bp < 0.05.11.6 ± 3.8bp < 0.05.10.6 ± 2.5ap < 0.01 versus control.Calnexin1.7 ± 0.44.7 ± 2.96.7 ± 1.4bp < 0.05.6.8 ± 1.6bp < 0.05.7.7 ± 1.8ap < 0.01 versus control.10.6 ± 2.6ap < 0.01 versus control.Calreticulin3.2 ± 0.74.3 ± 2.14.9 ± 0.46.8 ± 1.65.8 ± 1.612.9 ± 3.4a p < 0.01 versus control.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Expression of Hsps in Membrane Microdomains of Epithelial Cells: Modulation by Heat Shock and Drugs That Interfere with Protein Traffic—As a first step toward the demonstration that Hsps may associate with epithelial cell membranes, flow cytometry experiments were performed on non-permeabilized cells. As shown in Table III, a significant amount of Hsp70 was detected in unpermeabilized Caco-2 cells that likely corresponded to a membrane staining. To further characterize this membrane association and since it has been suggested that, in monocytes, Hsp70 may associate with membrane microdomains (18Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the distribution of Hsp70 in Caco-2 cells was studied on an Optiprep gradient after Triton X-100 extraction. As shown on Fig. 2A, this protocol allowed isolation of a DRM-enriched fraction (fraction 4) in which alkaline phosphatase, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored brush border protein known as a good raft marker, was strongly enriched (70.0 ± 0. 9%, n = 3) and soluble fractions (fractions 8–12) in which dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, a brush border hydrolase known to be mostly excluded from rafts (19Garcia M. Mirre C. Quarone A. Reggio H. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was almost exclusively recovered (94.0 ± 0.2%, n = 3). The expression of Hsp70 was determined in this gradient by Western blot (Fig. 2B), and a significant proportion of Hsp70 (14.6 ± 5.3%, n = 3) was detected in DRM fractions of untreated Caco-2 cells. This pattern of expression was also recovered from another epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney, indicating that Hsp70 expression in rafts is not restricted to Caco-2 cells. The effect of heat shock on the level of expression and the distribution between the DRM and soluble fractions was dramatic. Besides the expected increase in total expression of Hsp70, a clear redistribution of Hsp70 from the soluble fractions to DRMs was observed as a function of temperatures from 37 to 45 °C (Fig. 2C), indicating that Hsp70 association to membrane microdomains is modulated by stress. Note that in this and the following experiments only two fractions were routinely considered: the DRM fraction 4 located at the interface (5–30%) and the soluble fraction that corresponded to a pool of fractions 8–12.Table IIIExpression of Hsp70 in permeabilized and non-permeabilized Caco-2 cellsPermeabilizedNon-permeabilized(n = 6)(n = 4)Control3.3 ± 0.81.0 ± 0.87Heat shock52.5 ± 4.115.6 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab To further characterize this phenomenon, the level of expression and membrane distribution of different Hsps were studied in resting or stressed cells (Fig. 2D). Strikingly only two Hsps, namely Hsp70 and calnexin, displayed a redistribution to DRMs upon stress conditions, whatever the nature of the stress. The other Hsps displayed an expected overexpression without any redistribution. It is important to note that no change was observed in the distribution of alkaline phosphatase and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV between DRM and soluble fractions when cells were switched from a resting to a stressed situation (data not shown). The association of Hsp70 to DRMs was further confirmed using a quantitative ELISA protocol. Data from ELISA, described in Table IV, were consistent with those obtained by Western blot: Hsp70 is an abundant protein in Caco-2 cells (∼500 and 1,600 ng/mg of protein in control and heat-shocked Caco-2 cells, respectively). In unstressed cells, the amount of Hsp70 present on DRMs is only 17% of the total cellular content, most of which resides in the soluble fraction. Following heat shock, expression of Hsp70 was enriched in DRMs to reach 35% of the total cellular content (Table IV). We next examined whether association of Hsp70 to DRM might result in an extracellular localization of the protein.Table IVExpression of Hsp70 in DRM and soluble fractions of Caco-2 cellsHomogenateDRMSolubleng/mg proteinControl459.4 ± 23.763.3 ± 14.3320.5 ± 17.7Heat shock1578.9 ± 270.1459.3 ± 65.6869.4 ± 230.7 Open table in a new tab DRM Localization of Hsp70 and Its Release Are Two Related Events—Hsp70 was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA. Release of Hsp70 during a 6-h incubation period was 1.7 ± 0.4% of the total Hsp70 content in resting Caco-2 cells. Heat shock induced a high increase of Hsp70 release that increased up to 14.2 ± 2.2% of the total Hsp70 content (p < 0.01, n = 10) (Fig. 3). It should be pointed out that this result cannot be ascribed to an increased cell mortality since the amount of Hsp70 was corrected for LDH release (results are expressed as percentage of Hsp70 released–percentage of LDH released). Addition of the three drugs used to perturb protein traffic and secretion (namely monensin, brefeldin A, or tunicamycin) did not significantly affect Hsp70 secretion from resting or heat-shocked Caco-2 cells, a result expected from the above data indicating that these drugs did not elicit any significant up-regulation of Hsp70 (Fig. 3). However, it is important to note that, although these drugs strongly interfere with the classical exocytic pathway, they did not reduce Hsp70 release, demonstrating that Hsp70 is released through a pathway independent of the classical secretory route. Whether Hsp70 release may be related to its association with lipid raft was finally studied. Lipid rafts result from a preferential packing of cholesterol and sphingolipids onto which specific proteins attach. Cholesterol has generally been considered as the major lipid molecule for maintaining raft stability, and together with sphingolipids its concentration is highly enriched in DRMs. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was used to disturb raft organization by specifically removing cholesterol (20Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We then compared both the association of Hsp70 to DRMs and the release of the protein in the absence and in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin. To confirm the efficiency of methyl-β-cyclodextrin in cholesterol withdrawal, Caco-2 cells were incubated with [3H]cholesterol, and radioactivity was measured before and after methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment in different fractions. After 24 h of incubation, 73.6 ± 2.5% (n = 6) of [3H]cholesterol was incorporated in Caco-2 cells, and 6 h of incubation with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in 58.03 ± 7.8% cholesterol removal from cell lysates. DRMs were then isolated from normal and cholesterol-deficient cell lysates and submitted to immunoblot analysis. Our data revealed that after partial cholesterol removal by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, Hsp70 expression was significantly decreased in supernatants from cholesterol-depleted cells (Fig. 4A) suggesting that released Hsp70 localizes preferentially in lipid rafts whose integrity is required for efficient release of the protein. Accordingly we observed a redistribution of Hsp70 expression from the DRM to the soluble fraction (Fig. 4B). A primary finding of this report is that Hsps (Hsp70 in particular) exist in two forms within epithelial cells: a major Triton X-100-soluble form and a minor detergent-insoluble form associated to DRM fractions. The association of Hsps to DRM fractions appears to be physiologically modulated. Thus, following heat shock, increased amounts of Hsp70 become incorporated into DRMs as compared with unstressed cells. Drugs that perturb ER-Golgi protein traffic such as monensin and brefeldin A do not prevent incorporation of Hsps into DRMs. Indeed preferential partitioning of Hsps into DRMs is observed with drugs that interfere with calcium homeostasis and protein traffic. Furthermore we report here that Hsp70 is released from Caco-2 cells via a pathway that presumably does not follow the classical route involving vesicular trafficking through the ER-Golgi compartments. Instead Hsp70 release was affected by the raft-disrupting drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin suggesting that protein release occurs through an atypical pathway involving lipid rafts. Treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin affected both the release and the recruitment of Hsp70 in DRMs, suggesting that the drug altered protein-raft interactions. Consistent with our data on Hsp70 release, this protein was previously shown to be released by cultured rat embryo cells by a mechanism other than the classical secretory pathway (10Hightower L.E. Guidon Jr., P.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp70 has been described in the circulation, and its levels were increased in pathological conditions related to inflammation (11Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N. Sellevold O.F.M. Espevik T. Sundan A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Our findings are also consistent with previous studies indicating that Hsp70 interacts with fatty acid chains of membrane lipids (21Guidon Jr., P.T. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Arispe N. Doh M. De Maio A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This interaction is likely to occur within lipid rafts and may be related to the unknown function of the previously described Hsp70-lipid association. Hsp70-lipid affinity represents an alternative explanation for the effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin since this drug may interfere with the association of the protein to membrane lipids, thereby preventing Hsp70-lipid raft association. On the basis of our findings, lipid rafts can be considered as plausible platforms by which Hsps reach the cell membrane and are externalized by cells. This mechanism is likely not restricted to Hsps and indeed has already been suggested for other cytosolic proteins lacking s signal sequence such as galectin 4, a member of the β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectins (23Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of the externalization of Hsp70 is the consequence for immune responses. Hsps are among the dominant antigens recognized by the immune system and play an important role in the immune response against cancer (7Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Miller E. Meier T. Wilmanns W. Issels R.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 12Young R.A. Elliott T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Chouchane L. Bowers F.S. Sawasdikosol S. Simpson R.M. Kindt T.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hsp70 released from cells may allow the transfer of antigenic peptides to antigen-presenting cells or may enhance the ability of intact cells to process and present endogenous tumor antigens to specific T cells (24Wells A.D. Malkovsky M. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 129-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules are found to be concentrated in lipid rafts whose integrity appeared to be important to allow efficient antigen presentation in antigen-presenting cells (25Anderson H.A. Hiltbold E.M. Roche P.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that expression of Hsp70 in DRMs is not restricted to tumor cells since both Caco-2 and the non-tumoral cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney exhibit a similar expression pattern. Indeed raft microdomains appear to be a ubiquitous feature of mammalian cells that likely allow small fractions of Hsps to be transported to and expressed on the cell surface regardless of the cell type. Moreover, on the basis of our findings, we propose that the expression of Hsps in DRMs rather represents a cellular mechanism for controlling signaling events at the cell membrane. In favor of the latter view, data from Asea et al. (8Asea A. Rehli M. Kabingu E. Boch A. Baré O. Auron P.E. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) suggest that in human monocytes Hsp70 binds specifically to the cell membrane to induce the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. The signal transduction cascade stimulated by exogenous Hsp70 results in the activation of nuclear factor-κB promoter activity through the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4. In murine macrophages, Vabulas et al. (9Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. Ghose S. Kirschning C.J. Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-15112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) also define Hsp70 as an exogenous stimulus for the signaling pathway that engages Toll-like receptor 4. However, Hsp70 should be released to exert these functions, and authors from the latter studies (8Asea A. Rehli M. Kabingu E. Boch A. Baré O. Auron P.E. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 9Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. Ghose S. Kirschning C.J. Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-15112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) do not address this question. Our present data are thus in agreement with previously reported evidence for extracellular functions of Hsp70 and provide new elements that may explain how Hsp70 escapes the intracellular compartment. The presence of Hsp70 in lipid rafts may also allow physical proximity between Hsp70 and CD14 (a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein known to be present in lipid rafts), thereby facilitating their interaction as recently suggested (18Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that cell membrane expression and related functions of Hsp70 may not be restricted to innate immune cells (monocytes and macrophages) and may be extended to epithelial cells and to other molecular chaperones such as ER-resident Hsps. In agreement, cell surface expression of molecular chaperones other than Hsp70 (ER-resident in particular) has already been described (5Okazaki Y. Ohno H. Takase K. Ochiai T. Saito T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35751-35758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Johnson S. Michalak M. Opas M. Eggleton P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In conclusion, here we have generated three lines of evidence suggesting a raft-based mechanism in the targeting of Hsps (Hsp70 in particular) to the extracellular space of epithelial cells: first, the presence of Hsps in DRMs; second, the lack of an inhibitory effect of drugs affecting the classical ER-Golgi secretory route; and third, observations revealing a methyl-β-cyclodextrin-sensitive extracellular presence of Hsp70. The presence of Hsps in DRMs may have a number of still unexplored implications and is a challenge for future research.

We also thank Serge Chwetzoff and Christelle Lenoir for helpful advice and Michel Kornprobst for assistance in flow cytometric analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2093414544,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) removes dopamine from the extracellular milieu and is potently inhibited by number of psychoactive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines, and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulates dopamine transport, primarily by redistributing DAT from the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments, although the mechanisms facilitating transporter sequestration are not defined. Here, we demonstrate that DAT constitutively internalizes and recycles in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Temperature blockades demonstrated basal internalization and reliance on recycling to maintain DAT cell surface levels. In contrast, recycling blockade with bafilomycin A1 significantly decreased transferrin receptor (TfR) surface expression but had no effect on DAT surface levels, suggesting that DAT and TfR traffic via distinct endosomal mechanisms. Kinetic analyses reveal robust constitutive DAT cycling to and from the plasma membrane, independent of transporter expression levels. In contrast, phorbol ester-mediated PKC activation accelerated DAT endocytosis and attenuated transporter recycling in a manner sensitive to DAT expression levels. These data demonstrate constitutive DAT trafficking and that PKC-mediated DAT sequestration is achieved by a combination of accelerated internalization and reduced recycling. Additionally, the differential sensitivity to expression level exhibited by constitutive and regulated DAT trafficking suggests that these two processes are mediated by independent cellular mechanisms."

Understanding the mechanisms responsible for ischemic preconditioning is important for formulating therapeutic strategies aimed at mimicking protective mechanisms. We report that the resistance afforded by 30 min of bilateral kidney ischemia persists for 12 weeks after preconditioning. The protection is reflected by improved postischemic renal function, reduced leukocyte infiltration, reduced postischemic disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, and reduced postischemic expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1). The protection is observed in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains of mice. Thirty minutes of prior ischemia increases the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) and the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-25 and is associated with increased interstitial expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), an indication of long term postischemic sequelae. Treatment with Nω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA), an inhibitor of NO synthesis, increases kidney susceptibility to ischemia. Gene deletion of iNOS increases kidney susceptibility to ischemia, whereas gene deletion of eNOS has no effect. Pharmacological inhibition of NOS by l-NNA or l-N6-(1-iminoethyl) lysine (l-NIL, a specific inhibitor of iNOS) mitigates the kidney protection afforded by 30 min of ischemic preconditioning. Fifteen minutes of prior ischemic preconditioning, which does not result in the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, impairment of renal function, increased interstitial α-SMA, or increased iNOS or eNOS expression, but does increase HSP-25 expression, partially protects the kidney from ischemia on day 8 via a mechanism that is not abolished by l-NIL treatment.

Salom J.B. Sick T.J. Perez-Pinzon M.A. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), little is known in any organ about the role of NOS or other molecules in preconditioning when the initial insult results in prolonged long term protection, as defined by protection afforded for longer than 48 h. In our studies we characterized the time characteristics of the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning, whether the protective mechanisms differ according to the strength of ischemic preconditioning, and whether ischemic preconditioning in the kidney is dependent upon NOS expression. Our results indicate that prior ischemic preconditioning protects the kidney from ischemia/reperfusion insults up to 12 weeks later with the degree of protection decreased as length of time between ischemic periods increases. Thirty minutes of ischemic preconditioning results in a sustained increase in iNOS expression and sustained damage to the kidney as reflected by α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) accumulation. Pharmacological inhibition of NO synthesis or genetic deletion of the iNOS gene, but not the eNOS gene, increases mouse kidney susceptibility to ischemia and mitigates the protection afforded by 30 min but not 15 min of ischemic preconditioning. Fifteen minutes of ischemia does not lead to increases in iNOS or eNOS expression. Thus increases of iNOS expression account for an important component of long term ischemic preconditioning in the kidney when the initial ischemia results in persistent tissue injury. While others have studied the role of iNOS in preconditioning in other organs as indicated above, our data go beyond these studies in a number of ways. No one previously, in any organ, has reported nor explored the mechanisms of preconditioning that persist up to 12 weeks after the initial event. Furthermore we report persistent long term renal interstitial changes after ischemia in the mouse kidney, and for the first time implicates these changes in long term protection against subsequent ischemia. We have thus identified iNOS as an important factor in prolonged protection that follows ischemic preconditioning. This role of iNOS depends upon the initial ischemic time in the mouse kidney. Animal Preparation—Experiments were performed in male BALB/c mice obtained from Charles River Laboratory, C57BL/6J (eNOS +/+), eNOS gene deletion (eNOS -/-) (28Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S.

Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and administered 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl (37 °C) on the day of surgery (day 0). Body temperature was maintained at 36–38 °C. Kidneys were exposed through flank incisions. Mice were subjected to 15, 25, or 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia (preconditioning) or sham-surgery (non-preconditioning) on day 0. Ischemia was induced by clamping both renal pedicles with nontraumatic microaneurysm clamps (Roboz). The incisions were temporarily closed during ischemia or sham surgery. After the clamps were removed reperfusion of the kidneys was visually confirmed. Preconditioned or non-preconditioned animals were subjected to 30 min of either bilateral ischemia or sham-surgery at the times indicated in the figures. Some animals were administrated either 0.9% NaCl (vehicle, i.p.), Nω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA, 12 mg/kg, i.p.), l-N6-(1-iminoethyl) lysine (l-NIL, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or l-arginine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before and 30 min after 30 min of either bilateral ischemia or sham-operation on day 8. Kidneys were harvested at the times indicated in the figure legends. Kidneys were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and Western blot analysis or were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. Renal Functional Parameters—Seventy microliters of blood were taken from the retroorbital vein plexus at the times indicated in the figures. Plasma creatinine concentration was measured using a Beckman Creatinine Analyzer. Immunocytochemistry—After perfusion via the left ventricle with 30 ml of PBS for 2 min at 37 °C and then PLP (4% paraformaldehyde, 75 mml-lysine, 10 mm sodium periodate) fixative for 5 min, kidneys were excised and placed in PLP overnight at 4 °C. Kidneys were then washed and stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. Fixed tissue was washed with PBS three times for 5 min each, placed overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose, embedded in oxytetracycline compound (Sakura FineTek, Torrance, CA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then cut into 5-μm sections using a cryotome. Sections were mounted on Fisher Superfrost Plus (Fisher) microscope slides, dried in air, and stored at -20 °C. For staining with phalloidin, which stains the actin cytoskeleton, sections were dried, washed in PBS for 10 min, incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk) for 40 min at room temperature, and washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. The section was incubated in blocking buffer containing TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma, 1:500) for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS containing 1.9% NaCl, once in PBS and mounted with a 1:1 mixture of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.9.

The sections were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG for 40 min at room temperature, washed with PBS three times for 10 min each, and mounted with Vectashield. To detect α-smooth muscle actin, sections were boiled with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, at pH 6.0, for 15 min and then washed with PBS. Monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody, 1:250, Sigma, was used as primary antibody. Subsequent procedures were carried out as described above with the exception that the secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with FITC. Images were viewed on a Nikon FXA epifluorescence microscope. MPO Activity—MPO activity, an index of tissue leukocyte infiltration, was measured in 1.5 and 24 h postischemic kidneys as previously described (6Park K.M. Kramers C. Vayssier-Taussat M. Chen A.

Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted from kidneys as previously described (33Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol.

Protein samples were separated on 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP-27 or 25 (Upstate Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) or mouse monoclonal anti-iNOS or -eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. As a positive control for iNOS expression, mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with interferon-γ (10 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccaride (1 μg/ml) for 12 h. Macrophage cell lysates were provided by BD Transduction Laboratories. Secondary antibodies, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Each group consisted of more than four animals as indicated in the figure legends. Thirty Minutes of Ischemic Preconditioning Reduces Postischemic Kidney Functional Impairment and Disruption of the Actin Cytoskeleton—We have reported that prior ischemia confers resistance of the BALB/c male mouse to subsequent ischemia 8 or 15 days later (2Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To examine how long the acquired resistance persists, male BALB/c mice were subjected to either sham-operation or 30 min of bilateral ischemia on day 0, and the animals were exposed to a second 30-min period of bilateral ischemia on day 8 or week 3, 4, 6, 10, or 12 after the initial surgery. The initial 30 min of bilateral ischemia results in dramatic increases in plasma creatinine levels that return to basal levels by 1 week after the surgery (Fig. 1A). Sham-operation does not result in a change in plasma creatinine concentration (Fig. 1A). After the initial 30 min of bilateral ischemia, the body weight of all animals was slightly reduced followed by an increase over time. While sham-operated animals have higher growth curves than animals exposed to ischemia, weights differ by only ∼5% 12 weeks later (Fig. 1B). Thirty minutes of bilateral ischemia on day 8 in the non-preconditioned mice results in a significant increase in plasma creatinine concentration (Fig. 1C). In contrast, 30 min of bilateral ischemia imposed on day 8 in the preconditioned mice has no effect on plasma creatinine levels (Fig. 1C). Even when the preconditioned mice were exposed to 30 min of bilateral ischemia at 3 weeks after the initial ischemia, a postischemic increase of plasma creatinine is not observed (Fig. 1C). When the preconditioned mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral ischemia 4, 6, 10, or 12 weeks after the preconditioning, there is a postischemic increase of plasma creatinine, but this increase is significantly less than the increase in plasma creatinine seen in the non-preconditioned mice (Fig. 1C). Renal ischemia/reperfusion results in disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (6Park K.M. Kramers C. Vayssier-Taussat M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2040-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Kellerman P.S. Bogusky R.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 896-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effect of ischemic preconditioning on postischemic actin cytoskeleton changes using immunocytochemistry techniques. Kidney sections were stained for phalloidin to identify the actin cytoskeleton (35Schwartz N. Hosford M. Sandoval R.M. Wagner M.C. Atkinson S.J. Bamburg J. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; : F544-F551PubMed Google Scholar). There is normal apical phalloidin staining in the proximal tubules of the sham-operated kidneys (Fig. 2A). Twenty-four hours after 30 min of ischemia, severe disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is observed in the non-preconditioned kidney (Fig. 2B). The disruption is particularly severe in the S3 segment proximal tubular cells in the outer stripe of the outer medulla (Fig. 2). At 8 days or 6 or 12 weeks after ischemia, the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton has largely reversed (Fig. 2, C, E, and G). At 24 h after a second period of ischemia imposed on day 8, the changes in the actin cytoskeleton were much less pronounced in the preconditioned kidneys than in the non-preconditioned kidneys (compare Fig. 2, D and B). With increasing time between ischemic insults the postischemic disruption of the actin cytoskeleton increases (Fig. 2). We evaluated the effect of 30 min of ischemic preconditioning on Kim-1 expression after subsequent ischemia as an additional measure of injury to the proximal nephron. We wanted to evaluate whether there are effects of ischemia that persisted well beyond the time that serum creatinine returned to normal. Kim-1 is markedly up-regulated in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule in the outer stripe of the outer medulla after ischemia and ureteral obstruction (30Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V. Bailly V. Wei H.

Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F1326-F1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), In the normal kidney there is no staining with an anti-Kim-1 antibody (Fig. 3). Ischemia results in the marked expression of Kim-1 in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules (Fig. 3). Kim-1 expression peaked 24 h after ischemia and reperfusion and then decreased over time. Increased expression of Kim-1 was seen for at least 3 weeks after 30 min of ischemia suggesting there was persistent tubular injury (Fig. 3) despite the absence of any increase in plasma creatinine (Fig. 1). When a second ischemic insult was imposed either 3 or 6 weeks after the first the postischemic expression of Kim-1 in the preconditioned kidney was much lower when compared with the expression normally seen 24 h after ischemia in the non-preconditioned kidney (Fig. 3). Thirty Minutes of Ischemic Preconditioning Reduces Postischemic Tissue MPO Activity—To evaluate whether protection against ischemic injury could be related to postischemic leukocyte infiltration, the extent of tissue leukocyte infiltration was determined by tissue MPO activity. When 30 min of ischemia was induced on day 8, MPO levels markedly increased in the non-preconditioned kidneys 1.5 and 24 h later (Fig. 4). By comparison there was no increase of MPO activity in the preconditioned kidneys (Fig. 4). Thirty Minutes of Ischemia Increases Endothelial and Inducible NOS Protein Expression—Endothelial or iNOS protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Thirty minutes of ischemia results in a significant increase in the expression of eNOS and iNOS in whole kidney lysate (Fig. 5). Sham-surgery does not result in a change in the expression of eNOS and iNOS (Fig. 5). The increased expression of eNOS and iNOS after ischemia/reperfusion persists for 12 weeks (Fig. 5). The expression of iNOS peaks at 1 week after ischemia and gradually diminishes over time, but remains above baseline levels for 12 weeks (Fig. 5, A and C). Since the sustained long term iNOS expression suggests the presence of a persistent stimulus, we evaluated whether the initial ischemic period resulted in long term changes in the kidney, which were not severe enough to cause measurable functional changes in plasma creatinine. α-Smooth muscle actin expression is a characteristic feature of renal fibrosis (36Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F349-F357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thirty minutes of ischemia results in an increase of α-smooth muscle actin expression in the interstitium 1, 6, and 12 weeks later (Fig. 6A). This increase in renal α-smooth muscle actin expression is also manifest on Western blots taken from kidneys at 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks after 30 min of bilateral ischemia (Fig. 6B). Effect of l-Arginine or l-NNA on Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury—To evaluate whether NO/NOS can modulate the extent of ischemic renal injury, we examined the effect of l-arginine and l-NNA in BALB/c male mice. Treatment with l-arginine or l-NNA does not change plasma creatinine levels (Fig. 7A). Twenty-four hours after a second procedure of 30 min of ischemia, plasma creatinine levels in the non-preconditioned mice treated with l-NNA 30 min prior to and subsequent to ischemia are higher than in the mice treated with l-arginine or vehicle (Fig. 7A). Treatment of ischemia-preconditioned animals with l-NNA, prior to and subsequent to a second ischemic period, partially mitigates the protection afforded by preconditioning. The increase in plasma creatinine, however, does not reach levels seen in the non-preconditioned mice treated with vehicle or l-NNA (Fig. 7A). Three days after ischemia 75% of the l-NNA-treated non-preconditioned (S/I) mice died, whereas all"
https://openalex.org/W1966718167,"Previous work from our laboratory (Athenstaedt, K., Zweytick, D., Jandrositz, A., Kohlwein, S. D., and Daum, G. (1999) J. Bacteriol. 181, 6441–6448) showed that the gene product of YMR313c (named Tgl3p) is a component of yeast lipid particles, and deletion of this gene led to an increase in the cellular level of triacylglycerols (TAG). These observations suggested that TGL3 may encode a TAG lipase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we demonstrate by cell fractionation and by microscopic inspection of a strain bearing a Tgl3p-GFP hybrid that this polypeptide is highly enriched in the lipid particle fraction but virtually absent from other organelles. The entire TAG lipase activity of lipid particles is attributed to Tgl3p, because the activity in this organelle is completely absent in a Δtgl3 deletion mutant, whereas it is significantly enhanced in a strain overexpressing Tgl3p. A His6-tagged Tgl3p hybrid purified close to homogeneity from a yeast strain overexpressing this fusion protein exhibited high TAG lipase activity. Most importantly, experiments in vivo using the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin demonstrated that deletion of TGL3 resulted in a decreased mobilization of TAG from lipid particles. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame YMR313c contains the consensus sequence motif GXSXG typical for lipolytic enzymes. Otherwise, Tgl3p has no significant sequence homology to other lipases identified so far. In summary, our data identified Tgl3p as a novel yeast TAG lipase at the molecular level and by function in vivo and in vitro.

All eukaryotic organisms and also some prokaryotes of the Gram-positive genera store triacylglycerols (TAG) 1The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerols; STE, steryl esters; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerols; STE, steryl esters; GFP, green fluorescent protein. in intracellular lipid particles that are also named lipid bodies and lipid droplets or oil bodies, oleosomes, and spherosomes in plants. The structure of this lipid-rich compartment is similar in all cell types and is rather simple; a hydrophobic core, mainly formed of TAG and/or steryl esters (STE), is surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer in which only few proteins are embedded (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar). Lipid particles serve as an energy source and/or as a source of fatty acids and sterols needed for membrane biogenesis, but they are also involved in the formation of specific lipophilic components, e.g. steroid hormones or prostaglandins (2Gwynn J.T. Strauss J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 299-329Google Scholar, 3Freeman D.A. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14231-14238Google Scholar, 4Bisgaier C.L. Chanderbhan R. Hinds R.W. Valhouny G.V. J.

Utilization of TAG and STE from lipid particles requires the action of TAG lipase(s) and STE hydrolase(s). Some proteins associated with the phospholipid monolayer of lipid particles, such as mammalian perilipins or oleosins of plants, were assumed to be involved in the mobilization of the neutral lipid core of the particle by serving as a docking and/or activating protein for TAG lipases and STE hydrolases. Alternatively, such proteins were assumed to protect the stored lipids from random degradation (6Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Servetnick D.A. Schultz C.J. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 611-615Google Scholar, 7Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Google Scholar, 8Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Google Scholar). Lipases are a family of enzymes with similarities in structure and function (9Svendsen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 223-238Google Scholar, 10Østerlund T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 268: 1899-1907Google Scholar). In particular, the active site of these proteins with a catalytic triad, which is opened or closed by a lid, has been unveiled. Some lipases exhibit high substrate specificity and regioselectivity. The subcellular localization of these enzymes varies. Lehner et al. (11Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-766Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a TAG lipase on cytosolic lipid droplets from pig liver. In contrast, Spalinger et al. (12Spalinger J.H. Seidman E.G. Menard D. Levy E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 119-127Google Scholar) reported lipase activities in the cytosolic fraction of Caco2 cells but also in the apical brush border membrane and other organelles. Lipases are assumed to interact with proteins located on the lipid particle surface prior to mobilization of TAG. As an example, interaction of the cytosolic hormone-sensitive lipase with perilipins, the most abundant proteins of mammalian lipid particles, was demonstrated (6Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Servetnick D.A. Schultz C.J. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 611-615Google Scholar). Both hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipins are phosphorylated at the same time, and it was suggested that only phosphorylated perilipin can serve as the docking protein for the lipase. In plants, many TAG lipases were isolated and characterized, although their subcellular localization has not been well studied. By using an antibody against animal lipases, Belguith et al. (13Belguith H. Jridi T. Hamida J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 974-976Google Scholar) detected lipases of rapeseed in different subcellular fractions isolated by differential centrifugation. During germination of maize kernel, lipases synthesized on free polyribosomes are specifically bound to oil bodies (7Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Google Scholar). Oleosins, the major proteins of oil bodies, appear to act as receptors for binding and/or activation of such lipases and to maximize the surface area of oil bodies, thus accelerating the mobilization of the storage oil from the hydrophobic core by lipases (14Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 299-324Google Scholar). TAG lipases of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are poorly characterized. Schousboe (15Schousboe I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 366-375Google Scholar, 16Schousboe I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 450: 165-174Google Scholar) described a TAG lipase activity in the yeast mitochondrial fraction, but the polypeptide catalyzing this reaction was not identified. In the course of the yeast genome sequencing project, several putative yeast lipases were detected by homology to such enzymes from other organisms. Three polypeptides encoded by YDL109c, YGL144c, and YDR444w contain lipase-active site motifs (www.proteome.com/), and a mutant deleted of YDL109c exhibits increased TAG levels (17Daum G. Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Balliano G. Cattel L. Milla P. Rocco F. Conzelmann A. Voinnet C. Kelly D.E. Kelly S. Schweizer E. Schüller H.-J. Hoja U. Greiner E. Finger K. Yeast. 1999; 15: 601-614Google Scholar). None of these open reading frames, however, was demonstrated by enzymatic analysis of the gene product to encode a TAG lipase. In addition, two proteins of unknown function named Tgl1p and Tgl2p were proposed to be yeast TAG lipases based on their homology to rat, human, and Pseudomonas lipases (18Abraham P.R. Mulder A. Van't Riet J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 227-238Google Scholar, 19Van Heusden G.P.H. Nebohacova M. Overbeeke T.L.A. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 1998; 14: 225-232Google Scholar). More recently, Cvt17p, which contains a motif conserved in esterases and lipases (20Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Google Scholar), was proposed to be a lipase involved in degradation of autophagic vesicles in the vacuole. TAG lipase activity, however, was neither demonstrated for Tgl1p nor for Tgl2p and Cvt17p. Analysis of the most abundant yeast lipid particle proteins by mass spectrometry led to the identification of several polypeptides with unknown function (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). Because most lipid particle proteins characterized by function are directly involved in lipid metabolism, it was tempting to speculate that at least some of the novel lipid particle proteins may also play such roles. Computational analysis of yeast lipid particle proteins revealed that some of these polypeptides contain a lipase motif, namely gene products of TGL1, YOR059c, and YJU3. None of all lipid particle proteins identified so far contained obvious sequence homology to perilipins or oleosins. Systematic analysis of deletion mutants lacking lipid particle proteins showed that TAG levels were similar to wild-type in Δtgl1, Δyor059c, and Δyju3, but significantly increased in a strain lacking YMR313c (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). This observation led us to speculate that YMR313c may encode a protein involved in TAG mobilization from lipid particles. In the present study we provide evidence that the gene product of YMR313c is indeed a TAG lipase. This assumption is based on results obtained from in vitro and in vivo experiments performed with wild-type, a Δymr313c deletion mutant, and strains overexpressing the respective gene product. Strains and Culture Conditions—The haploid wild-type yeast strain S. cerevisiae FY1679 (MATa, ura3-52, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200) containing either the empty plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen) or pYES2 with YMR313c inserted into the multiple cloning site, the Δtgl3 mutant deleted of the open reading frame YMR313c (MATa, ura3-52, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, Δtgl3::kanMX4) (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar) bearing the empty plasmid pYES2, and the wild-type strain FY1679 containing the hybrid protein of Tgl3p with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or His6, respectively, were used throughout this study. For the overexpression of Tgl3p, the YMR313c gene was inserted into the plasmid pYES2. The open reading frame was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA derived from a wild-type yeast strain as template using standard conditions (22Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 235-240Google Scholar). Primers used for amplification are shown in Fig. 1A. The PCR products were purified with NucleoSpin purification kit (Macherey-Nagel), and DNA fragment and plasmid were cleaved with HindIII and XhoI. The DNA fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the plasmid that was used for transformation of yeast (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For the construction of the His6-tagged Tgl3p under a GAL1 promoter (selectable marker TRP+), six ATG codons were inserted into the reverse primer used for the construction of the insertion cassette (Fig. 1A). In Fig. 1B a schematic view of the construct is shown. The fragment for insertion was amplified by PCR with plasmid pFA6a-TRP-PGAL1 for N-terminal tagging (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). PCR was performed as described previously (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). PCR fragments were ethanol-precipitated, and 400–700 ng were used for transformation of FY1679 applying the high efficiency lithium acetate transformation protocol (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Transformed cells were spread on TRP– plates and incubated for 2–3 days, and large colonies were transferred to fresh TRP– plates. Only those clones that yielded colonies were considered as positive transformants and further tested for correct integration of the respective fusion cassette. Correct replacement was verified by analytical PCR of whole yeast cell extracts (26Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Google Scholar). For the construction of hybrids of Tgl3p with GFP, the GFP(S65T) sequence and the selectable marker kanMX6 were inserted into the chromosomal DNA of the coding region of YMR313c at the N and the C terminus, respectively. The fragment for insertion was amplified by PCR with the plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1-GFP(S65T) for N-terminal or pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 for C-terminal tagging (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Primers used for amplification are shown in Fig. 1A, and the scheme of the constructs is shown in Fig. 1, C and D, respectively. PCR was performed as described above. Transformed cells were grown in YPD at 30 °C over night and then spread on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen). Yeast cells were grown aerobically in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks to the early stationary phase at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 2% galactose (Merck), and the respective amino acid supplements. Five hundred milliliters of culture medium were inoculated with 1 ml of a preculture grown aerobically for 48 h in minimal medium containing 2% glucose (Merck) as the carbon source. Growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance (A) at 600 nm. Isolation and Characterization of Subcellular Fractions—Lipid particles were isolated at high purity from yeast cells grown to the early stationary phase by the method of Leber et al. (27Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were prepared as described by Zinser et al. (28Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Google Scholar). Relative enrichment of markers and cross-contamination of fractions were similar to those reported previously (29Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and then solubilized in 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaOH. Prior to protein analysis samples of the lipid particle fraction were delipidated. Non-polar lipids were extracted with 3 volumes of diethyl ether; the organic phase was withdrawn; residual solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen; and proteins were precipitated from the aqueous phase as described above. SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were dissociated at 37 °C to avoid hydrolysis of polypeptides that may occur at higher temperature. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Haid and Suissa (32Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rabbit or mouse antisera as the first antibody and goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG, respectively, linked to peroxidase as the second antibody. Purification of Tgl3p-His6of Lipid Particles by Column Chromatography—For solubilization of lipid particle proteins, Zwittergent 3-14 (SB14) was added to lipid particles at a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and proteins were solubilized for 30 min on ice. The sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, and solubilized proteins were separated from the floating lipid layer. The solubilized lipid particle proteins were immediately applied onto a prepared 1-ml His-Trap™ chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) using the standard protocol. Then, in brief, the column was rinsed with 5 ml of washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 0.5 m NaCl; 10 mm imidazole; 20 μm Zwittergent 3-14), and subsequently the bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 0.5 m NaCl; 0.5 m imidazole; 12.5 μm Zwittergent 3-14). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots of 600 μl were used for measuring TAG lipase activity as described below. Lipid Analysis—Lipids of whole yeast cells were extracted by the procedure of Folch et al. (33Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanly G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar) after breaking cells with glass beads. Analysis of neutral lipids was performed as described previously (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). In brief, quantification of ergosterol and ergosteryl esters separated by TLC was carried out by densitometric scanning at 275 nm with ergosterol as a standard. TAGs were visualized on TLC plates by post-chromatographic staining and quantified by densitometric scanning at 400 nm with triolein as a standard. Fatty acids of TAGs were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. For this purpose, the TAG fraction isolated by TLC was subjected to methanolysis using BF3/methanol (14%), thus converting fatty acids to their methyl esters (34Morrison W.R. Smith L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 600-608Google Scholar). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis of fatty acid methyl esters was performed as described before (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 equipped with a flame ionization detector operated at 320 °C and a capillary column (Hewlett-Packard 5; 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness). Fatty acids were identified by comparison to commercial fatty acid methyl ester standards (NuCheck, Inc., Elysian, MN). In Vivo Mobilization of Neutral Lipids—To measure the mobilization of neutral lipids, cells were pre-grown for 40 h in minimal medium containing 2% galactose as the carbon source. Then fresh minimal medium (2% galactose) was inoculated with the pre-grown culture to an A600 nm of 3, and cerulenin (final concentration 10 μg/ml) or terbinafine (final concentration 30 μg/ml), respectively, was added from ethanolic stock solutions. Control incubations contained the equivalent volume of ethanol only. At the time points indicated, 10-ml aliquots of the culture were withdrawn, and cells were harvested by centrifugation on a table-top centrifuge. After freezing the pellet at –20 °C for at least 1 h, cells were disintegrated by glass beading, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. Enzymatic Analysis—For the biosynthesis of radioactively labeled TAG, 100 ml of synthetic medium, containing 20 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid (0.4 μmol), were inoculated with 200 μl of a wild-type preculture grown for 48 h. Cells were grown for 24 h and harvested, and lipids were extracted as described above. Lipids were separated by TLC using light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:2; per volume) as a solvent. Bands of TAG were scraped off the plate and extracted from the silica gel with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). An aliquot of the isolated TAG was used for quantification as described above. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using LSC Safety (Baker) plus 5% water as a scintillation mixture. To measure enzymatic activity of TAG lipase, 15 μg of TAG (∼80,000 cpm) was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and 150 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 20 μl of a bovine serum albumin solution (20 μg/ml) were added and sonicated for 4 min in a sonicator waterbath at 30 °C. Then 50 μl of 0.2 m MgCl2 were added, and the mixture was pre-warmed at 30 °C. Samples containing TAG lipase activity were added (25 μg of the maximum amount of protein, 600 μlof the maximum volume), and an aliquot was immediately taken as a blank. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and lipids were extracted for at least 45 min at room temperature. Then the organic phase was washed once with 1 ml of 0.034% MgCl2 and three times with 2 ml methanol/H2O/chloroform (48:47:3; per volume) each. Lipids were separated by TLC as described above; bands were visualized with iodine vapor; TAG, fatty acids, and diacylglycerols were scraped off, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting as described above. During systematic analysis of yeast mutants deleted of lipid particle proteins (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar), a strain lacking the gene product of YMR313c (in the following named Tgl3p) was characterized by its elevated level of cellular TAG. The primary sequence of Tgl3p revealed the consensus motif GXSXG, which is conserved among lipolytic enzymes (Fig. 2A). Otherwise, the polypeptide did not exhibit homology to other lipases identified so far. Analysis of the secondary structure of Tgl3p demonstrated the presence of 7 to 8 hydrophobic domains (Fig. 2B). A hydrophobic domain at the C terminus of the protein and the lack of transmembrane domains are characteristic features of lipid particle proteins as reported previously (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). Tgl3p Is a Major Component of Yeast Lipid Particles—Mass spectrometric analysis (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar) had identified Tgl3p as a major component of lipid particles. These studies, however, did not exclude the presence of this polypeptide in other organelles. Therefore, we compared protein patterns of subcellular fractions isolated from wild type, a Δtgl3 deletion mutant, and a strain overexpressing Tgl3p in wild-type background. As can be seen from Fig. 3, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa present in lipid particles of wild type was absent in this fraction from Δtgl3 but highly enriched in the Tgl3p overexpressing strain. Due to the small contribution of lipid particles to total cellular protein, however, no significant changes were observed in the protein patterns of the corresponding homogenates. To examine the possible presence of Tgl3p in other organelles the subcellular distribution of a Tgl3p-GFP hybrid was determined. Fluorescence microscopic inspection of Tgl3p N-terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed the presence of the hybrid in typical lipid particle structures (Fig. 4A). The same staining pattern was observed using the lipophilic fluorescent dye Nile Red which selectively accumulated in lipid particles (Fig. 4B), thus confirming the accumulation of Tgl3p in this compartment. Similar results were obtained with a Tgl3p C-terminally tagged with GFP (data not shown). Western blot analysis of isolated organelles (Fig. 5) confirmed results obtained by fluorescence microscopy. The only signal was seen in the lipid particle fraction, whereas other organelles were devoid of immunoreactive bands. Thus, Tgl3p appears to be exclusively localized to lipid particles.Fig. 5Western blot analysis of organelles from a strain bearing an N-terminal fusion of GFP to Tgl3p.1, vacuoles; 2, lipid particles; 3, 30,000 × g microsomes; 4, 40,000 × g microsomes; 5, 100,000 × g microsomes; 6, cytosol; 7, mitochondria. Each lane contained 10 μg of total protein. Polypeptides were detected by using a monospecific mouse antiserum against GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Δtgl3 Mutation Changes the Cellular Lipid Pattern— Lipid analysis of total extracts from the Δtgl3 deletion strain grown on rich medium had revealed that the ratio of TAG to phospholipids was 3-fold increased compared with wild-type cells (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). This difference depends on the growth status and is less pronounced at the end of the exponential phase than in earlier growth phases. 2K. Athenstaedt, unpublished results. Results obtained by lipid analysis of lipid particles from Δtgl3 confirmed the view that Tgl3p contributes to TAG homeostasis in yeast, although effects observed by deletion or overexpression of Tgl3p were not dramatic (Table I). In the Δtgl3 mutant, the ratio of TAG to protein in lipid particles was increased, whereas it was slightly decreased in the strain overexpressing Tgl3p. In contrast, the content of STE, the second major component of lipid particles, was decreased in the Δtgl3 deletion strain and slightly increased by overexpression of Tgl3p. As a result, the total amount of neutral lipids (TAG and sterols) was higher in Δtgl3 and lower in the Tgl3p overexpressing strain than in wild type, and the ratio of TAG to STE was decreased in the overexpressing strain and increased in the Δtgl3 deletion strain as compared with wild type. At this point, it is noteworthy that more dramatic effects by deletion and overexpression of Tgl3p could not be expected. Most recent experiments in our laboratory2 demonstrated that besides Tgl3p other TAG lipase isoenzymes exist in the yeast. Moreover, regulatory mechanisms unknown so far may contribute to TAG homeostasis in the yeast.Table ITriacylglycerols and sterols in lipid particlesFY1679 (wild-type)Overexpressant of Tgl3pΔtgl3mg/mg proteinTriacylglycerol (TAG)8.507.829.86Steryl esters (STE)4.354.493.56Total neutral lipids12.8512.3113.42TAG:STE ratio1.951.742.77 Open table in a new tab To test whether Tgl3p has a substrate specificity in vivo, we performed fatty acid analysis of the TAG fractions from wild-type and the Δtgl3 deletion strain. As can be seen from Fig. 6, TAG of the mutant contained slightly increased amounts of very long chain fatty acids (C22:0 and C26:0) and more short chain saturated species (C14:0 and C16:0) than wild type. In contrast, the amounts of the mono-unsaturated C16:1 and C18:1 species in TAG of Δtgl3 were slightly decreased resulting in a shift of the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio from 2.03 in wild-type to 1.54 in Δtgl3. The fatty acid pattern of TAG from the Tgl3p-overexpressing strain was similar to that of wild type (data not shown). Thus, the Δtgl3 deletion affects moderately but significantly the fatty acid composition of TAG. Because TAG contains only a small portion of total cellular fatty acids, shifts in the fatty acid pattern of total cell extracts were not observed (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). Tgl3p Catalyzes TAG Lipase Activity in Vitro—To measure TAG lipase activity in vitro, we established an assay that is described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Significant TAG lipase activity was detected in lipid particles isolated from wild type but was absent from lipid particles of Δtgl3 (Table II). Although the amount of Tgl3p in lipid particles of the strain overexpressing this polypeptide exceeded severalfold that of wild-type (see Fig. 2), the TAG lipase activity was only slightly increased (Table II). Lipid particles of the strain expressing Tgl3p-GFP, however, exhibited significantly higher TAG lipase activity than wild type. This result indicated functionality of the hybrid but also suggested that structural modifications caused by the GFP tag may have facilitated access of the substrate to the active center of the enzyme or modified the total structure of the protein in a way that enhanced the enzymatic activity.Table IITriacylglycerol lipase activity in vitroStrainEnzyme sourceLiberated fatty acids/proteinEnrichmentμg/mg min-foldFY1679 (wild-type)Lipid particles0.0711Overexpressant of Tgl3pLipid particles0.1311.8Δtgl3Lipid particlesNDOverexpressant of Tgl3p-(N-GFP)Lipid particles0.2723.8Overexpressant of Tgl3p-His6(N-terminal fusion)Lipid particles0.3725.2Tgl3p-His6 (N-terminal fusion) purified12.3174 Open table in a new tab Although data presented so far strongly suggested that Tgl3p is a TAG lipase, we could not exclude the possibility that this polypeptide acts as an activator/regulator of the lipase reaction. To solve this problem, a Tgl3p-His6 fusion protein was constructed, isolated by chromatography, and tested for its activity. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the Tgl3p-His6 fusion protein was significantly overexpressed in the transformant and accumulated in lipid particles. Isolation of the hybrid using affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” yielded a product purified close to homogeneity. Table II shows that the TAG lipase activity in lipid particles of the Tgl3p-His6 expressing strain was severalfold enhanced over that of wild type. Most importantly, the isolated protein exhibited high specific activity thus confirming that TGL3 is the structural gene for a yeast TAG lipase. Deletion of TGL3 Abolishes TAG Mobilization from Lipid Particles—To examine whether the TAG lipase activity of Tgl3p measured in vitro is also relevant in vivo, we followed mobilization of cellular TAG in the presence of cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis in yeast (35Inokoshi J. Tomoda H. Hashimoto H. Watanabe A. Takeshima H. Omura S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 90-96Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8A, Δtgl3 was more sensitive to cerulenin than wild type. Incubation of wild-type cells with cerulenin led to almost complete depletion of stored TAG within 5 h (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the control with untreated wild-type cells showed a decrease of the TAG level within 3 h followed by a steady increase. This effect is due to the shift of cells to fresh medium. During the same period of observation, the level of TAG in Δtgl3 decreased only slowly more or less independently of the presence of the inhibitor. This minor decrease indicates that Tgl3p is of major relevance for the mobilization of TAG depots in vivo but also shows that besides Tgl3p other TAG lipases appear to be active in the yeast. The hypersensitivity of Δtgl3 to cerulenin may be caused by the failure of this mutant to mobilize TAG depots under conditions of fatty acid depletion. Cells overexpressing Tgl3p or harboring Tgl3p-GFP mobilized TAG with almost the same rate as wild type upon cerulenin treatment (data not shown). Thus, the lipase activity of Tgl3p is not the limiting factor for TAG mobilization in wild type. Even though STE did not accumulate in Δtgl3 (see Table I) and measurements in vivo and in vitro (see Fig. 8 and Table II) indicated that Tgl3p is a TAG lipase, we tested the possibility whether Tgl3p might be involved in unspecific mobilization of neutral lipids from lipid particles in vivo. Such a function was ascribed to perilipins of mammalian cells (for a review see Ref. 1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar). The yeast Tgl3p, however, has no such properties. When terbinafine, an inhibitor of squalene epoxidase (Erg1p) (36Leber R. Landl K. Zinser E. Ahorn H. Spök A. Kohlwein S.D. Turnowsky F. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 375-386Google Scholar), was added to Δtgl3, STE of lipid particles were mobilized at wild-type rates, and no hypersensitivity of the mutant against this drug was observed (Fig. 9). Previous studies from our laboratory had revealed that in a yeast strain bearing a deletion of YMR313c/TGL3, the amount of TAG was significantly increased compared with wild type (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). This observation may be interpreted in three different ways: Tgl3p could act as (i) a bona fide TAG lipase; (ii) an auxiliary factor of a TAG lipase, e.g. a docking protein for a cytosolic lipase; or (iii) a negative regulator of TAG synthesis. To distinguish between these possibilities and to determine the function of this protein, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments with wild type, Δtgl3, and a Tgl3p overexpressing strain. The results of these experiments revealed that Tgl3p (i) is involved in TAG catabolism in vivo, (ii) exhibits TAG lipase activity in highly purified lipid particles, and (iii) is enzymatically active in vitro when purified close to homogeneity. Thus, all data presented here clearly support the view that Tgl3p is a TAG lipase and the first enzyme of this kind from S. cerevisiae identified by function at the molecular level. Although Tgl3p does not show homology to other known lipases, the consensus sequence GXSXG of lipolytic enzymes present in Tgl3p is in line with its identification as a lipase. Most recently, a lipase from Candida parapsilosis was identified, which also contains the consensus motif but lacks similarity with other lipases (37Neugnot V. Moulin G. Debreucq E. Bigey F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1734-1745Google Scholar). How does accumulation of TAG affect cell growth? In the Δtgl3 mutant the moderate increase of the TAG level does not lead to major phenotypic alterations (21Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar) except the hypersensitivity to cerulenin (see Fig. 8A). In contrast, a dramatic accumulation of TAG in humans results in severe defects as observed with patients suffering from a metabolic disorder named neutral lipid storage disease (38Radom J. Salvayre R. Maret A. Negre A. Douste-Balzy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 131-139Google Scholar). In cultured neutral lipid storage disease fibroblasts TAG with long acyl chains (C12 and longer) remained undegraded, whereas short/medium chain (C4 to C10) TAG species and endogenous STE were mobilized at a normal rate (39Hilaire N.

This result is reminiscent of the slight substrate specificity of the yeast Tgl3p in vivo (see Fig. 6). Localization of Tgl3p in lipid particles raised the question as to the coordinate formation, storage, and mobilization/degradation of TAG. How can Tgl3p be prevented from permanent lysis of TAG stored in lipid particles? Although we cannot yet answer this question at the molecular level, we can speculate about regulatory aspects by comparing the yeast system to other experimental systems. Wiggins and Gibbons (40Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Google Scholar) reported that about 70% of newly synthesized TAG in the rat liver is subjected to a lipolysis/re-esterification cycle before being secreted in the form of very low density lipoproteins. Yang et al. (41Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Google Scholar) reported that a minimum of 60% of the very low density lipoprotein-TAG is derived from the stored TAG by lipolysis/re-esterification. Lehner et al. (11Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-766Google Scholar) showed that a TAG lipase is associated with the cytoplasmic TAG droplet in pig liver and that the ontogeny of the TAG lipase seems to be coordinated with very low density lipoprotein secretion by the liver. Similar mechanisms of lipolysis/re-esterification may also exist in the yeast. Studies from our laboratory revealed that yeast lipid particles, besides TAG lipase activity, also harbor a TAG synthase (42Sorger D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Google Scholar). Thus, a lipolysis/re-esterification cycle may also exist in yeast lipid particles. Regulation in vivo through presently unknown mechanisms may favor one or the other direction of this enzymatic step leading either to accumulation or mobilization of TAG depots. Depending on the requirement for fatty acids, stores of TAG may be utilized to a greater or lesser extent. Even though the in vivo experiment shown in Fig. 8 using the inhibitor cerulenin revealed that cleavage of TAG strongly depends on Tgl3p, the moderate decrease of the TAG content observed in Δtgl3 suggests the existence of additional TAG lipases with minor enzymatic activities in yeast. Another indication for the presence of additional TAG lipase activities was the observation that the fatty acid pattern of TAG from the Δtgl3 deletion mutant was different from that of wild type (see Fig. 6) and of strains deleted of two homologues of Tgl3p.2 A common feature of Tgl3p and its homologues is their increased expression during sporulation. Systematic analysis of the neutral lipid patterns of single and multiple deletion strains will show whether the TGL3 homologues are also involved in TAG mobilization. Furthermore, these investigations may elucidate a possible role of this gene family during yeast spore formation."

Gene deletion studies in mice have implicated Stat5b and to a lesser extent Stat5a as components of the GH signaling pathways that are responsible for normal postnatal somatic growth. The absence of Stat5b appears to phenocopy GH receptor deficiency in male mice but not in females, leading to animals up to 30% smaller than heterozygous or wild-type littermates, whereas in both female and male mice the double knockout of Stat5a and Stat5b caused a decline in growth rates (6Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 7Teglund S. McKay C.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a highly conserved 70-residue secreted protein, also plays an essential role in regulating somatic growth (8Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr.

Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). In GH-deficient hypophysectomized rats IGF-I serum levels are reduced to less than 5% of normal, and hormone treatment restores IGF-I toward the normal range within several hours (8Daughaday W.H.

GH also rapidly induces IGF-I mRNA expression in multiple tissues in vivo through acute stimulation of IGF-I gene transcription by mechanisms that have not been fully characterized but appear to be independent of new protein synthesis (11Hynes M.A. Van Wyk J.J.

In male mice lacking Stat5b and in female and male mice lacking both Stat5a and b, serum IGF-I concentrations are reduced only to 50–70% of normal (6Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J.

By contrast, Davey et al. (15Davey H.W. Xie T. McLachlan M.J. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Grattan D.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown that in Stat5b-deficient hypophysectomized male mice a week of GH treatment failed to induce either IGF-I mRNA or protein expression, potentially implicating Stat5b as being important for this chronic response to hormone treatment but without uncovering any mechanisms. We now have used replication-defective adenoviruses encoding either a constitutively active or dominant-negative version of rat Stat5b to directly assess the role of this transcription factor in the acute regulation of IGF-I gene expression by GH in vivo. Our results demonstrate that Stat5b is an essential intermediate in GH-stimulated IGF-I gene transcription and establish the feasibility of selectively targeting components of complex signal transduction pathways in experimental animals. Materials—Antibodies to Akt and Erks were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-Stat1 (anti-ISGF3 p91/p84) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-Stat3 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), anti-SP1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Goat anti-mouse-Alexa 488 conjugate was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant rat GH was from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Core Facility. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from commercial suppliers. Recombinant Plasmids—pEGFP-N3 was from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; pShuttle and pAdEasy were from Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada. The mouse GH receptor in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. F. Talamantes (University of California, Santa Cruz, CA). The 8xGHRE-TK Cat and TK Luc plasmids were gifts from Dr. Susan Berry (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). Reporter gene 8xGHRE-TK Luc was constructed by substituting the luciferase coding region from TK Luc for Cat by standard molecular biological methods. A cDNA encoding rat Stat5b was a gift from Dr. Christin Carter-Su (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). It was modified by addition of an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag by site-directed mutagenesis. Point mutations were introduced to create Stat5bDN (Y699F) and Stat5bCA (N642H) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For each Stat5b recombinant plasmid, the coding region was verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Adenoviruses encoding EGFP, Stat5b, and mutant Stat5bs were prepared following procedures described by the provider of pAdEasy. The DNA inserts were checked by PCR and by restriction enzyme mapping, and the recombinant viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells. All viruses were purified over a discontinuous CsCl gradient and titered by optical density. Reporter Gene Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for the mouse GH receptor and 8xGHRE-TK Luc reporter gene using Fugene-6 and a protocol from the supplier. After incubation for 16 h cells were infected with either Ad-EGFP, or different Ad-Stat5b variants, and Ad-tTA, each at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Ad-tTA encodes a tetracycline-inhibited transcriptional activator that binds to response elements adjacent to the promoter-regulating gene encoding either EGFP or Stat5b in each recombinant adenovirus and is required for gene expression. 8 h later, after addition of serum-free media containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and recombinant rat GH (1 μg/ml final concentration) or vehicle, cells were incubated for 16 h, harvested, and cell lysates used for luciferase assays. For co-infection experiments, COS-7 cells were transfected as described above, followed by infection with Ad-Stat5bWT, Ad-tTA, and either Ad-β galactosidase or Ad-Stat5bDN at a ratio of 1:10. This corresponded to a multiplicity of infection of 10 for Ad-Stat5bWT, 90 for Ad-β galactosidase or Ad-Stat5bDN, and 100 for Ad-tTA. Subsequent steps were as outlined above. Animal Studies—Male Sprague-Dawley rats, hypophysectomized by a transauricular route at age 7 weeks, were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed at the OHSU Animal Care Facility on a 12-h light/dark schedule with free access to food and water, and received care according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. All procedures were pre-approved by the OHSU Animal Care and Use Committee. Glucocorticoids (cortisol phosphate, 400 μg/kg/day) and thyroxine (10 μg/kg/day) were replaced by daily subcutaneous injection, and GH deficiency was confirmed by failure to grow during a 2-week observation period. Following this interval, rats were injected via tail vein with 0.2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 × 1010 plaque forming units (pfu) of Ad-EGFP, Ad-Stat5bDN, or Ad-Stat5bCA plus 2 × 109 pfu of helper virus Ad-tTA. In pilot experiments, the lowest dose of viruses that gave nearly complete liver cell infection in vivo was determined by analysis of primary hepatocytes isolated using the collagenase method (16Yoon J.B. Berry S.A. Seelig S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19947-19954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar approach was used to document quantitative infection with Ad-Stat5bDN and Ad-Stat5CA, except that isolated hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained using antibody to the FLAG epitope tag at a 1:1000 dilution (see Fig. 2). For studies of GH action, rats were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle (saline) or 1.5 μg/g recombinant rat GH at 48 h after infection. Following an incubation period of 30–120 min, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and sacrificed. Liver proteins and RNA were isolated as outlined below. Protein Immunoblotting—Isolation of hepatic nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins has been described previously (3Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for2hat15 °C, and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer as follows: α-Akt, α-Erks, α-SP1, 1:1000; α-Stat1, 1:250; α-Stat3, 1:2500; α-FLAG (M2), 1:2000. After removal of primary antibodies, incubation with AP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 90 min, and additional washes, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence followed by detection using a Molecular Imager FX and quantification using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). DNA-Protein Binding Studies—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (17Thomas M.J. Gronowski A.M. Berry S.A. Bergad P.L. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with 10 or 2 μg of rat hepatic nuclear proteins and a 5′-fluorescein-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide from the rat β-casein gene (top strand, GAACTTCTTGGAATTAAG; bottom strand, CTTAATTCCAAGAAGTTC) (18Bergad P.L.

After incubation of proteins and DNA for 30 min at 4 °C, products were separated by electrophoresis through non-denaturing, 4–12% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 120 V for 2 h at 20 °C. Results were detected using a Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total liver and hepatic nuclear RNA was isolated as described previously (13Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and its quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl using an RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), with either oligo-dT primers (for total RNA) or random hexamers (for nuclear RNA). Each PCR reaction contained 0.5 μl of cDNA. Primer sequences are listed in Table I. The linear range of product amplification was established in pilot studies for each primer pair, and the cycle number that reflected the approximate midpoint was used in final experiments. This varied from 18 to 25 cycles for total RNA and from 25 to 30 cycles for nuclear RNA. Results were quantified by densitometry after electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCR of total (A) and nuclear RNA (B)GeneLocationDNA sequenceProduct sizebpA) Total RNASpi 2.1Exon 35′-TATGTCCGGGATGAGGAACTCTC371Exon 55′-TGTAGCAGCAGTTGCTTCTGTGCc-fosExon 15′-TGATGTTCTCGGGTTTCAACGCG374Exon 25′-TTCTGCCGATGCTCTGCGCTCTGAPDHExon 55′-TGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTCG365Exon 85′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTGGGS17:Exon 25′-ATCCCCAGCAAAAACCTTCGGAACA301Exon 55′-TATGGCATAATGGATTAAACAGCTCIGF-IExon 15′-GCCTGCGCAATCGAAATAAAGTCC347Exon 35′-GTAAAAGCCCCTTGGTCCACACAIGF-IExon 25′-GTACCAAAATGAGCGCACCTCCA175Exon 35′-GTAAAAGCCCCTTGGTCCACACASpi 2.1Exon 35′-TATGTCCGGGATGAGGAACTCTC225Intron 35′-TCACTGGCCATCAGGCAACAGCAB) Nuclear RNAc-fosExon 15′-TGATGTTCTCGGGTTTCAACGCG200Intron 15′-CCAATGTGCCCTCCTCGGCGACCIGF-1Exon 15′-GCCTGCGCAATCGAAATAAAGTCC397Intron 15′-AATGCATTCATCTCCCGGACCTCIGF-IExon 25′-GTACCAAAATGAGCGCACCTCCA316Intron 25′-CTCCCCATATGTTCTCCATTCCC Open table in a new tab Development of Recombinant Adenoviruses Encoding Rat Stat5b and Variants—To determine if Stat5b plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of IGF-I gene expression, we first constructed a series of recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type, dominant-negative, and constitutively active versions of the protein. Dominant-negative rat Stat5b (Ad-Stat5bDN) contained a substitution mutation of phenylalanine for tyrosine at amino acid 699. The mutation prevents phosphorylation at this residue, thus blocking the inducible dimerization of two Stat5b molecules and the subsequent nuclear import that occurs normally after hormone treatment (20Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 21Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Constitutively active Stat5b (Ad-Stat5bCA) contains a point mutation of histidine for asparagine at residue 642 that was modeled after an activating mutation in the analogous location in Stat5a (22Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test the function of recombinant adenoviruses encoding these proteins, they were introduced by infection into COS-7 cells that had been transfected a day earlier with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and the hormone-responsive reporter gene, 8xGHRE-TK Luc. GH treatment caused a 7.5-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells infected with Ad-Stat5bWT. No increase in gene expression was observed after GH in cells infected with Ad-Stat5bDN or control virus (Ad-EGFP), and luciferase activity remained at basal levels. In cells receiving Ad-Stat5bCA, reporter gene activity was enhanced in the absence of GH to levels equivalent to those seen after hormone treatment of cells infected with Ad-Stat5bWT, and GH caused a small further rise in luciferase (Fig. 1A). As seen in Fig. 1B, Stat5b protein expression from all three recombinant adenoviruses was similar. To test the function of Ad-Stat5bDN, cells were co-infected with Ad-Stat5bWT, and either Ad-Stat5bDN or an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-β-galactosidase) at a ratio of 1:10 as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Ad-Stat5bDN completely prevented induction of reporter gene expression by GH, whereas Ad-β-galactosidase was ineffective (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, we conclude that both Ad-Stat5bCA and Ad-Stat5bDN function appropriately. Quantitative Liver Expression after in Vivo Infection with Ad-Stat5b Variants—Traditional analyses of gene activation and studies in transgenic mice have not yielded the molecular mechanisms by which GH regulates IGF-I gene expression (23Benbassat C. Shoba L.N. Newman M. Adamo M.L. Frank S.J. Lowe Jr., W.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Ye P. Umayahara Y. Ritter D. Bunting T. Auman H. Rotwein P. D'Ercole A.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5466-5475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Adamo M.L. Diabetes Rev. 1995; 3: 2-27Google Scholar), even though in vivo studies have demonstrated that GH exerts a rapid and potent stimulatory effect on IGF-I transcription in the liver (13Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus to assess any potential role of Stat5b in GH-induced IGF-I gene expression, it was necessary to establish conditions in which quantitative in vivo hepatic infection with recombinant adenoviruses could be achieved. At optimal doses of viruses (2 × 1010 pfu of Ad-Stat5b and 2 × 109 pfu of Ad-tTA), we found that 80–90% of liver cells were infected in vivo, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry of subsequently isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). In the absence of co-infection with Ad-tTA, no Stat5b was produced (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2B, hypophysectomized rats treated without GH or with hormone for up to 120 min expressed relatively comparable levels of FLAG-tagged Stat5bDN or Stat5bCA, which was absent in rats infected with Ad-EGFP. We were unable to determine the effects of infection with either Ad-Stat5bDN or Ad-Stat5bCA on endogenous Stat5b, because both native and recombinant proteins reacted with Stat5b antibodies. Assessing Signal Transduction Pathways Regulated by GH in Hypophysectomized Rats Expressing Stat5b Variants—Fig. 3 shows results of time-course experiments designed to evaluate intracellular signal transduction pathways that are usually activated by GH (1Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3A, Erk phosphorylation is acutely stimulated by in vivo GH treatment, as evidenced in rats infected with Ad-EGFP by detection of phosphorylated Erks 1 and 2 beginning at 30 min after hormone injection and continuing for up to 120 min, with a peak response of 3-fold above baseline at 30 min. An analogous time course of induction of Erk phosphorylation was observed in rats receiving either Ad-Stat5bDN or Ad-Stat5bCA (2-fold above time 0 at 30 min for Ad-Stat5bDN and 3-fold for Ad-Stat5bCA). Akt also becomes rapidly phosphorylated after GH (1Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), as seen in Fig. 3B, and was induced for up to 120 min after GH in hypophysectomized rats infected with any of the three recombinant viruses, although a slightly higher level of basal phosphorylation was noted in animals expressing Ad-Stat5bCA. This latter result is consistent with a prior observation in cultured cells overexpressing Stat5aCA (26Santos S.C. Lacronique V. Bouchaert I. Monni R. Bernard O. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2080-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At 30 min after GH in rats infected with any of the recombinant adenoviruses, levels of pAkt were nearly 7-fold above baseline values. In addition to Stat5, the nuclear expression and activity of Stats 1 and 3 is acutely stimulated by in vivo GH treatment (3Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gronowski A.M. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Rotwein P. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, nuclear accumulation of these latter transcription factors was rapidly induced by GH in rats expressing each recombinant virus, although in animals infected with Ad-Stat5bDN, basal nuclear expression of each protein was increased slightly in the absence of GH. Nevertheless, at 30 min after GH, nuclear Stat1 was 2-fold above basal levels in rats infected with each of the recombinant adenoviruses; nuclear Stat3 was 3-fold higher than baseline, except in animals infected with Ad-Stat5bDN, where it was 2-fold higher. No change in abundance was seen for the constitutively nuclear transcription factor SP1, confirming that equal amounts of nuclear protein were examined at each time point. Taken together, results from these experiments show that forced expression of recombinant adenoviruses for Stat5b or EGFP did not impede the acute biological effects of GH at the levels of cytoplasmic or nuclear signaling. The activity of Stat5 was assessed in rats infected with recombinant adenoviruses by gel mobility shift assays, using hepatic nuclear protein extracts isolated before or after GH treatment, and a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the GH/prolactin response element from the β-casein gene. As seen in Fig. 3D, in Ad-EGFP-infected pituitary-deficient rats, GH stimulated sustained nuclear expression and DNA binding activity of Stat5. GH-induced binding toward the β-casein GH/prolactin DNA response element was markedly reduced after forced expression of Stat5bDN with a detectable gel shift being seen only at a single time point, 30 min after GH, where Stat5bDN protein expression was slightly diminished compared with other animals (see Fig. 2B). In contrast, DNA binding activity was greatly enhanced even in the absence of GH in rats infected with Ad-Stat5bCA. Taken together with the results in Fig. 3 (A–C), the observations in Fig. 3D demonstrate the effectiveness and specificity of in vivo delivered Stat5bDN and Stat5bCA, respectively, in repressing or activating Stat5 function in the liver. Hormonal Regulation of Gene Expression—We next examined the effects of Stat5bDN and Stat5bCA on GH-regulated hepatic gene expression. RNA was isolated at various times after GH injection and used as template for measurement of mRNA abundance by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (for primers see Table I). Spi 2.1 is a GH-stimulated liver-specific gene whose expression is dependent on active Stat5 (16Yoon J.B. Berry S.A. Seelig S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19947-19954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, GH induced Spi 2.1 mRNA within 120 min of hormone treatment in Ad-EGFP-infected rats but not in Ad-Stat5bDN rats. Infection with Ad-Stat5bCA caused a marked increase in Spi 2.1 transcript abundance even in the absence of GH, and hormone treatment had little additional effect. The gene encoding c-fos is also rapidly induced by GH in vivo (27Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but by mechanisms that are dependent in part on Stats 1 and 3 (28Chen C. Clarkson R.W. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4505-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4A, c-fos gene expression was increased with similarly rapid kinetics after GH administration in all three groups of rats, although a greater induction was observed in animals infected with Ad-Stat5bDN. Control mRNAs encoding GAPDH and ribosomal protein S17 were unaltered by GH under all experimental conditions (Fig. 4A). IGF-I gene transcription is regulated in the liver by two adjacent promoters, termed P1 and P2, respectively, which control expression of IGF-I mRNAs containing distinct 5′ exons, 1 and 2, that are individually spliced to a common exon 3 (29Rotwein P. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts Jr., C.T. The IGF System. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 19-35Crossref Google Scholar). Regulation by GH of transcripts directed by each promoter was assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using the primers listed in Table I. In hypophysectomized rats infected with Ad-EGFP, GH induced an increase in expression of exon 1-containing mRNAs within 60 min of hormone treatment, and exon 2-containing transcripts within 120 min. Induction of IGF-I mRNAs was blocked in rats infected with Ad-Stat5bDN and was enhanced in animals expressing Ad-Stat5bCA, even in the absence of GH (Fig. 4B). Hormonal Control of Gene Transcription—Based on the results seen in Fig. 4, it appears that Stat5b was both necessary and sufficient for GH-dependent gene expression of Spi 2.1 and IGF-I but was not required for c-fos. To extend these observations in a more mechanistic direction, we next assessed hormone-regulated gene transcription in nuclear RNA by use of a semi-quantitative RT-RCR assay that measures accumulation of nascent transcripts for each gene.

https://openalex.org/W2097536945,"A previous report from this laboratory described two novel proteins that have sequence similarity to A20, a negative regulator of NF-κB (Evans, P. C., Taylor, E. R., Coadwell, J., Heyninck, K., Beyaert, R., and Kilshaw, P. J. (2001) Biochem. J. 357, 617–623). One of these molecules, cellular zinc finger anti-NF-κB (Cezanne), a 100-kDa cytoplasmic protein, also suppressed NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that Cezanne is a novel deubiquitinating enzyme, distinct from the two known families of deubiquitinases, Types I and II. We show that Cezanne contains an N-terminal catalytic domain that belongs to the recently discovered ovarian tumor protein (OTU) superfamily, a group of proteins displaying structural similarity to cysteine proteases but having no previously described function. Recombinant Cezanne cleaved ubiquitin monomers from linear or branched synthetic ubiquitin chains and from ubiquitinated proteins. Mutation of a conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic site of the proteolytic domain caused Cezanne to co-precipitate polyubiquitinated cellular proteins. We also provide evidence for an additional ubiquitin binding site in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Our data provide the first demonstration of functional activity among OTU proteins. A previous report from this laboratory described two novel proteins that have sequence similarity to A20, a negative regulator of NF-κB (Evans, P. C., Taylor, E.

The activities of numerous cellular proteins are regulated by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (1Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin genes encode tandem repeats of several ubiquitin units which are joined by α-amino, peptide bonds. These linear polyubiquitin chains are processed to generate reactive ubiquitin monomers. Ubiquitin is covalently attached to substrate lysine residues through the concerted action of E1, 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase; UBP, ubiquitin-specific processing protease; AMC, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; AD, Gal-4 activation domain; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; OTU, ovarian tumor protein. E2, and E3 ubiquitin ligases, which together determine substrate specificity. Successive rounds of ubiquitination, where ubiquitin is itself ubiquitinated, generate an isopeptide-linked branched chain. Proteins modified with a polyubiquitin chain conjugated through lysine 48 are targeted to the proteasome, where they are degraded. Recent data suggest that alternative forms of ubiquitin modification, such as monoubiquitination or assembly of Lys63-linked chains, regulate intracellular localization of proteins and signaling activities. Deubiquitinating enzymes are important regulators of this process (2Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Molecules belonging to the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family (Type I) are small (20–30 kDa) and highly conserved. They cleave α-amino linked (linear) polyubiquitin chains and are required for the generation of reactive ubiquitin monomers from polyubiquitin gene products. The UBP family (Type II) comprises over 90 proteases that have a range of cellular functions. Molecules belonging to this family are large (60–300 kDa) and highly divergent except for two short conserved sequences that surround the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues. UBP enzymes are able to hydrolyze branched polyubiquitin chains. They play an important role in proteasome function (3Lam Y.A. DeMartino G.N. Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28438-28446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and in generating free ubiquitin monomers from branched chains for recycling (5Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, some UBP molecules can regulate the fate of specific cellular proteins. Thus, removal of ubiquitin chains will extend the half-life of these molecules and therefore modulate their particular activities in the cell. For example, genetic experiments in Drosophila have revealed that liquid facets protein is the specific target of Fat facets, a UBP molecule involved in eye development (6Fischer J.A. Leavell S.K. Li Q. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fat facets stabilizes liquid facets through deubiquitination (7Chen X. Zhang B. Fischer J.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the great majority of UBP molecules, however, substrate specificity has not been determined. The JAMM family of metalloproteases that cleave ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules has also been identified recently (8Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 9Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinating activity by one of these enzymes, Rpn11, is essential for degradation of substrate proteins by the 26 S proteasome (9Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered two novel proteins, Cezanne and TRABID, with sequence similarity to A20, an important negative regulator of the transcription factor NF-κB (11Evans P.C. Taylor E.R. Coadwell J. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Kilshaw P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cezanne also has the capacity to suppress NF-κB. Here, we demonstrate that Cezanne is a novel type of deubiquitinating enzyme. This activity may explain its inhibitory effect on NF-κB. Mammalian Cells—COS7 and HeLa cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal-calf serum, supplemented with antibiotics. Yeast Expression Vectors—Cloning was performed by recombinant PCR using Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The yeast expression vector pGBKT7 (Clontech Laboratories) was used to express fusions between the DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor, a Myc epitope tag, and Cezanne (driven by the ADH1 promoter). The primers used to amplify regions corresponding to Cezanne residues 17–858 (5′-GCTGGAATTCACCCTGGACATGGATGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTGTCGACTCAGAACCTGTGCACCAGGAG-3′), residues 17–443 (5′-GCTGGAATTCACCCTGGACATGGATGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTGTCGACCATGTAGCTATGCAGCAGATGC-3′), or residues 444–858 (5′-GCTGGAATTCAATGTGAAGTGGATCCCACTG-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTGTCGACTCAGAACCTGTGCACCAGGAG-3′) incorporated SalI or EcoRI restriction sites, which facilitated directional cloning of cDNA in frame with GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Bacterial Expression Vectors—pDEST15 (Invitrogen) was used for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cezanne fusion proteins in Escherichia coli in response to isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase (IPTG). PCR primers amplified cDNA corresponding to residues 126–455 (sense, 5′-CACCGAGAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGTCGGTCCCATGTCTCCTCCAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTACTAGAACTCCTCTGCATCAGAGGACAGTGGGATCCACTT-3′) or residues 182–455 (sense, 5′-CACCGAGAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGTGCAGGGCGTTTGAACTGG-3′; antisense as above). Sense primers incorporated nucleotides encoding the tobacco etch virus protease recognition site and nucleotides required for topoisomerase cloning. Antisense primers incorporated stop codons. Amplified sequences were cloned initially into pENTR/D-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and then into pDEST15, using the GATEWAY system (Invitrogen). Mammalian Expression Vectors—pHM6 was used to express molecules tagged at the N terminus with hemagglutinin (HA) in mammalian cells (driven by a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter). Construction of pHM6-Cezanne 1–858 and pHM6-Cezanne 1–443 has been described previously (11Evans P.C. Taylor E.R. Coadwell J. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Kilshaw P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was achieved using pcDNA3.1-FLAG-ubiquitin, kindly supplied by Dr. I. Dikic (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Mutagenesis—QuikChange technology (Stratagene) was used to change two nucleotides at codon 209 (Cys to Ala) in pGBKT7-Cezanne 17–858, pHM6-Cezanne 1–858, and pHM6-Cezanne 1–443 using complementary primers (sense, 5′-CTACTGGAGATGGGAACGCCCTCCTGCATGCAGCCTC-3′). This method was also used to introduce a point mutation at codon 209 (Cys to Ser) in pHM6-Cezanne 1–858 (sense, 5′-GGAGATGGGAACAGCCTCCTGCATGCAG-3′). QuikChange PCR using this primer set was unsuccessful when pG-BKT7-Cezanne 17–443 was used as template. An alternative strategy was employed, which involved amplification of two overlapping products (using primers 5′-GCTGGAATTCACCCTGGACATGGATGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CTGAATCAAGTAGGCTGTCTCCTGCAGTCC-3′ or 5′-GGACTGCAGGAGACAGCCTACTTGATTCAG-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTGTCGACTCAGAACCTGTGCACCAGGAG-3′, respectively). The two products were then denatured and annealed, and 3′ ends were extended using polymerase. cDNA corresponding to residues 17–443 was then amplified by PCR and inserted into pGBKT7, following restriction with EcoRI and SalI. DNA sequencing was used to ensure that each construct was inserted in frame with N-terminal residues and to verify changes at codon 209. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The yeast two-hybrid system was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech). In the first instance, it was ensured that co-transformation of yeast strain YRG-2 with various pGBKT7-Cezanne constructs (17–858, 17–443, 444–858, 17–443 C209S, 17–858 C209A, or 17–443 C209A) plus empty pGAD424 would not generate colony growth on minimal medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His in the presence of 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (–Trp, –Leu, –His, +3AT). The cDNA library used was derived from whole mouse embryos and cloned into pGAD424 in frame with the activation domain of GAL4 (AD) using methods described previously (12De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This library was screened using pGBKT7-Cezanne 17–858, and clones containing putative interacting proteins were identified by growth on minimal medium lacking essential amino acids (–Trp, –Leu, –His, +3AT) and by expression of β-galactosidase. pGAD424 plasmid DNA was harvested from positive clones and amplified using Escherichia coli as host. Each plasmid was then used to retransform yeast together with either pGBKT7-Cezanne 17–858 or empty pGBKT7. Colony growth on minimal medium lacking Trp and Leu was assessed to ensure that the transformation efficiency using either construct was identical. Clones that reacted exclusively with pGBKT7-Cezanne 17–858 were sequenced. In Vitro Peptidase and Isopeptidase Assays—In vitro hydrolysis assays were performed by incubating potential proteases with substrate in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij, 3 mm dithiothreitol; 40-μl total volume) at 37 °C for varying lengths of time. For peptidase assays, a fluorescent substrate was used (Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (Bachem)) at a final concentration of 10 μm. Hydrolysis of the peptide bond between Gly and AMC was assessed over time using a fluorimeter (Cytofluor II; PerSeptive Biosystems). Test material was prepared as follows: E. coli (Rosetta, Novagen) transformed with pDEST (15)126–455 or pDEST (15)182–455 were cultured in the presence of 0.4 mm IPTG for 6 h to induce expression of GST fusion proteins (or remained untreated as a control). Bacteria from each 50-ml culture were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of BugBuster (Novagen), 0.04% β-mercaptoethanol, 25 units of benzonase (Novagen), 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA and clarified by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Hydrolysis reactions were performed using 5 μl of lysate, which gave a final concentration of each GST fusion protein of 15 nm (estimated by Coomassie staining of lysates alongside standards of known concentration, following gel electrophoresis). For isopeptidase assays, a mixed population of branched polyubiquitin chains polymerized through Lys48 (Affiniti Research Products) was used as substrate at a final concentration of 1 μm. Preparation of test material was carried out as follows. (i) GST-Cezanne 126–455, GST-Cezanne 182–455, and a GST-tagged irrelevant molecule (Vav2; kindly supplied by Dr. M. Turner, Babraham Institute) were harvested from E. coli as described earlier. They were either tested in crude form (denoted as lysate) or purified using a glutathione column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified material was eluted from the column using 20 mm glutathione, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8), NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Material was then used either directly in isopeptidase assays (denoted as purified) or used after dialysis against PBS (denoted as purified/dialyzed). Analysis of the purified material by gel electrophoresis/silver staining identified only trace amounts of impurities (<1%), which were present at identical levels in each preparation (data not shown). All forms of the GST fusion protein or isopeptidase T (Affiniti Research Products), which served as a positive control, were tested at a final concentration of 15 nm. In some experiments, the GST tag was removed from GST-Cezanne 126–455 protein by digestion with tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen). Material was then loaded onto a glutathione column to remove undigested fusion protein and released GST, before final purification of Cezanne 126–455 by gel filtration on a Superose75 column (Amersham Biosciences). (ii) Alternatively, HA-tagged molecules were tested after immunoprecipitation from COS7 cells. Cultures in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with various pHM6 constructs using DEAE-dextran, according to standard protocol. After 40 h, cells were washed using PBS before application of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2) plus reversible protease inhibitors (10 μm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and precleared using 150 μl of Sepharose 4B. HA-tagged molecules were then immunoprecipitated using 12 μl of anti-HA antibody bound covalently to matrix (Roche Applied Science). Beads were then washed twice using lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl; once using lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl; and then three times using reaction buffer (see above) before 50% were used in hydrolysis reactions. For inhibition of deubiquitinating activity, Cezanne was preincubated in the presence of 2 mm ubiquitin aldehyde (Affiniti Research Products) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following hydrolysis, ubiquitin was revealed by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), and chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Assay of Deubiquitination in Cultured Cells—HeLa cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-FLAG-ubiquitin plus 2.5 μg of various pHM6-Cezanne constructs (or with empty pHM6) using Genejuice, following the manufacturer's recommendations (Novagen). A relatively low amount of FLAG-ubiquitin expression vector was used to ensure that proteins modified with FLAG-ubiquitin were derived from cells that also expressed the HA-tagged molecule. After 48 h, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 1 h (or remained untreated). Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG (1:500; Sigma) or anti-HA (1:1000; Roche Applied Science) primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. To control for the total amounts of protein loaded, blots were stripped and reprobed using anti-α-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation of Ubiquitinated Cellular Proteins—COS7 cells cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were transfected with a pHM6 expression vector containing a HA-tagged version of Cezanne (as indicated) or with empty pHM6 (vector), using DEAE dextran. After 24 h, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 1 h (or remained untreated, as indicated) before the addition of lysis buffer (see earlier) plus irreversible protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and precleared twice using 50 μl of Sepharose 4B. HA-tagged molecules were immunoprecipitated using 30 μl of anti-HA matrix (Roche Applied Science). Beads were then washed four times using lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The levels of immunoprecipitated Cezanne protein were revealed by silver staining following gel electrophoresis, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad). Co-immunoprecipitating material was detected by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), and chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Sequence Structure Homology Recognition—Sequence data base searching was carried out using Psi-BLAST (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with the NCBI nonredundant data base, and multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Secondary structure predictions were obtained from the programs PHD (available on the World Wide Web at cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/) and PSIPRED (available on the World Wide Web at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/). Structure-based sequence alignments were generated using COMPARER (13Zhu Z.Y. Sali A. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the resultant output formatted with JOY (14Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2469-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of A20 family and ovarian tumor protein (OTU) superfamily sequences together with the protease structures was then created using FUGUE (15Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Comparative models were constructed using Modeler (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) for Cezanne and other family members on the basis of known structures of homologous enzymes and their precursors. These were used to optimize the alignment and increase confidence about the location of the N and C termini of the protease region of Cezanne. Cezanne Cleaves Polyubiquitin Gene Products—Yeast two-hybrid screening of a murine whole embryo cDNA library with full-length Cezanne showed that 29 clones of 93 analyzed contained polyubiquitin genes. Start points of polyubiquitin cDNA varied between clones and were in frame with the GAL4 AD. Neither polyubiquitin nor Cezanne bound components of the GAL4 transcription factor, thus demonstrating that the interaction between Cezanne and polyubiquitin was genuine (data not shown). Data base searches have previously identified weak sequence similarity between the N-terminal region of Cezanne and molecules related to Drosophila OTU (17Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 50-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (see Supplementary Figure). OTU is the founder member of a superfamily of over 80 proteins predicted to be cysteine proteases. They contain conserved cysteine and histidine residues in a putative catalytic site. For Cezanne, the residues are Cys209 and His373 (Fig. 1). A proteolytic function for OTU-like molecules has not been previously demonstrated. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to investigate whether the putative catalytic cysteine of the proposed protease domain (see Fig. 1) may effect the interaction with polyubiquitin that we observed in our initial screen. The ability of this region of Cezanne (residues 17–443) to interact with polyubiquitin was enhanced considerably by mutating cysteine 209 to serine (Fig. 2, A and B) or to alanine (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with the interpretation that the mutation prevented proteolytic activity and trapped the substrate, thus enhancing activation of yeast two-hybrid reporter genes. Interestingly, the full-length version of wild-type Cezanne (residues 17–858) yielded a higher colony count when co-transformed with polyubiquitin than the putative protease domain alone (residues 17–443) (Fig. 2B). A separate yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was performed using the C-terminal half of Cezanne as bait (residues 444–858). A total of 90 clones of 92 analyzed contained polyubiquitin genes, which were in frame with the GAL4 AD (data not shown). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Cezanne 444–858 revealed several structural features (see Fig. 1), but sequence similarity to known ubiquitin-binding domains was not identified. We conclude, therefore, that Cezanne 444–858 may contain a novel type of binding element for ubiquitin. Further experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal region generated relatively few colonies compared with the inactive protease domain (residues 17–443, C209S) suggesting that, in relative terms, it may have a lower affinity for ubiquitin (Fig. 2B). The greater number of colonies seen with the full-length version compared with the N-terminal region in isolation (residues 17–443) could be explained by a synergistic relationship between binding sites in the C-terminal and N-terminal halves. Alternatively, the C-terminal region may inhibit proteolytic activity, and this would have the effect of increasing colony number. When mutated versions of full-length and truncated sequences were compared, colony counts were closely similar (Fig. 2C). This suggests that inactivation of the catalytic cysteine was sufficient to allow maximal binding to polyubiquitin and full activation of yeast two-hybrid reporter genes. Although UCH and UBP molecules have different substrate preferences, both types target the peptide bond at Gly76, which links ubiquitin units in tandem. Both have the ability to cleave short model substrates (18Dang L.C. Melandri F.D. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1868-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess directly whether Cezanne has proteolytic activity, we tested its ability to cleave a fluorophore from a short peptide corresponding to the C terminus of ubiquitin (Fig. 2D). Lysates from E. coli expressing a version of the putative protease domain (residues 126–455), cleaved the fluorophore AMC from Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC. A shorter version of the catalytic domain, Cezanne 182–455, had little or no activity. Cezanne 126–455 corresponds to the region that displays similarity to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-binding domain of A20 (19Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), whereas Cezanne 182–455 corresponds to the predicted core catalytic domain that displays structural similarity to papain (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure). Although it is plausible that residues 126–181 are critical for substrate binding or regulation of hydrolysis, it is equally possible that the conformation of the active site of Cezanne 182–455 may have been compromised by aberrant folding. The lack of reactivity of endogenous E. coli proteins toward this substrate was not surprising, because prokaryotes lack ubiquitin hydrolase genes. Cezanne Hydrolyzes Branched Polyubiquitin Chains—The potential ability of Cezanne to cleave branched polyubiquitin chains was examined (Fig. 3A). Hydrolysis experiments in vitro demonstrated that a GST-Cezanne 126–455 fusion protein cleaved ϵ-amino-linked polyubiquitin chains into monomers (lanes 4, 7, and 10). This activity was present in crude E. coli lysates containing Cezanne 126–455 (lane 4) and was elevated in purified material (lanes 7 and 10). The deubiquitinating activity observed in this experiment must be attributed to Cezanne sequences, because it was not observed using an irrelevant GST fusion protein either purified (lanes 5 and 8)orin the presence of endogenous E. coli proteins in the crude lysate (lane 2). The shortened version of the protease domain (Cezanne 182–455) had little isopeptidase activity against branched polyubiquitin chains (lanes 3, 6, and 9). Cezanne's activity was suppressed by ubiquitin aldehyde, a highly specific inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes (Fig. 3B). The C-terminal Half of Cezanne Regulates Deubiquitination of Branched Polyubiquitin Chains—Hydrolysis experiments were performed to examine the influence of the C-terminal half of Cezanne on deubiquitination of branched polyubiquitin chains and to examine our prediction that Cys209 is a catalytic residue. We compared full-length Cezanne and the isolated protease domain alone for the ability to cleave a synthetic substrate of branched polyubiquitin chains using HA-tagged versions of Cezanne immunoprecipitated from transfected COS7 cells. The full-length molecule was considerably more effective than the protease domain alone (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 3). The mutation C209S abolished activity in the full-length molecule, confirming that Cys209, which is highly conserved between members of the OTU superfamily, is a catalytic residue (compare lanes 1 and 2). We observed very little activity using isolated protease domain immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells compared with that seen using preparations purified from E. coli (Fig. 3). We attribute this difference to the much greater concentration of protease domain used in the latter experiments. Cezanne Deubiquitinates Cellular Proteins in Cultured Cells—To investigate the effect of Cezanne on ubiquitinated cellular proteins, we co-transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors containing HA-tagged versions of Cezanne and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (at a ratio of 5:1; Fig. 5A). After 48 h, cells were either treated with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) for 1 h or remained untreated. Levels of ubiquitinated cellular proteins in experimental and control cultures were then compared by Western blotting for FLAG. Full-length Cezanne prevented the buildup of ubiquitinated cellular proteins in response to MG132, whereas a catalytically inactive version had no effect (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 3 or lanes 13 and 15). This implies that Cezanne has the capacity to deubiquitinate at least part of the cellular pool of ubiquitinated proteins. Expression of the catalytic domain alone had only a marginal effect on ubiquitination levels (compare lanes 1 and 5). Thus, the C-terminal part of Cezanne is required for efficient hydrolysis of both free and conjugated forms of branched ubiquitin chains (Figs. 4 and 5). We next examined the capacity of the mutated full-length molecule to bind to polyubiquitinated proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 5B). Ubiquitinated cellular proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated with a catalytically inactive version of full-length Cezanne (lane 6) but not with the wild-type molecule (lane 5). It is likely that the catalytically inactive version of Cezanne functions as a substrate-trapping mutant, whereas the active version would not be expected to retain polyubiquitin after hydrolysis. Cezanne Is a Novel Type of Deubiquitinating Enzyme—Data base searching and sequence analysis was carried out to examine the relationship between members of the A20 group, the OTU-superfamily, Type I and Type II deubiquitinating enzymes, and other cysteine proteases (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figure). Secondary structure predictions for the A20 family show close agreement to the actual structure of papain-like cysteine proteases, despite low sequence identity between these groups (Supplementary Figure). Multiple sequence alignment of the putative protease regions of the A20 family, however, revealed that Cezanne shares 39 and 25% sequence identity with A20 and TRABID, respectively. The similarity is particularly evident in the areas containing putative catalytic residues (Cys and His regions) (Fig. 5). Makarova et al. (17Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 50-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) suggest that the catalytic site of OTU proteins may comprise a triad of conserved Cys, His, and Asp residues (209, 373, and 206; Cezanne numbering). It is notable that TRABID does not contain the conserved Asp. We emphasize that, with the exception of Cezanne, empirical evidence for proteolytic activity is lacking among other A20 and OTU family members. The Cys and His regions of the A20 family display a significant level of sequence identity with OTU-like molecules but not to the catalytic regions of Type I or Type II deubiquitinating enzymes, apart from conservation of active site cysteine and histidine residues. We conclude that Cezanne is a novel type of deubiquitinating enzyme. We have demonstrated that Cezanne has deubiquitinating activity against both linear and branched forms of polyubiquitin. We compared the activity of Cezanne with isopeptidase T, a well characterized UBP molecule that is known to hydrolyze the branched form of polyubiquitin chains in preference to linear forms (5Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet analyzed the kinetics of Cezanne deubiquitination in detail, we noted from several experiments that equimolar quantities of Cezanne and isopeptidase T hydrolyzed free, branched polyubiquitin chains at similar rates. The activities of both molecules were suppressed by ubiquitin aldehyde, a highly specific inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes. The catalytic domain of Cezanne is present in the N-terminal half. Yeast two-hybrid experiments provided preliminary evidence for an additional ubiquitin binding site in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Full-length Cezanne hydrolyzed free and conjugated forms of branched polyubiquitin chains more efficiently than the catalytic domain alone. These observations are consistent with the idea that a C-terminal ubiquitin binding element may contribute to the avidity of Cezanne for the branched form of polyubiquitin. Alternatively, this motif may be required for optimal orientation of polyubiquitin chains with the catalytic site. Other proteases are known to contain substrate-binding sites outside the catalytic region, otherwise known as exosites. Interestingly, prothrombinase contains an exosite that is responsible for the initial interaction of this protease with its substrate (20Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The anchored substrate is then cleaved at two spatially separated sites. By analogy, it is conceivable that binding of the C terminus of Cezanne to a branched polyubiquitin chain may enable cleavage of multiple ubiquitin units in processive fashion. The presence of two ubiquitin binding sites could also explain our observation, using yeast two-hybrid analysis, that full-length Cezanne generated more colonies when co-transformed with polyubiquitin than the protease domain in isolation. A synergistic relationship between binding sites in the N- and C-terminal halves would have the effect of increasing the avidity of Cezanne for linear polyubiquitin chains. An alternative explanation is that the C-terminal half may inhibit hydrolysis of the linear form of polyubiquitin, which would also increase the number of colonies generated. The latter model implies that the C-terminal half may have opposing effects on the hydrolysis of different structural forms of polyubiquitin (i.e. it may inhibit cleavage of linear forms but promote cleavage of branched polyubiquitin chains). A precedent for this mode of regulation is provided by a study of a Type II deubiquitinating enzyme, UBP-t (21Lin H. Yin L. Reid J. Wilkinson K.D. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20357-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A region outside the catalytic domain of this molecule was found to regulate the preference for linear or branched polyubiquitin substrates. At present, we cannot distinguish whether the C-terminal half of Cezanne regulates binding to or hydrolysis of the linear form of polyubiquitin. Our experiments demonstrated that Cezanne can cleave branched polyubiquitin chains from a substantial proportion of cellular proteins. We cannot, however, draw firm conclusions about substrate specificity at this stage. These studies have relied on overexpression of Cezanne in cell lines, and it is quite possible that in such circumstances substrate specificity will be broadened well beyond the normal physiological range. The domain composition among deubiquitinating enzymes is diverse, and it has been proposed that regions outside the catalytic domain may target specific cellular proteins for deubiquitination. This concept has been established for several UBP molecules including HAUSP, which targets the apoptosis regulator p53 (22Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 23Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity remains poorly defined, however, for the great majority of ubiquitin hydrolases. The capacity of Cezanne to interact with other cellular proteins that could focus its activity has not yet been investigated in any depth. Our previous study revealed that transcripts for Cezanne are expressed widely and are particularly abundant in fetal liver and kidney (11Evans P.C. Taylor E.R. Coadwell J. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Kilshaw P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have also recently found that Cezanne is expressed differentially among B-cells at distinct developmental stages (reviewed in Ref. 24Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Primary immature B-cells (IgM+, IgD–) contained 100-fold more Cezanne mRNA than their mature counterparts (IgM–, IgD+) as assessed by real time PCR using β-actin transcripts as a standard. 2P. C. Evans, M. Turner, and P. J. Kilshaw, unpublished observations. The potential role of Cezanne during B-cell development awaits further investigation. It is possible that the capacity of Cezanne to suppress NF-κB, a powerful survival factor, may influence the fate of immature B-cells. Ubiquitin plays an essential role at several levels during NF-κB signaling, the best characterized being ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα (25Ben-Neriah Y. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination also provides the signal for cleavage of NF-κB precursors into active forms (26Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) and activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor- and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1) (27Deng L.

Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) signaling intermediaries. We have previously demonstrated that Cezanne has the capacity to suppress NF-κB and are currently investigating the intriguing possibility that this may be mediated through deubiquitination of key signaling intermediaries. The amino acid sequence of the protease domain of Cezanne is similar to corresponding regions found in A20 and TRABID (11Evans P.C. Taylor E.R. Coadwell J. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Kilshaw P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently discovered a close homologue of Cezanne, which we have named Cezanne-2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_130901). The catalytic cysteine and histidine residues of Cezanne are conserved throughout the group. Our discovery of enzymatic activity for Cezanne suggests strongly that proteolysis may be a common function throughout this family. We are currently testing the potential of other A20 family members to function as deubiquitinating enzymes. Our study also provides the first demonstration of proteolytic activity in the OTU superfamily. It remains to be established whether other members of the OTU superfamily can also function as deubiquitinating enzymes, but it is highly likely that at least one other human OTU family member does have this activity (29Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This molecule, called HSPC263, was identified recently by tandem mass spectrometry after capture using an alkylhalide-modified ubiquitin probe, which reacted with the putative active site cysteine. We propose, therefore, that Cezanne and HSPC263 should be classified as founder members of a Type III or OTU-type family of deubiquitinating enzymes.

Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHE-RF) was the first PDZ domain-containing protein that was reported to modulate the function of a GPCR (e.g. the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR)) (23Hall R.A.

MUPP1 has also been predicted to interact with both the 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2B receptor based on its ability to bind to purified COOH-terminal fusion proteins of both receptors in vitro (26Becamel C.

Furthermore, a proteomic approach has recently identified PSD-95 as a component of a multi-protein complex that associates with the 5-HT2C receptor in vivo (27Becamel C. Alonso G. Galeotti N.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9325-9333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is thus predicted to interact with 5-HT2A receptors. The functional significance of any association between PDZ proteins and 5-HT receptors is unknown because none has been previously reported. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether PSD-95 interacts with and regulates 5-HT2A receptors. A combination of biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches demonstrated that PSD-95 directly interacts with the 5-HT2A receptor in vitro. We also discovered that PSD-95 enhanced 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling, inhibited agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor internalization, and promoted 5-HT2A receptor clustering on the plasma membrane. Thus, this work demonstrates a novel role for PSD-95 in modulating the activity of a GPCR. These findings have important implications for elucidating the roles of PDZ domain-containing proteins in regulating the functions of the 5-HT family of receptors and possibly other GPCRs. cDNA Constructs and Reagents—The construct coding for FLAG-tagged wild type (WT) rat 5-HT2A receptor (FLAG-5-HT2A) was modified from a similar construct that has been described previously (30Bhatnagar A.

Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)] derived from influenza hemagglutinin. The addition of such a signal sequence has been shown to increase the expression of GPCRs (31Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

FLAG-5-HT2AΔ469–471 was constructed by using FLAG-5-HT2A as the template and by introducing a premature stop codon at residue 469, the third to the last amino acid of the carboxyl terminus, using site-directed mutagenesis (5′-primer: 5′-CGTGAATGAAAAGGTTTGATGTGTGTGATCTAGAGGGCCC-3′, and 3′-primer: 5′-GGGCCCTCTAGATCACACACATCAAACCTTTTCATTCACG)-3′ (QuikChange). Deletion of amino acid residues 469–471 effectively ablates the PDZ-binding domain of the 5-HT2A receptor. PSD-95-GFP (a generous gift from D. Bredt) has been described elsewhere (32Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The EGFP-C2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) contained the GFP coding sequence. The constitutively active Gαq mutant (Q229L) (a generous gift from D. Siderovski) has been described elsewhere (33Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All of the constructs containing inserts in the appropriate orientation were verified by automated sequencing (Cleveland Genomics, Cleveland, OH). 5-Hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate (5-HT), quipazine, clozapine, chlorpromazine, (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride, CHAPS, and sodium orthovanadate were acquired from Sigma. [3H]Ketanserin and myo-[3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Transfection of HEK-293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) using a FuGENE 6 to DNA ratio of 5:1 was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 6 μg of DNA was used in each co-transfection, 4 μg of which were vector, 5-HT2A receptor, or mutant 5-HT2A receptor DNA and 2 μg of which were DNA encoding either PSD-95-GFP or GFP. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—At 24 h after co-transfection, HEK-293 cells were split into 6-well plates and cultured first in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 24 h and then in DMEM without serum for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed at 4 °C twice with PBS and once with Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7,and2mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by incubation on a rocker platform at 4 °C for 15 min in Buffer A containing 1.5% CHAPS and EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Sciences). A portion of the cell lysates was saved for subsequent determination of total protein expression levels, and the remainder was incubated with Sepharose beads conjugated to a monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed at 4 °C for three times in Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted from the beads by resuspension in 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 67 °C, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard methods (30Bhatnagar A.

Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A polyclonal GFP antibody (1:2000) (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used to detect PSD-95-GFP or GFP. A rabbit polyclonal FLAG antibody (1:1500) was used to detect FLAG-tagged WT and mutant 5-HT2A receptors. The constitutively active Gαq mutant and the endogenous WT Gαq in cell lysates were detected by a rabbit polyclonal Gαq antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The levels of PSD-95-GFP expression from immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were quantified using a chemiluminescence imaging system (Kodak Scientific Imaging System, Eastman Kodak Co.). The levels of PSD-95-GFP expression from immunoprecipitates were subsequently normalized to corresponding levels in cell lysates. Agonist-mediated Internalization—At 24 h after co-transfection, HEK-293 cells were split into 24-well plates containing poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 24 h and then in DMEM without serum for an additional 24 h. Cells were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 5-HT at a final concentration of 10 μm. Treatment was terminated by placing cells at 4 °C, removing media, and fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunocytochemistry was performed, confocal images were acquired (see “Immunocytochemistry, Confocal Microscopy, and Image Quantification”), and internalization was quantified using the MetaView imaging software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis, Radioligand Binding, and Desensitization Assays—Phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and saturation radioligand binding assays were performed on cells from the same transfection. At 24 h following transfection, HEK-293 cells were either 1) split into poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 24 h and then in serum-free and inositol-free DMEM for an additional 24 h before performing PI hydrolysis assay or 2) kept in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 24 h and then in serum-free DMEM for additional 24 h before harvesting cell membranes for binding assay. As described previously, agonist efficacy (Emax) and potency (EC50) were determined from dose-response PI hydrolysis assays and kinetic binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) were determined from saturation binding assays with [3H]ketanserin (35Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting Emax values were then normalized to Bmax values with results replicated in at least three separate experiments. PI hydrolysis data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA), and saturation binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism or the weighted nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting program LIGAND (36Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Agonist-dependent desensitization of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated accumulation of inositol phosphate (IP) was performed as described previously (34Gray J.A. Bhatnagar A. Gurevich V.V. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry, Confocal Microscopy, and Image Quantification—Dual-labeling immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described previously (30Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 at 4 °C, blocked with 5% milk, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with secondary antibodies, conjugated to the appropriate Alexa Fluor dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and finally mounted on glass slides. FLAG-tagged constructs were visualized using a monoclonal FLAG antibody (1:1500) (Stratagene). GFP-tagged constructs were visualized with a rabbit polyclonal GFP antibody (1:2000) (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Images of cells were acquired digitally using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) without saturation of pixel intensities and were subsequently analyzed using MetaView (Universal Imaging) as previously detailed (30Bhatnagar A.

For each cell in which 5-HT2A receptor internalization was quantified, two measurements were made: 1) total cellular immunofluorescence and 2) intracellular immunofluorescence. The extent of 5-HT2A receptor internalization was then defined as the percentage of the total 5-HT2A receptor immunofluorescence, which was intracellular. For each sample group, at least 50 cells were quantified in a blinded fashion. In prior studies (30Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Willins D.L. Berry S.A. Alsayegh L. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Friedman L. Roth B.L. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that this method provides quantitative estimates of internalization that are essentially equivalent to results obtained by biochemical techniques such as surface biotinylation. Statistical Analysis—Data from co-immunoprecipitation and internalization studies were analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. Statistical significance of the PI hydrolysis data was analyzed by GraphPad Prism using the two-tailed paired Student's t test and was defined as p < 0.05. 5-HT2AReceptors Directly Interact with PSD-95 via a Type I PDZ-binding Motif—Because the 5-HT2A receptor contains a canonical Type I PDZ-binding domain and is found in the postsynaptic densities of cortical neurons where PSD-95 is also enriched (12Miner L.A. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Sesack S.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 116: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we predicted that 5-HT2A receptors and PSD-95 might directly associate. To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in which 5-HT2A receptors and PSD-95 were co-transfected in HEK-293 cells. We probed for GFP-tagged PSD-95 following lysis of transiently transfected HEK-293 cells and immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged WT or mutant 5-HT2A receptors. Wild type FLAG-5-HT2A receptors were co-immunoprecipitated robustly with PSD-95-GFP (Fig. 1A, lanes 9 and 10), indicating that 5-HT2A receptors and PSD-95 directly interact in vitro (see Fig. 1E for quantification). To identify the responsible binding motif(s) on the 5-HT2A receptor, we constructed a mutant 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AΔ469–471) that lacks the PDZ-binding domain. Ablating the PDZ-binding domain attenuated the interaction between FLAG-5-HT2A and PSD-95-GFP to control levels (Fig. 1, A, lanes 11 and 12 versus lanes 7 and 8, and E), demonstrating that the PDZ-binding domain of the 5-HT2A receptor (residues 469–471, SCV) mediates the association with PSD-95. To further establish the specificity of the interaction between the 5-HT2A receptor and PSD-95, we performed a number of controls. First, we showed that cells co-transfected with PSD-95-GFP and an empty vector (Fig. 1, A, lanes 7 and 8, and E) yielded minimal pull-down of PSD-95. Second, no PSD-95 was immunoprecipitated from nontransfected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2) or from cells co-expressing 5-HT2A receptors (WT or mutant) and GFP (Fig. 1A, lane 3–6). These findings demonstrated the specificity of PSD-95 association with 5-HT2A receptors. Finally, the significantly higher levels of PSD-95 that co-immunoprecipitated with WT 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 1A, lanes 9 and 10) resulted neither from variations in the expression of WT or mutant 5-HT2A receptors in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6 and lanes 9–12) or in cell lysates (Fig. 1D, lanes 3–6 and lanes 9–12) nor from variations in PSD-95 expression (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–12; see Fig. 1E for quantification). Therefore, we conclude that PSD-95 specifically associates with 5-HT2A receptors by interacting with the PDZ-binding domain of the 5-HT2A receptor. PSD-95 Potentiates 5-HT2AReceptor-mediated Signal Transduction—We next examined whether the association between PSD-95 and the 5-HT2A receptor has functional consequences on 5-HT2A receptor signal transduction. Because the 5-HT2A receptor is a Gq-coupled receptor that activates phospholipase C (PLC) (39Roth B.L. Nakaki T. Chuang D.M. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 480-485PubMed Google Scholar), we measured inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation resulting from 5-HT2A receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis (Fig. 2) and determined in parallel the expression of 5-HT2A receptors by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, B and D) and saturation binding assays. We then normalized the functional activity of the 5-HT2A receptor (i.e. IP accumulation) to the expression level of the 5-HT2A receptor (i.e. Bmax), thus accounting for minor variations in 5-HT2A receptor activation that might have resulted from variations in receptor expression. Assays were also performed under the conditions of minimal receptor reserve (35Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PSD-95 significantly enhanced WT 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling when compared with the base line (i.e. 5-HT2A receptors co-transfected with GFP) (Fig. 2, WT 5-HT2A + PSD-95 versus WT 5-HT2A + GFP) (Table I). The augmentation of signaling by PSD-95 was not seen when PSD-95 was co-transfected with the 5-HT2AΔ469–471 mutant (Fig. 2, 5-HT2AΔ469–471 + PSD-95) (Table I). Blocking the direct physical interaction between PSD-95 and 5-HT2A receptors thus inhibited the ability of PSD-95 to augment 5-HT2A signaling. Interestingly, PSD-95 did not alter agonist potency (Table I), and there was no apparent alteration in the constitutive activity of any of the receptor constructs (measured as detailed by Shapiro et al. (40Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Weiner D.M. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11441-11449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); data not shown). These results indicate that PSD-95 via a direct physical interaction with 5-HT2A receptors augments 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling.Table IPSD-95 potentiates 5-HT2A receptor signalingAgonist potency EC50 (pEC50 ± S.E.)Agonist efficacy relative Emax ± S.E.FLAG-5-HT2A + GFP18.1 nM (1.26 ± 0.07)1.00 ± 0.02FLAG-5-HT2A 469-471 + GFP21.6 nM (1.33 ± 0.15)NS0.92 ± 0.05NSFLAG-5-HT2A + PSD-95-GFP29.4 nM (1.47 ± 0.19)NS1.65 ± 0.14*FLAG-5-HT2A 469-471 + PSD-95-GFP26.6 nM (1.42 ± 0.16)NS1.07 ± 0.07NS Open table in a new tab To investigate the possibility that PSD-95 augments the PLC signaling pathway by associating with downstream effectors (i.e. Gαq and PLC), we examined whether PSD-95 increased IP accumulation in cells expressing a constitutively active form of Gαq (Q229L and Gαq*), which activates PLC directly (33Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the absence of 5-HT2A receptor expression, PSD-95 neither altered the Gαq*-stimulated IP accumulation when compared with GFP alone (Fig. 3C) nor affected the relative expression of Gαq* (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings strongly suggest that PSD-95 enhances intracellular signaling at the level of receptor-effector coupling and not via a receptor-independent augmentation of Gαq signaling. PSD-95 Does Not Affect the Agonist-dependent Desensitization of 5-HT2AReceptors—To determine the potential cellular mechanisms subserving the PSD-95-mediated augmentation of 5-HT2A receptor signaling, we examined whether PSD-95 alters the time course of 5-HT2A receptor desensitization. We have previously reported that exposure to agonists inhibits the activation of the 5-HT2A receptor by the process of desensitization whereby receptors on the cell surface no longer respond to agonists and fail to efficiently signal downstream pathways (41Gray J.A. Roth B.L. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 56: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PSD-95 did not attenuate agonist-dependent 5-HT2A receptor desensitization when compared with the base line (Fig. 4, WT 5-HT2A + PSD-95 versus WT 5-HT2A + GFP). Likewise, disrupting the association between PSD-95 and 5-HT2A receptors had no effect on agonist-dependent desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 4, 5-HT2AΔ469–471 + PSD-95). Hence, PSD-95 does not enhance 5-HT2A receptor signaling by attenuating the desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2154911084,"African trypanosomes have a tightly coordinated cell cycle to effect efficient segregation of their single organelles, the nucleus, flagellum, and kinetoplast. To investigate cell cycle control in trypanosomes, a mitotic cyclin gene (CYC6) has been identified in Trypanosoma brucei. We show that CYC6 forms an active kinase complex with CRK3, the trypanosome CDK1 homologue, in vivo. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that absence of CYC6 mRNA results in a mitotic block and growth arrest in both the insect procyclic and mammalian bloodstream forms. In the procyclic form, CYC6 RNA interference generates anucleate cells with a single kinetoplast, whereas in bloodstream form trypanosomes, cells with one nucleus and multiple kinetoplasts are observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis shows that bloodstream but not procyclic trypanosomes are able to reinitiate nuclear S phase in the absence of mitosis. Taken together, these data show that procyclic trypanosomes can undergo cytokinesis without completion of mitosis, whereas a mitotic block in bloodstream form trypanosomes inhibits cytokinesis but not kinetoplast replication and segregation nor an additional round of nuclear DNA synthesis. This indicates that there are fundamental differences in cell cycle controls between life cycle forms of T. brucei and that key cell cycle checkpoints present in higher eukaryotes are absent from trypanosomes.

This indicates that there are fundamental differences in cell cycle controls between life cycle forms of T. brucei and that key cell cycle checkpoints present in higher eukaryotes are absent from trypanosomes. The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, is a unicellular parasitic protozoan that causes sleeping sickness in humans. T. brucei has a complex biphasic life cycle with different developmental forms playing specific roles within each of two hosts (1Hammarton T.C. Mottram J.C. Doerig C.D. Meijer L. Jézéquel A. Roberge M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Life in Progress Editions, Roscoff, France2003: 91-101Google Scholar). The procyclic form in the tsetse fly gut and the long slender form in the mammalian bloodstream establish infection in each host, whereas the metacyclic form in the tsetse salivary glands and the short stumpy form in the mammalian bloodstream are arrested in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and are preadapted to life in the new host. Upon transmission, concomitant with differentiation to the new developmental form, the cell cycle arrest is released. Thus, there is an integral link between the cell cycle and parasite differentiation during the life cycle of T. brucei (2Matthews K.R. Gull K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 473-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a requirement for the trypanosome to replicate and segregate its single organelles (the nucleus, the kinetoplast (which contains the DNA of the single mitochondrion), flagellum, and basal body) (3Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 4Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which implies added complexity in cell cycle control not present in relatively simple eukaryotes such as yeast. Ultrastructural studies of the procyclic form have described a number of markers of cell cycle position and identified discrete phases within the trypanosome cell cycle (3Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). During G1 phase, the probasal body (lying adjacent to the flagellar basal body) matures. Daughter flagellum outgrowth follows, and new probasal bodies for each mature basal body are formed. Kinetoplast S phase is much shorter than nuclear S phase and commences just prior to nuclear S phase (4Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that (as yet unidentified) interorganelle control mechanisms may coordinate DNA synthesis. Early in G2 phase, the replicated kinetoplast segregates, and this is followed by nuclear mitosis and finally cytokinesis. It has been postulated that entry to cytokinesis may be more dependent on kinetoplast division and segregation than on mitosis (5Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tightly controlled regulation of DNA replication and chromosome segregation is essential for maintenance of genome stability. Eukaryotes have therefore evolved a complex ordered series of checkpoints in order to bring about accurate DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis. Most checkpoints and cell cycle control proteins are highly conserved from yeast to humans. However, at least one cell cycle checkpoint present in mammalian cells has been suggested to be absent from trypanosomes, since treatment of procyclic trypanosomes with the anti-microtubule agent rhizoxin results in cytokinesis occurring in the absence of mitosis (5Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of procyclic trypanosomes with aphidicolin prevented cells from entering mitosis, indicating that a mitotic entry checkpoint is present (5Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also remains possible that additional checkpoints may operate to cope with requirements specific to trypanosomes (e.g. in order to coordinate the replication and segregation of the kinetoplast with that of the nucleus). The involvement of cyclin-dependent kinases in the control of the cell cycle is well established in yeast and higher eukaryotes (7Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar, 8Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In T. brucei, a number of putative CDKs 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CRK, cdc2-related kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

The cyclins can be grouped into different classes according to sequence homology to other known cyclins. CYC2, CYC4, CYC5, and CYC7 exhibit homology to the PREG1/PHO80 class of cyclins (1Hammarton T.C. Mottram J.C. Doerig C.D. Meijer L. Jézéquel A. Roberge M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research.

Recently, CRK3 was shown to form an active kinase complex with CYC2 in vivo, the first example of a trypanosome CDK-cyclin complex; however, the role of this complex in vivo is not known (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwartz R.J. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Studies on T. brucei CRK3 and its orthologue from Leishmania suggest that CRK3 is a functional trypanosomatid CDK1 (1Hammarton T.C. Mottram J.C. Doerig C.D. Meijer L. Jézéquel A. Roberge M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Life in Progress Editions, Roscoff, France2003: 91-101Google Scholar). By a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitations with histone H1 kinase assays, we extend previous studies to show that CRK3 also forms an active kinase complex with CYC6 in vivo. We demonstrate using RNA interference (RNAi) that CYC6 is essential for mitosis in the African trypanosome, but that a mitotic block produces different phenotypes in the procyclic and bloodstream life cycle stages. In the procyclic form, anucleate cells with a single kinetoplast (termed zoids) (5Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) are generated, whereas in bloodstream form trypanosomes, cells with a single nucleus but multiple kinetoplasts are observed. Bloodstream form but not procyclic trypanosomes reinitiate nuclear S phase in the absence of mitosis. From these data, we conclude that procyclic trypanosomes can undergo cytokinesis without completion of mitosis, but inhibiting mitosis in bloodstream form trypanosomes prevents cytokinesis but neither kinetoplast replication and segregation nor an additional round of nuclear DNA synthesis. Recombinant DNA Techniques—Standard DNA techniques were performed as described (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was achieved using the lithium acetate method (12Leopold P. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1991; 66: 1207-1216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Plasmid isolation from Escherichia coli, and DNA extraction from agarose gels used Qiaprep and Qiaex kits from Qiagen, respectively. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA sequencing service (University of Glasgow) using an ABI automatic sequencer. Cloning CYC6 and TbCKS1—The T. brucei genome databases (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/ and www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei) were searched using the sequences of known cyclins to identify potential T. brucei homologues. Using sequence information derived from these databases, CYC6 was cloned using a PCR-based approach. The sequences of CYC6 have been submitted to EMBL under accession numbers AJ496539 and AJ496540. The genome databases were also searched for the T. brucei homologue of SUC1/CKS1 using the leishmanial CKS1 sequence (13Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PCR with oligonucleotides OL861 and OL862 (Table I) was used to amplify the TbCKS1 sequence from EATRO 795 genomic DNA. The gene was cloned, sequenced, and submitted to EMBL under accession number AJ496538.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligoGeneSequence 5′ → 3′OL171CYC2 senseGCCCATGGCCATTATGATGGACGGOL372CRK4 senseGAGAGCTCATGTCAACTGTCAACAGACTGOL373CRK4 antisenseGTGTCGACAACTACATTGTAAGAACTGCCTAOL490CRK5 senseCTCCGAATTCATGCAAAAGTACGCAAOL491CRK5 antisenseCTCGGAATTCATATAGGTTCATGTCOL544CYC6 senseCGAGGCGTACGACCGGACOL545CYC6 antisenseTGAAATCACGTACTTGAGCOL746CYC6 3′-flank, antisenseCGCACACGACGAGGGAAAAGOL827PIGO senseGCGGATCCGCACTCATGCCAGTAACGCOL828PIGO antisenseCCGCCACACGCCATTTGCCOL849CRK6 senseCCACGAATTCATGTCTGATACATTAAGTAGOL850CRK6 antisenseGGTTGTCGACGGAGGGGAAGGAGCTAGTCTCOL861CKS1 antisenseGGGTCTCGAGTCATCTATTGTGTCTTGGGOL862CKS1 senseGGTGAAGCTTATGTCTGGCCGGGACTACOL895CYC6 senseGGAGAAGCTTATGTACATGGAAAGTGAGAAGGOL896CYC6 antisenseGGAGGGATCCGAAGCACGCAACACACCACOL941CYC6 5′-flank, senseCCTTCCACTTTCCAGTTTACCOL952CYC6ty senseTCAGCGGGAGGTCCATACTAACCAGGATCCACTTGACGCOL953CYC6ty antisenseTGAGCGTCAAGTGGATCCTGGTTAGTATGGACCTCCCGCOL1155CYC6 senseCCCAAAGCTTATGAATCCCACGGCACTTCGOL1156CYC6 antisenseGAGTGGGCCCTTACACAGCAGAGTGTAACGOL1079CYC2 antisenseTGAGTATTTGCCTATGCGACGGATG Open table in a new tab BLAST searches were carried out using the search engine at NCBI (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), which also incorporated a conserved protein domain search. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The Hybrid Hunter system (Invitrogen) was used. Plasmids pGL176 (LexA:CRK1) and pGL177 (LexA:CRK3) have been described previously (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwartz R.J. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CRK4 (accession number AJ413200) was cloned into the SacI/SalI sites of pHybLex/Zeo following PCR with oligonucleotides OL372 and OL373, generating plasmid pGL395. The open reading frame of CRK5 was previously cloned into expression vector pHD675 (14Biebinger S. Wirtz E. Lorenz P. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), generating pGL220. 2J. J. Van Hellemond and J. C. Mottram, unpublished results. To clone CRK5 into pHybLex/Zeo, a 1.6-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pGL220 was subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pHybLex/Zeo, generating pGL412. This fragment contained a 5′-truncated CRK5 gene, since CRK5 contains an internal EcoRI site. PCR with oligonucleotides OL490 and OL491 was used to amplify the remainder of the gene and clone it into the EcoRI site of pGL412, generating pGL442 (LexA: CRK5). CRK6 (accession number AJ505556) was cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pHybLex/Zeo following PCR with oligonucleotides OL849 and OL850, generating plasmid pGL627. A fragment of CYC6 containing the cyclin box homology region was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides OL895 and OL896 and cloned into BamHI/HindIII-cut pYESTrp to generate pGL680 (B42:CYC6). TbCKS1 was cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pYESTrp following PCR with oligonucleotides OL861 and OL862, generating plasmid pGL656 (B42:CKS1). Plasmid inserts were sequenced to show that they were in-frame with either LexA or B42 and contained no mutations introduced by PCR. Bait and prey plasmids were transformed separately into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L-40, and β-galactosidase filter lift assays (as described by the manufacturer) were performed to confirm that no plasmid alone could activate transcription of the reporter gene lacZ. L-40 strains expressing appropriate pairs of plasmids were then generated, and further β-galactosidase assays were performed to assay for protein-protein interactions. Control plasmids expressing LexA:Fos, B42:Jun, and B42:lamin (Invitrogen) were also transformed into L-40 in the appropriate combinations to provide positive and negative controls for the assays. Expression of fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates with antibodies (Invitrogen) against either LexA or the V5 epitope, which is fused to the B42 domain, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Antiserum specific for T. brucei CRK3 was generated by immunizing a sheep with recombinant CRK3 that was tagged with 6 histidines at the C-terminal end, generating antibody AB24. The mouse monoclonal antibody BB2 (15Bastin P. Bagherzadeh A. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was used as the anti-TY antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blots were performed as described previously (13Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with either a 1:20 dilution of anti-TY antibody or a 1:200 dilution of AB24 followed by a 1:20,000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The West-Dura chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce) was used to visualize antigens. Transfection of T. brucei—Culture and transfection of T. brucei was carried out essentially as described previously (16Vassella E. Krämer R. Turner C.M.R. Wankell M. Modes C. Van den Bogaard M. Boshart M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Where necessary, hygromycin was added at a concentration of 50 μg ml–1 (procyclic cells) or 5 μg ml–1 (bloodstream form cells), G418 at 10 μg ml–1 (procyclic cells) or 2.5 μg ml–1 (bloodstream form cells), zeocin at 10 μg ml–1 (procyclic cells), and phleomycin at 2.5 μg ml–1 (bloodstream form cells). Generation of a T. brucei CYC6ty-overexpressing Cell Line—To generate TY-tagged CYC6, two annealed oligonucleotides OL952 and OL953, which composed the TY epitope flanked by Bpu1102I-compatible overhangs, were ligated into the unique Bpu1102I site at the 5′-end of CYC6. Correct integration of the TY tag was confirmed by sequence analysis. CYC6ty was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides OL1155 and OL1156, sequenced to confirm no mutations had been introduced by PCR and ligated into HindIII/ApaI-cut pHD675 (14Biebinger S. Wirtz E. Lorenz P. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to generate pGL840. Plasmid pGL840 was linearized by digestion with NotI and transfected into the procyclic cell line EATRO 795 pHD449 (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwartz R.J. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CYC6ty was induced in midlog phase cultures by growing cells in medium containing 50 ng ml–1 tetracycline for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and either snap-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath (for immunoprecipitations and kinase assays) or resuspended in Laemmli buffer (for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis). Immunoprecipitations and Histone H1 Kinase Assays—To immunoprecipitate CYC6ty or CYC2ty kinase complexes from appropriate cell lines, trypanosome S100 lysates (107 cell equivalents) (prepared as described previously (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwartz R.J. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) were incubated with 20 μl of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (0.5 mg ml–1) was added, and samples were incubated for a further 30 min before being washed and assayed for histone H1 kinase activity as described previously (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwartz R.J. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To show CRK3 co-precipitates with CYC6ty, anti-TY monoclonal antibody was first cross-linked to protein G beads using disuccinimidyl suberate using the Seize X protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). 500 μl of S100 lysate from cells overexpressing CYC6ty were diluted 1:1 with binding buffer 1 (0.14 m NaCl, 8 mm Na2PO4, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with either protein G beads alone or protein G-anti-TY beads overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive washing of the beads with 25 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled to release immunoprecipitated proteins from the antibody. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-TY and anti-CRK3 antibodies. p12cks1 and p13suc1 Binding Assays—Leishmanial p12cks1 or yeast p13suc1 protein was coupled to Amino-link beads at a concentration of 5 mg ml–1 as described previously (13Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amino-link beads coupled to Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to block the reactive sites were used as a negative control. S100 lysates were incubated with 50 μl of control, p12cks1, or p13suc1 beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and used for either immunoblotting or histone H1 kinase assays. Generation and Induction of RNAi Cell Lines—For RNAi, the procyclic 427 pLew13 pLew29 and the bloodstream form 427 pLew13 pLew90-6 cell lines (17Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) were transfected with pGL622 or p2T7ti/green fluorescent protein (GFP) (18LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGL622 was generated by subcloning a 408-bp BamHI-XhoI fragment of CYC6 into vector p2T7ti (18LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Plasmid p2T7ti/GFP contains the full open reading frame for GFP (758 bp) between the two opposing T7 promoters. Independent clones were generated by limited dilution cloning. To induce RNAi in procyclic forms, the cell line was grown to a density of 0.5–1 × 107 cells ml–1, diluted to give a density of 5 × 105 cells ml–1, and cultured in the presence or absence of 50 ng ml–1 tetracycline. Cells were counted daily using a Neubauer improved hemocytometer, and cultures were diluted to 106 cells ml–1 when the density approached 107 cells ml–1. Bloodstream form cells were induced at a density of 105 cells ml–1 with 1 μg ml–1 tetracycline and were diluted back to 105 cells ml–1 whenever the cell density approached 106 cells ml–1. Generation of cDNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cell pellets using Trizol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 3 h at 37 °C before being heat-inactivated. For first strand cDNA synthesis, 0.325 μg of RNA was mixed with 100 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen) and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. To the RNA, dNTPs were added to 400 μm, dithiothreitol was added to 10 μm, and PCR buffer (5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit; Invitrogen) was added to give a final concentration of 1×. The reagents were mixed and incubated at 42 °C for 1 min before 200 units of Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) was added, and the reactions were further incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. Identical reactions were set up for each cDNA sample without RT to act as a control for genomic DNA contamination. The reactions were terminated by heating to 70 °C for 15 min before treatment with 1 μl of 10 mg ml–1 RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Multiplex PCRs were set up, using 1 μl of cDNA/reaction and PIGO primers (OL827 and OL828) plus either CYC6 (OL544 and OL746, or OL941 and OL545) or CYC2 (OL171 and OL1079) primers. PCRs contained 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 11 mm NH4SO4, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 6.7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4.4 μm EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mm dNTPs, 113 μg ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 20 ng of each primer, 1 μl of cDNA, and 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (ABI). The conditions for PCR were 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 50 °C for 50 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Staining and FACS Analysis—For DAPI staining, ∼5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 50 μl of medium, spread on a glass microscope slide, air-dried, and fixed overnight in methanol at–20 °C. Slides were removed, the methanol was allowed to evaporate, and 50 μl of 1 μg ml–1 DAPI in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as anti-fading agent was added to the slide and spread by the addition of a coverslip. Slides were examined under UV light on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, and images were processed using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera and Openlab version 3.0.3 software. For FACS analysis, cells were suspended at a density of 106 ml–1 in 70% methanol, 30% PBS and were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed in 10 ml of cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 10 μg ml–1 propidium iodide and 10 μg ml–1 RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. FACS was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using detector FL2-A and an AmpGain value of 1.75. Data were analyzed using the software CellQuest version 3.3. Identification of a T. brucei Mitotic Cyclin—We searched the T. brucei genome databases and identified a sheared DNA clone containing a partial gene sequence displaying high similarity to mitotic A and B type cyclins. Using PCR, we were able to clone and sequence the remainder of the gene (Fig. 1A), which we designated CYC6. Sequencing of independent PCRs indicated that there are two alleles of CYC6. The first allele (CYC6-1) encodes a 436-amino acid protein with a leucine at position 309. The second allele (CYC6-2) contains an insertion of a G at position 827 of the open reading frame, resulting in a frameshift and a shorter protein of 426 amino acids (Fig. 1B). CYC6-2 also has a valine residue at position 309 in place of the leucine of CYC6-1. Evidence for the presence of two alleles rather than two genes encoding CYC6-1 and CYC6-2 was provided by Southern blot analysis of EATRO 795 procyclic genomic DNA using a fragment of CYC6 as probe (Fig. 1A), which indicated that CYC6 is most likely single copy (Fig. 1C). So far, we have no data to indicate whether the two forms of CYC6 play distinct roles in vivo. However, the presence of alleles encoding two distinct proteins is unusual and has not been reported for any other cell cycle-related gene in T. brucei to date. BLAST searches of CYC6-1 revealed that it shares highest similarity with the mitotic B-type cyclins, cyclin 1 from Antirrhinum majus (19Fobert P.R. Coen E.S. Murphy G.J.P. Doonan J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (22% identity, rising to 57% identity over the cyclin box) and with cyclin S13-6 from Glycine max (20Hata S. Kouchi H. Suzuka I. Ishii T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (24% identity rising to 53% identity over the cyclin box). Additionally, a search for conserved domains in CYC6-1 revealed high homology to both N- and C-terminal cyclin fold domains, (accession numbers gn1CDD5902 and gn1CDD6896), thus showing that CYC6 has the structural characteristics of a cyclin. Fig. 1B shows an alignment of CYC6-1 and CYC6-2 with the cyclin boxes of other mitotic cyclins. Another feature characteristic of mitotic cyclins is the presence of a 9-amino acid destruction box, frequently present at the N-terminal end of the protein, which targets the cyclin for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the anaphase-promoting complex at the end of mitosis (21Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M. Nature. 1991; 348: 132-138Crossref Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for the destruction box in organisms studied to date is RXALGXIXN. In the absence of data on destruction box sequences in T. brucei, the best candidate is at positions 3–11 (Fig. 1B), but it diverges from the consensus sequence and, most notably, lacks the conserved arginine at position 1 (Fig. 1D). Evidence that CYC6 can function as a cyclin came from the observation that the cyclin box homology region of CYC6 could complement the S. cerevisiae G1 cyclin conditional mutant, DL-1 (22Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We were therefore interested to discover its kinase partner in T. brucei. The cyclin box homology region of CYC6 was tested in a two-hybrid interaction screen with CRK1 and CRK3-CRK6. We were unable to test for an interaction with CRK2, since LexA: CRK2 was autoactivatory in the absence of prey. CYC6 expressed in the host strain L-40 resulted in negligible β-galactosidase activity, whereas a positive reaction was detected for CYC6 with CRK3 (Fig. 2) but not CRK1, CRK4, CRK5, or CRK6 (not shown). To confirm this interaction in vivo, a T. brucei cell line that expresses a tetracycline-inducible TY1-epitope-tagged CYC6 gene was generated (Fig. 3A). CYC6ty was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-TY monoclonal antibody and demonstrated to be associated with a histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 3B). Preincubation of the antibody with TY peptide abrogated the activity. To determine whether CYC6ty interacts with CRK3 in vivo, CYC6ty immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). CRK3 co-precipitated with CYC6ty, demonstrati"

Here we report an evaluation of the catalytic activity of recombinantly expressed soluble forms of ADAM19, a protein that is essential for cardiovascular morphogenesis. Proteolytic activity of soluble forms of ADAM19 was first demonstrated by their autocatalytic removal of a purification tag (Myc-His) and their ability to cleave myelin basic protein and the insulin B chain. The metalloprotease activity of ADAM19 is sensitive to the hydroxamic acid-type metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 (batimastat) but not to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) 1–3. Moreover, ADAM19 cleaves peptides corresponding to the known cleavage sites of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF–α), TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE, also referred to as osteoprotegerin ligand), and kit ligand-1 (KL-1) in vitro. Although ADAM19 is not required for shedding of TNFα and TRANCE in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, its overexpression in COS-7 cells results in strongly increased TRANCE shedding. This suggests a potential role for ADAM19 in shedding TRANCE in cells where both molecules are highly expressed, such as in osteoblasts. Interestingly, our results also indicate that ADAM19 can function as a negative regulator of KL-1 shedding in both COS-7 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, instead of acting directly on KL-1. The identification of potential in vitro substrates offers the basis for further functional studies of ADAM19 in cells and in mice.

Although all ADAMs share a common domain organization, consisting of a pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 1), only 16 of the 26 mouse members present a fully conserved metzincin consensus catalytic site (HEXGHXXGXXHD (7Jongeneel C.V.

Numerous membrane-anchored proteins, including cytokines, growth factors, receptors, adhesion molecules, and enzymes, have been shown to undergo proteolytic release from the plasma membrane (11Massague J.

J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). This event, which is thought to regulate the function of the substrate proteins, is called protein ectodomain shedding. Inhibitor studies have revealed that most shedding events are mediated by metalloproteases (13Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). ADAMs have been clearly implicated in the shedding of several proteins, although some matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) may also act as sheddases in specific circumstances (14Schlöndorff J. Lum L.

Functional Kuzbanian, the putative ADAM10 orthologue in D. melanogaster, is required for proper Notch signaling and is thought to trigger the second cleavage of this transmembrane receptor protein (22Pan D.

However, little is currently known about the catalytic activity of other ADAMs. Furthermore, the enzymes responsible for the processing of many proteins that are shed from the plasma membrane remain to be identified. ADAM19, also know as meltrin β (30Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), is a widely expressed protein, but its mRNA is particularly abundant in bone, heart, and lung (31Inoue D. Reid M. Lum L.

Mouse ADAM19 cDNA has been isolated from a C2C12 muscle cell library, and the encoded protein presents the classical domain organization of the members of the ADAM family, as well as an intact consensus catalytic site (HEIGHNFGMSHD; Fig. 1). Its closest homologues are ADAM12 (meltrin α (30Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A.

BMC Genet. 2002; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human ADAM19 cDNA has also been isolated recently (36Fritsche J. Moser M. Faust S. Peuker A. Buttner R. Andreesen R. Kreutz M. Blood. 2000; 96: 732-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a soluble form of the protein has been recombinantly expressed in 293T cells (37Wei P. Zhao Y.G. Zhuang L. Ruben S. Sang Q.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 744-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This initial attempt to characterize the catalytic activity of ADAM19 focused on the cleavage of α2-macroglobulin, a suicide inhibitor that covalently binds to the protease and inactivates it after cleavage. Overexpression experiments in L929 cells also recently suggested that ADAM19 may participate in the shedding of neuregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, and more specifically of its β isoforms (38Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Finally, interest in the characterization of ADAM19 catalytic activity is further stimulated by the recent discovery that this protein is essential for cardiovascular morphogenesis in mice. 2H. M. Zhou and C. P. Blobel, submitted for publication. As a first step in the biochemical characterization of ADAM19, we expressed and purified two soluble recombinant forms of the mouse enzyme. These proteins are active metalloproteases and were used to identify several in vitro substrates among short peptides corresponding to the region surrounding the cleavage site of shed proteins. We also present the analysis of ADAM19 sensitivity toward tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and the hydroxamic inhibitor BB94 in vitro, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the understanding of the function of this metalloprotease. Finally, using cell-based assays, we assessed the potential physiological relevance of ADAM19 in shedding candidate substrates (TNF-α, TRANCE, and KL-1). Reagents—Mutagenesis oligonucleotides were obtained from GeneLink. The pFastBac1 vector, competent DH10Bac cells, Sf9 cells, serum-free medium-adapted Hi5 cells, and serum-free insect cell media (Sf-900 II SFM and Ultimate Insect serum-free medium) were purchased from Invitrogen. TIMP-1 and -2 were kindly provided by Dr. Gillian Murphy (University of East Anglia, UK), and the His-tagged recombinant N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 was a gift from Dr. Hideaki Nagase (Kennedy Institute, UK). The kit ligand 1 (KL-1) cDNA was provided by Dr. Peter Besmer (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Construction of the ADAM19(EC) and ADAM19(MP) Expression Plasmids—All nucleotide numbers refer to mouse ADAM 19 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF019887 (31Inoue D. Reid M. Lum L. Krätzschmar J. Weskamp G. Myung Y.M. Baron R. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4180-4187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). pcDNA3-EK-Fc was originally generated by inserting a sequence encoding an enterokinase cleavage site (EK; amino acid sequence DDDDK) at the BamHI site of the pcDNA3-Fc vector (39Lum L. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26236-26247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). pFasBac1-EK-Fc was created by transferring the sequence encoding the enterokinase site followed by the human IgG-Fc domain of pcDNA3-EK-Fc between the BamHI and XbaI sites of pFasBac1. pcDNA3/ADAM19(EC)EK-Fc and pFastBac1/ADAM19(EC)EK-Fc were made to express a soluble ADAM19 extracellular domain (EC) fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG in mammalian and insect cells, respectively. Specifically, PCR was used to generate a fragment corresponding to bases 11–2175 of mouse ADAM19 cDNA, bearing BclI sites on both 5′ and 3′ ends. In a two step-PCR procedure, the same fragment carrying the adenine 1075 to cytosine and guanine 1076 to adenine mutations was created. These mutations lead to the production of inactive protease carrying a glutamate to alanine mutation in the catalytic site (E/A mutant). After digestion with BclI, the two restriction products were subcloned at the BamHI site of pcDNA3-EK-Fc and pFastBac1-EK-Fc. In a second step, we generated plasmids to express soluble C-terminally Myc- and poly-His-tagged wild type and E/A mutant ADAM 19 extracellular domains. The SalI-XbaI restriction fragments of pFastBac1/ADAM19(EC)EK-Fc and pFastBac1/ADAM19(ECE/A)EK-Fc were replaced by the corresponding digestion product of pBlSK+-MycHis. The latter plasmid carries the sequence encoding a Myc tag followed by a hexa-histidine tag (amino acid sequence: EQKLISEEDLHHHHHH) subcloned inbetween the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pBlue-script SK(+) (Stratagene). The resulting constructs were used to express the recombinant proteins in insect cells. Finally, pcDNA3/ADAM19(EC)-MycHis and pcDNA3/ADAM19(ECE/A)-MycHis were obtained by replacing the XcmI-XbaI restriction fragment of pcDNA3/ADAM19(EC)EK-Fc by those of pFastBac1/ADAM19(EC)-MycHis or pFastBac1/ADAM19(ECE/A)-MycHis to allow the expression of the same proteins in mammalian cells. Constructs to express a soluble ADAM19 containing only the pro- and metalloprotease domains (MP constructs) were generated in two steps. A fragment corresponding to nucleotides 8–1312 of ADAM19 cDNA and carrying a BamHI site on both ends was generated by PCR. Both the wild type and mutated (adenine 1075 to cytosine and guanine 1076 to adenine mutations encoding the inactive mutant) ADAM19 sequences were amplified. These fragments were introduced at the BamHI site of pBlSK+-MycHis (see above), and the EcoRI-XbaI fragments of the resulting constructs were subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3 and pFastBac1. All constructs were sequenced to rule out undesired mutations. Production of the Anti-ADAM19(ECE/A)EK-Fc Polyclonal Antibodies— pcDNA3/ADAM19(ECE/A)EK-Fc was used to establish CHO lines stably expressing and secreting the extracellular domain of the catalytically inactive ADAM19E/A fused to the Fc domain of the human IgG. After transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), positive clones of CHO cells were selected in F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 unit/ml penicillin, 1 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml of the antibiotic G418 (geneticin; Invitrogen). Expression was monitored by Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-human IgG, Fcγ-specific antibody (Pierce). To produce recombinant ADAM19, stably transfected cells were grown for 3 days in serum-free Opti-MEM-I (Invitrogen). Conditioned media were collected, and the cell debris were removed by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. The soluble ADAM19(ECE/A)EK-Fc fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a 1-ml Hi-Trap rProtein A column (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (40Howard L. Zheng Y. Horrocks M. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by Covance. Expression of Recombinant ADAM19 Proteins in Mammalian Cells— COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1 unit/ml penicillin, and 1 μg/ml streptomycin. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated at the density of 1.5 × 105 per well of 6-well plates. Cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3/ADAM19(EC)-MycHis and pcDNA3/ADAM19(ECE/A)-MycHis using LipofectAMINE. The expression step was carried out in Opti-MEM-I. After 48 h, culture media were collected and incubated with 20 μl of Talon™ resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl. The MycHis-tagged proteins bound to the resin were analyzed by Western blot using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 at the 1:1000 final dilution. Expression of Recombinant ADAM19 Proteins in Insect Cells—Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained using the Bac-to-Bac expression system as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, recombinant bacmids were obtained by transforming DH10Bac competent cells with 1 μg of pFastBac1/ADAM19(EC)-MycHis, pFastBac1/ADAM19(ECE/A)-MycHis, pFastBac1/ADAM19(MP)-MycHis, or pFastBac1/ADAM19(MPE/A)-MycHis. Transfecting Sf9 cells with the recombinant bacmids led to the production of a first viral stock of titer ≈5 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml, which was subsequently amplified. This amplified viral stock was then used to infect Hi5 cells to express the recombinant ADAM19s. The expression step was performed in Ultimate Insect serum-free medium. After 72 h, conditioned media were collected and centrifuged for 2 h at 20,000 × g and 4 °C to pellet the virus particles. The supernatants were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, kept at –80 °C, and later used in proteolytic assays or as a source for ADAM19 purification. Purification of Recombinant ADAM19 Proteins—Supernatants from the 20,000 × g centrifugation (see under “Expression of Recombinant ADAM19 Proteins in Insect Cells”) were incubated with a minimal amount (∼20 μl) of Talon™ metal affinity resin pre-equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl. The binding step was carried out in batch either overnight at 4 °C, or for 30 min at room temperature. After pelleting the resin, the unbound protein solution was removed, and the beads were packed into a small column. The resin was washed with a 20-fold volume of equilibration buffer, and the Myc-His-tagged proteins were eluted with 10 volumes of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 300 mm NaCl. The amount of protein in each fraction was estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Gelcode Blue Reagent (Pierce) staining. The most concentrated fractions were combined and used immediately in proteolytic assays. Proteolytic Assays—Self-proteolysis of recombinant ADAM19(EC)-MycHis was assayed in conditioned media by incubating 10 μl of the supernatant devoid of virus particles (see under “Expression of Recombinant ADAM19 Proteins in Insect Cells”) with 10 μlof50mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 or 8.5, 300 mm NaCl for 16 h at 37 °C. Incubations were performed in the presence or absence of different protease inhibitors, as indicated. The amount of proteolysis was estimated by Western blot analysis using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 at the 1:1000 final dilution. Similar incubations performed with an aliquot of the purified wild type enzyme or of the inactive mutant were analyzed by either Western blot or SDS-PAGE followed by Gelcode Blue staining. Bovine myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) was purified by electroelution from 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (40Howard L. Zheng Y. Horrocks M. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Degradation assays by ADAM19(EC)-MycHis were performed by incubating purified MBP with an aliquot of purified enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl for 1–6 h at 37 °C. Protease inhibitors were added as indicated. MBP degradation by recombinant TACE was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bistris NuPage acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were revealed using the Gelcode Blue Stain reagent. The ability of ADAM19 to cleave insulin B chain (Sigma) and dinitrophenyl-labeled synthetic peptides corresponding to the 12 amino acids surrounding the processing site of selected membrane proteins known to be shed (41Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

Potential substrates at the final concentration of 100 μm were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl for 6 h at 37 °C with an aliquot of wild type purified enzyme in the presence or absence of 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline or with an aliquot of inactive mutant. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and the cleavage products were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-reTOF MS) using a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics Inc.); in isolated cases, the sequences of the peptides were confirmed by operating the instrument in “LIFT” (laser induced fragmentation) mode; the resulting tandem MS/MS spectrum was then inspected for the y″,b″, and a″ ion series in order to confirm the sequence provided (42Erdjument-Bromage H.

Protein N-terminal Sequencing—Purified recombinant ADAM19 or protein mixtures from MBP degradation assays by either ADAM19 or TACE were separated on NuPage 10% Bistris acrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie R-250. After destaining with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, the bands of interest were excised, and the N-terminal amino acids were identified by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 494 automated sequenator, as described previously (44Tempst P. Geromanos S. Elicone C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 248-261Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Generation of TNF, TRANCE, and KL-1 Expression Plasmids—To facilitate the detection of both precursor and shed forms of TNFα, TRANCE, and KL-1, all three proteins were expressed as fusion proteins bearing an alkaline phosphatase (AP) module in their extracellular domain. The engineering of pAPtag5-TNFα was described previously (45Zheng Y. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

An NheI site was introduced 6 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the coding sequence, and TRANCE stop codon and following nucleotides were mutated to create a HindIII site. The PCR product, digested by NheI and HindIII, was subcloned inbetween the corresponding sites of pAPtag5 vector (Genhunter Corp.). The sequence encoding the full-length KL-1 cDNA was subcloned in-frame between the XhoI and XbaI sites of pAPtag5. Briefly, nucleotides 273–275 (GenBank™ accession number U44725) of KL-1 cDNA were mutated to introduce an XhoI site, and nucleotides 1016–1018 around the stop codon were changed to create an XbaI restriction site. All final constructs were sequenced to rule out any unwanted mutations. The resulting fusion proteins are schematized in Fig. 7A. Shedding Assays—COS-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates were cotransfected with either pAPtag5-TRANCE or pAPtag5-KL-1 plasmids together with the control vector pcDNA3, full-length wild type mouse ADAM19 expression plasmid (pcDNA3-ADAM19), mouse ADAM19 inactive mutant expression vector (pcDNA3-ADAM19E/A), or pcDNA3.1-mTACE (45Zheng Y.

https://openalex.org/W2029736231,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate as second messengers in the mitogenic signal transduction. Most of the experimental data supporting the role of ROS as signaling molecules have been obtained by using H2O2. Exposure of cells to H2O2 rapidly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) in the absence of growth factor binding, thus inducing the activation of downstream signaling cascades, like that of protein kinase B (AKT). Another molecule able to induce an increase of intracellular ROS levels is diethylmaleate (DEM), which acts by depleting the ROS scavenger reduced glutathione (GSH). A comparison of the effects exerted by H2O2 and DEM shows that the latter induces redox modifications milder than those generated by H2O2. We also demonstrated that DEM-induced redox modifications are not accompanied by platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R) and epidermal growth factor-receptor Tyr phosphorylation, although they are able to activate ERKs and AKT, with kinetics different from those observed following H2O2 treatment. The activation of these two pathways is not blocked by AG1296, a selective inhibitor of PDGF-R Tyr kinase, thus confirming that the effects of DEM are not mediated by the TKR phosphorylation. On the contrary, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazole[3,4-d]pyrimidine), an inhibitor of Src kinase, completely prevents DEM- and H2O2-induced AKT activation but has no effect on the pathway of ERKs. Finally, nitration of Tyr residues in PDGF-R is observed in DEM-treated cells, thus suggesting that ROS-induced modifications different from Tyr phosphorylation can occur at the growth factor-receptor level and can be involved in the regulation of signaling pathways.

A first group of data shows that one of the events triggered by the binding of growth factors (GF) and cytokines to their cognate receptors is the accumulation of ROS (8Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S.

This phenomenon appears to play a major role in the transduction of the signal, considering that the inhibition of this accumulation, due to scavenging enzymes or to chemical antioxidants, prevents the activation of the downstream transduction pathways (10Irani K.

Further support for the hypothesis of an involvement of ROS in signal transduction came from a second group of observations showing that the exposure of cultured cells to H2O2 results in Tyr phosphorylation of several growth factor receptors, in the absence of growth factor stimulation (1Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 13Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Tyr phosphorylation of GF-R seems to be strong enough to induce the activation of a downstream cascade of events, including AKT and MAPK activation, similar to that observed upon GF stimulation (14Guyton K.Z.

MAPK activation induced by ROS is also responsible for the accumulation of p21waf1 (16Russo T. Zambrano N. Esposito F. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Anderson C.W.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although a transient p21waf1 accumulation is also observed upon GF stimulation, the induction of this protein by ROS is responsible, at least in part, for the growth arrest that is caused by ROS (16Russo T. Zambrano N. Esposito F. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29386-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ROS are also able to activate JNK and p38 (18Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar): the first event is dependent on the activation of Src and, in turn, on Tyr phosphorylation of Cas, thus suggesting a physiological role for ROS in the transduction of signals involved in cell migration. On the contrary, p38 is not involved in the activation of JNK by ROS, as demonstrated by using PP2, the specific Src family Tyr kinase inhibitor (18Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Most of the mentioned experiments have been performed by exposing cells to different concentrations of H2O2, which is not a reactive oxygen species but is rapidly transformed in the hydroxyl radical (HO•), the most harmful ROS. It is still unclear which of the one or more ROS function as second messenger(s) in the cell, and it cannot be excluded that different types and/or concentrations of ROS could yield different effects on different targets within specific cell types. Furthermore, exogenous administration of H2O2, often at concentrations significantly higher than those even reached within the cell in physiological conditions, is probably a procedure not so accurate to mimic what normally occurs in the cell, considering the low diffusion of many ROS as well as the possible compartmentalization of ROS-generating systems. We previously developed a procedure to induce redox modification in intact cells (19Esposito F. Russo T. Cimino F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar): this is based on the exposure of cells to diethylmaleate (DEM), a GSH depleting agent (20Boyland E. Chasseaud L.F. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This experimental system allows the alteration of the concentrations of endogenously generated ROS by inactivating the scavenging systems based on GSH, through the formation of GSH-DEM conjugates. In this report a comparison between the well known consequences of H2O2 treatment and the effects of DEM-induced GSH depletion is presented. The results demonstrate that the activation of ERKs and AKT in cells exposed to DEM is independent from tyrosine phosphorylation of TKRs. Materials and Cell Lines—DEM, H2O2, lucigenin, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, and spermine NOnoate were from Sigma. The Comet assay was from Trevigen. The PDGF-Rβ-specific inhibitor AG1296, genistein, and the selective Src-inhibitor (PP2) and its inactive analogue (PP3) were from Calbiochem; PDGF-BB, EGF, hydrocortisone, and insulin were from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-phospho ERKs, tubulin, and PDGF-Rβ antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

Anti-Src antibody was from Oncogene. Anti-eNOS antibody was from Transduction Laboratories, and the anti-phospho eNOS antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein A (horseradish peroxidase-linked), anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase, and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Rat-2 fibroblasts and MCF10A were from ATCC. HEK293 cells stably transfected with eNOS were gently provided by W. C. Sessa (21Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardenas G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rat-2 fibroblasts and HEK293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone), respectively, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. MCF10A were grown in a solution containing 50% DMEM and 50% Hams' nutrient mixture F-12 (Euroclone), supplemented with 5% FCS (HyClone), 0.24 unit/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Cell Culture Conditions and Treatments—Cells were grown until they reached 90% confluence and then were starved in DMEM containing 0.2% FCS (Rat-2) or 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (MCF10A). After 48 h for Rat-2 and 84 h for MCF10A, cells were stimulated with FCS to a final concentration of 20% or with purified growth factors (80 ng/ml) for 5 min. The oxidizing treatments as well as treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors were performed before mitogenic stimulation. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Analyses—Growth-arrested fibroblasts were treated with or without 20% FCS in the presence or absence of the appropriate amounts of DEM and H2O2 with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see legends of figures for details) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.5) and harvested in the same buffer. Cell lysates and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (22Esposito F. Russo L. Russo T. Cimino F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Antigen·antibodies complexes were detected with a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, after the appropriate treatments, the cells were washed with cold PBS and solubilized at 4 °C for 30 min in 800 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4,50mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 1 mg of proteins was immunoprecipitated by incubating with 1 μg of anti-PDGF-R or anti-EGF-R antibodies for 90 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-SepharoseTM CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and solubilized in 15 μlof4× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gel. Phosphorylation and/or nitration of PDGF-R and EGF-R were analyzed by Western blotting using 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal or anti-nitrotyrosine rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies. Src activity was assayed in Src immunoprecipitates from oxidanttreated and untreated cells, using enolase as substrate (23Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Lucigenin Assays—To measure intracellular superoxide anion production we used lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (10Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollot S.J. Dere C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 24Gylelenhammar H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 97: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) with slight modifications: exponentially growing Rat-2 cells were grown as above described and trypsinized; cell suspension was exposed to DEM and H2O2 for the times indicated in Fig. 4, centrifuged and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (5.5 mm d-glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 136 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4) containing 1 mm lucigenin. Chemiluminescence was recorded using a Berthold LB 9505 luminometer, and consecutive readings were taken at various intervals (5 min). For the determination of a single value, the average of four readings over a 2- to 4-min period was taken, and the mean ± S.D. of four experiments was used to plot the data. Comet Assay—DNA damages were analyzed using the Comet assay (25Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9117) Google Scholar). Slight modifications to the manufacturer's instructions were made: briefly, the cells underwent the oxidizing treatments, as described in the figure legends, and were washed with PBS, trypsinized, re-suspended in PBS, and combined with LM-agarose (supplied in the Trevigen kit assay) at a ratio of 1:8 (cells:agarose). Electrophoretic run and qualitative and/or quantitative analyses were carried out according the Trevigen protocol. Quantitative analyses of the results were done by using the Image software (National Institutes of Health), as suggested by the manufacturer. Data are reported as the ratio between tail/nucleus areas on a log scale. Measurement of Nitrites—After the oxidizing treatments, as described in the figure legends, the culture medium of Rat-2 and HEK293/eNOS cells was collected for the measurement of nitrites. Nitrites were assayed fluorometrically in microtiter plates using a standard curve of sodium nitrite (26Misko T.P. Schilling L.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Effects of Redox Changes Mediated by DEM and H2O2— Several experimental results indicate that signal transduction mediated by growth factors is accompanied by transient accumulation of ROS and that, in the absence of growth factors, exposure of cells to H2O2 mimics some molecular events that follow mitogenic stimulation, including Tyr phosphorylation of growth factor receptors (GF-Rs) and the activation of downstream cascades (1Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11Millis E.M. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V. Katagiri Y. Jiang H. Lavigne M.C. Leto T.L. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22165-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Diethylmaleate (DEM) is an indirect oxidant that yields an accumulation of endogenously produced ROS through a GSH depletion (20Boyland E. Chasseaud L.F. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An activation of ERK1 and ERK2 has been previously demonstrated following both H2O2 (14Guyton K.Z. Lui Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and DEM treatment (16Russo T. Zambrano N. Esposito F. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29386-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). According to these results, Western blot analyses, with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 ERKs, of lysates from Rat-2 fibroblasts exposed to H2O2 or to DEM for 30 min, demonstrated a strong activation of both kinases with either H2O2 or DEM (see Fig. 1, A and B). This activation is significantly stronger than that observed 5 min after serum addition to starved fibroblasts, whereas it is similar to that produced by stimulation of starved cells with PDGF-BB (see Fig. 1, C and D). The simultaneous exposure of cells to mitogenic stimulation and to DEM seems to show a moderate increase of MAPK activation that was not observed when cells were simultaneously stimulated with H2O2 plus PDGF-BB or serum. In contrast, the effects of H2O2 or DEM on TKR phosphorylation are dramatically different. Fig. 2A shows an immunoblot of total cell lysates of Rat-2 fibroblasts, deprived from serum for 48 h and then re-exposed to serum, or to H2O2. The samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF-R β antibody and analyzed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In both cases the receptor becomes Tyr-phosphorylated following the treatments. Similarly, Tyr phosphorylation content of EGF receptor increases following the treatment with H2O2: Fig. 2C shows an immunoblot, in which lysates of MCF10A cells, starved from serum for 84 h and then stimulated with EGF or with H2O2, were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibodies and then analyzed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.Fig. 2DEM is unable to induce PDGF and EGF receptor phosphorylation. Cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PDGF-R and EGF-R and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (p-Tyr). The same filters were reprobed with anti-PDGF-R (A and B) or EGF-R (C and D) antibodies for the normalization of cell lysates. A and B, Rat-2 fibroblasts were treated as described in the legend for Fig. 1. After treatments (80 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 5 min, 1 mm H2O2 for 30 min, or 1 mm DEM for 30 min, in the absence or in presence of the growth factor for the last 5 min), the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the PDGF-β receptor. The arrows indicate the PDGF-R phosphorylated in Tyr (p-Tyr) or the total receptor present in the cell lysates. C and D, MCF10A cells were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” serum-deprived for 84 h, stimulated with EGF (80 ng/ml for 5 min), or treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 30 min or DEM for 30 min, in the absence or in presence of the growth factor for the last 5 min. The arrows indicate the EGF-R phosphorylated in Tyr (p-Tyr) or the total receptor present in the cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Again, both serum and H2O2 treatments induced EGF-R Tyr phosphorylation. On the contrary, in cells exposed to DEM the Tyr phosphorylation content of PDGF-R-β was undistinguishable from that of starved control cells. Furthermore, PDGF-R Tyr phosphorylation was unchanged when DEM treatment was performed simultaneously to serum stimulation (see Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with EGF-R, as shown in Fig. 2D. These results demonstrate that H2O2 and DEM exert different effects on the Tyr phosphorylation of PDGF and EGF receptors: the exposure of cells to H2O2 mimics the effects of growth factors even in the absence of mitogenic stimulation, whereas treatment with DEM is unable to change phospho-Tyr content of these two proteins, both in the presence or in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Protein kinase B (AKT) is another target of ROS downstream the TKR (27Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the effects of DEM treatment on the activation of this Ser-Thr protein kinase and observed a further difference by comparing the effects of H2O2 and DEM on the phosphorylation of AKT. Fig. 3 shows a Western blot of total cell lysates from starved Rat-2 fibroblasts stimulated with serum (panels A and B) or with PDGF-BB (panels C and D). An increased phosphorylation of AKT can be observed using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated Ser-473 of the kinase. A similar activation can be induced by the treatment with H2O2 as well as by the two concomitant treatments (mitogenic and oxidant). However, the effects of DEM on the activation of AKT appear to be different: as shown in Fig. 3B, the phosphorylation of this kinase in cells exposed only to DEM is very low, much lower in comparison to H2O2 treatment, but when serum and DEM are added simultaneously, these two treatments yield a strong synergistic effect on AKT phosphorylation at Ser-473. This result is less pronounced when PDGF-BB, instead of serum, is used to stimulate starved fibroblasts (Fig. 3D): the explanation for this could probably be based on the higher extent of AKT activation by the purified growth factor. One of the mechanisms responsible for the observed effects could be related to possible qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the ROS produced by the two oxidants: to this aim, we exposed Rat-2 fibroblasts to DEM and to H2O2 and measured the generation of superoxide ion using the lucigenin assay (10Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollot S.J. Dere C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 24Gylelenhammar H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 97: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, when Rat-2 fibroblasts are exposed to DEM, a peak of superoxide anion production is observed 30 min after DEM treatment (see Fig. 4A), which follows the DEM-induced GSH depletion (data not shown), whereas, upon treatment of cells with H2O2, the production of superoxide ion is much faster, reaching the maximal value after 1 min, and the amount of ROS generated by H2O2 treatment is at least 10 times higher (Fig. 4A). The differences between DEM and H2O2 suggest the hypothesis that also the activation of MAPK and AKT by these two oxidizing agents could be different. To evaluate this phenomenon we performed time course experiments of MAPK and AKT activation during the treatment with both oxidizing agents: as shown in Fig. 4B, the peak of ERKs and AKT phosphorylation following the treatment with H2O2 is observed already 1–5 min after the treatment, whereas a longer time (30 min) is required for DEM. However, the delay of DEM-induced ERKs activation is not sufficient to explain the absence of TKR phosphorylation, because, even at a longer time of DEM exposure (up to 3 h), the phosphorylation of PDGF-R was undistinguishable from that of starved cells (Fig. 3C). One possible explanation of the observed differences between H2O2 and DEM effects could be the different levels of ROS generation following the exposure of cells to the two agents. In the attempt to analyze H2O2 and DEM effects in comparable experimental conditions, we measured Tyr phosphorylation of PDGF-R following the treatment of cells with various concentrations of H2O2 and DEM. At the same concentration the extent of DNA damage provoked by ROS was measured by using the comet assay (24Gylelenhammar H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 97: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, even at a comparable degree of DNA damage provoked by DEM and H2O2, as for example 0.05 mm H2O2 and 1 mm DEM (see Fig. 5A), the PDGF-R Tyr phosphorylation is induced only by the treatment with H2O2 (see Fig. 5B). Activation of a Non-receptor Tyrosine Kinase Is Involved in DEM-induced Effects—To investigate on possible mechanisms involved in the activation of mitogenic cascade in the absence of the activated tyrosine kinase receptor, we exposed Rat-2 fibroblasts to genistein, a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the catalytic domain of tyrosine kinase and inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of both growth factor receptor and non-receptor Tyr kinases. As shown in Fig. 6A, the activation of AKT by DEM is blocked by genistein pretreatment. To test the involvement of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase in the activation of AKT following DEM treatment, we focused our attention on Src, a tyrosine kinase activated by H2O2 (28Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To this aim we exposed Rat-2 cells to DEM and H2O2 and assayed Src tyrosine kinase activity on a heterologous substrate: Fig. 6B shows an increased Src activity, measured through the phosphorylation of the enolase, in Src immunoprecipitates from DEM- and H2O2-treated cells. The involvement of Src in the activation of AKT was confirmed by exposing the cells to PP2, a selective Src inhibitor, and to PP3, a structurally inactive analogue. Fig. 6C shows a specific inhibition of DEM- and H2O2-induced AKT activation in the presence of this Src inhibitor. On the contrary, PP2 treatment was ineffective in the abolishment of MAPK activation by DEM (Fig. 6C); this last finding is in agreement with previously described results demonstrating that H2O2-induced ERK1 and p38 activities in endothelial cells are Src-independent (18Yoshizumi M.

These results are consistent with a Src-mediated activation of AKT upon oxidizing treatments. DEM-mediated Effects on AKT and ERKs Are Independent of Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Phosphorylation—Fig. 7A illustrates a Western blot of total cell lysates from starved Rat-2 fibroblasts exposed to PDGF-BB, DEM, or H2O2, with or without AG1296, a specific inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of PDGF-R. The effects of DEM on AKT do not require PDGF-R phosphorylation: in fact, Fig. 7A shows that, although the activation of AKT by PDGF-BB is highly decreased in Rat-2 cells pretreated with the inhibitor, the same treatment does not yield any effect in cells exposed to DEM. Surprisingly, in cells pretreated with the PDGF-R inhibitor and then exposed simultaneously to the growth factor and to DEM, the effect of DEM is reinforced. Similar results were obtained for ERKs. As a control, the analysis of Tyr phosphorylation of PDGF-R is shown to exclude direct inactivation of AG1296 inhibitor by the oxidizing treatments (Fig. 7A). These results confirm that the activation of downstream targets following DEM treatment does not require tyrosine autophosphorylation of PDGF-R but suggest that PDGF·PDGF-R interaction could have some role in the activation of downstream cascades, even in the absence of receptor phosphorylation. We therefore hypothesized that modifications of Tyr residues other than phosphorylation could be involved in the activation of the downstream cascade: to this aim we focused our attention on tyrosine nitration, a modification that can occur in proteins and is involved in the modulation of signaling processes starting from receptors of tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling cascades (29Klotz L.O. Schoereder P. Sies H. Free Radic. Mol. Biol. 2002; 33: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Monteiro H.P. Free Radic. Mol. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 7B shows a Western blot of cell lysates from starved Rat-2 fibroblasts exposed to serum, DEM, or spermidine NOnoate, a positive control of intracellular NO generation. After these treatments cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF-R antibodies and then analyzed by immunoblot with anti-nitrotyrosine antibody: the amount of PDGF-R tyrosine nitration in DEM-treated cells was comparable to that present in the positive control, whereas it seemed to be absent in serum-treated cells. To investigate how DEM treatment induces the nitrosylation of PDGF-R, we measured the amount of NO produced by Rat-2 cells after DEM treatment. A total nitrites assay in the culture medium demonstrated that a significant nitrite accumulation was present after DEM exposure. Conversely, in the same experimental conditions, treatment with H2O2 was ineffective (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that DEM-induced NO accumulation is due to eNOS activation: this specific matter was demonstrated by using HEK293 cells stably transfected with eNOS and exposed to the two oxidizing agents (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, by using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated Ser-1177 of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, we demonstrated that DEM treatment promotes eNOS phosphorylation, which indicates eNOS activation (Fig. 8B).Fig. 8DEM treatment induces nitrite accumulation and eNOS activation.A, effect of DEM treatment on nitrites in Rat-2 and HEK293/eNOS. Rat-2 cells were grown in serum-free medium for 48 h and then treated with DEM 1 mm and H2O2 50 μm for 30 min. Growing HEK293/eNOS cells were treated with the same DEM and H2O2 concentrations. The medium was collected, and nitrites were assayed fluorometrically (26Misko T.P. Schilling L.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as -fold increases by assuming the nitrite concentration in starved and untreated controls equal 1. The control value was 0.09 ± 0.08 nm. B, DEM treatment induces eNOS phosphorylation in HEK293/eNOS cells. Growing HEK293/eNOS cells were treated with DEM 1 mm, H2O2 50 μm, and 500 nm sphingosine 1-phosphate (SP) for 30 min. Cell lysates containing 35 μg of protein were analyzed by Western blot anti-phospho eNOS (p-eNOS); the same filter was re-probed with an antibody anti-eNOS for the normalization of cell lysates. The arrows indicate the phosphorylated forms of eNOS (p-eNOS) and the total eNOS, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of results have accumulated in the literature on the involvement of ROS in growth factor signal transduction. Most of these data have been obtained upon the exposure of cells to H2O2, which causes tyrosine kinase receptor phosphorylation, in the absence of growth factor stimulation. In this report we have demonstrated that redox modifications induced by DEM are accompanied by the activation of ERKs and AKT, even if TKR phosphorylation is completely absent. This different behavior between DEM and H2O2 could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the ROS generated by these two agents. In fact, the timing and the extent of superoxide anion production are very different, being much higher, at least 10 times compared with DEM, and faster in the cells treated with H2O2. Furthermore, we found that DEM induces milder redox modifications, as demonstrated by the lower extent of DNA damage in cells exposed to this compound, compared to that observed in H2O2-treated cells. The timing and the quantitative differences of ROS production could explain the different timing of MAPK and AKT activation by DEM and H2O2; in fact, both kinases are rapidly activated by H2O2 (within 1 min), whereas longer exposures to DEM are required. However, even by using concentrations of H2O2 and DEM leading to similar intracellular redox modifications, Tyr phosphorylation of GF-R could be observed only with H2O2 and not with DEM. Therefore, one possible explanation of this difference is that the intracellular compartments in which ROS are produced respectively by the two oxidants is different. In fact H2O2 generates ROS both outside and inside the cell, whereas DEM, acting through the enzymatic depletion of GSH and the consequent accumulation of endogenous “unscavenged” ROS, is expected to affect mainly intracellular redox conditions. The main finding of this report is, then, that ERK and AKT pathways can be activated by ROS also through mechanisms different from the GF-R Tyr phosphorylation. At least in the case of AKT, the observed activation is, however, dependent on Tyr kinase activity, given the abolishment of the phenomenon in cells treated with genistein. The non-receptor Tyr kinase Src is activated by both DEM and H2O2, and treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of this kinase, PP2, completely blocks AKT activation by both prooxidant molecules. These results support the hypothesis that intracellular ROS accumulation leads to the activation of nonreceptor TKs, without a contemporary phosphorylation of GF-R. This phenomenon triggers the induction of AKT survival pathway and has no effect on the machinery of ERKs. This last result is in agreement with the data of Yoshizumi et al. (18Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) demonstrating that neither ERK or p38 are activated by H2O2 through an Src-dependent mechanism. To explain these observations a direct effect of ROS on Src TK activity could be hypothesized, although it is quite surprising that ROS selectively activate Src and not GF-R. As mentioned above, one possibility is that ROS generated by DEM are restricted to the intracellular compartments where they are normally generated (e.g. mitochondria); it is possible that in these areas they are only challenged with non-receptor TK as Src and not with membrane bound GF-R. The mechanisms through which ERKs are activated by DEM in the absence of both GF-R and non-receptor TK remain to be established. Previous results demonstrated that this activation of ERKs is blocked by dominant negative mutants of ras (17Esposito F. Cuccovillo F. Vanoni M. Cimino F. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Russo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and this result contributes to the positioning of ROS targets on ras itself or upstream of this molecule. The results obtained with the selective PDGF-R inhibitor AG1296, besides being of support for a PDGF-R phospho-Tyr-independent activation of AKT and ERKs upon DEM treatment, also suggest an interesting hypothesis. In fact, even though PDGF-R is not phosphorylated following DEM treatment, in the presence of the specific PDGF-R inhibitor AG1296 and the growth factor, the effects of DEM are significantly reinforced. These results suggest that the PDGF·PDGF-R complex could have some role in the activation of downstream cascades, even in the absence of receptor autophosphorylation, e.g. PDGF·PDGF-R could act as a scaffold protein, facilitating the transduction of the signals independently from its Tyr kinase activity. Other proteins interacting with tyrosine kinase receptors not through TKR tyrosine phosphorylation include the Enigma protein whose binding to Ret/ptc2, the constitutively active, oncogenic form of the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, is required for mitogenic signaling by this TKR (31Durick K. Gill G.L. Taylor S.S Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and RALT, an ErbB-2-interacting protein, whose binding does not require the receptor autophosphorylation (32Fiorentino L. Pertica C. Fiorini M. Talora C. Crescenzi M. Castellani M. Alema S. Benedetti P. Segatto O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7735-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A mechanism that could contribute to the activation of the mitogenic pathway in the absence of Tyr phosphorylation includes Tyr modifications different from phosphorylation such as, for example, nitration. It is well known that the nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins occurs through the action of ROS and nitrogen species and is considered a marker of oxidative stress in physiological conditions (33Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 34Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that nitration of tyrosine residues may have some role in the modulation of signaling processes: a nitrotyrosine-containing peptide could induce lyn kinase activation through a displacement of the phosphotyrosine, present in lyn C-terminal tail, from its SH2 binding site (35Mallozzi C. Di Stasi M.A.M. Minetti M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Minetti M. Mallozzi C. Di Stasi A.M.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are results demonstrating that nitration of Tyr-15 of p34cdc2 kinase prevents the phosphorylation of this residue catalyzed by the lck kinase (37Kong S.K. Yim M.B. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3377-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Tyr nitration in PDGF-R occurs following DEM treatment, whereas it is completely absent upon serum stimulation. Interestingly, our results strongly support the hypothesis that PDGF-R nitrosylation upon DEM treatment is most likely linked to eNOS activation. On this basis it could be hypothesized that DEM treatment does not induce Tyr phosphorylation of PDGF-R because Tyr residues are already modified (by nitration) in these experimental conditions. Finally, the synergistic activation of AKT that we observe when the cells are simultaneously exposed to serum and DEM could be the result of two independent mechanisms: one mediated by the phosphorylation of some Tyr residues in PDGF-R, which follows serum stimulation, and the other by the nitration of some other Tyr residues, upon DEM treatment; both processes can converge on and contribute to AKT activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ROS can activate signaling cascades, even in the absence of growth factor receptor phosphorylation, and suggest the possibility of a new mechanism for the activation of transduction pathways based on Tyr nitration of TKRs. From a regulatory point of view it should be ascertained that, due to the existence of specific “denitrases” (38Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Bian K. Balabanli B. Davis K. Martin E. Behbod F. Lee Y.C. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11584-11589Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the nitration of Tyr residues is a reversible process. Acknowledgments—We thank A. Tomasi and A. C.

Growth factors stimulate actin remodeling and membrane ruffling by integration of signaling pathways that regulate actin-binding proteins. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the activity of many actin-binding proteins and is produced by the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKIs). Here we show in MG-63 cells that only the PIPKIα isoform is localized to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced membrane ruffles. Further, expression of kinase dead PIPKIα, which acts as a dominant negative mutant, blocked membrane ruffling, suggesting that PIPKIα and PIP2 participate in ruffling. To explore this, PIPKIα was overexpressed in serum-starved cells and stimulated with PDGF. In serum-starved cells, PIPKIα expression did not stimulate actin remodeling, but when these cells were stimulated with PDGF, actin rapidly reorganized into foci but not membrane ruffles. PIPKIα-mediated formation of actin foci was independent of both Rac1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. Significantly, coexpression of dominant active Rac1 with PIPKIα in PDGF-stimulated cells resulted in membrane ruffling. The PDGF- and Rac1-stimulated ruffling was inhibited by expression of kinase-dead PIPKIα. Combined, these data support a model where the localized production of PIP2 by PIPKIα is necessary for actin remodeling, whereas formation of membrane ruffles required Rac signaling.

Combined, these data support a model where the localized production of PIP2 by PIPKIα is necessary for actin remodeling, whereas formation of membrane ruffles required Rac signaling. The movement of cells in response to chemoattractants or growth factors is mediated by coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, involving polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments in lamellipodia or membrane ruffles (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horowitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The nucleation of polarized actin filaments leads to formation of protrusions and membrane ruffles critical for migration (2Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Remodeling the actin cytoskeleton to form membrane ruffles and actin foci requires the activity of several actin-binding proteins, such as the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein)-Arp2/3 complex, α-actinin, talin, vinculin, and gelsolin (3Hartwig J.H.

Many of these proteins are themselves modulated by the lipid signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PIPKI, type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PIPKII, type II phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; kn, kinase-negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PH, pleckstrin homology; PLC, phospholipase C. 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PIPK, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PIPKI, type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PIPKII, type II phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; kn, kinase-negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PH, pleckstrin homology; PLC, phospholipase C. (8Ayscough K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Importantly, actin nucleation is spatially organized during cell migration, therefore requiring the local generation of phosphoinositides specifically PIP2. PIP2 is generated from phosphatidylinositol by sequential phosphorylation of the 4- and 5-hydroxyl groups by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPK), respectively (9Rana R. Hokin L.E. Phys. Rev. 1990; 70: 115-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase (PI3K) utilizes PIP2 as substrate resulting in the production of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is an activator of the small G-protein Rac leading to membrane ruffle formation. Inhibition of PI3K by both molecular and pharmacological approaches blocks membrane ruffling and inhibits cell migration (11Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Thus, PIP2 and PIPK activity are intrinsically linked to membrane ruffling and cell migration, but the mechanism for PIPK involvement has not been defined. Two PIPK subfamilies, each consisting of α, β, and γ isoforms, have been identified and characterized both biochemically and molecularly (10Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Type II PIPKs (PIPKIIs) are distinct, in their substrate specificity and function, from the type I PIPK (PIPKI) enzymes. Overexpression of PIPKI, but not PIPKII isoforms, in fibroblasts results in decreased stress fiber formation and formation of highly dynamic actin structures termed actin foci and comets (12Shibasaki Y.

In fibroblasts and macrophages, overexpression of kinase-dead PIPKIα and PIPKIβ mutants do not induce actin foci and comets, indicating that PIP2 production is a necessary for remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (12Shibasaki Y.

When overexpressed, all PIPKI isoforms target to the plasma membrane; thus, it has been difficult to define the specific PIPKI isoform involved in membrane ruffling. In contrast, PIPKII are primarily cytosolic upon overexpression. Interestingly, Kunz et al. (16Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation loop (amino acids 374–396 in PIPKIIβ) is responsible for determination of substrate specificity and subcellular targeting of the overexpressed PIPKs. When the activation loops of the type I and type II PIPKs are swapped, the substrate specificity is also swapped, where a type II PIPK can then utilize PI4P as substrate and localize to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the type II PIPK with a type I PIPK activation loop has PIPK activity at the plasma membrane but very poorly induces actin remodeling (16Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Kunz J. Fuelling A. Kolbe L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5611-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). From these studies, simple PIP2 production at the plasma membrane is not sufficient to induce actin remodeling. Therefore, other features of the PIPKI isoforms are required for actin remodeling. There is growing evidence that each type I PIPK isoform has distinct subcellular localization and therefore distinct function. PIPKIγ 661 is targeted specifically to focal adhesions, modulates talin assembly, and regulates formation of focal adhesions (18Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The targeting of PIPKIγ 661 to focal adhesions provides an example of a mechanism by which PIP2 is generated at specific subcellular sites. Determining the specific PIPKI isoform that is involved in membrane ruffling will provide a mechanism for spatial PIP2 production in regulation of actin dynamics. Signaling pathways that coordinate changes in the actin cytoskeleton include the Rho family of small G-proteins (19Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 20Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 12: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In migrating cells, Rac1 and RhoA activities are required for the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, stress fibers, and focal adhesions, which are each actin-dependent cellular structures that are dynamically reorganized during migration (21Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small G-proteins requires stimulation with agonists such as PDGF as well as PIP2 signaling to modulate actin assembly (22Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K.

Stimulation of cells via G-protein-coupled receptors leads to PIPKIα translocation to the plasma membrane and is dependent upon Rac and Rho signaling (30Chatah N.E.H. Abrams C S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34059-34065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports have shown that Rac is also able to activate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity, providing substrate to the PIPKIs (31Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P.

Therefore, these data suggest that Rac is potentially involved in stimulating PI4P and PIP2 synthesis at the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which PIPKI isoforms function in actin remodeling and Rac-dependent membrane ruffling is not well defined. In this report, the role of PIPKI signaling in the regulation of actin remodeling leading to the formation of actin foci and membrane ruffles is investigated. PIPKIα is identified as the specific PIPKI isoform that localizes to membrane ruffles. The results show that following PDGF stimulation, endogenous PIPKIα is targeted to membrane ruffles. In addition, PIPKIα activity coordinates with Rac signaling and is required for the formation of membrane ruffles.

His-tagged PIPKIβ was expressed in E. coli BL21(λDE3) (Novagen) for 3 h and purified with His resin (Novagen) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Indirect Immunofluorescence— MG-63 osteosarcoma fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Transfection and immunofluorescence was performed as described (16Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, PIPKIα and Rac were cotransfected at a ratio of 1:3 (PIPKI/Rac) or as indicated with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and washed (15Coppolino M.G. Dierckman R. Loijens J. Collins R.F. Pouladi M. Jongstra-Bilen J. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Anderson R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43849-43857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies (PIPKI polyclonal antibodies or anti-Myc 9E10) were diluted in 3% IgG free bovine serum albumin (Jackson Immunoresearch). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch. Actin was stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Imaging—Cells were examined using a × 60 plan oil immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.4) on a Bio-Rad MR 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope mounted transversely to an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200 (Keck Biological Imaging Laboratory; available on the World Wide Web at keck.bioimaging.wis-c.edu). Images were processed as described (18Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were also captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with a CoolSNAP CCD camera (RS Photometrics) with the CoolSNAP software. Images were then further processed in Photoshop 6.0. Quantification of Actin Remodeling—Actin foci formations in cells microinjected with PIPKIα were quantified by counting cells as positive for actin foci when large increases in the formation of these actin structures were present compared with control surrounding cells. Cells with few foci (10 or less) were counted as negative. Cells were counted in both the –PDGF and +PDGF treatment. The same criteria were followed when counting cells after treatment with LY294002 or Me2SO control. Membrane ruffling was quantified by counting the cells overexpressing PIPKIα compared with control neighboring cells. In all cotransfection experiments, PIPKIα was transfected at a ratio of 1:3 (PIPKIα/Rac) unless otherwise indicated. PIPKIα-overexpressing cells were divided into three categories: cells with no ruffles, peripheral ruffles, and increased membrane ruffles. Peripheral ruffles were defined as cells with a single membrane ruffle around the edge of the cell similar to membrane ruffles induced by expression of dominant active Rac in cells (see example in Fig. 4). Cells with peripheral membrane ruffles were not counted as representing an increase in membrane ruffling. An increase in membrane ruffles was identified as cells with small yet numerous ruffles over the surface of the cell, sometimes forming circular dorsal ruffles. All quantifications were determined from two or three independent experiments. Error bars were determined by S.E. and calculated using Sigma Plot. Immunoblotting—MG-63 cell lysates were made by washing the cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, with the addition of protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA method (Pierce). Lysates were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.). Chemiluminescent substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was used for visualization on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Microinjection—MG-63 fibroblasts were plated on glass bottom dishes (Bioptechs) and grown for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm Hepes for 72 h prior to microinjection. PIPKI constructs were prepared in microinjection buffer (5 mm potassium glutamate and 150 mm KCl) at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml (34Malliri A. Symons M. Hennigan R.F. Hurlstone A.F Lamb R.F. Wheeler T. Ozanne B.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to express protein for 3 h prior to fixation. For PDGF stimulation, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (R & D Systems, Inc.) was added to the cells for 10 min and then fixed as previously described. In experiments with LY294002, 25 μm LY294002 (Sigma) was added to the cells for 30 min, and PDGF was then added for 10 min followed by immunofluorescence. Microinjection of recombinant Rac protein was injected into cells expressing PIPKI cDNA for 3 h. Glutathione S-transferase Rac was purified and prepared as described (35Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). Rac protein was microinjected at 500 μg/ml with nonspecific mouse IgG at 500 μg/ml, and the cells were allowed to recover for 30 min and then treated as indicated prior to fixation. Microinjections were performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with an Eppendorf microinjection unit (Micro-injector model 5242, Micromanipulator model 5170 with a heated stage from Bioptechs). Endogenous Localization of PIPKI Isoforms—Spatial production of PIP2 at various subcellular sites is likely to be regulated by specific PIPKI isoforms. PIP2 is reported to be enriched at membrane ruffles (36Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so we then determined which PIPKI isoform localized to membrane ruffles using specific antibodies generated against either PIPKIα or PIPKIβ. The polyclonal antibodies were isoform-specific for PIPKIα and PIPKIβ (Fig. 1A). The PIPKIγ splice variants are of larger molecular size and were not detected by either antibody (15Coppolino M.G. Dierckman R. Loijens J. Collins R.F. Pouladi M. Jongstra-Bilen J. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Anderson R. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PIPKIα and PIPKIβ are ubiquitously expressed, and the antibodies specifically detected endogenous kinase in MG-63 fibroblasts as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). The isoform specificity of the PIPKI polyclonal antibodies for use in immunofluorescent staining was confirmed by staining cells that overexpressed FLAG epitope-tagged PIPKIα or PIPKIβ. The cells expressing FLAG-PIPKIα were probed with the anti-PIPKIβ antibody and an anti-FLAG antibody to detect transfected cells and repeated with cells expressing FLAG-PIPKIβ with the anti-PIPKIα antibodies. Anti-PIPKIα antibodies did not recognize cells overexpressing FLAG-PIPKIβ, and the same was found with the anti-PIPKIβ antibodies (data not shown). There was no isoform cross-reactivity with the polyclonal PIPKIα and PIPKIβ antibodies. Endogenous PIPKIα was detected at membrane ruffles, diffuse in the cytosol, and within the nucleus by immunofluorescent staining. In contrast, PIPKIβ was detected primarily in cytosolic vesicular structures that are perinuclear, and staining was not observed in membrane ruffles (Fig. 1C). These results support the hypothesis that endogenous PIPKIα and PIPKIβ isoforms generate PIP2 at specific subcellular sites and that PIPKIα may be responsible for synthesis of PIP2 at membrane ruffles. PIPKIα Translocates to Membrane Ruffles following PDGF Stimulation—PDGF stimulation of serum-starved cells, including MG-63 fibroblasts, resulted in rapid reorganization of actin to form membrane ruffles (39Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Wennstrom S. Yokote K. Siegbahn A.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 111-120PubMed Google Scholar). Since PIP2 modulates actin dynamics and is reported to be concentrated at membrane ruffles, we investigated the effects of PDGF stimulation on the subcellular localization of endogenous PIPKIα and PIPKIβ. MG-63 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 72 h and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) to induce membrane ruffling. As shown in Fig. 2, serum-starved MG-63 fibroblasts contain stress fibers and cortical actin bands but lack membrane ruffles. To define endogenous PIPKI localization, cells were fixed and analyzed with and without PDGF stimulation. Only PIPKIα accumulated at PDGF-induced membrane ruffles (Fig. 2A). In the serum-starved cells, PIPKIα is primarily cytosolic and nuclear. Localization of PIPKIβ remains unchanged after stimulation (Fig. 2B). Costaining with an antibody to PIP2 (AM212) clearly showed an increase in PIP2 and colocalization with PIPKIα at membrane ruffles upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2C). PIP2 has also been detected at membrane ruffles with a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific PH domain of PLCδ (36Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Watt S.A. Kular G. Fleming I.N. Downes C.P. Lucocq J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These data show that endogenous PIPKIα localizes to membrane ruffles and correlates with the localized synthesis of PIP2. PIP2 synthesis was inhibited to assess the significance of PIP2 production in membrane ruffling. PIPKIα kinase-dead (PIPKIα kn) is able to act as a dominant negative in the inhibition of phagocytosis in macrophages. PIPKIα kn has <1% of wild-type activity but retains its localization at the plasma membrane (15Coppolino M.G. Dierckman R. Loijens J. Collins R.F. Pouladi M. Jongstra-Bilen J. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Anderson R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43849-43857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether PIPKIα kn was able to inhibit PDGF-stimulated membrane ruffle formation, PIPKIα kn was transiently transfected into MG-63 fibroblasts and expressed for 15 h without serum. The formation of membrane ruffles was stimulated with PDGF for 15 min and analyzed by immunofluorescence to detect actin and PIPKIα kn. PIPKIα kn effectively blocked PDGF-stimulated membrane ruffling (Fig. 3). The data indicate that PIPKIα is responsible for PIP2 synthesis at membrane ruffles and supports a key role for PIP2 in membrane ruffle formation. Endogenous PIPKIα Translocates to Rac-induced Membrane Ruffles—Membrane ruffle formation requires the activation of Rac1 and downstream effectors for regulation of actin assembly. Recent studies have also shown that cotransfection of dominant active Rac1 or Arf6 with epitope-tagged murine PIPKIα or PIPKIβ, respectively, results in translocation of overexpressed PIPKI to the plasma membrane and to membrane ruffles (29Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34059-34065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that when overexpressed, both PIPKI isoforms can be targeted to membrane ruffles. We next wanted to define which endogenous PIPKI isoform is targeted to Rac-induced membrane ruffles. Transient overexpression of dominant active Rac1 (Myc-RacL61) in MG-63 fibroblasts results in the formation of membrane ruffles around the cell periphery. Endogenous PIPKIα, but not endogenous PIPKIβ, translocated to Rac-induced membrane ruffles (Fig. 4). These data demonstrated that PIPKIα localized to both PDGF- and Rac-induced membrane ruffles. PIPKIα-induced Actin Remodeling Is PDGF-dependent—We next investigated how PIPKIα and PIP2 contributed to membrane ruffle assembly. Previous studies have shown that transient overexpression of all murine PIPKI isoforms induces actin remodeling, forming actin foci and actin comets (12Shibasaki Y. Ishirhara H. Kizuki N. Asano T.

This is the first demonstration of the effects of eliminating (short-chain) β-oxidation capacity in plants and shows that a functional β-oxidation cycle is essential in the early stages of embryo development. In oilseed plants, seed lipid reserves are catabolized to provide metabolic energy and carbon skeletons to fuel germination and early postgerminative growth (2Kindl H. Stumpf P.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 9. Academic Press Inc., New York1987: 31-50Google Scholar). Peroxisomal β-oxidation plays an essential role in the catabolism of fatty acids from storage lipid during this phase. This pathway plays additional roles including general housekeeping functions in membrane lipid turnover in all cells and as a salvage pathway of primary galactolipids during foliar senescence, reviewed by Graham and Eastmond (3Graham I.A. Eastmond P.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 156-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Additionally, β-oxidation is induced to supply respiratory substrates in carbohydrate-deprived maize root tips (4Dieuaide M. Brouquisse R. Pradet A. Raymond P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couee I. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 657-660Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acid-derived signaling molecules such as jasmonic acid (6Wasternack C. Parthier B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and traumatin (7Farmer E.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A mutation in the β-oxidation gene aim1 displays abnormal inflorescence meristems, suggesting that β-oxidation may be involved in floral development (8Richmond T.A. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently, the increased expression of an acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX2) gene of β-oxidation in response to UV light suggests that the pathway may be induced to provide acetyl-CoA substrate for secondary metabolism (9Logemann E. Tavernaro A. Schulz W. Somssich I.E. Hahlbrock K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Logemann E Hahlbrock K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2428-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The β-oxidation pathway breaks down acyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA via the repeated cleavage of acetate units from the thiol end of the acyl-CoA molecule. With each round of β-oxidation, the substrate chain length shortens by 2 carbon units. The acetyl-CoA units produced are converted to succinate by the glyoxylate cycle, and this is then metabolized into sugars by gluconeogenesis. In Arabidopsis, the degradation of common, straight chain fatty acids involves the sequential activity of three gene families: the acyl-CoA oxidases (ACX), multifunctional proteins (MFP), and l-3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases. The ACX gene family products catalyze the conversion of fatty acyl-CoAs to trans-2-enoyl CoAs (EC 1.3.3.6). This first step is believed to be predominant in exerting control over the rate of carbon flux through the pathway (11Holtman W.L. Heistek J.C. Mattern K.A. Bakhuizen R. Douma A.C.

Two additional ACX genes, ACX5 (MIPS code At2g35690) and ACX6 (MIPS code At1g06310) are present in the Arabidopsis genome. ACX5 exhibits 85% identity with ACX1, and one expressed sequence tag currently exists in the MIPS Arabidopsis data base (AV786007). Expression analysis using RT-PCR indicates that the level of ACX5 expression in 2-day-old seedlings is less than 10% that of ACX1. 3E. L. Rylott and I. A. Graham, unpublished results.3E. L. Rylott and I. A. Graham, unpublished results. The ACX6 gene occurs adjacent with ACX3 on chromosome 1 and exhibits 87% identity with it. However, there are no expressed sequence tags reported in the MIPS data base for ACX6, and its expression was undetectable in 2-day-old seedlings using RT-PCR analysis. 3E. L. Rylott and I. A. Graham, unpublished results. All six Arabidopsis ACX isoforms contain two common motifs (PROSITE numbers PS00072 and PS00073, available on the World Wide Web at ca.expasy.org) that are homologous to the conserved signatures from mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (16Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), and these regions may be important in substrate interaction (15Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A.

There are two MFP genes identified in the Arabidopsis genome; MFP2 (MIPS code At3g06860) shows a significant induction during germination and seedling growth (17Eastmond P.J. Graham I.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 95-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas AIM1 (MIPS code At4g29010) is expressed predominantly in the silique and flower (8Richmond T.A. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar). The predominantly expressed thiolase during early postgerminative growth in Arabidopsis is ketoacyl-CoA thiolase 2 (KAT2/PED1) (MIPS code At2g33150). The ACX1, ACX2, ACX3, ACX4, MFP2, and KAT2 genes are all up-regulated coordinately during Arabidopsis seed germination and early postgerminative growth (18Rylott E.L. Hooks M.A. Graham I.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), correlating with the period of most rapid fatty acid degradation in Arabidopsis (19Germain V. Rylott E.L. Larson T.R. Sherson S.M. Bechtold N. Carde J.P. Bryce J.H. Graham I.A. Smith S.M. Plant J. 2001; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The β-oxidation proteins are targeted to the peroxisome by a variety of signaling motifs. The KAT2 protein contains a peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2) N-terminal sequence that is cleaved upon import into the peroxisome (20Olsen C. Thomsen K.K. Svendsen I. Brandt A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 138-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and ACX2 also contains a putative PTS2 sequence (13Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A.

The AIM1 protein contains a PTS1, ending in the amino acids Ser, Lys, and Leu, and the ACX1 contains a putative PTS1, Ala, Arg, and Leu (13Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. In acx3 seedlings, there is a large reduction (>95% of wild type) in medium-chain, acyl-CoA oxidase activity. However, the phenotype of acx3 is unaltered throughout the life cycle of the plant, and seedling lipid breakdown is not affected, most probably due to the overlapping substrate specificities of the ACX1 and ACX4 gene products (1Eastmond P.J.

The aim1 mutant shows abnormal inflorescence development (8Richmond T.A. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that β-oxidation may play a role in floral development. However, seedling growth is not compromised in the aim1 mutant, presumably because the AtMFP2 gene encodes the predominant multifunctional protein responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation at this stage. In both the ped1 and kat2 mutants, postgerminative seedling growth arrests in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose. In addition, seedlings of kat2 are unable to catabolize storage triacylglycerol (TAG) and accumulate long-chain (C16:0-C20:0) acyl-CoA units (19Germain V. Rylott E.L. Larson T.R. Sherson S.M. Bechtold N. Carde J.P. Bryce J.H. Graham I.A. Smith S.M. Plant J. 2001; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Five-day-old ped1 and kat2 seedlings grown in the light also have enlarged peroxisomes with lipid bodies still present in the cotyledons (19Germain V. Rylott E.L. Larson T.R. Sherson S.M. Bechtold N.

Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica disrupted in multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE2), a homologue of MFP2, also has enlarged peroxisomes (23Smith J.J. Brown T.W. Eitzen G.A. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20168-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis mutants in β-oxidation genes show resistance to the compound 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid (2,4-DB), which is metabolized to the herbicide and auxin analogue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by β-oxidation (22Hayashi H.

Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville1998: 343-345Google Scholar). The ped1/kat2 seedlings exhibit a high level of resistance to 2,4-DB (up to 10 μm) whereas acx3 and aim1 seedlings are only resistant at lower concentrations (up to 2 μm) (1Eastmond P.J.

There are several characteristics of the ACX4 gene that distinguish it from the ACX1,-2, and -3 genes. Intriguingly, the ACX4 gene sequence is more closely related to mammalian mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases than to other ACX genes. Mammalian peroxisomes are unable to β-oxidize short-chain acyl-CoAs, and fatty acids are shuttled to the mitochondria instead for completion of the process involving acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (23Smith J.J. Brown T.W. Eitzen G.A. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20168-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ACX1, -2, and -3 isozymes share common characteristics; they are all dimers, with similar subunit molecular masses, pH optima, and respective substrate affinities. However, ACX4 exists as a homotetramer with a Km double that of ACX1, -2, and -3 (25Eastmond P.J Hooks M. Graham I.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of short-chain (C6:0) ACX in 2-day-old Arabidopsis seedling extracts is significantly higher than medium-chain (C12:0) ACX (Fig. 2b and Ref. 1Eastmond P.J.

In mammals and yeast, coordinate regulation of peroxisomal β-oxidation genes is via free fatty acids or acyl-CoAs (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Wolf G. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In plants, although there is some correlative evidence suggesting that acyl-CoAs are involved in controlling peroxisomal size and morphology in Arabidopsis seedlings (29Graham I.A. Li L. Larson T.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), peroxisomal β-oxidation regulation is not yet understood. Together, these factors made ACX4 an interesting target for reverse genetics analysis. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Seeds were surface-sterilized and germinated in continuous light on 1% (w/v) agar plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (30Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-496Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) (plus 20 mm sucrose where indicated) at 20 °C following 4 days of imbibition at 4 °C in the dark. For experiments with etiolated seedlings, plates were transferred back to the dark at 20 °C after a 1-h exposure to white light. Mutant Isolation—We screened the T-DNA-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) population at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (available on the World Wide Web at www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/) (31Sussman M.R. Amasino R.M. Young J.C. Krysan P.J. Austin-Phillips S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1465-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), using primers to the ACX4 gene, 5′-GTC CGC AAT TTC TCC GTC ACT ATC ATA AC-3′ and 5′-GTT AAC AAA TGG TAT TTC CCC CAG TAC AA-3′. The population consists of 60,480 Arabidopsis lines (32Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Sussman M.R. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) transformed with a derivative of the T-DNA vector pD991: pD991-AP3. Sequence flanking the left border of the T-DNA insert was sequenced using the left border primer JL202 (5′-CAT TTT ATA ATA ACG CTG CGG ACA TCT AC-3′). Enzyme Assays, Protein, and Western Blot Analysis—ACX assays were performed on plant tissue and bacterial cell extracts according to the method of Hryb and Hogg (33Hryb D.J. Hogg J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), using 50 μm acyl-CoAs as substrate. Arabidopsis embryos were dissected from siliques using a light microscope, and the embryonic stages were as described by Jurgens and Mayer (34Jurgens G. Mayer U. Arabidopsis Embryos: Colour Atlas of Development. Genetics Unit of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK1994Google Scholar). Soluble protein was measured on the same extracts as those used for enzyme assays, according to the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). X-Gluc histochemical staining was carried out as described by Jefferson (36Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (3992) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out using an antibody raised against the Arabidopsis ACX4 protein as previously described by Hayashi et al. (15Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This antibody was shown to recognize specifically recombinant Arabidopsis ACX4 protein (15Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid and Acyl-CoA Measurement—Fatty acids were measured using the method of Browse et al. (37Browse J. Mc Court P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and acyl-CoAs were measured using the method of Larson and Graham (38Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2001; 25: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications of Larson et al. (39Larson T.R. Edgell T. Byrne J. Dehesh K. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2002; 32: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Total RNA from various tissues was isolated using the RNAeasy isolation kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was made using Invitrogen reverse transcriptase and reagents. For RT-PCR, the primers used were act2a (5′-CTT ACA ATT TCC CGC TCT GC-3′), act2s (5′-GTT GGG ATG AAC CAG AAG GA-3′), P1 (5′-GTC CGC AAT TTC TCC GTC ACT ATC ATA AC-3′), P2 (5′-GCT TGG GGC TAT GGG TGT TG), P3 (5′-GAA AGC AGC CAA CGG TGC TC-3′), P4 (5′-GCC GGT TTG AAA CTC GCA AT-3′), and P5 (5′-GGT TAA CAA ATG GTA TTT CCC CCA GTA CA-3′). ACX3 was amplified using ACX3-S (5′-TGG CTG AAG AAC ACC GAA GAT TAT-3′) and ACX3-A(5′-GAA ACA TCA GCA ACT GCA TTC AAC-3′). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Crosses with acx3—The acx4 mutant was crossed with the acx3 mutant (1Eastmond P.J. Hooks M.A. Williams D. Lange P. Bechtold N. Sarrobert C. Nussaume L. Graham I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34375-34381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). F1 and F2 progeny plants were germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 20 mm sucrose. PCR was used to genotype the progeny plants. For acx3, primers ACX3-S (5′-TGG CTG AAG AAC ACC GAA GAT TAT-3′) and ACX3-A (5′-GAA ACA TCA GCA ACT GCA TTC AAC-3′) were used to amplify the endogenous gene, and primer ACX3-S with the T-DNA border primer (5′-ATT TCA CGG GTT GGG GTT TCT AC-3′) to amplify across the T-DNA region. For acx4, primers P2 (5′-TGA TTA CAT AGT CAG TAC GCT AGC CGA AA-3′) and P4 (5′-GTT AAC AAA TGG TAT TTC CCC CAG TAC AA-3′) were used to amplify the endogenous gene, and primers P2 and JL202 (5′-CAT TTT ATA ATA ACG CTG CGG ACA TCT AC-3′) to amplify across the T-DNA region. The presence of the acx3 T-DNA in the progeny, determined using PCR, was confirmed using GUS staining of leaves, as described by Eastmond et al. (1Eastmond P.J. Hooks M.A. Williams D. Lange P. Bechtold N. Sarrobert C. Nussaume L. Graham I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34375-34381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Peroxisome Morphology—The acx3, acx4 and kat2 mutants were crossed into a line (A5) containing GFP fused to a truncated MFP2 cDNA that targets GFP to the peroxisomes (40Cutler S. Ehrhardt D.W. Griffitts J.S. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3718-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) (see supplementary information on the World Wide Web at deepgreen.stanford.edu). Lines homozygous for acx3, acx4, and kat2 were identified by PCR and by resistance to kanamycin. The acx3:GFP-MFP2, acx4:GFP-MFP2 and kat2:GFP-MFP2 lines were germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium plus 20 mm sucrose plates. Peroxisomes were visualized in 4-day-old seedlings using a Nikon Optiphot-2 confocal microscope with mercury lamp and epifluorescence filter set. GFP fluorescence was detected at 510–532 nm with excitation at 488 nm. Mutant Isolation and Genotypic Characterization—The acx4 mutant was isolated from the T-DNA-tagged population described by Sussman et al. (31Sussman M.R. Amasino R.M. Young J.C. Krysan P.J. Austin-Phillips S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1465-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) following procedures detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The acx4 mutant was backcrossed, and the F1 population shown to segregate 3:1 for kanamycin resistance. PCR-based analysis of the F2 progeny showed that kanamycin resistance segregated with T-DNA insertion in the ACX4 gene and that only those plants that were homozygous for T-DNA insertion in the ACX4 gene were affected in short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity. Sequencing of the left and right borders and flanking regions indicated that the T-DNA was situated in the last exon of the acx4 gene, 3315 bp 3′ from the ATG (Fig. 1a). PCR and sequencing analysis indicated that the T-DNA insert consisted of a truncated, 400-bp, left border fragment followed by an inverted, complete T-DNA. The 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the ACX4 protein, including the putative PTS1 Ser, Arg, and Leu, are predicted to be replaced with a 23-amino acid sequence, encoded by the T-DNA insert and ending in the amino acids Lys, Lys, Lys, and Glu (Fig. 1a). RT-PCR analysis using ACX4-specific primers, 5′ of the T-DNA insert, amplified the expected sized fragment from both wild type and acx4 seedling RNA. Primers that spanned the T-DNA insert failed to amplify a product for the acx4 cDNA (Fig. 1b). These results suggest that a truncated or modified transcript of ACX4 is produced in acx4. Activity of ACX4 —To investigate whether the production and integrity of the ACX4 protein was perturbed in acx4, a Western blot of protein extracts from 0–5-day-old wild type and acx4 seedlings was challenged with an antibody raised against Arabidopsis ACX4 (15Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of 47.7 kDa for ACX4 was detected in the wild type, but no bands were detected in acx4 seedling extracts (Fig. 2a). To investigate whether the acx4 mutant displayed altered acyl-CoA oxidase activity, enzyme activity was measured in 2-day-old germinating seedlings (Fig. 2b) and rosette leaves (Fig. 2c). In seedlings and leaves, the acx4 mutant exhibited less than 2% of wild type short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity (measured using hexanoyl-CoA, C6:0 substrate), whereas medium-chain activity was unaltered (measured using lauroyl-CoA, C12:0 substrate). Phenotypic Analysis—Arabidopsis mutants in the β-oxidation genes, ped1/kat2, acx3, and aim1 exhibit varying degrees of resistance to 2,4-DB, indicating that they have impaired β-oxidation activity (1Eastmond P.J.

Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify the level of resistance in acx4 seedlings, root length of seedlings germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (30Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-496Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) containing 1.5 μm 2,4-DB was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, a and b, homozygous acx4 seedlings were significantly more resistant to 2,4-DB than wild type seedlings, although acx4 seedlings were not as resistant as kat2 seedlings. Both acx4 and wild type seedlings were susceptible to the auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (results not shown), demonstrating that the resistance to 2,4-DB in the mutant is specific to the impaired β-oxidation activity in acx4. Heterozygous acx4 seedlings were sensitive to 2,4-DB, indicating that 2,4-DB resistance is a recessive phenotype. The kat2 mutant is impaired in the ability to catabolize storage lipid through β-oxidation, and both ped1 and kat2 mutants require an exogenou"
https://openalex.org/W2116058717,"A relaxed cap-dependence of translation of the mRNA-encoding mammalian heat shock protein Hsp70 may suggest that its 5′-untranslated region (UTR) possesses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In this study, this possibility has been tested in transfected cells using plasmids that express dicistronic mRNAs. Using a reporter gene construct, Renilla luciferase/Photinus pyralis luciferase, we show that the 216-nt long 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA acts as an IRES that directs ribosomes to the downstream start codon by a cap-independent mechanism. The relative activity of this IRES (100-fold over the empty vector) is similar to that of the classical picornaviral IRESs. Additional controls indicate that this high expression of the downstream reporter is not due to readthrough from the upstream cistron, nor is it due to translation of cryptic monocistronic transcripts. The effect of small deletions within the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA on the IRES activity varies in dependence on their position within the 5′-UTR sequence. With the exception of deletion of nt 33–50, it is small for the 5′-terminal half of the 5′-UTR and rather strong for the 3′-terminal section. However, neither of these small deletions abolishes the IRES activity completely. Excision of larger sections (>50 nt) by truncation of the 5′-UTR from the 5′-end or by internal deleting results in a dramatic impairment of the IRES function. Taken together, these data suggest that the IRES activity of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA requires integrity of almost the entire sequence of the 5′-UTR. The data are discussed in terms of a model that allows a three-dimensional rather than linear mode of selection of the initiation region surrounding the start codon of Hsp70 mRNA.

At least three mechanisms are thought to exist for eukaryotic translation initiation, namely 5′→ 3′ scanning, “shunting,” and internal ribosomal entry. In the scanning model (1Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the small ribosomal subunit binds to the 5′-end and is believed to subsequently travel in a 5′→ 3′ direction until it encounters an initiator AUG codon in a favorable context. The shunting mechanism (2Futterer J. Kiss-Laszlo Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) is also 5′-terminus-dependent but differs from scanning in that the 40 S subunit bypasses part of the 5′-UTR by “jumping” to a region at or near the authentic initiation codon. Translation initiation by internal ribosome entry involves the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; UTR, untranslated region; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; HRV (hrv), human rhinovirus; nt, nucleotides; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; Fluc, firefly luciferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. at or near the authentic AUG, thereby eliminating the requirement for scanning through the greater part of the 5′-UTR (for recent reviews see Refs. 4Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar and 5Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Whether these three modes of translational initiation are mechanistically quite different or else they are just versions of the same mechanism of eukaryotic translational initiation is not clear. IRESs were originally identified in the 5′-UTRs of picornaviral RNAs where these complex structural elements allow ribosomes to enter at a considerable distance from the 5′-end of the viral mRNA. Later, IRESs were also identified within the 5′-UTRs of cellular mRNAs. The list of cellular IRESs is constantly growing (5Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), giving an impression that every long and structured 5′-UTR of eukaryotic mRNAs may harbor an IRES or employ the shunting model, whereas a “purely” scanning mechanism may operate only for mRNAs with short and unstructured 5′-UTRs. The cellular IRESs, as a rule, are also complex and highly organized structures. Of those known to date, the only cellular IRES that structurally stands by itself is that from the mRNA-encoding human immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) (6Masejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The attempts to experimentally identify a specific structure within the relatively short 5′-UTR of BiP mRNA (210 nt) have been unsuccessful (7Yang Q. Sarnow P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2800-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Even more surprising is that the 5′-UTR of mammalian Hsp70 mRNA has been reported to be devoid of IRES properties (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vivinus S. Baulande S. van Zanten M. Campbell F. Topley P. Ellis J.H. Dessen P. Coste H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1908-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), despite the fact that its length, GC-content, and relaxed cap-dependence (10Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11882-11889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Joshi-Barve S. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are similar to the 5′-UTR of BiP mRNA, and the corresponding mRNAs encode proteins with related functions (chaperones). The high G+C content of the 5′-UTR of mammalian Hsp70 mRNA seems more compatible with operation via an IRES than by means of the classical scanning mechanism. The Drosophila homologue of the mammalian Hsp70 mRNA has been studied much more extensively. However, the results obtained for its 5′-UTR may be extended to the mammalian Hsp70 mRNA only with great caution. Indeed, the 5′-UTR of the former is strikingly enriched in adenylic residues (>50%), which should greatly facilitate the scanning process. Furthermore, a higher discrimination in translation between Hsp and normal mRNAs is observed in Drosophila as compared with mammalian cells (12Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 271-294Google Scholar). Nevertheless, like the Drosophila homolog, the mammalian Hsp70 mRNA demonstrates a reduced dependence on eIF4F, a principal initiation factor that recognizes the cap at the 5′-end of mRNA and initiates the search for the authentic initiation codon. Under heat shock conditions and soon after heat shock, the mammalian cap-binding initiation factor eIF4E is impaired (13Paniers R. Henshaw E.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Panniers R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, 4E-BPs, repressors of eIF4E, become activated under these conditions due to their hypophosphorylation (18Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5450-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Vries R.G. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32779-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, like mRNAs encoding other heat shock proteins, the translational activity of human Hsp70 mRNA is resistant to changes in activity of eIF4F. The relaxed cap-dependence of the 5′-UTR of human Hsp70 mRNA along with the current lack of evidence for an IRES within this 5′-UTR leaves open the possibility of translation initiation occurring via a shunting mechanism. This is usually revealed by a low sensitivity of translation initiation to insertion of a stable hairpin near the 3′-end of 5′-UTR. Indeed, insertion of a stable hairpin into the 3′-end of the 5′-UTR of human Hsp70 mRNA still allows the mRNA to direct translation of a reporter cistron. In addition, two short sequences complementary to a 3′-terminal hairpin of 18 S rRNA have been identified at positions 96–102 and 194–205 of this 5′-UTR. These sequences have been postulated to participate in a primary binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit followed by its shunting to the authentic AUG codon (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). However, insertion of the 3′-hairpin showed a large suppression (3-fold) of translation directed by the modified 5′-UTR, whereas, on the contrary, deletion of the sequences complementary to 18 S rRNA did not abolish completely the initiation activity of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is not immediately clear why a 5′-UTR that uses for ribosomal binding sequences complementary to 18 S rRNA is not capable of internal initiation. Given incompleteness of current data on the translation initiation of mammalian Hsp70 mRNA, we have reinvestigated the issue using plasmids that express dicistronic mRNAs, a conventional approach to test eukaryotic 5′-UTRs for the presence of an IRES. Here we show that the 5′-UTR of human Hsp70 mRNA represents an IRES with the relative activity similar to that of the classical picornaviral IRESs. However, unlike many other IRES-elements, the activity of the Hsp70 mRNA IRES requires the integrity of almost the entire sequence of the 5′-UTR. Plasmid Constructs—The initial dicistronic vector pGL3R containing reporter genes for Renilla luciferase (first cistron, Rluc) and Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase (second cistron, Fluc) was described (20Stonely M. Paulin F.E.M. Le Quesne J.P.C. Chappel S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This vector contains an intercistronic linker with the sites for endonucleases 5′-XbaI, SpeI, PvuII, and EcoRI-3′. To generate pGL3Rhsp70 that has the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA in the intercistronic position, a SalI (blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase)-NarI fragment comprising the complete 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA and 33 nt of the coding region of the Fluc gene, was inserted between the EcoRI (blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase) and NarI sites in the pGL3R. The SalI-NarI fragment was excised from the dicistronic plasmid pGFP-hsp70-Fluc, kindly provided by Y. Rubtsov (Moscow State University). To shorten the remaining linker separating Rluc and the Hsp70 5′-UTR in pGL3Rhsp70, the XbaI site was converted to a SpeI site using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTCAAAAATGAACAATAATACTAGTGCTTATCGATACCG-3′ with the Gene-Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The resulting plasmid was digested with SpeI and re-ligated. To obtain pGL3Rhsp70d33–50, a 315-bp fragment consisting of the last 280 nt of Rluc gene and the first 32 nt of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA was amplified by PCR from pGL3Rhsp70 using the following primers: sense 5′-GGCCTCGTGAAATCCCG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGTCGCAGCAGCTCCTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with SpeI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and inserted into pGL3Rhsp70d1–50 (see below), which was digested with SpeI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. To create plasmids pGL3Rhsp70d1–23, d49–68, d72–95, d96–117, d118–140, d152–176, and d177–206, 1.5 kb fragments consisting of the Rluc gene and a part of the 5′-UTRof Hsp70 mRNA were amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from pGL3Rhsp70 using the reverse primer (Promega) and the following antisense primers: d1–23, 5′-TCTAGTATTATTGTTCATTTTTG-3′; d49–68, 5′-CGAAAAAGGTAGTGG-3′; d72–95, 5′-CTTGGGACAACGGG-3′; d96–117, 5′-CCGCACAGGTTCG-3′; d118–140, 5′-CTCGACGCGCCGG-3′; d152–176, 5′-GCGAGAAGAGCTCG-3′; and d177–206, 5′-GGGCTGGAAACGGAAC-3′. These products were digested with AvrII (fragments 1). Then 1 kb fragments consisting of a part of the Fluc gene and a part of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA were amplified by PCR from pGL3Rhsp70 using the following primers: antisense 5′-GATCTCTGGCATGCGAGAATC-3′ and sense 5′-TCTGCGACA GTCCACTACC-3′, 5′-AAGGCTTCCCAGAG-3′, 5′-CTTGCAGGCACCGGC-3′, 5′-TTTCCGGCGTCCG-3′, 5′-GCTCTTCTCGCGG-3′, 5′-CCAATCTCAGAGCC-3′, and 5′-GGGAACCGGCATGGC-3′ for d1–23, d49–68, d72–95, d96–117, d118–140, d152–176, and d177–206, respectively. These products were digested with Bsp1407I (fragments 2). The corresponding fragments 1 and 2 were inserted between the AvrII and Bsp1407I sites in pGL3Rhsp70 in one step. The dicistronic inserts of the resulting constructs were sequenced. To generate plasmids pGL3Rhsp70d1–151 and pGL3Rhsp70d1–50, 63 and 170 bp fragments of the whole 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA were amplified by PCR from pGL3Rhsp70 using the following primers: sense 5′-GGACTAGTGGATCCAGTGTTCCG-3′ for d1–151 and 5′-GACTAGTGACTCCCGTTG-3′ for d1–50, respectively, and antisense 5′-GGTGGCCATGCCGGTTC-3′. These products were digested with SpeI and BalI and then inserted between the SpeI and BalI sites in pGL3Rhsp70. To create pGL3Rhsp70d1–96, pGL3Rhsp70 was digested with SpeI and PstI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligated. To construct pGL3Rhsp70d51–151, a 1.5-kb fragment covering the Rluc gene and first 50 nt of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA was amplified by PCR from pGL3Rhsp70 using the following primers: sense 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGATCCCTCGAAAAAGGTAGTAGTGGAC-3′. This product was digested with EcoRV and BamHI and inserted between the same sites in pGL3Rhsp70. To generate pGL3Rhsp70d97–151, pGL3Rhsp70 was cleaved with PstI and BamHI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligated. The construct containing the IRES element from human rhinovirus RNA in the intercistronic region of pGL3R as well as the construct with a low-energy stem preceding the Rluc cistron were a gift from A. Willis. The latter was used to obtain the construct with the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA in the intercistronic position (construct pGL3RH). To generate pGL3REMCVmut, a 400-bp fragment containing a truncated version of the EMCV IRES with a deletion of nt 701–763 was amplified by PCR from plasmid pTE10 (21Evstafieva A.G. Ugarova T.Y. Chernov B.K. Shatsky I.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides: sense 5′-GCCGTCTTTTGGCCAATGTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GTCAATAACTCCTCTGG-3′. The product was digested with EcoRI and BalI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and inserted into plasmid pGL3R treated with PvuII and BalI. The plasmid pGL3Rhsp70 lacking the SV40 promoter was prepared as suggested in Ref. 22Han B. Zhang J.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar. Cellular RNA Purification—Total cellular RNA from 5 × 106 transfected cells was prepared by the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNase Protection Assay—A 626-bp DNA fragment from pGL3Rhsp70 was PCR amplified using primers 5′-GGCCTCGTGAAATCCCG-3′ and 5′-GCAATTGTTCCAGGAACC-3′. This product was blunt-end ligated into SmaI site of pSK+ Bluescript (Stratagene). A [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobe was then generated using T7 RNA polymerase with an XhoI-restricted DNA template. The transcripts were treated with DNase I and purified on a 4% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. The RNA probe was hybridized with total cellular RNA: 2 μg of RNA was dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 80% deionized formamide) containing the probe (3 × 105 cpm) and incubated at 45 °C for 16h. Then 500 μlof10mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 300 mm NaCl containing 20 units of RNase ONE (Promega) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After addition of 50 μg proteinase K and 10 μl of 20% SDS, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation with rRNA as a carrier. The RNA samples were then dissolved, denatured, and fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. The gel was dried and products were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Product sizes were determined using 32P-labeled RNA size markers, which were produced by T7 transcription from a plasmid based on the vector pUC18 containing the HSP70 gene under control of the T7 promoter. Prior to T7 transcription, this construct was linearized with BalI, NcoI, or PvuII. DNA Transfections and Reporter Gene Analysis—Approximately 2 × 105 293 or TE671 cells were grown on a 12-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (23Ausubel R.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Willey-Interscience, New York1987: 9.11-9.17Google Scholar), with 5 μg of pGL3R derivatives and 5 μg of β-galactosidase construct pCMV lacZ (Promega) as a transfection control. Cells were harvested after 48 h, luciferase expression was determined using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase expression was estimated with the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured for 60 s following a 10 s delay on a Luminoscan TL (Labsystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Variations in transfection efficiency were corrected by normalizing luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate on three to five independent occasions. Expression of a Downstream Reporter Gene Directed by the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA in a Dicistronic Vector—To investigate whether the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA could contain an internal ribosome entry segment, a dicistronic reporter assay was used. The whole 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA was inserted between the two cistrons of the dicistronic vector pGL3R (20Stonely M. Paulin F.E.M. Le Quesne J.P.C. Chappel S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The vector incorporates both the sea pansy (Renilla reinformis) and firefly (P. pyralis) luciferases as the first and second cistrons, respectively. As controls for the basal expression of the second cistron, the highly structured EMCV IRES with a deleted eIF4G-binding site (21Evstafieva A.G. Ugarova T.Y. Chernov B.K. Shatsky I.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18599-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was used along with the initial vector pGL3R. As a positive reference for the IRES activity, a construction with the human rhinovirus IRES element in the intercistronic position of the vector was employed. The activity of both luciferases was determined in transiently transfected human cells 48 h after transfection, and the activity of firefly luciferase (second cistron) was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase (first cistron) to generate values for the downstream cistron expression that were independent of transfection efficiency. As seen in Fig. 2A, the translation efficiency of the downstream cistron in 293 cells is increased 100-fold over background after insertion of the 5′-UTR of human Hsp70 mRNA into the intercistronic position, and exceeds 3–4-fold the activity of the well documented rhinovirus IRES. As expected, the lowest IRES activity was found for the mutated EMCV IRES. The IRES properties of the Hsp70 5′-UTR are not affected by the origin of cultured cells. This is evident from comparison of the activities in 293 cells (kidney) (Fig. 2A) with that of human TE671 cells (muscles) (Fig. 2B). Although the overall IRES activity of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA is somewhat lower in TE671 cells than in 293 cells, the relative activities of the Hsp70 IRES to the HRV IRES remained roughly the same. IRES Properties of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA Are Not due to Either Ribosomal Readthrough or the Presence of Cryptic Promoters or Splice Sites in the Dicistronic RNA—To ensure that the apparent internal ribosome entry was not observed due to either enhanced ribosomal readthrough or the presence of cryptic promoters or splice sites in the dicistronic RNA, three control assays were performed. In the first assay, vector pGL3RH (20Stonely M. Paulin F.E.M. Le Quesne J.P.C. Chappel S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) was used. This vector is analogous to dicistronic vectors pGL3R but contains a stem-loop structure with a free energy equivalent to –55 kcal mol–1 inserted approximately in the middle of the 5′-UTR of Renilla cistron. The effect of this insertion on translational efficiency was determined separately for the first and second cistrons (Fig. 2C). The Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase synthesized from a co-transfected plasmid and expressed relative to those obtained from a similar construction but without the hairpin structure. It is evident that the hairpin decreases the translation efficiency of the first reporter gene, whereas translation of the second cistron remains unchanged. In the second control experiment, to ensure that only intact dicistronic RNA was being transcribed from the dicistronic vector, RNase protection assay was carried out. A 32P uniformly labeled antisense riboprobe (Fig. 3A) comprising the 3′-end of Renilla luciferase cistron (288 nt), the whole intercistronic region (216 nt), and the beginning of firefly luciferase reporter (122 nt) was annealed to mRNA isolated from cells that had been either mock transfected (Fig. 3B, lane 4) or transfected with the vector with the whole Hsp70 5′-UTR in the intercistronic position (Fig. 3B, lane 3) followed by RNase treatment. The data presented in Fig. 3B, lane 3, clearly show that the protected fragment corresponds to the expected size, 626 nt. In the third control test, to ensure that there is no cryptic promoter either within the first reporter gene or within the intercistronic region, the SV40 promoter of plasmid pGL3Rhsp70 was destroyed as described in Ref. 22Han B. Zhang J.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, and 293 cells were transfected with the resulting plasmid. No activity of Renilla or firefly luciferases was detected in such cells (data not shown). Taken together these results represent compelling evidence that the 5′-UTR of human Hsp70 mRNA does contain an IRES with a strong translation initiation activity. Mapping the Hsp70 IRES—To determine the position of the IRES within the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA, a series of dicistronic constructions was generated containing deletions of different size in the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA placed between the two cistrons (Fig. 4). The plasmids were transfected into 293 cells and the relative firefly luciferase activity was determined for each of these mutants. As seen from Fig. 5A, the IRES activity of the mutant constructs with relatively small deletions varies in dependence on their position within the 5′-UTR sequence. With the exception of deletion of nt 33–50 (construct hsp70d33–50), the effect is small for the 5′-terminal half of the 5′-UTR (deletion of the first 23 nucleotides did not affect the IRES activity) and much stronger for the 3′-terminal section. The most dramatic effect was found for construct d152–176. However, neither of these deleterious deletions abrogated completely the IRES activity of Hsp70 mRNA. This contrasts with the effect of small deletions or even point mutations on viral IRESs, at least those characterized to data (21Evstafieva A.G. Ugarova T.Y. Chernov B.K. Shatsky I.N.

Some of such mutations completely abolish their translation initiation activity (see, for example, the data for one of the EMCV IRES mutants in Fig. 2A).Fig. 5Effect of various deletions within the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA on its IRES activity. The relative Fluc/Rluc activities were determined as before and expressed as a ratio of the activity for the intact Hsp70 IRES which was set at 100%. A represents the effect of smaller deletions, whereas B demonstrates the influence of larger adeletions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) IRES Activity of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA Requires Integrity of Almost the Entire Sequence of the 5′-UTR—The data presented in the previous section may produce the impression that the IRES of Hsp70 mRNA is located mostly in the 3′-terminal half of the 5′-UTR and the 5′-terminal half is less essential. If this is the case, removal of the 5′-terminal part of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA should not abrogate the IRES activity. The results presented in Fig. 5B show that this is not the case. Deletion of just the first 50 nt from the 5′-UTR resulting in the intercistronic region, which constitutes 76% of the entire length of the 5′-UTR, leads to a dramatic reduction of the IRES activity. Even larger truncation of the 5′-UTR from the 5′-end further decreased the IRES efficiency (constructs hsp70d1–96) and in construct hsp70d1–151, which is lacking some important elements from the 3′-terminal half (see Fig. 4), it approached a background value (Fig. 5B). As expected, internal deletions larger than those used in the experiments shown in Fig. 5A almost abrogated the IRES activity. One may conclude that though the 3′-terminal half of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA is more susceptible to mutations, almost the entire sequence of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA is needed for the IRES activity. The data point to a specific configuration acquired by the 5′-leader of Hsp70 mRNA where many, if not all, parts of its sequence contribute (albeit to a different extent) to a maximal activity in the cap-independent mode of translation initiation. This study focused on the molecular mechanism that allows Hsp70 mRNA to be translated without the cap even under normal conditions. Thus, the use of dicistronic mRNAs in this report, with the 5′-leader of Hsp70 mRNA in the intercistronic position, completely ensured cap-independence of translation of the reporter sequence directed by the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA under normal physiological conditions. An intriguing feature of the 5′-leader of Hsp70 mRNA that distinguishes it from Hsp70 mRNA from Drosophila is its elevated G/C content. This feature makes it poorly compatible with the requirements of the classical scanning model for efficient mRNAs and suggests employment of an alternative way of translation initiation. Here we present compelling evidence that the 5′-leader of Hsp70 mRNA possesses a strong IRES element comparable with that of translationally efficient picornaviral RNAs. However, unlike many other viral and cellular IRES-containing mRNAs studied to date where IRESs occupy an internal position within their long 5′-UTRs, the IRES of Hsp70 mRNA appears to be represented by almost the entire leader of this mRNA. No large section of the 5′-UTR can be excised without a dramatic deleterious effect on the expression of the second cistron. This conclusion nicely correlates with data of Vivinus et al. (9Vivinus S. Baulande S. van Zanten M. Campbell F. Topley P. Ellis J.H. Dessen P. Coste H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1908-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), who have recently shown the importance of the integrity of Hsp70 5′-UTR for its enhancing effect on translation of reporter genes in monocistronic constructions. It should be noted that any data obtained by deletion experiments should be interpreted with great caution, in particular when the secondary structure of the corresponding RNA region is unknown and the resulting mutant RNA derivatives are not probed. Excision of a sequence may entail a substantial reorganization of the secondary structure of the corresponding RNA segment, and the resulting structure may have very little in common with the initial one, a fact that is neglected in many reports on identification and characterization of IRES-elements. This shortcoming is also inherent to the experimental design employed in this study. For instance, deletion of sequences 96–117 or 177–206 produces a remarkable negative effect on the IRES activity of Hsp70 mRNA. These deletions comprise nt 96–102 and 194–205, respectively, that have been recently postulated to be involved in complementary interactions with 18 S rRNA (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, our data only indicate that these sequences are important parts of a larger sequence forming the IRES element of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA. The deleterious effect of their removal may be accounted for by both impairment of the interaction of the 40 S ribosomal subunit with this 5′-UTR and changing a specific secondary structure located in its 3′-half. Certainly, much finer structural analysis is needed to choose between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, even taking into account these considerations, one may draw some conclusions as to how the IRES of Hsp70 mRNA is organized. The viral IRESs characterized to data all form autonomous and highly ordered structural domains (4Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). These domains include highly specific binding sites for canonical initiation factors, auxiliary mRNA-binding proteins, or the 40 S ribosomal subunit (4Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). That is why short deletions or even point mutations in many parts of these IRESs are able to completely destroy them (21Evstafieva A.G. Ugarova T.Y. Chernov B.K. Shatsky I.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7301-7307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pestova T.V.

This does not appear to be the case for the IRES of Hsp70 mRNA. With the exception of mutant d152–176, deletions within this IRES produce at most strong rather than dramatic effects. This suggests that it forms a relatively loose configuration, presumably with some redundancy of binding sites for mRNA recruiting translational components. Assuming that the mode of cap-independent accommodation of the scanning machinery is similar for the 5′-terminal (monocistronic) and intercistronic positions of the Hsp70 mRNA 5′-UTR, we suggest a model for the cap-independent recruitment of the Hsp70 mRNA onto the 40 S ribosome (Fig. 6). In this model, the mRNA recruitment machinery binds to the sites of the Hsp70 5′-leader, which includes both its 5′-proximal and 3′-terminal segments as essential elements. The binding occurs in a way that a three-dimensional configuration of the 5′-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA ensures a close proximity of the sequence surrounding the start codon to the scanning apparatus. If so, any large deletion of the internal or terminal segments of the IRES would destroy either binding of the mRNA recruiting factors or the functional configuration of the IRES. There is a well documented example of the three-dimensional recognition by eIF4A (as a part of eIF4F) of the sequence surrounding the initiation codon. This is the case for the EMCV IRES. Here the mRNA recruitment factors appear to have their fixed binding sites on the IRES (24Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18599-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Meyer K. Petersen A. Niepmann M. Beck E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and do not appear to move anywhere. The IRES seems to acquire a specific three-dimensional configuration that allows selection of the initiation triplet only within a narrow “starting window” (34Kaminski A. Belsham G.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Pilipenko E.V. Gmyl A.P. Maslova S.V. Belov G.A. Sinyakov A.N. Mei Huang T. Brown D.K. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the cap-dependent translation initiation does not exclude three-dimensional recognition of the initiation region, either. In that case, a presumably more flexible connection of eIF4F with an mRNA (through the cap) will only facilitate such a three-dimensional recognition. This model substantially differs from the shunting mechanism of translation initiation of mammalian Hsp70 mRNA that has been recently proposed (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). It necessitates neither prior binding of the mRNA recruitment machinery at the cap nor a subsequent scanning of the 5′-proximal sequence of the 5′-leader of an mRNA followed by a mysterious jumping to the initiation codon. The model also explains why it is not amenable to testing by the conventional approach elaborated for identification of shunting mechanisms. This approach is known to be based on insertion of a low-energy hairpin structure between the 5′-end of an mRNA and its initiation codon. A small effect of such modifications on translational activity is regarded as evidence in favor of the ribosomal shunting. However, it is difficult to predict how such insertions would affect an overall configuration of the 5′-UTR and, hence, relative positions of the scanning machinery and the initiation codon. These considerations may help to explain why insertion of a stable hairpin in the distal position of the 5′-UTR of HSP70 mRNA results in a considerable loss (30% versus wt mRNA) of the translational activity (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). The classical scanning model (1Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) is strictly linear. It should be stressed, however, that it was directly tested only for 5′-UTRs whose length did not exceed 100 nt. None of the existing reports excludes a three-dimensional way of selection of the target sequence near the initiation codon by initiation factors positioned on the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Thus, we speculate that the model described above is applicable not only to the case of the Hsp70 IRES but may have a more general application. Certainly, a proximity of the scanning machinery apparatus to the initiation codon may not be the only principal parameter determining the rate and efficiency of translation initiation. A base-pairing and a nucleotide context of the sequence surrounding the initiation codon should greatly affect kinetics of the process. For standard capped mRNAs routinely used in laboratories, with their unstructured and relatively short 5′-UTRs, all three requirements (proximity, a low base-pairing, and a nucleotide context) are optimal, giving a strong preference for the cap-proximal initiation triplet. We are aware that the model of translation initiation discussed in this paper is speculative. However, we hope that it may prove to be useful in understanding 1) why the overwhelming majority of the IRESs has been identified in long, GC-rich, and highly structured 5′-leaders of mammalian mRNAs, and 2) what the role of cellular IRESs is and how they may be regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2072343646,"PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein-1 (also referred to as MNAR, or modulator of nongenomic activity of estrogen receptor)), a recently identified novel coactivator of estrogen receptors, is widely expressed in a variety of 17 β-estradiol (E2)-responsive reproductive tissues and is developmentally regulated in mammary glands. pRb (retinoblastoma protein), a cell cycle switch protein, plays a fundamental role in the proliferation, development, and differentiation of eukaryotic cells. To study the putative function of PELP1, we established stable MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines overexpressing PELP1. PELP1 overexpression hypersensitized breast cancer cells to E2 signaling, enhanced progression of breast cancer cells to S phase, and led to persistent hyperphosphorylation of pRb in an E2-dependent manner. Using phosphorylation site-specific pRb antibodies, we identified Ser-807/Ser-811 of pRb as a potential target site of PELP1. Interestingly, PELP1 was discovered to be physiologically associated with pRb and interacted via its C-terminal pocket domain, and PELP1/pRb interaction could be modulated by antiestrogen agents. Using mutant pRb cells, we demonstrated an essential role for PELP1/pRb interactions in the maximal coactivation functions of PELP1 using cyclin D1 as one of the targets. Taken together, these findings suggest that PELP1, a steroid coactivator, plays a permissive role in E2-mediated cell cycle progression, presumably via its regulatory interaction with the pRb pathway.

The steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) 1The abbreviations used are: E2, 17β-estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PELP, proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucinerich protein; MNAR, modulator of non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor. plays an important role in controlling the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological processes, including development, homeostasis, and breast cancer progression (1McDonnell D.P. Norris J.D. Science. 2002; 296: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The biological effects of estrogen are mediated by its binding to the structurally and functionally distinct estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ. ERα is the major ER in mammary epithelium (3Warner M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 11: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Upon binding of E2 to ERα, the ligand-activated ERα translocates to the nucleus, binds to the 13-bp palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in the target genes, and stimulates gene transcription, thus promoting cell proliferation (4Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In addition to the genomic actions of ER, non-genomic functions are implicated via activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (5Levin E.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Luconi M. Forti G. Baldi E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Sci. 2002; 27: 172-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ERα comprises an N-terminal AF1 (activation function-1) domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding region that contains an AF2 domain (9Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The AF2 ligand-dependent activation function of ERα is located in the ligand-binding domain, whereas AF1 functions in a ligand-independent manner. AF1 and AF2 exhibit cell-type and promoter context specificity (10Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Also, the transcription functions of ERs have been shown to be influenced by several coactivators, including SRC1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1), GRIP1, AIB1, CBP (cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein), p300, PGC1, E6AP, PCAF (p300/CBP associating factor), and SNF2 (11Hermanson O.

It is generally accepted that some of the diverse functions of estrogens depend on differential recruitment of coregulators to the E2·ER complex. Despite the identification of a number of ER coregulators, the molecular mechanism by which E2 elicits distinct responses in different tissues is not known. Tissue-specific expression of coregulators and availability of novel integrators of signaling are speculated to play a role in the complex signaling elicited by the E2/ER pathway. E2 regulates cell proliferation in a wide variety of tissues, including mammary glands (14Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Ahamed S. Wimalasena J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 320-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that estrogen induces mitogenesis by recruiting non-cycling cells into the cell cycle and increasing the rate of progression from G1 to S phase. Induction of the early-response genes (such as c-myc and c-fos) was proposed as one mechanism of this process (15Prall O.W. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Lamb J. Ladha M.H. McMahon C. Sutherland R.L. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas regulation of CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase-2) and CDK4 activities was proposed as another (18Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Bukovsky A. Seth P. Wimalasena J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Prall O.W. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin D1 was identified as a target of E2 action, and estrogen treatment was shown to up-regulate cyclin D1 levels (21Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2315-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Even though E2-mediated cell cycle progression has been well acknowledged, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of G1/S phase transition remain elusive, as does the regulatory role, if any, ER coregulators play in this process. pRb (retinoblastoma protein), a cell cycle switch protein, plays a fundamental role in the proliferation, development, and differentiation of eukaryotic cells (22Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that pRb can act as a positive or negative regulator of transcription, depending on the cellular context (23Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 24Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Additionally, pRb is a nuclear protein that arrests cells in the G1 phase by repressing the genes required for G1/S phase progression (25Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Members of the E2F family of transcription factors are the major targets of pRb (26Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Progression of cells from G1 to S phase requires inactivation of pRb via phosphorylation; the phosphorylation status is primarily governed by cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 enzymes (23Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). pRb has also been shown to play a role in cell differentiation and development. Furthermore, expression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of pRb in a mammary gland leads to ductal growth suppression, precocious differentiation, and adenocarcinoma (27Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A number of cellular proteins interact with pRb, including cyclin D1, HDAC1, and Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1), and oncogenes such as EIA, SV40 antigen, and human papilloma virus E7 (22Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These proteins use a conserved LXCXE motif in their binding domain for this interaction (23Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 26Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Even though both ERs and pRb have been shown to play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, very little is known about the mechanisms by which ER uses pRb and the role ER coactivators may play in the regulation of pRb functions by E2. Recently, we cloned a novel ER regulatory protein named PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein-1), which is abundantly expressed in mammary glands; and its expression is developmentally regulated (28Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). PELP1 is predominantly nuclear in localization, contains 10 nuclear receptor interaction motifs (LXXLL), and functions as an ER coactivator in a ligand-dependent manner. In addition, PELP1 contains a number of potential protein interaction motifs, including proline-rich regions and zinc finger domains and an unusually rich glutamic acid domain in its C-terminal region. However, earlier analysis of the Expressed Sequence Tags Database suggested the possibility of a splice variant of PELP1 missing 435 bp in the N-terminal region (accession numbers gi 19894545, gi 19898760, gi 22814677, and gi 13139213); hence, the name PELP1 was given. A new study using a proteomics approach identified an ER-β-interacting protein that was named MNAR (modulator of non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor) (29Wong C.W. McNally C. Nickbarg E. Komm B.S. Cheskis B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, comparison of MNAR cDNA sequence with human genome sequence shows that both PELP1 and MNAR cDNAs are localized to the same region in chromosome 17p13.3 and share >99% DNA sequence homology. The present study was designed to clarify whether PELP1 and MNAR encode the same protein and to further understand the functions of PELP1 using model breast cancer cells overexpressing PELP1. Herein, we present evidence that is consistent with the NCBI gene prediction method (accession number XM_053717) showing that PELP1 and MNAR are the same proteins. Deregulation of PELP1 hypersensitized breast cancer cells to E2 signaling, leading to persistent hyperphosphorylation of pRb and enhanced progression of breast cancer cells to S phase. Our findings also suggest that PELP1 interacts with pRb via its C-terminal pocket domain and that regulatory interactions between PELP1 and pRb are required for PELP1-mediated maximal ER coactivation functions such as cyclin D1 induction by E2. In presenting these findings, we are the first to provide a mechanism by which PELP1 contributes to E2-mediated G1/S phase progression, in addition to its suspected role in ER transcriptional regulation. Cell Cultures and Reagents—MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (28Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SAOS2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in McCoy's medium 5A. Dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (DCC serum) and antibodies against vinculin and E2 were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against ERα were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-T7 epitope antibody was purchased from Novagen (Milwaukee, WI). Phosphorylation site-specific pRb antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). The anti-pRb antibody was purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). The anti-cyclin D1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Stable Cells, Synchronization, and Estrogen Treatment—MCF-7 cells stably expressing PELP1 were generated by transfecting full-length PELP1 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Stable clones were selected using G418 (1 mg/ml) selection. Approximately 200 clones were isolated. Twenty clones were screened for selection of individual clones, and the rest were pooled and used as pooled clones. Stable cell lines expressing full-length PELP1 were synchronized in G0 phase via serum starvation for 48 h in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.15% serum, and growth was stimulated by supplementation of 5% DCC serum and estrogen. The growth rate of the cells was measured by counting them with a Beckman Coulter Counter. Cell cycle progression was analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences), and CDK2 kinase activity was determined using histone H1 as a substrate following the protocol described previously (19Prall O.W. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cell Extracts, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—To prepare cell extracts, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm sodium vanadate) for 15 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates containing an equal amount of protein (∼200 μg) were then resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8% acrylamide), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the appropriate antibodies, and developed using either the enhanced chemiluminescence or alkaline phosphatase-based color reaction method. Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). Immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 h at 4 °C using 1 μg of antibody/mg of protein. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on a formaldehyde gel and hybridized in formamide buffer at 42 °C. Northern blots were probed with a 32P-labeled 900-bp PELP1 N-terminal cDNA fragment. A poly(A) blot containing various human tissues was purchased from Clontech. A mouse conceptus fullstage blot was purchased from Seegene (Seoul, Korea) and probed with a 300-bp mouse pelp1 N-terminal fragment. Actin levels were used to assess the integrity of the RNA and as a control for RNA loading. RT-PCR was performed with 1 μg of total RNA, and the RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for RT-PCR were 5′-gctgtcctcagaagatggtgatgcc-3′ (forward) and 5′-aggatcccaaagcgcaagagccggct-3′ (reverse). Full-length MNAR cDNA in the pcDNA vector was isolated by screening a mammary gland cDNA library (Invitrogen) using 32P-labeled 900-bp PELP1 cDNA as a probe. GST Pull-down Assay—Plasmids encoding GST-pRb fusion proteins were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Mark Ewen (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Deletion constructs of PELP1 were generated by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pcDNA3.1 vector. In vitro translation of pcDNA3.1-PELP1 (amino acids 1–330) was performed using a TnT kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (28Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Eluates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and developed using a PhosphorImager. Reporter Gene Assays—For reporter gene transient transfections, MCF-7 or SAOS2 cells were cultured for 24 h in minimal essential medium without phenol red-containing 5% DCC serum. ERE-luciferase or cyclin D1-luciferase reporter constructs were cotransfected with or without PELP1 and the pRb expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with E2 for 24 h. Cells were then lysed with passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The total amount of DNA used in the transfections was kept constant by adding a parental vector. Each transfection was carried out in six-well plates in triplicate wells. PELP1 and MNAR Are Identical Proteins—Localization of PELP1 and MNAR cDNAs to the same region of chromosome 17p13.3 raised the possibility that the PELP1 and MNAR proteins are generated from the same gene. Even though MNAR cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF547983) shows 99% similarity to PELP1 cDNA (accession number U88153.2), there are two differences between them: 1) an extra 435-bp region in PELP1, which is absent in MNAR (Fig. 1A), and 2) at the protein level in few amino acids localized to small pockets. PELP1 has many GC-rich regions and repetitive amino acids (stretches of proline and glutamic acids), which may give rise to errors during sequencing and lead to localized loss or gain of a base in the region of 10–15 bp and thus artificially create errors in the protein reading frame of a few amino acids. To test this hypothesis, we resequenced the PELP1 plasmid, designing multiple primers closer to the region where the differences were observed. The results show sequencing errors at six places, and correcting them makes MNAR 100% identical to PELP1 except for the presence of an extra 435 bp in PELP1 (the corrected sequence and its comparison with MNAR are shown as a supplemental figure). Because PELP1 and MNAR are identical except for an extra 435 bp in PELP1, this suggests that PELP1 and MNAR are isoforms of the same gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed a Northern blot analysis of various human tissues using the 900-bp N-terminal region present in both PELP1 and MNAR cDNAs as a probe. The results show the presence of a single transcript of ∼3.5 kb (Fig. 1B). We then investigated the possibility that PELP1 and MNAR are expressed differentially during development using total RNA from murine embryos in different stages. The results show the expression of a single transcript of ∼3.5 kb that was differentially regulated in various stages (Fig. 1C). Further examination of the extra 435-bp region of PELP1 showed that it contains consensus intron splice sites at both ends (GTAAGTG... TTCTCCAG (Fig. 1A). Because we failed to detect two mRNA species, this raises the possibility that the PELP1 cDNA we initially isolated was an immature transcript. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that cellular poly(A)+ RNA usually contains a considerable amount of heteronuclear RNA, including premature forms of cytoplasmic RNA (30Hirosawa M. Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Ohara O. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Hillier L.D. Lennon G. Becker M. Bonaldo M.F. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N. DuBuque T. Favello A. Gish W. Hawkins M. Hultman M. Kucaba T. Lacy M. Le M. Le N. Mardis E. Moore B. Morris M. Parsons J. Prange C. Rifkin L. Rohlfing T. Schellenberg K. Marra M.

If the initial PELP1 clone is an immature transcript containing an unspliced intron, then following transfection into cells, it should be spliced out and generate a mature mRNA of the same size as the endogenous transcript. We examined this possibility first by RT-PCR using primers 890–916 (forward) and 1625–1599 (reverse), which are outside the extra 435-bp region (nucleotides 1068–1503) present in PELP1. If PELP1 RNA synthesized from the pcDNA vector is spliced properly, then RTPCR will generate a 300-bp fragment; and if unspliced, it will generate a 735-bp fragment. In all four cell lines we examined, we observed only 300-bp fragments, suggesting that endogenous PELP1 mRNA does not have the extra 435-bp region observed in PELP1 cDNA (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–4). As suspected, stable expression of T7-tagged PELP1 cDNA in breast cancer cells showed a prevalent band of 300 bp, rather than the expected 735 bp (Fig. 1D, lane 5). Both PELP1 and MNAR cDNAs activated ER-mediated transcriptional activation of the ERE-luciferase reporter in a similar fashion (Fig. 1E). We then examined whether any expressed sequence tag cDNA clones present in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank contain this 435-bp region and found that all 12 expressed sequence tag clones matching the N-terminal region lack it. Collectively, these observations suggest that PELP1 and MNAR encode an identical protein, and the PELP1 cDNA we initially isolated contains a 435-bp intron that is efficiently spliced out in epithelial cells to generate mature PELP1 mRNA. PELP1 Expression Causes Hypersensitivity to E2Signaling—To understand the mechanism by which PELP1 may contribute to E2-mediated signaling, we established MCF-7/PELP1 stable clones as model cells. We characterized two individual clones (PELP1 clones 13 and 20) and one PELP1 pooled clone in this study. As a control, two pcDNA vectors expressing pcDNA clone 1 and the pcDNA pooled clone were used. Northern analysis showed that mRNA expressed from PELP1 cDNA migrated to the same distance as endogenous PELP1 (Fig. 2A). Expressed T7-PELP1 protein showed a similar size as endogenous PELP1 in Western analysis and migrated as a 160-kDa protein (Fig. 2B). Stable clones showed 3–4-fold overexpression of T7-PELP1 compared with endogenous PELP1. To determine whether overexpression of PELP1 hypersensitizes breast cancer cells to E2 action, MCF-7 cells expressing pcDNA clone 1, the pcDNA pooled clone, PELP1 clones 13 and 20, and the PELP1 pooled clone were treated with 10–9m E2 for 8 h, and the expression status of the E2-responsive gene pS2 was analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C, PELP1 overexpression resulted in a significant 7–8-fold induction of pS2 mRNA expression compared with a 4-fold induction in the pcDNA clones. As expected, PELP1-overexpressing cells were hypersensitive to estrogen as evaluated in ERE-luciferase reporter transactivation assays (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that deregulated expression of PELP1 contributes to increased hormonal sensitivity of breast cancer cells. PELP1 Expression Accelerates E2-mediated Cell Cycle Progression—E2 regulates cell proliferation in a wide variety of tissues (17Prall O.W. Rogan E.M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because PELP1 is a coactivator of ER (28Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and PELP1-expressing cells are hypersensitive to E2, we next examined PELP1 overexpression to investigate whether it accelerates the growth of breast cancer cells in response to E2 stimulation. pcDNA- and PELP1-expressing stable clones were cultured in medium containing 5% DCC serum for 48 h and treated with or without E2 (10–9m) for 72 h, and the cell numbers were determined using a Coulter Counter. PELP1-expressing cells showed a 35–50% increase in cell number compared with pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). To further validate the effect of PELP1 on cell cycle progression, we next synchronized cells in G0/G1 phase by growing them in 0% DCC serum for 48 h and treating them with or without E2 for 20 h; the status of the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). The results show a clear effect of PELP1 on the accelerated G1/S phase progression of the cells compared with the control pcDNA clones (Fig. 3C). To confirm these findings, we next sought to determine whether the enhanced G1/S phase transition was also accompanied by associated biochemical alterations. The pcDNA and PELP1 clone-expressing cells were treated with or without E2 for 20 h, and the CDK2 kinase activity was determined in an in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as a substrate (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the cell cycle analysis, PELP1 clones had a 3–4-fold increase in CDK2 kinase activity. These results suggest that PELP1 overexpression sensitizes cells to E2-mediated G1/S phase progression. PELP1 Expression Leads to Persistent Hyperphosphorylation of pRb—To examine the mechanism by which PELP1 overexpression sensitizes breast cancer cells to G1/S phase transition, we analyzed the status of several cell cycle regulatory proteins. PELP1- and pcDNA-expressing MCF-7 cells growing in 5% DCC serum were stimulated with E2 for different lengths of time. PELP1 overexpression had no effect on the status of p21 and p27 (data not shown). Of all the cell cycle proteins analyzed, we observed the most profound change in the status of phosphorylated pRb in PELP1-overexpressing clones; hence, we limited this study to further characterize the noticed PELP1 regulation of pRb. As shown in Fig. 4A, PELP1-expressing breast cancer cells showed higher levels of hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb. This hyperphosphorylation persisted for up to 20 h after E2 treatment. Analysis of the kinetics of phosphorylation showed the maximal increase in phosphorylation at 6–8 h of treatment (Fig. 4B). To examine the identity of the responsive phosphorylation sites on pRb, pcDNA and PELP1 clones were treated with or without E2 for 6 or 8 h, and the phosphorylation status of pRb was analyzed using phosphorylation site-specific-pRb antibodies that recognize Ser-807/Ser-811, Ser-780, or Ser-795. We observed substantial changes in the magnitude of pRb phosphorylation selectively at Ser-807/Ser-811, but not at Ser-780 or Ser-795 (Fig. 4C). To confirm the specificity of the pRb Ser-807/Ser-811 phosphorylation in PELP1 clones via ER, we pretreated cells with or without the pure antiestrogen ICI 182780 and, 30 min later, stimulated them with E2 for 8 h. The phosphorylation of pRb at Ser-807/Ser-811 was analyzed with the phospho-Ser-807/Ser-811-specific antibody (Fig. 4D). Increased phosphorylation of pRb in the PELP1 clone was blocked by ICI 182780, suggesting that the observed activation of Ser-807/Ser-811 in pRb is dependent on the E2/ER-initiated signaling in PELP1-over expressing cells. PELP1 Interacts with pRb in Vitro and in Vivo—pRb hyperphosphorylation in PELP1-expressing cells raised the possibility that PELP1 plays an important role in E2-mediated regulation of the pRb pathway. To test this possibility, we set out to explore whether PELP1 intera"
https://openalex.org/W2028716923,"The DNA ligase IXRCC4 complex (LX) functions in DNA non-homologous-end joining, the main pathway for double-strand break repair in mammalian cells. We show that, in contrast to ligation by T4 ligase, the efficiency of LX ligation of double-stranded (ds) ends is critically dependent upon the length of the DNA substrate. The effect is specific for ds ligation, and LX/DNA binding is not influenced by the substrate length. Ku stimulates LX ligation at concentrations resulting in 1?2 Ku molecules bound per substrate, whereas multiply Ku-bound DNA molecules inhibit ds ligation. The combined footprint of DNA with Ku and LX bound is the sum of each individual footprint suggesting that the two complexes are located in tandem at the DNA end. Inhibition of Ku translocation by the presence of cis-platinum adducts on the DNA substrate severely inhibits ligation by LX. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis using fluorophore-labeled Ku and DNA molecules showed that, as expected, Ku makes close contact with the DNA end and that addition of LX can disrupt this close contact. Finally, we show that recruitment of LX by Ku is impaired in an adenylation-defective mutant providing further evidence that LX interacts directly with the DNA end, possibly via the 5'-phosphate as shown for prokaryotic ligases. Taken together, our results suggest that, when LX binds to a Ku-bound DNA molecule, it causes inward translocation of Ku and that freedom to move inward on the DNA is essential to Ku stimulation of LX activity."

A subpopulation of fibrin molecules (γA/γ′-fibrin) has an alternate COOH terminus of the normal γ-chain (γA/γA-fibrin) that binds thrombin with high affinity. To determine the roles of exosites 1 and 2 in the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin, binding studies were done with thrombin variants and exosite 1- or 2-directed ligands. α-Thrombin bound γA/γ′-fibrin via high and low affinity binding sites. A peptide analog of the COOH terminus of the γ′-chain that binds α-thrombin via exosite 2 blocked the high affinity binding of α-thrombin to γA/γ′-fibrin, suggesting that the interaction of α-thrombin with the γ′-chain is exosite 2-mediated. In support of this concept, (a) γ-thrombin, which lacks a functional exosite 1, bound to γA/γ′-fibrin, but not to γA/γA-fibrin; (b) thrombin R93A/R97A/R101A, an exosite 2-defective variant, bound only to γA/γ′-fibrin via low affinity sites; and (c) exosite 2-directed ligands reduced α-thrombin binding to γA/γ′-fibrin. However, several lines of evidence indicate that exosite 1 contributes to the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin. First, the affinity of γ-thrombin for γA/γ′-fibrin was lower than that of α-thrombin. Second, removal of a low affinity binding site on the β-chain of γA/γ′-fibrin reduced its affinity for α-thrombin. Third, exosite 1-directed ligands reduced α-thrombin binding to γA/γ′-fibrin. Taken together, these data suggest that, although exosite 2 mediates the interaction of thrombin with the γ′-chain of γA/γ′-fibrin, simultaneous ligation of exosite 1 by low affinity binding sites is essential for the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin. Exosite 1 on thrombin mediates low affinity binding to sites on the NH2 termini of the α- and β-chains of fibrin.

Thrombin is a serine protease that plays an essential role in hemostasis, effecting procoagulant, anticoagulant, and profi-brinolytic responses. As a procoagulant, thrombin activates platelets, converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and promotes its own generation by activating factors V, VIII, and XI. After binding to thrombomodulin, its cellular receptor, thrombin triggers anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic pathways by activating protein C and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, respectively (1Colman R.W. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Marder V.J. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 3-16Google Scholar, 2Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The activity of thrombin is primarily regulated through inhibition by antithrombin in a reaction that is enhanced by heparin (3Bock S.C. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 321-334Google Scholar). Although the heparin-antithrombin complex readily inhibits fluid-phase thrombin, thrombin that remains bound to fibrin after clotting is protected from inactivation by the heparin-antithrombin complex. This protection reflects, at least in part, heparin-mediated bridging of thrombin onto fibrin to form a ternary thrombin-heparin-fibrin complex (4Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 248-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that provides a plausible explanation for the in vitro observation that thrombi induce activation of platelets and trigger coagulation (7Badimon L. Meyer B.J. Badimon J.J. Haemostasis. 1994; 24: 69-80PubMed Google Scholar). The concept that fibrin-bound thrombin contributes to the procoagulant activity of thrombi is supported by the recent demonstration that human thrombi obtained from pathological specimens harbor active thrombin (8Mutch N.J. Robbie L.A. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sequestered thrombin may be generated by activated factor X (factor Xa) bound to platelets within the thrombus. Like fibrin-bound thrombin, factor Xa within the platelet-bound prothrombinase complex also is protected from inactivation by the heparin-antithrombin complex (9Rezaie A.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consequently, thrombus-associated factor Xa may further contribute to the procoagulant activity of thrombi by triggering local thrombin generation (11Prager N.A. Abendschein D.R. McKenzie C.R. Eisenberg P.R. Circulation. 1995; 92: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thrombin binds to fibrin via a domain distinct from the active site of the enzyme. Thrombin possesses two electropositive domains (termed exosites) that bracket the catalytic site. Exosite 1 serves as the initial docking site that orients substrates and inhibitors within the active site cleft (12Jackman M.P. Parry M.A.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15375-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second electropositive domain (exosite 2) binds heparin, other glycosaminoglycans, and prothrombin fragment 2 (13Liu L.W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). In addition to acting as binding sites, the two exosites on thrombin may also modulate thrombin enzymatic activity. Thus, ligand binding to either exosite alters the active site environment (14Ye J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2373-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), effecting conformational changes that alter thrombin substrate specificity (2Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence for allosteric linkage between the two exosites because ligand binding to one exosite can influence the binding properties of the other (15Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thrombin utilizes exosite 1 to dock fibrinogen as it is converted to fibrin. Fibrinogen is composed of duplicated Aα-, Bβ-, and γ-chains held together by disulfide bonds. Two chromatographically distinct forms of fibrinogen, distinguished by the structure of their γ-chains, can be isolated from human plasma (16Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most fibrinogen molecules contain two γA-chains, each composed of 411 amino acids, and are thus designated γA/γA. About 10% of circulating fibrinogen molecules contain a variant of the native γ-chain (termed γ′) composed of 427 amino acids. This longer γ′-chain results from alternative mRNA polyadenylation and has an acidic hirudin-like 20-amino acid sequence at its COOH terminus (17Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. Blood. 1980; 56: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen heterodimers containing one γA- and one γ′-chain are designated γA/γ′. Conversion of γA/γA- or γA/γ′-fibrinogen to fibrin requires sequential thrombin-mediated release of fibrinopeptides A and B from the NH2 termini of the Aα- and Bβ-chains of fibrinogen, respectively. Current thinking is that once thrombin-mediated fibrinopeptide release is effected, some of the thrombin remains bound to the resultant fibrin via exosite 1 (16Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Functionally, γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrin are distinguished by their thrombin-binding properties (16Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of thrombin to γA/γA-fibrin occurs through a single class of low affinity binding sites that have been localized to the NH2 termini of the α- and β-chains, proximal to the fibrinopeptide cleavage sites (19Lord S.T. Strickland E. Jayjock E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2342-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thrombin binds to these low affinity sites with Kd values that range from 1 to 3.4 μm (20Hogg P.J. Bock P.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to low affinity thrombin binding, γA/γ′-fibrin also displays high affinity thrombin binding that has been attributed to the COOH terminus of the γ′-chain. The Kd value for this interaction is 0.18 μM (16Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further explore the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin, we measured the affinity of thrombin for a synthetic 20-amino acid peptide analog of the COOH terminus of the γ′-chain. Using thrombin variants or DNA aptamers directed against the exosites, we demonstrated that thrombin binding to this γ′-chain peptide is mediated by exosite 2. Building on this observation, we then explored the role of exosites 1 and 2 in the interaction of thrombin with γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrin. These studies suggest that both exosites on thrombin contribute to the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin. In contrast, the low affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′- or γA/γA-fibrin is mediated solely by exosite 1.

Fibrinogen concentrations were determined using a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer by measuring absorbance at 280 and using Mr = 340,000 and ϵ2801%=15 (33Dellenback R.J. Chien S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1970; 134: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at –70 °C. The integrity of isolated γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrinogen fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Ready-Gel, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) under reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). The gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed against the γ′-chain (Fig. 1B). Two bands are seen in the γ-chain region of γA/γ′-fibrinogen (Fig. 1A, lane 2), but only the higher molecular weight band of the doublet was recognized by the antibody against the γ′-chain (Fig. 1B, lane 2). In contrast, the single γ-chain band of γA/γA-fibrinogen (Fig. 1A, lane 1) was not recognized by the antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Preparation of Des-Bβ1–42-γA/γA- and Des-Bβ1–42-γA/γ′-Fibrinogen—γA/γA- or γA/γ′-fibrinogen (8.4 μm; in TBS containing 12 mm EDTA) was incubated with 2.3 μm protease III fraction from C. atrox venom for 90 min at 23 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of FPRck to 10 μm. After 10 min, 20% (v/v) ethanol was added, and the solution was maintained on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of TBS and dialyzed against TBS. Protein concentrations were determined as described above, and the material was stored in aliquots at –70 °C. The integrity of des-Bβ1–42-γA/γA- or des-Bβ1–42-γA/γ′-fibrinogen was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoblot analysis using an antibody against the γ′-chain was used to ensure that treatment with C. atrox venom had no effect on the COOH-terminal region of the γ′-chain of γA/γ′-fibrinogen. Upon SDS-PAGE, the β-chain lacking Bβ1–42 migrated with the γ-chain (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the γ′-chain of des-Bβ1–42-γA/γ′-fibrinogen was still recognized by the antibody against the γ′-chain (Fig. 1B, lane 4). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the β-chain of des-Bβ1–42-γA/γA- or des-Bβ1–42-γA/γ′-fibrinogen confirmed that the β-chains of both species were cleaved at the β42–43 bond. In contrast, the sequences of the NH2 termini of the α- and γ-chains corresponded to those of native fibrinogen (data not shown). Labeling of Proteins—Fluorescent derivatives of α-IIa, γ-IIa, and RA-IIa (f-FPR-α-IIa, f-FPR-γ-IIa, and f-FPR-RA-IIa, respectively) were prepared by incubation with a 5-fold molar excess of fluorescein-FPRck until there was no detectable chromogenic activity against tGPR-pNA. Samples were then dialyzed against TBS, and thrombin concentrations were determined using Mr = 37,000 and ϵ2801% = 18. A fluorescent derivative of the γ′-peptide (f-γ′-peptide) was generated by incubating the peptide with a 10-fold molar excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate in 1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9) for 90 min at 23 °C. Unreacted fluorescein isothiocyanate was removed by passing the material over a 10-ml Sephadex G-10 column equilibrated with TBS, and the concentration was determined as described (15Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). α-IIa was radiolabeled with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-BEAD (Pierce) as described (35Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44828-44834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specific radioactivity ranged from 0.7 to 1.5 × 109 cpm/mg. Radiolabeled α-IIa migrated with its unlabeled counterpart when subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Radiolabeled α-IIa bound to fibrin monomer-Sepharose (36Liaw P.C.Y. Becker D.L. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20959-20965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and to heparin-Sepharose with affinities similar to those of unlabeled α-IIa, thereby confirming the integrity of exosites 1 and 2, respectively. Only the fraction of 125I-α-IIa that bound to the columns was used. Active site-blocked 125I-α-IIa was prepared by incubating 125I-α-IIa with a 10-fold molar excess of FPRck, followed by dialysis against TBS. When prepared in this fashion, 125I-FPR-α-IIa had no activity against tGPR-pNA (37Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). For binding studies, trace amounts of 125I-FPR-α-IIa were combined with FPR-α-IIa. γ′-Peptide Binding to f-FPR-IIa—f-FPR-α-IIa, f-FPR-γ-IIa, or f-FPR-RA-IIa (at a concentration of 100 nm in 1 ml of TBS) was added to a semi-micro quartz cuvette, and samples were stirred with a mini-stir bar and maintained at 23 °C using a circulating water bath. Initial fluorescence (Io) was monitored at 1-s intervals using a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 and 535 nm, respectively, with a 515-nm cutoff filter in the emission beam and excitation and emission slit widths of 10 nm. Samples were then titrated with 1–10-μl aliquots of 50 μm γ′-peptide containing 100 nm f-FPR-IIa to prevent fluorescent probe dilution. The signal was allowed to stabilize before each addition, and fluorescence intensity values (I) were obtained from the time drive profile. I/Io values were plotted against the concentration of γ′-peptide, and binding was analyzed by nonlinear regression (Table Curve, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) in Equation 1,IIo=1+α2(1+Kd+Lon⋅Po−(1+Kd+Lon⋅Po)2−4⋅Lon⋅Po) (Eq. 1) where Lo is the concentration of ligand added, Po is the concentration of target protein, α is the maximum change in emission intensity, and n is the stoichiometry. Experiments were then performed to examine the ability of DNA aptamers directed against exosite 1 or 2 (HD1 and HD22, respectively) to displace the γ′-peptide from α-IIa. The fluorescence of a 1-ml sample containing 1 μm thrombin was monitored before and after addition of 50 nm f-γ′-peptide. The sample was subsequently titrated with 1–2-μl aliquots of HD1 or HD22 to a final concentration of 5.6 or 4.4 μm, respectively. Data were analyzed as described above. Thrombin Binding to Fibrin—Binding studies were performed with either radiolabeled or unlabeled thrombin. When labeled thrombin was used, 125I-FPR-α-IIa (0–8 μm) was added to microcentrifuge tubes containing 2 mm CaCl2 in the absence or presence of 2 μm γA/γA- or γA/γ′-fibrinogen. Clotting was initiated by addition of 10 nm α-IIa; and after a 60-min incubation at 23 °C, fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min. Two 10-μl aliquots of supernatant were removed and counted for radioactivity. The concentration of unbound thrombin in the supernatant was determined by comparison with a standard curve prepared in the absence of fibrinogen, and the concentration of the bound thrombin was then calculated by subtraction. Binding of unlabeled thrombin to fibrin was assessed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes to which were added 2 mm CaCl2, 30 nm α-, γ-, or RA-IIa, and 0–10 μm γA/γA- or γA/γ′-fibrinogen to a total volume of 50 μl. Because γ-IIa has minimal procoagulant activity, atroxin was added to 5% (v/v) to initiate clotting. After a 60-min incubation at 23 °C, fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min, and two 10-μl aliquots of supernatant were removed. The chromogenic activity of thrombin in each of these samples was assessed by their addition to the wells of a 96-well plate prefilled with 200 μl of 200 μm tGPR-pNA. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The thrombin concentration was determined by comparison with a standard curve, and the concentration of bound thrombin was then calculated by subtraction. In all cases, values were divided by the fibrinogen concentration to determine the number of moles of thrombin bound per mol of fibrin (ν). For each point in the titration, these values were then plotted against the concentration of unbound protein. Scatchard plots were also constructed, and depending on whether these appeared linear, reflecting a single class of binding sites, or curved downward, reflecting two classes of binding sites, data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis (Table Curve, Jandel Scientific) of a one-site (Equation 2) or two-site (Equation 3) binding equation,ν=n⋅LKd+L(Eq. 2) ν=n1⋅LKd1+L+n2⋅LKd2+L(Eq. 3) where L represents the concentration of unbound protein, n reflects stoichiometry, and Kd is the dissociation constant (38Horrevoets A.J.G. Smilde A. de Vries C. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12639-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effect of Exosite 1- or 2-directed Ligands on Thrombin Binding to Fibrin—Concentrations of hirudin-(54–65) (50 μm), heparin cofactor II-(54–75) (100 μm), HD1 (1 μm), h-F2 (64 μm), γ′-peptide (236 μm), and HD22 (0.25 μm), determined to be saturating in separate experiments were added to a series of microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 μm γA/γA-fibrinogen or 0.35 μm γA/γ′-fibrinogen, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 nm125I-FPR-α-IIa. Clotting was initiated by addition of atroxin to 5% (v/v), and after a 60-min incubation at 23 °C, fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. Duplicate 10-μl aliquots of supernatant were then removed and counted for radioactivity. The amount of 125I-FPR-α-IIa bound to fibrin in the absence or presence of competitor was calculated by subtraction. Data were displayed by plotting the concentration of 125I-FPR-α-IIa bound to fibrin in the presence of each concentration of competitor as a percentage of that bound in the absence of competitor. Statistical Methods—Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to evaluate significance. Interaction of α-IIa with the γ′-Peptide—To explore the interaction of α-IIa with the γ′-peptide, the fluorescence of 100 nM f-FPR-α-IIa was monitored as the sample was titrated with the γ′-peptide. Addition of the γ′-peptide elicited a saturable increase in the fluorescence intensity of f-FPR-α-IIa (Fig. 2), consistent with binding, and nonlinear regression analysis of the data revealed a Kd value of 2.2 μM. This compares with the Kd value of 0.68 μM reported for interaction of the fluorescently labeled γ′-peptide with α-IIa (24Lovely R.S. Moaddel M. Farrell D.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify the exosite mediating the interaction of f-FPR-α-IIa with the γ′-peptide, the experiment was repeated using f-FPR-γ-IIa, a thrombin derivative lacking exosite 1, and f-FPR-RA-IIa, a thrombin variant with an impaired exosite 2. The γ′-peptide bound to f-FPR-γ-IIa with a Kd of 1.0 μM (Fig. 2), an affinity similar to that for f-FPR-α-IIa. In contrast, the γ′-peptide did not bind to f-FPR-RA-IIa. These data suggest that exosite 2 mediates the interaction of α-IIa with the γ′-peptide, in agreement with a recent report (24Lovely R.S. Moaddel M. Farrell D.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further explore this concept, we performed reverse titrations to examine the ability of exosite 1- or 2-directed DNA aptamers to displace the f-γ′-peptide from α-IIa. The fluorescence intensity of 50 nM f-γ′-peptide decreased by 6% after addition of α-IIa (Fig. 3A). Titration with HD22, an aptamer directed against exosite 2, restored the fluorescence intensity to initial background levels, indicating displacement of the f-γ′-peptide from α-IIa. In contrast, HD1, an exosite 1-directed aptamer, had no effect (Fig. 3B). These data support the concept that the interaction of α-IIa with th"

Previously, we and others have shown that a partial re-activation of the cell cycle machinery occurs in myocytes undergoing hypertrophy such that cells progress through the G1/S transition. In this study, we have examined the regulation of the E2F family of transcription factors that are crucial for the G1/S phase transition during normal cardiac development and the development of myocyte hypertrophy in the rat. Thus, mRNA and protein levels of E2F-1, 3, and 4 and DP-1 and DP-2 were down-regulated during development to undetectable levels in adult myocytes. Interestingly, E2F-5 protein levels were substantially up-regulated during development. In contrast, an induction of E2F-1, 3, and 4 and the DP-1 protein was observed during the development of myocyte hypertrophy in neonatal myocytes treated with serum or phenylephrine, whereas the protein levels of E2F-5 were decreased with serum stimulation. E2F activity, as measured by a cyclin E promoter luciferase assay and E2F-DNA binding activity, increased significantly during the development of hypertrophy with serum and phenylephrine compared with non-stimulated cells. Inhibiting E2F activity with a specific peptide that blocks E2F-DP heterodimerization prevented the induction of hypertrophic markers (atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide) in response to serum and phenylephrine, reduced the increase in myocyte size, and inhibited protein synthesis in stimulated cells. Thus, we have shown that the inhibition of E2F function prevents the development of hypertrophy. Targeting E2F function might be a useful approach for treating diseases that cause pathophysiological hypertrophic growth.

Thus, we have shown that the inhibition of E2F function prevents the development of hypertrophy. Targeting E2F function might be a useful approach for treating diseases that cause pathophysiological hypertrophic growth. Shortly after birth, the majority of rat cardiac myocytes lose the ability to undergo cell division such that post-natal growth of the heart occurs primarily by myocyte hypertrophy (1Poolman R.A. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2121-2135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Li J.-M. Brooks G. Eur. Heart J. 1999; 20: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This adaptive physiological growth response enables the heart to grow to an adequate size in order to maintain sufficient cardiac output. However, myocardial injury, e.g. myocardial infarction and/or prolonged periods of chronic stress on the heart (e.g. hypertension), leads to excessive hypertrophic growth, commonly referred to as “decompensated hypertrophy,” which adversely affects cardiac function and accelerates heart failure (3Piano M.R. Bondmass M. Schwertz D.W. Heart Lung. 1998; 27: 3-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clinically, there is a need to develop new therapeutic entities that target specific molecules involved in this detrimental growth, which will ultimately improve the prognosis for patients. Previously, we have reported that a partial re-activation of specific components of the cell cycle machinery occurs during the development of cardiac hypertrophy, leading to transition of myocytes through the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint (2Li J.-M. Brooks G. Eur. Heart J. 1999; 20: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Li J.M. Poolman R.A. Brooks G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H814-H822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2F is a family of transcription factors that are known to play a pivotal role in the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle (5Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 6Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); however, very little is known about the potential role(s) of these transcription factors in cardiac hypertrophy. Structurally and functionally, the E2F transcription factors can be divided into three main categories as follows: (i) E2Fs 1–3, which are involved in proliferation; (ii) E2F-4 and E2F-5 that are thought to play a role in differentiation; and (iii) E2F-6, which is described as a transcriptional repressor (7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). For full transcriptional activity, the E2F transcription factors heterodimerize with a DP partner protein, of which two mammalian forms have been described, namely DP-1 and DP-2 (8Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Milla M.M. Phillips R.S. Horowitz J.M. Rogers K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7594-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of E2F members is sterically regulated by the pRb family of pocket proteins that consists of pRb, p107, and p130 (5Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). E2F activation occurs when cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 complexes in the G1 phase of the cell cycle phosphorylate the pRb pocket proteins, which then dissociate from the E2F-DP complex, resulting in E2F-mediated gene transcription and progression to the S phase of the cell cycle (5Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 6Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Indeed, various studies have shown that E2F is instrumental in cardiac myocyte cell cycle progression. Thus, Flink et al. (11Flink I.L. Oana S. Maitra N. Bahl J.J. Morkin E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 563-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that a switch occurs from the E2F-p107 complex in proliferating fetal myocytes to E2F-p130 in 2-day-old neonatal cells. Also, von Harsdorf et al. (13von Harsdorf R. Hauck L. Mehrhof F. Wegenka U. Cardoso M.C. Dietz R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) showed that adenoviral delivery of E2F-1 drove a significant number of adult cardiac myocytes into the S phase of the cell cycle; Agah et al. have reported similar findings (12Agah R. Kirshenbaum L.A. Abdellatif M. Truong L.D. Chakraborty S. Michael L.H. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2722-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Clinically, E2F has proved to be a viable target in the treatment of certain vasculoproliferative diseases. Thus, Mann et al. (10Mann M.J. Whittemore A.D. Donaldson M.C. Belkin M. Conte M.S. Polak J.F. Orav E.J. Ehsan A. Dell'Acqua G. Dzau V.J. Mann M.J. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1493-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) showed that blocking E2F-1 function in human vein grafts ex vivo, using a decoy oligonucleotide strategy, reduced the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent graft failure. The importance of E2F in the heart was shown recently by Cloud et al. (14Cloud J.E. Rogers C. Reza T.L. Ziebold U. Stone J.R. Picard M.H. Caron A.M. Bronson R.T. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), who reported that E2F-3a and E2F-3b null mice die from symptoms of congestive heart failure during development, indicating a crucial role for E2F3 in normal cardiac growth. Although much is known about E2F function in a variety of diseases, currently no study has characterized expression and/or inhibited E2F function during the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. In the present study, we have determined the expressions of E2F and DP family members at the mRNA and protein levels in myocytes obtained from the developing rat heart. In addition, we have determined the expressions and activities of these molecules during the development of myocyte hypertrophy in vitro and shown that blocking E2F function with a peptide that abrogates E2F-DP heterodimerization (15Bandara L.R. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) inhibits the development of hypertrophy. Our results suggest that E2F plays an important role in cardiac myocyte growth and that targeting these transcription factors could provide us with an effective therapy for treating detrimental left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) leading to heart failure. Myocyte Isolation—Fetal Wistar rat cardiac myocytes were isolated from 70 fetuses at 18 days of gestation (E18), and neonatal rat myocytes were isolated from 30 Wistar pups (2–3 days post-natal (P2)), according to the method described by Poolman and Brooks (1Poolman R.A. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2121-2135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, including enzymatic digestions for 10 min, preplating for 1 h, and centrifugation and re-suspension of cells in myocyte media (one part M199, four parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fetal calf serum; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RT, reverse transcription; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; PE, phenylephrine; AH2, peptide sequence targeted to the DEF box region of the E2F heterodimerization domain; AHS2, scrambled sequence based upon AH2; ANT, penetratin sequence. with 100 IU of penicillin/streptomycin) containing 500 μm 5-bromo-3-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) prior to culture on Primaria plates (Falcon). Adult myocytes were isolated as described by Brooks et al. (16Brooks G. Poolman R.A. McGill C.J. Li J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 28: 2261-2271Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that 5 mg of protease (Sigma) and 50 mg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) were added to the digestion mixture. Peptide Studies—E2F blocking and control peptides were used at concentrations of 30 μm in myocyte media as described by Bandara et al. (15Bandara L.R. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were as follows: AH2, RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKRRRVYDALNVLMAMNIISK; AHS2, RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKDRVKAVRNLMIASYRNMLI; and ANT, RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Two-color flow cytometric analysis was performed as described by Poolman and Brooks (1Poolman R.A. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2121-2135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that BrdUrd was added directly to myocyte media at a final concentration of 10 μm. Also, pepsin was omitted when myocytes were exposed to 0.1 m HCl and cells were incubated for 10 min. Finally, the staining solution was modified by replacing Isoton with phosphate buffered saline. Isolation of Total RNA, Semi-quantitative, and Quantitative RT-PCR Analyses—Fetal, neonatal, and adult myocytes were homogenized in TRI Reagent (1 ml per 50–100 mg of tissue). Total RNA was then prepared from the sample in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). RT-PCR was performed on 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA using AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT). PCR analysis was carried out using the following primer sequences: E2F-1, sense 5′-TTCTTGGAGCTGCTGAGCC-3′, antisense 5′-TGGTGATGTCATAGATGCG-3′; E2F-2, sense 5′-ATCCAGTGGGTAGGCAGG-3′, antisense 5′-TGGGCACAGGTAGACTTC-3′; E2F-3, sense 5′-TGGACCTCAAACTGTTAACCG-3′, antisense 5′-GGAGGCAGTAAGTTCACAA-3′; E2F-4, sense 5′-TGCTTGACCTCAAGCTGG-3′, antisense 5′-CTCCAGCAAAGCATCTGC-3′; E2F-5, sense 5′-ACCACCAAGTTCGTGTCGTTGC-3′, antisense 5′-GTTATGATGAACTGAAGCCTGC-3′; DP-1, sense 5′-GGATCTGGTAACATGGCA-3′, antisense 5′-GGATATGATGTTCATGGC-3′; DP-2, sense 5′-TGCAGCATCTCCAGTGAC-3′, antisense 5′-CAGAGAGCATTTGCCTGAC-3′; GAPDH, sense 5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAAC-3′, antisense 5′-AGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′; ANF, sense 5′-ATGGGCTCCTTCTCCATCAC-3′, antisense 5′-TCTTCGGTACCGGGAAGCT-3′; BNP, sense 5′-AGACAAGAGAGAGCAGGACACC-3′, antisense 5′-CTTGAACTATGTGCCATCTTGG-3′. PCR products were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose/TAE gels. Bands were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed using ABsolute™ QPCR ROX mix (ABgene) and a GeneAmp® 5700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Rat ANF was amplified using sense (5′-CGGACTAGGCTGCAACAGCT-3′) and antisense (5′-CCAGGAGGGTATTCACCACCT-3′) oligonucleotides and detected using an ANF probe (5′-FAM-CGGTACCGAAGATAACAGCCAAATCTGCT-TAMRA-3′). Real-time PCR analysis was normalized using the rodent GAPDH control reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein was prepared from freshly isolated fetal, neonatal, and adult rat ventricular myocytes as described by Brooks and co-workers (16Brooks G. Poolman R.A. McGill C.J. Li J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 28: 2261-2271Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar) except that 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF; 0.3 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml) were used as protease inhibitors. Following separation in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) before incubation with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) directed against either E2F-1 (C-20), E2F-2 (C-20), E2F-3a (N-20), E2F-4 (C-20), E2F-5 (MH-5), DP-1 (K-20), or DP-2 (C-20 and N-20) were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/0.1% Tween 20 containing 1% milk powder. Membranes were then incubated in goat anti-rabbit- or goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:4000) for 1 h. Finally, all washes were carried out in TBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min, except the final wash, which was TBS alone. Luciferase Assays—Neonatal myocytes were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 2.5 × 105/well and left overnight in 5% FCS myocyte medium containing 500 μm BrdUrd. Cells then were co-transfected overnight with either 0.2 μg of a cyclin E promoter-firefly luciferase construct or control vector (lacking the cyclin E promoter) and 0.01 μg of vector encoding the Renilla luciferase enzyme (Promega) using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with various hypertrophic agonists for 48 h, after which transfected cells were collected and assayed using a Dual-Luciferase™ assay kit (Promega). Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSAs)—EMSAs were performed according to La Thangue et al. (17La Thangue N.B Thimmappaya B. Rigby P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that poly(dI-dC) was used as the nonspecific competitor. The E2F binding sequence used was 5′-TAGTTTTCGCGCTTAAATTTGA-3′. Myocyte nuclear extracts (20 μg) were used in each assay, and appropriate competition studies were performed. Statistical Analysis—Autoradiographs and photographs were scanned and analyzed using the Quantity One® densitometric computer analysis program (Bio-Rad). Data was subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical significance was assessed using the Bonferroni t test. p values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. Developmental Expression of E2F and DP in Rat Cardiac Myocytes—Fig. 1 shows mRNA (Fig. 1a) and protein (Fig. 1b) expressions of E2F and DP family members during development in fetal (E18), neonatal (P2), and adult rat cardiac myocytes. The mRNA expressions of all E2F family members were down-regulated progressively during normal cardiac myocyte development, although E2F-5 levels remained detectable in adult cells compared with other family members (Fig. 1a). A similar pattern of regulation was demonstrated at the protein level, such that E2F-1, -3a, and -4 and DP-1 and DP-2 were down-regulated progressively in both ventricular tissues (data not shown) and in isolated cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, levels of E2F-5 protein were seen to increase during development (Fig. 1b). Protein levels of E2F-2 in both whole ventricular tissues and cardiac myocytes were consistently very low and were only detectable when the films were over-exposed despite a strong immunoreactive E2F-2 band being present in control NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). This result is consistent with the work of Kusek et al. (18Kusek J.C. Greene R.M. Nugent P. Pisano M.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 267-277PubMed Google Scholar) in the mouse showing that expression of E2F-2 protein also was low in murine whole cardiac tissues compared with the expressions of other E2F proteins. Expression of E2F and DP Family Members during the Development of Myocyte Hypertrophy—Having established that E2F and DP family members are expressed differentially during normal cardiac development, we next determined whether the regulation of these molecules was similarly altered during the development of myocyte hypertrophy. Using an in vitro model of hypertrophy, cardiac myocytes were stimulated for 24 h with one of two different hypertrophic stimuli, 20% FCS or 100 μm phenylephrine (PE). To confirm that hypertrophy had been induced, we measured the induction of the hypertrophic marker, ANF, by real time PCR, cell cycle progression by flow cytometry and cell size (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows that ANF was induced significantly in cells treated for 24 h with FCS (4-fold) and PE (7-fold) compared with the levels expressed in control cells maintained in 0% FCS. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on control and treated cell populations using the propidium iodide/BrdUrd double staining method to accurately determine the cell cycle profiles of these cells. Fig. 2b shows that over 80% of the cells maintained in 0% FCS were in G1 with 5% in the S phase. However, upon stimulation with FCS for 24 h, the S phase population of cells increased to ∼20%, with a proportional decrease of cells in the G1 phase. PE stimulation also increased the S phase population by 10%, with a proportional decrease of cells in the G1 phase. Thus, a significant number of cells treated with different hypertrophic agonists progress from G1 into S phase, consistent with a partial re-activation of the cell cycle during the development of hypertrophy (4Li J.M. Poolman R.A. Brooks G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H814-H822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Fig. 2c shows that cell size was increased significantly in cultures treated with either 20% FCS or 100 μm PE, compared with control cells (0% FCS). Taken together, these analyses confirm that a significant level of hypertrophy was induced in cardiac myocytes stimulated with our different stimuli. We next determined the expression patterns of E2F and DP family members during the development of myocyte hypertrophy. Concentrating on protein expression of E2F and DP family members, Fig. 3 shows that the E2F-1 protein was up-regulated following stimulation with 20% FCS for 24 h, whereas 100 μm PE did not regulate E2F-1 protein levels when compared with controls. A similar result was observed 48 h following agonist stimulation (data not shown). E2F-3a and -4 and DP-1 proteins were all up-regulated following stimulation with FCS or PE. Protein expression of DP-2 in stimulated and non-stimulated cells was very low (determined using both N- and C-terminus-directed DP-2 antibodies). This observation confirms our previous developmental data, which showed that freshly isolated neonatal myocytes contain low amounts of DP-2 (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, E2F-5 protein was not regulated in cells stimulated with PE at any time point, whereas levels were down-regulated significantly following 20% FCS stimulation at both 24 (Fig. 3) and 48 h (data not shown) post-stimulation. In accordance with our developmental results, the E2F-2 protein was not detectable in stimulated or non-stimulated cells. This differential pattern of regulation suggests either distinct functional roles for individual E2F family members and/or a temporal pattern of expression during the development of hypertrophy. Changes in E2F Activity in Cardiac Myocytes during the Development of Hypertrophy—Because our initial studies showed that the E2F and DP proteins are regulated differentially during the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, we next determined whether the transcriptional activities and DNA binding activities of these proteins was similarly altered during this process by using a combination of dual luciferase assays and EMSAs. We measured global E2F activity in myocytes by transfecting a construct containing the firefly luciferase gene under transcriptional control of the mammalian cyclin E promoter into cultured neonatal myocytes. A second construct, containing the Renilla luciferase gene under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, was co-transfected into myocytes to provide a baseline luminescence which could be used to normalize E2F activity and provide an overall ratio of E2F-mediated luciferase activity. Fig. 4a shows that E2F activity was doubled when myocytes were stimulated to undergo hypertrophy with FCS, whereas PE increased E2F activity ∼6-fold compared with levels found in 0% FCS control cells 48 h post-stimulation. We confirmed that global E2F-DNA binding was increased following treatment with hypertrophic agents by performing a series of EMSAs (Fig. 4b) 24 h post-stimulation. The results of these studies confirmed those from the dual luciferase assays and showed an up-regulation in E2F-DNA binding following stimulation of myocytes with 20% FCS or 100 μm PE. To ensure probe specificity in EMSAs, appropriate competition studies were performed with an unlabeled E2F probe and probes designed to detect Sp1 and PPAR-γ (data not shown). Two E2F bands were visualized in EMSAs, namely “free E2F” that describes the E2F-DP heterodimer and “bound E2F” that describes E2F-DP in complex with pocket proteins. A nonspecific band (ns in Fig. 4), which was not competed out in appropriate competition studies, was also observed near the unincorporated nucleotide front. Blocking E2F Activity Prevents the Induction of Hypertrophy—Because E2F activity is increased during the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 4), we next determined whether inhibiting E2F activity would affect this process. E2F-DP heterodimerization is essential for transcriptional E2F activity, and its function can be blocked completely by inhibiting this dimerization. Indeed, a specific peptide sequence named “AH2,” targeted to the DEF box region of the heterodimerization domain of E2F, has been shown previously to inhibit the growth of tumor cells consistent with its inhibition of E2F activity (15Bandara L.R. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have used this same peptide sequence to block E2F function in myocytes stimulated to undergo hypertrophy with 20% FCS or 100 μm PE. Peptides were N-terminally linked to the penetratin sequence to aid delivery into intact cells (19Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The penetratin sequence (referred to as “ANT”) and a scrambled sequence based upon AH2 (termed AHS2) were included as negative controls for this study because they do not inhibit E2F function. Using a combination of semi-quantitative (Fig. 5a) and quantitative (Fig. 5b) PCR analyses, we determined the effect of blocking E2F function on the development of hypertrophy. Fig. 5a shows that myocytes stimulated to undergo hypertrophy in the absence of any peptide or those exposed to the control peptides, AHS2 (30 μm) and ANT (30 μm), showed a significant induction of ANF and BNP, confirming that hypertrophic growth had occurred. However, cells stimulated to undergo hypertrophy with 20% FCS in the presence of AH2 (30 μm) showed a reduction in ANF and BNP levels compared with cells treated with control peptides. This reduction was even more pronounced in PE-stimulated cells wherein AH2 completely abrogated the induction of both ANF and BNP. Quantitative PCR analyses (Fig. 5b) showed that, following serum stimulation, the presence of AH2 inhibited ANF induction where levels were decreased 4-fold when compared with normal serum-stimulated cells and those with serum and control peptides, i.e. AHS2 and ANT. Similar to that seen with the semi-quantitative analyses, ANF induction was greatly reduced in AH2-treated cells (6-fold) when compared with PE-stimulated cells or PE-stimulated cells in the presence of control peptides (AHS2 and ANT) (Fig. 5c). Total protein content of myocytes also was compared in myocytes exposed to either 0% FCS or 20% FCS for 24 h in the presence or absence of E2F peptides (Fig. 6a). Thus, cells stimulated to undergo hypertrophy with 20% FCS doubled their total protein content over a 24 h period without any increase in cell number. AHS2- and ANT-treated cells also showed an approximate doubling of total protein content, indicating that the inclusion of a nonspecific exogenous peptide in the myocyte culture medium did not adversely affect the development of hypertrophy. In contrast, the addition of AH2 abolished the increase in total protein content in myocytes treated with 20% FCS such that levels remained similar to non-stimulated cells. There also was no significant change in cell number following treatment of myocytes with AH2 for 24 h, suggesting that the effect of this peptide was to inhibit hypertrophic growth. Similar effects were observed for PE-treated cells wherein AH2 substantially blocked the increase in total protein content that normally accompanies hypertrophic growth (Fig. 6b). The control peptides, AHS2 and ANT, had no such effects. This result suggests that blocking E2F function inhibits the protein synthesis that is known to occur during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. In addition, AH2-treated myocytes did not show any increase in size 24 h post stimulation with 20% FCS, whereas cells treated with 20% FCS alone or 20% FCS plus AHS2 or ANT peptide approximately doubled in size (data not shown).Fig. 6Blocking E2F-DP heterodimerization prevents the increase in protein content associated with hypertrophic growth. Myocytes were stimulated to undergo hypertrophy with 20% FCS (panel a) or 100 μm PE (panel b) in the presence or absence of AH2, AHS2, or ANT peptides (30 μm each) compared with control cells (0% FCS-treated myocytes). Total protein content was determined by Bradford assay 24 h following treatment.

It has been shown previously that neonatal rat myocytes exit the cell cycle between days 3 and 4 after birth and accumulate in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle (1Poolman R.A. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2121-2135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Li F. Wang X. Capasso J.M. Gerdes A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1737-1746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory also has shown that certain cell cycle molecules that act upstream of E2F are down-regulated during normal development but are re-activated transiently during adaptive hypertrophic growth (2Li J.-M. Brooks G. Eur. Heart J. 1999; 20: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Li J.M. Poolman R.A. Brooks G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H814-H822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brooks G. Poolman R.A. McGill C.J. Li J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 28: 2261-2271Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our current data demonstrate that E2F (with the exception of E2F-5) and DP family members are down-regulated in the cardiac myocyte at the mRNA and protein levels from the fetal to adult stages of ventricular development. In contrast, E2F-5 protein expression was increased throughout development. This unique expression pattern for E2F-5 is consistent with a potential role for this cell cycle molecule in myocyte differentiation. Indeed, in neuronal tissue, which also has a terminally differentiated phenotype, E2F-5 similarly maintains significant levels of expression through to adulthood (21Kusek J.C. Greene R.M. Pisano M.M. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 54: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because E2F-5 mRNA levels were down-regulated progressively during development, E2F-5 expression is likely to be controlled at the translational level in adult cardiac myocytes. Using an in vitro model of myocyte hypertrophy, we determined the expression patterns of E2F and DP family members during this process. Interestingly, a differential expression pattern of E2F and DP members was observed in myocytes undergoing hypertrophic growth such that there was a reversal toward the fetal pattern of protein expressions consistent with the transient up-regulation in specific cyclins and cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinases during the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (4Li J.M. Poolman R.A. Brooks G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H814-H822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2F-1 expression levels were not changed significantly when myocytes were treated with PE, although a significant up-regulation was seen with FCS stimulation. Previously, E2F-1 has been implicated in cardiac myocyte cell cycle progression because adenoviruses expressing the E2F-1 gene caused a G1/S phase transition (13von Harsdorf R. Hauck L. Mehrhof F. Wegenka U. Cardoso M.C. Dietz R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, cells did not progress further than the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The reason for the differential regulation of E2F-1 with serum compared with PE might reflect differences in signaling pathways (a growth factor-mediated pathway for FCS versus the α1-adrenergic receptor for PE) that mediate the hypertrophic response. Our studies show that E2F-3a and, to a lesser extent E2F-4, are the predominant E2F species up-regulated both 24 and 48 h post stimulation with both hypertrophic agonists, suggesting an important role for these transcription factors in the hypertrophic growth of myocytes. It is possible that, during the development of hypertrophy, cardiac myocytes exhibit a temporal expression pattern of E2F as described by Takahashi et al. for human T98G glioblastoma cells (22Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, T98G cells were synchronized into the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation and then stimulated to traverse the cell cycle by subsequent serum stimulation. The results showed that E2F-1 promoter activity was at its greatest 16 h post-stimulation and then declined, with E2F-3 taking a leading role late in the G1 phase when it bound to promoters for cyclin A, cdc2, cdc6, p107, and E2F-1, all of which are required for S phase progression. E2F-5 activity was not detected in these cells, possibly as a consequence of the fact that they were a proliferating population. It is possible that a similar scenario exists in cardiac myocytes such that E2F-1 activity could be dominant early on in hypertrophy and eventually become down-regulated to control levels, leaving E2F-3a to continue cell cycle progression and modulate growth of stimulated myocytes. Currently, E2F-4 is considered to be important for differentiation, along-side E2F-5 (7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). However, we observed a significant presence of the E2F-4 protein in myocytes undergoing hypertrophy with both agonists. We therefore hypothesize that E2F-4 may be acting in conjunction with E2F-1 and E2F-3 to promote hypertrophy or that it could be removed from the nucleus following hypertrophic stimulation. Indeed, unlike the proliferative E2Fs (E2F-1, -2, and -3), both E2F-4 and E2F-5 contain nuclear export signals (NES) (7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that E2F-4 is removed from the nucleus upon hypertrophic stimulation of the cardiac myocyte, thereby repressing its differentiation function. In addition to determining the expression levels of the E2F proteins, we also investigated the global activity status of these transcription factors. Using a cyclin E promoter-luciferase assay, myocytes stimulated with 20% FCS showed a ∼2-fold increase in overall E2F activity, whereas cells stimulated with PE showed a 6-fold increase in overall E2F activity when compared with control cells (p < 0.05). These results strongly suggest that E2Fs play an important role in the development of hypertrophy following growth factor- or α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation. EMSAs confirmed these findings and showed an increase in E2F-DNA binding during the development of hypertrophy with serum and PE. Inhibiting functional E2F activity with a specific peptide sequence that inhibits E2F-DP heterodimerization led to a significant inhibition in the development of myocyte hypertrophy as determined by a combination of ANF and BNP mRNA expressions and protein synthesis measurements. Both semi-quantitative (Fig. 5a) and quantitative PCR (Fig. 5b) analyses showed that blocking E2F function led to significant inhibition of hypertrophic growth, as levels of ANF and BNP were reduced to those seen in non-stimulated myocytes. Interestingly, semi-quantitative analysis showed that blocking E2F activity in PE-stimulated cells with AH2 has a greater effect, because ANF and BNP induction were reduced to undetectable levels (Fig. 5a). This finding is consistent with our luciferase assay results showing that PE-mediated hypertrophic growth is strongly E2F-dependant (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, inhibiting E2F function in 20% FCS-stimulated cells prevented protein synthesis, which doubled in cells exposed to FCS alone and in cells treated with FCS and the control peptides AHS2 or ANT. Other investigators have shown previously that targeting E2F can affect the growth of cardiovascular cells. Thus, Morishita et al. (24Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Horiuchi M. Ellison K.E. Nakama M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5855-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) showed that transfecting an E2F decoy oligonucleotide into rat vascular smooth muscle cells decreased proliferation of these cells and decreased the expression of E2F-dependent genes, namely, c-myc, cdc2, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. More recently, Mann et al. (10Mann M.J. Whittemore A.D. Donaldson M.C. Belkin M. Conte M.S. Polak J.F. Orav E.J. Ehsan A. Dell'Acqua G. Dzau V.J. Mann M.J. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1493-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) used a similar approach to prevent neointimal hyperplasia in autologous vein grafts, a common problem that contributes to vein graft failure. Using an ex vivo pressure-mediated delivery of an E2F decoy oligonucleotide into veins, a transfection efficiency of 89% was achieved, and overall graft failure event rates fell to 29% compared with 69% for the control group. Clearly, blocking E2F function in the vascular system can provide significant clinical benefits for patients. In the present study, we have shown that blocking E2F function in cardiac myocytes may provide similar benefits for patients with hypertrophic cardiac disease. In summary, we have shown that E2F and DP family members are regulated differentially during normal rat cardiac myocyte development such that all transcription factors, with the exception of E2F-5, are down-regulated as the heart matures. This pattern of expression is reversed during the development of myocyte hypertrophy, because E2F-1, -3a, and -4 and DP-1 are up-regulated, whereas E2F-5 is down-regulated following mitogenic stimulation. E2F activity is increased during the development of hypertrophy, and blocking E2F function inhibits the development of hypertrophy, suggesting that inhibiting E2F activity in certain cardiac diseases might provide a novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting the development of myocyte hypertrophy that might delay, and possibly prevent, the onset of heart failure."

Paradoxically, loss of this evolutionarily conserved enzyme has not been seen to result in severe growth phenotypes in the cellular life forms. In this study, we chose G+C-rich genome containing bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium smegmatis) as model organisms to investigate the biological significance of ung. Ung deficiency was created either by expression of a highly specific inhibitor protein, Ugi, and/or by targeted disruption of the ung gene. We show that abrogation of Ung activity in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis confers upon them an increased mutator phenotype and sensitivity to reactive nitrogen intermediates generated by acidified nitrite. Also, in a mouse macrophage infection model, P. aeruginosa (Ung–) shows a significant decrease in its survival. Infections of the macrophages with M. smegmatis show an initial increase in the bacterial counts that remain for up to 48 h before a decline. Interestingly, abrogation of Ung activity in M. smegmatis results in nearly a total abolition of their multiplication and a much-decreased residency in macrophages stimulated with interferon γ.

Among all the bases in DNA, cytosine is highly susceptible to deamination of its exocyclic amino group in response to normal physiological reactions or environmental pollutants, resulting in generation of promutagenic G×U mismatches in the genome. If these were to be left unrepaired, an exorbitant increase in accrual of G-C to A-T mutations would occur unabated after each replication cycle and pose a serious threat to the genomic integrity and the very survival of the organism. In cells, uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung), 1The abbreviations used are: Ung, uracil DNA glycosylase (also UDG); RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediates; LBT, LB supplemented with 0.2% Tween 80; ORF, open reading frame; FCS, fetal calf serum; IFN, interferon; Eco, E. coli; kb, kilobase(s). also known as UDG, is the major DNA repair enzyme that initiates uracil excision repair pathway (1Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Google Scholar). Ung proteins are found in all life forms including many viruses that infect eukaryotic cells. These enzymes are inhibited by free uracil and some of its derivatives as well as by Bacillus subtilis phage PBS-1- and -2-encoded inhibitor Ugi. Ugi is a heat-stable, acidic, low molecular weight protein that forms a tight complex with Ung (2Cone R. Bonura T. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10354-10358Google Scholar, 3Krokan H.E.

In herpes simplex virus, UNG gene is necessary for efficient replication and reactivation (5Pyles R.B. Thompson R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4963-4972Google Scholar).

It is paradoxical that the loss of ung gene, whose phylogenetic distribution is so exceedingly broad and which codes for a highly conserved and functionally relevant protein, does not result in a severe phenotype in the cellular life forms, at least under the conditions investigated. However, it is noteworthy that the G+C-rich organisms, which are naturally at high risk of cytosine deamination, have not yet been used in such studies. The genome-sequencing projects have unfolded greater opportunities to investigate the roles of important genes in various organisms. We chose a fast- and a slow-growing G,C-rich genome-containing bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium smegmatis with G+C contents of 67 and 64%, respectively) as model organisms to investigate the biological significance of ung. In addition, M. smegmatis serves as a surrogate model for the pathogenic mycobacteria (10Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.V. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Google Scholar), which are at an increased risk of cytosine deamination inside host macrophages due to the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Both reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and reactive oxygen species penetrate through the lipid-rich membranes/cell wall (11Fels A.O. Cohn Z.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1986; 60: 353-369Google Scholar, 12Lancaster Jr., J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 31-50Google Scholar) of bacteria. One of the types of damage that ensues from the presence of these reactive intermediates is an increased rate of cytosine deamination in DNA (13Wink D.A. Kasprzak K.S. Maragos C.M. Elespuru R.K. Misra M. Dunams T.M. Cebula T.A. Koch W.H. Andrews A.W. Allen J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1001-1003Google Scholar). Here, we show that in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis abrogation of Ung activity leads not only to an increased mutator phenotype but also to growth inhibition by RNI. Furthermore, in a mouse macrophage infection model, P. aeruginosa (Ung–) shows a significant decrease in survival under the conditions of increased RNI production. Interestingly, in this assay loss of Ung in M. smegmatis results in near abolition of the initial round(s) of bacterial multiplication and in its compromised endurance in macrophage. Various DNA oligomers, plasmids, and bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Unless specified otherwise, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa were grown in Luria Bertani, LB (Difco), and M. smegmatis mc2155 (14Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Google Scholar) was grown in LB supplemented with 0.2% Tween 80 (LBT). For growth on a solid surface, 1.5% agar was included in the broth media. Liquid cultures were grown at 37 °C under shaking. When required, the media were supplemented with ampicillin, gentamycin, and kanamycin at 100, 20, and 50 μg/ml, respectively, for E. coli, with chloramphenicol at 200 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa, and with kanamycin and gentamycin at 50 and 5 μg/ml, respectively, for M. smegmatis cultures. Sucrose selection for M. smegmatis was performed on Middlebrook 7H10 (Difco) solid medium with 0.2% glycerol and 10% sucrose.Table IList of plasmids, bacterial strains, and oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this studyStrain/plasmidRelevant detailsReferencepDK20 (KanR)An integration vector for mycobacteria.20DasGupta S.K.

Varshney U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 579-590Google Scholar) was damaged at its active site by cleaving these plasmids at their unique BamHI sites and end-filling with Klenow DNA polymerase followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. The desired recombinants, pTrcUgi and pTrcUgi-oc36 (containing a stop codon, UAA at 36th position in ORF) were selected for expression of Ugi or its mutant Ugi-oc36, respectively, in E. coli KL16 (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To generate such constructs for introduction into P. aeruginosa, the BamHI to HindIII DNA fragments harboring ugi or ugi-oc36 from pTrcUDG-Ugi and the pTrcUDG-Ugi-oc36 were subcloned into the same sites of pBBR1MCS (Ref. 17Kovach M.E. Phillips R.W. Elzer P.H. Roop II, R.M. Peterson K.M. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 800-802Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. V. Rangaswami, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India) to create pBBRUgi and pBBRUgi-oc36, respectively. Transcription of ugi gene in these plasmids in P. aeruginosa is driven by a fortuitous promoter. For introduction of ugi gene into the L5 integration site in M. smegmatis, pTZUgi (18Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI, treated with Klenow DNA polymerase, and subjected to digestion with HindIII after heat inactivation. The DNA fragment containing ugi ORF was then cloned between a blunt-ended BamHI and HindIII sites of pTKmt (19Dastur A. Kumar P. Ramesh S. Vasanthakrishna M. Varshney U. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 288-296Google Scholar), downstream of metU promoter to generate pTKmtUgi. The pTKmtUgi was digested with EcoRI and HindIII to release a DNA fragment containing ugi along with the metU promoter, end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase, and cloned at the DraI site of pDK20 (20DasGupta S.K. Jain S. Kaushal D. Tyagi A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 797-804Google Scholar) to generate pDKUgi. Integration of ugi into the L5 att Site of M. smegmatis mc2155— M. smegmatis mc2155 was transformed with pDKUgi, a non-replicative vector (in mycobacteria) containing the L5 att sequence, and plated on LBT-agar containing kanamycin. Transformants that arose contained the whole plasmid inserted into the L5 att site in the chromosome (20DasGupta S.K. Jain S. Kaushal D. Tyagi A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 797-804Google Scholar). The targeted gene knockout strategy using pPR27 containing a thermosensitive origin of replication of pAL5000 and sacB counter-selective marker was used (21Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of M. smegmatis ung gene and its flanking regions was obtained from The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) web site (www.tigr.org) to design FP1 and RP1 primers (Table I) for amplification of ∼2.2-kb DNA containing 827 and 663 bp upstream and downstream, respectively, of ung ORF (684 bp). The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, 30 cycles of incubations at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4.5 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was digested with BclI and cloned into the BamHI site of pPR27 to yield pPRmsUng. Subsequently, a kanR (aph) cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was excised by digestion with BamHI and mobilized into the unique BamHI site present in the active site region of the ung (pPRmsUng) to generate pPRmsUng::aph. The latter construct was introduced into M. smegmatis by electroporation (22Hatfull G.F. Jacobs W.B. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 313-320Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected at 32 °C on LBT agar plates in the presence of gentamycin and kanamycin. Several transformants were grown at 32 °C in 7H9 medium containing kanamycin and plated on to 7H10 agar containing kanamycin and sucrose at 39 °C. The isolates were further screened for disruption of the chromosomal ung. Cell-free extracts were prepared from the putative ung– isolates (23Vasanthakrishna M. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3591-3598Google Scholar) and assayed for Ung activity. Subsequently, the genomic DNA from the isolates was analyzed by PCR using FP2 and RP2 primers (Table I, Fig. 4A), corresponding to the ung locus, and Taq DNA polymerase. For PCR, DNA samples were heated at 94 °C for 4 min and subjected to 30 cycles of incubations at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Genomic DNAs (2.5–5 μg) were digested with an excess of restriction enzymes (20 units), separated on a 0.7% agarose gel using Tris-buffered EDTA, transferred (24Reed K.C. Mann D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Google Scholar) to Hybond-NX membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to hybridization (23Vasanthakrishna M. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3591-3598Google Scholar) with a radiolabeled probe against the ung gene of M. smegmatis. The radiolabeled probe was made in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP by a PCR-based method using FP2 and RP3 primers (Table I, Fig. 4C). Cell-free extracts were prepared from log phase cultures by sonication of M. smegmatis cells (23Vasanthakrishna M. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3591-3598Google Scholar) or gentle lysis of E. coli and P. aeruginosa cells (25Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Google Scholar) and quantified (26Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Google Scholar). Uracil containing synthetic DNA (SSU9, Table I) was 5′ end-labeled and used in Ung assays (27Acharya N. Varshney U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1251-1264Google Scholar). For detection of Ugi expression in E. coli, total cell extracts (100 μg) were separated on native PAGE (15%) gels, which allow a discrete separation between the free EcoUng (pI 6.6) and the EcoUng·Ugi (pI 4.9) complex. The EcoUng·Ugi complex was then detected by immunoblotting using anti-EcoUng antibodies (18Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Google Scholar). Detection of Ugi expression in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis was also based on the ability of Ugi to sequester EcoUng into a complex. Total cellular proteins (200 or 300 μg for P. aeruginosa or M. smegmatis, respectively, for each treatment) were subjected to thermal denaturation (15Acharya N. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 579-590Google Scholar). Unlike Ung and most other cellular proteins, Ugi is thermostable and fully refolds to its native structure upon cooling (28Reddy G.B. Purnapatre K. Lawrence R. Roy S. Varshney U. Surolia A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 610-617Google Scholar), and it is highly efficient in forming a complex with Ung. The supernatant of the thermally denatured protein extract was used as source of Ugi and incubated with EcoUng (50–200 ng) for 15 min at room temperature followed by 10 min on ice. The samples were then analyzed as above by immunoblotting of the proteins separated on native PAGE. Isolated colonies from plates were inoculated into broth media and grown to early stationary phase (10–12 h for E. coli and P. aeruginosa and 48 h for M. smegmatis). Cells from 1-ml cultures were spread in duplicate on solid media containing rifampicin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for E. coli and M. smegmatis cultures and 100 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa cultures. Total viable counts in the culture were determined by dilution plating. Mutation frequencies were calculated as the number of colonies (RifR) that appeared on rifampicin-containing media divided by the total viable counts of the bacteria plated. Cultures were started with 0.1% inoculum from freshly prepared saturated cultures. The growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa in LB was monitored at different initial pH values (7.2, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5) of the media with or without 1 mm NaNO2 at 37 °C for up to 11 h. The growth curves of M. smegmatis in LBT with or without 0.2 mm NaNO2 were obtained in the same manner except that the growth was monitored for up to 48 h. The NaNO2 was supplemented to the medium from a filter sterilized stock before inoculation. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and infected by P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis as described (29Morissette C. Francoeur C. Darmond-Zwaig C. Gervais F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4984-4992Google Scholar, 30Rastogi N. Labrousse V. de Sousa J.P. Curr. Microbiol. 1992; 25: 203-213Google Scholar). In brief, the infection assays were as follows. Macrophage Infection Assays with M. smegmatis—Bacteria were opsonized with guinea pig serum, washed with RPMI 1640, and used at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Macrophages (1 × 106) were allowed to adhere for 24 h in a 24-well tissue culture plate in RPMI with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were washed with 0.2% FCS-RPMI, incubated with opsonized M. smegmatis for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in the same medium to allow macrophages to phagocytose and internalize the bacteria, and washed three times with 0.2% FCS-RPMI to remove extracellular bacteria. Cells infected with M. smegmatis were incubated for a further period of 0.5 h in 0.2% FCS-RPMI containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin and washed again three times with 0.2% FCS-RPMI to remove antibiotics. This was considered time 0 of sample collection, and further incubations were for 24, 48, and 72 h in 5% FCS-RPMI. At the end of the incubations, macrophages were subjected to lysis with 0.25 ml of 0.25% SDS supplemented with 0.25 ml RPMI, and the total viable counts of the internalized bacteria were determined by dilution plating. Control experiments wherein bacteria alone or macrophages alone were treated the same were also carried out. No viable counts were detected in these controls. For experiments with stimulated macrophages, cells were treated with 1 unit/ml interferon γ (IFNγ) during adherence to the plates. Macrophage Infection Assays with P. aeruginosa—These were the same as described above except that the wells seeded with 0.5 × 106 macrophages were infected for 0.5 h with P. aeruginosa opsonized with fetal calf serum, washings were done with 0.2% FCS-RPMI without antibiotics, and the post-washing incubations were done either for 0 or 1.5 h in the absence of antibiotics, after which the macrophages were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.01% BSA in distilled water. Nitric oxide secretion was determined by measuring the accumulation of nitrite ( NO2−), a stable metabolite of the reaction of nitric oxide with oxygen. Briefly, macrophage culture supernatants (100 μl) were added to a 96-well flat-bottomed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate in duplicate, supplemented with an equal volume of the Griess reagent (0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% n-1-naphthylethylenediamine hydrochloride in 2.5% phosphoric acid, Ref. 31Stuehr D.J. Gross S.S. Sakuma I. Levi R. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1011-1020Google Scholar), incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and spectrophotometrically measured at 550 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. All experiments involving macrophage infections and nitric oxide estimation were statistically analyzed for significance using Student's t test. Comparison of Primary Sequences of Ung Proteins—Primary sequences of Ung proteins from P. aeruginosa (Pae) and M. smegmatis (Msm), E. coli (Eco), human (Hu), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are shown in Fig. 1. The comparison shows a high degree of similarity and identity of 63.5 and 55.9% for the Eco-/Pae-Ung pair and 50.4 and 43.8% for the Eco-/Msm-Ung pair, respectively. Both proteins possess all the conserved motifs such as the water-activating loop, 62-GQDPY-66; the Pro-Ser loop, 84-AIPPS-88; the uracil specificity pocket, 120-LLLN-123; and the DNA intercalation loop, 187-HPSPLS-192 (numbering according to EcoUng). These motifs are characteristic of Ung proteins and lie at the interface with Ugi in the Ung-Ugi complexes (32Savva R. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 752-755Google Scholar, 33Mol C.D.

Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Google Scholar). Furthermore, a closer analysis (Fig. 1) shows that in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis-Ung proteins, the majority of the functional equivalents of the crucial amino acids that interact with Ugi are also conserved. Expression of Ugi in E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and M. smegmatis and Inactivation of Ung Activity—Expression of Ugi in B. subtilis by phage PBS-1 and -2 as an early gene product allows these uracil containing DNA phages to survive and replicate in the host that is genotypically ung+ (36Friedberg E.C. Ganesan A.K. Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Google Scholar). More recently, expression of Ugi in a chicken B cell line, DT40 rendered them Ung– (37Noia J.D. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 43-48Google Scholar). Hence, in one of the approaches to obtain Ung– phenotype, we expressed Ugi in these bacteria. The indirect immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2, wherein Ugi is detected as EcoUng·Ugi complex, see “Materials and Methods”) shows that introduction of multicopy ugi expression vectors in E. coli (pTrcUgi) and P. aeruginosa (pBBRUgi) resulted in production of Ugi (lanes 4, Figs. 2, A and B, respectively). The band corresponding to EcoUng·Ugi was not present in the transformants harboring vector alone (lanes 2) or the Ugi-oc36 mutant (lanes 3) that does not form a complex with Ung (15Acharya N. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 579-590Google Scholar). However, a similar approach of expression of Ugi in M. smegmatis from a mycobacterial plasmid (pTKUgi), most likely because of the vector instability effects, resulted in inconsistent observations (data not shown). Therefore, to abrogate Ung activity in this organism, we cloned the ugi ORF downstream of a mycobacterial promoter (metU (19Dastur A. Kumar P. Ramesh S. Vasanthakrishna M. Varshney U. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 288-296Google Scholar)) in pDKUgi and integrated it as a single copy gene into the L5 attachment (att) site of M. smegmatis genome. As detected by the indirect immunoblot analysis, this strain resulted in consistent expression of Ugi (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5). To ascertain that expression of Ugi in these organisms resulted in abolition of Ung activity, assays were performed in the cell-free extracts of the various strains, using a 5′ 32P-labeled uracil containing synthetic DNA oligomer (SSU9) as substrate (S). Uracil excision by Ung generates an apyrimidinic site in the DNA oligomer, which is sensitive to alkaline conditions and results in two fragments, one of which (32P-labeled) is detected as faster migrating product band (P) upon gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 3, expression of Ugi in E. coli (panel A, lanes 9–11), P. aeruginosa (panel B, lanes 9–11), and M. smegmatis (panel C, lanes 6–8) resulted in undetectable Ung activities as opposed to the extracts of bacteria harboring vector alone (lanes 3–5 in all panels) or the Ugi-oc36 mutant (lanes 6–8 in panels A and B). ung Gene Knockout in M. smegmatis and Ung Assays—Because in M. smegmatis expression of Ugi was achieved from a single copy of the chromosomally inserted gene of ugi (L5att::pDKUgi), we employed a yet another approach to deplete Ung activity in this organism. This approach involved disruption of the ung gene by insertion of a 1.264-kb kanamycin resistance cassette (aph) into the active site region. Amplification of a 1.384-kb DNA (Fig. 4B, lane 1) from the wild type strain and a 2.648-kb DNA from the knockout strains (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3) upon PCR with the primers flanking the ung gene are exactly as per the expectations (Fig. 4A) and show that the ung gene was disrupted by the kanamycin (aph) marker. Furthermore, the genomic blot analyses (Fig. 4, C and D) also show the bands of expected sizes of 1.822 kb (lane 1) versus 3.086 kb (lanes 2 and 3) in the EcoRV and 3.049 kb (lane 4) versus 4.313 kb (lanes 5 and 6) in the BclI digests of the DNA from wild type and the knockout strains, respectively. The presence of single bands corresponding to the ung plus aph cassette size in the knockout strains confirms the disrupted nature of the ung gene in the isolates. And as shown in Fig. 3C, lanes 9–11, the M. smegmatis strain with disrupted gene (ung::aph) did not contain any detectable Ung activity. It may also be mentioned that susceptibility of M. smegmatis DNA to restriction by BclI (Fig. 4D, lanes 5 and 6) further confirms an earlier report (38Hemavathy K.C. Nagaraja V. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 11: 291-296Google Scholar) of the absence of methylation at GATC (Dam) sequences in this bacterium. Effect of Depletion of Ung Activity in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis on the Appearance of Rifampicin Resistance— One of the consequences of the loss of a DNA repair enzyme is an increase in the rate of mutations in the organism. Hence, to investigate the consequence of the Ung– phenotype in P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis, we plated bacterial cultures on rifampicin-containing media and scored for rifampicin resistant (RifR) colonies. As shown in Table II, expression of Ugi in P. aeruginosa (pBBRUgi) resulted in an increase in the appearance of RifR colonies by ∼7-fold when compared with the vector alone (pBBR) control. We noticed that in P. aeruginosa but not in E. coli the Ugi mutant (Ugi-oc36) offered a detectable protection over the vector alone control. Hence, the actual increase in the appearance of RifR colonies in P. aeruginosa upon Ugi expression may actually be more than 7-fold. In M. smegmatis (L5att::pDKUgi) ha"
https://openalex.org/W2137411441,"Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane constituents whose metabolites function as signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a key sphingolipid second messenger, regulates proliferation, motility, invasiveness, and programmed cell death. These effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate and similar phosphorylated sphingoid bases have been observed in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Intracellular levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate are tightly regulated by the actions of sphingosine kinase, which is responsible for its synthesis and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase and sphingosine phosphate lyase, the two enzymes responsible for its catabolism. In this study, we describe the cloning of the Caenorhabditis elegans sphingosine phosphate lyase gene along with its functional expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Promoter analysis indicates tissue-specific and developmental regulation of sphingosine phosphate lyase gene expression. Inhibition of C. elegans sphingosine phosphate lyase expression by RNA interference causes accumulation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated long-chain bases and leads to poor feeding, delayed growth, reproductive abnormalities, and intestinal damage similar to the effects seen with exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis toxin. Our results show that sphingosine phosphate lyase is an essential gene in C. elegans and suggest that the sphingolipid degradative pathway plays a conserved role in regulating animal development. Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane constituents whose metabolites function as signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a key sphingolipid second messenger, regulates proliferation, motility, invasiveness, and programmed cell death. These effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate and similar phosphorylated sphingoid bases have been observed in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Intracellular levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate are tightly regulated by the actions of sphingosine kinase, which is responsible for its synthesis and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase and sphingosine phosphate lyase, the two enzymes responsible for its catabolism.

Promoter analysis indicates tissue-specific and developmental regulation of sphingosine phosphate lyase gene expression. Inhibition of C. elegans sphingosine phosphate lyase expression by RNA interference causes accumulation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated long-chain bases and leads to poor feeding, delayed growth, reproductive abnormalities, and intestinal damage similar to the effects seen with exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis toxin. Our results show that sphingosine phosphate lyase is an essential gene in C. elegans and suggest that the sphingolipid degradative pathway plays a conserved role in regulating animal development. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis are critical to embryogenesis. Elucidating the signal transduction pathways that regulate these cellular processes can lead to insights into normal animal development and the pathophysiology of developmental diseases.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 236-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). S1P is unique in its ability to function in two signaling capacities, first as an intracellular second messenger and second as a ligand for a subset of G protein-coupled cell surface receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) family (3Brownlee C.

Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is substantial evidence to support the existence of a “sphingolipid rheostat” whereby cell fate decisions are determined by the ratio of intracellular levels of S1P, a known proliferative stimulus, and ceramide, an inducer of apoptosis (5Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Intracellular levels of S1P are controlled by its synthesis, catabolism, and export to the extracellular space. Sphingosine kinase (SK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, generating S1P (6Buehrer B. Bell R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). SK activity increases in response to a variety of inducers, including fetal calf serum, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, muscarinic acetylcholine agonists, tumor necrosis factor α, and cross-linking of the FcγRI and FcϵRI immunoglobulin receptors (7Olivera A.

Sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL) catalyzes the cleavage of S1P at the C2–3 carbon bond to yield a long-chain aldehyde and ethanolamine phosphate (14Van Veldhoven P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SPL is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent member of the carbon-carbon lyase subclass of aldehydelyases. The reaction proceeds optimally at pH 7.4–7.6, requires chelators due to sensitivity toward heavy metal ions, and is irreversible (15Stoffel W. LeKim D. Sticht G. Hoppe-Seylers Z Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SPL activity is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, with the notable exception of platelets, in which SPL activity is absent. Although modulation of S1P levels is considered the major biological function of this enzyme, the products of the reaction can contribute to synthesis of both fatty acids and phospholipids and have been shown to regulate sterol regulatory element binding protein processing in Drosophila melanogaster, indicating that the effects of this enzyme on lipid metabolism and biology may be broader than previously appreciated (16Dobrosotskaya I. Seegmiller A. Brown M. Goldstein J. Rawson R. Science. 2002; 296: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). SPL was first identified through a genetic screen for sphingosine resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Saba J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Subsequently, functional SPL homologs of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens were cloned and characterized (18Zhou J. Saba J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Van Veldhoven P.P. Gijsbers S. Mannaerts G.P. Vermeesch J.R. Brys V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, predicted protein sequences demonstrating significant homology to known SPL proteins in D. melanogaster, Neurospora crassa, Dictyostelium discoideum, Danio rerio, and Arabidopsis thalliensis have been identified, indicating that SPL may be highly conserved. In addition to its degradation by SPL, S1P can be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine. Enzymes capable of catalyzing the dephosphorylation of S1P comprise two groups, the S1P phosphatases, which demonstrate sphingoid base substrate specificity, and a family of lipid phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating various substrates, including lysophosphatidic acid, S1P, and phosphatidic acid (20Brindley D. Xu J. Jasinska R. Waggoner D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Knowledge of SPL, SK, and S1P phosphatase gene sequences from a variety of genetically tractable organisms has made possible the use of both forward and reverse genetic approaches to elucidate the role of sphingolipid metabolism in animal development. Recent studies have implicated roles for both S1P and SPL in the developmental processes of different species, including slime mold, zebrafish, and mouse (23Li G. Foote C. Alexander S. Alexander H. Development. 2001; 128: 3473-3483PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stanier D. Nature. 2000; 406: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 25Liu Y. Wada R.

Invest. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified the gene encoding Caenorhabditis elegans SPL using nucleotide sequence homology and complementation of a yeast SPL mutant. SPL promoter analysis using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs indicates tissue specific and developmental regulation of the SPL gene. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to investigate the importance of SPL in regulating metabolism of sphingolipid signaling molecules and the role of SPL in vivo during development and in the adult worm. Our results demonstrate that C. elegans SPL expression is localized to intestinal cells and that interference with SPL expression leads to accumulation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated long-chain bases. Furthermore, inhibiting SPL expression results in severe intestinal damage, egg laying defects, and semi-lethality. These studies demonstrate the importance of SPL in maintaining tight regulation of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites and indicate that SPL expression has a role in normal gut and reproductive physiology, representing a first step toward understanding the biological importance of the sphingolipid degradative pathway in more complex animals, including humans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of C. elegans SPL—Two open reading frames (gi1226312 = B0222.4; gi3801005 = Y66H1B.4) with significant homology to the S. cerevisae SPL gene were identified in the C. elegans genome by BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base (17Saba J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Both these open reading frames were reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR from total C. elegans RNA using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) and the DNA primer pairs 5′-B0222.4 and 3′-B0222.4, and 5′-Y66H1B.4 and 3′-Y66H1B.4 (Table I).Table IPrimers used in these experimentsPrimer namePrimer sequence5′-B0222.45′-GATCGAATTCACAGAATAAAATGGATTTTGCACTGGAGC-3′3′-B0222.45′-GACTGAATTCAGCACTTCACTCTG TTAAAGCATAAACAGCA-3′5′-Y66H1B.45′-GAGGAATTCATGGATTCGGTTAAGCACACAACCG-3′3′-Y66H1B.45′-AGCCTCGAGTTAATTAGAAGTT GAAGGTGGAGC-3′5′-T07A9.15′-GAGAATTCATGGAATCGATATCACGTTCG-3′3′-T07A9.15′-AGGGGCTCGAGTTAAAATGATTTTAAAAAATTG-3′PstIY66H1B.45′-TTTACTGCAGCATTTCTACTCCAC-3′SmaIY66H1B.45′-CGAATCCCGGGTAACCTGAAAA-3′PstIT07A9.15′-TTAATCTGCAGAAAGCAATGGGAATCGTGAGAATC-3′SmaIT07A9.15′-TCGTTCCCGGGTATTCGGACAATCAGGTGCTCCAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab After restriction enzyme digestion, the resulting cDNA fragments were cloned into EcoRI (B0222.4) and EcoRI and XhoI (Y66H1B.4) sites of the pYES2 yeast shuttle vector (Invitrogen). The resulting galactose-inducible constructs pYES2-B0222.4 and pYES2-Y66H1B.4 were evaluated for ability to functionally and biochemically complement relevant S. cerevisiae mutant strains. For injected RNAi studies in C. elegans, the B0222.4 and Y66H1B.4 sequences were cloned into pBluescript at the EcoRI and EcoRI/XhoI sites, respectively. Additionally, cDNA of the T07A9.1 gene, which is immediately upstream of Y66H1B.4 on chromosome IV, was amplified by RT-PCR using the DNA primer pair 5′-T07A9 and 3′-T07A9, and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pBluescript (+ or –) at EcoRI and XhoI sites. RNA was produced from the resulting plasmids pBS-B0222.4, pBS-Y66H1B.4, and pBS-cT07A9.1 as described below.Generation and Expression of C. elegans Reporter Gene Constructs— For transcriptional reporter constructs, a promoter region of 512 nucleotides of Y66H1B.4 upstream untranslated sequence corresponding to a position –3 to –515 relative to the ATG start codon was generated by PCR from T07A9 cosmid template DNA using Vent DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) and the primer pair PstIY66H1B and SmaIY66H1B. Similarly, a promoter region of 3949 nucleotides of T07A9.1 upstream untranslated sequence corresponding to a position –2 to –3951 relative to the ATG start codon was generated by PCR from T07A9 cosmid template DNA using the primer pair PstIT07A9 and SmaIT07A9. Following restriction enzyme digestion, these PCR products were cloned into PstI and SmaI sites of the GFP reporter plasmids pPD95.75 and pPD95.67 (gifts of A. Fire and B. Meyer). The resulting constructs, pY66H1B.4.75, pY66H1B.4.67, pT07A9.1.75, and pT07A9.1.67, were used in transgenic experiments.Creation of Transgenic Animals—Transformation of C. elegans dpy-20(e1362) worms with reporter constructs was performed by microinjection of plasmid DNA into the distal arm of the hermaphrodite gonad as described previously (26Montgomery M. Xu S. Fire A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15502-15507Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 27Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M. Kostas S. Driver S. Mello C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar). Reporter construct DNA was co-injected with plasmid pMH86, allowing the recognition of transformants by rescue of the Dpy phenotype (28Han M. Sternberg P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two independently derived stable lines for each construct were analyzed, PS4246 dpy-20(e1362); syEx561[pMH86,pY66H1B.4.75] and PS4247 dpy-20(e1362); syEx562[pMH86,pY66H1B.4.67]. GFP was visualized by mounting live transgenic nematodes on 5% agarose 0.01% sodium azide and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop) using a Chroma High Q GFP long pass filter set (450-nm excitation and 505-nm emission).Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Strain JSK133, a derivative of JK9–3d containing a dpl1::TRP1 allele, was transformed with pYES2 vector control, pYES2-DPL1, pYES2-B0222.4, and pYES2-Y66H1B.4 using the lithium acetate method (see Table II) (29Ito H. Iukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were isolated by uracil prototrophy. Cells were grown in uracil media containing 20 g/liter of either glucose or galactose. Sphingosine resistance was analyzed using a dilutional assay, as previously reported (17Saba J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cells were also plated onto standard YEPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) media as a control. Sphingosine-enriched plates were made with minimal media containing 0.0015% Nonidet P-40 and 50 μmd-erythro-sphingosine. At this concentration of Nonidet P-40, no effects on cell viability are observed.Table IIYeast strains used in these experimentsNameRelevant genotypeJSK133a dp1::TrpJS200a dp11::Trp [pYES2-B0222.4 (URA3)]JS201a dp11::Trp [pYES2-Y66H1B.4 (URA3)]JS203a dp11::Trp [pYES2-DPL1 (URA3)] Open table in a new tab SPL Assay—Yeast strains of interest were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.0) in uracil media containing galactose as a carbon source. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (17Saba J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), adjusted for protein concentration, and evaluated for SPL activity as described using as substrate [3H]dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) (30Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, worms propagated on Escherichia coli HB101 strain carrying either no vector or a Y66H1B.4 RNAi feeding construct were harvested, washed in M9 and SPL extraction buffer, homogenized using a Wheaton glass homogenizer, adjusted for protein concentration and evaluated for SPL activity as above. Extracts containing only denatured proteins were prepared by boiling for 5 min.Worm Propagation and Collection of Staged Animals—Worms were grown under standard conditions in nematode growth medium (31Epstein H. Shakes D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To synchronize C. elegans cultures worms were grown in liquid culture, treated with alkaline hypochlorite treatment, resuspended in S basal media, and harvested at various time points to obtain L4 larvae for feeding experiments described below.RNA Interference by Injection—The B0222.4, Y66H1B.4, and T07A9.1 cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript in the multiple cloning site. RNA complementary to each strand was synthesized using T3 and T7 promoter regions and an in vitro transcription kit (Promega). The two strands were annealed to make double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and injected into the distal gonads of 12 wild-type (N2 Bristol) young adult C. elegans hermaphrodites as described (27Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M. Kostas S. Driver S. Mello C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar). Uninjected hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites injected with a control dsRNA were handled in parallel as controls. Eight hours after injection, each hermaphrodite was transferred to a fresh culture plate, and 12-h cohorts of F1 progeny were established. Progeny were examined daily with a dissecting microscope and by Nomarski microscopy (Zeiss Axioscop) until most animals reached adulthood and culture plates became too crowded with F2 progeny (32Guo S. Kemphues K. Cell. 1995; 81: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar).RNA Interference by Ingestion—Wild-type (N2 Bristol) L4 larvae were plated on E. coli strain HB101 carrying an L440 plasmid containing the Y66H1B.4 insert (kind gift of Julie Ahringer, Cambridge, UK) (33Fraser A. Kamath R. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 34Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). This plasmid expresses the corresponding target gene dsRNA when induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). L4 worms were fed and allowed to lay eggs, as described previously (35Kamath R. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A. Ahringer J. Genome Biology. 2002; (http://genomebiology.com/2000/2/1/RESEARCH/0002): 2Google Scholar). Progeny were harvested and evaluated by microscopy and biochemical analysis, as described above.Labeling of C. elegans Lipids—Worms were treated by RNAi by ingestion as described above, except that worms were plated on IPTG plates at the L1 stage and were harvested at L4 to adult stage. Worms were then collected by scraping and resuspended in 1 ml of S basal media containing 50 μm [3H]serine (100 μCi/ml) and incubated for 4 h at 20 °C. Following incubation the volume was brought up to 50 ml with M9 buffer, and worms were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded, and worms were washed two times with 50 ml of M9 buffer each time. Washed worms were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized until a flaky powder was obtained. Lyophilized worms were stored at –80 °C until used.Preparation and Analysis of C. elegans Lipid Extracts—A sample containing 15 mg of lyophilized worms was placed in a glass tube, and 2 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v), was added to the tube. The sample was homogenized by tip sonication (5 × 20 s) while on ice and then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was recovered, and a second extraction was performed on the pellet. The two supernatants were pooled and dried down in a Speed Vac. Lipid extract was resuspended in 400 μl of 1.5 m ammonium hydroxide by tip sonication, and 2 ml of chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), was added while vortexing. The sample was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to obtain a clear separation of the two phases. Both phases were recovered and dried down in a Speed Vac. To compare the efficiency of the homogenization and extraction procedure between different samples, the total amount of phosphatidylcholine present in the organic phase was determined following phospholipase B treatment (Waco Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Lipid equivalent to 250 μg of phosphatidylcholine was removed for TLC analysis. Lipid groups were separated by running TLC (Silica Gel HL, 20 × 20 cm, Analtech, Newark, DE) and identified based on known standards. Different solvent systems were applied. Phospholipids were analyzed by applying 10–20% of the organic phase to a TLC plate followed by a separation using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/glacial acidic acid/0.9% sodium chloride, 20:10:3.2:1 (v/v, solvent system A). The remainder of the organic phase was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C in 400 μl of methanol containing 0.1 m potassium hydroxide. Following hydrolysis the lipids were dried down, resuspended in chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), and applied to a TLC plate. Lipids were separated using two-dimensional TLC. Plates were developed in the first dimension using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/4.2 m ammonium hydroxide, 9:7:2 (v/v, solvent system B) followed by a separation in the second dimension using solvent system A. Spots corresponding to sphingoid bases and ceramide were identified. Phosphorylated sphingoid bases obtained in the water phase were analyzed using the same two-dimensional TLC procedure. Aliquots were taken out throughout the homogenization and extraction procedures and evaluated for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Spots corresponding to lipids of interest were scraped from the TLC plates and counted for radioactivity.RESULTSIdentification of C. elegans SPL—Based on a BLASTP search of the GenBank™ data base against the DPL1 (dihydrosphingosine phosphate lyase) gene sequence of S. cerevisiae, two open reading frames were identified in the C. elegans genome. Open reading frame B0222.4 on cosmid B0222 (representing a portion of chromosome V) had been predicted to encode a glutamate decarboxylase. Predicted coding sequence Y66H1B.4 was identified on yeast artificial chromosome Y66H1B (representing a portion of chromosome IV) and is noted to contain a conserved pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylase domain. No experimental evidence for the function of either gene was available. These two sequences are 39% identical and 60% similar to one another. Y66H1B.4 is slightly more similar to the SPL protein sequences of S. cerevisiae and Homo sapiens (40% identical to DPL1 and 41% identical to human SPL) compared with B0222.4 (36% identical to DPL1 and 38% identical to human SPL). In each case, the region of similarity spans nearly the entire length of each protein sequence. A predicted pyridoxal 5′-phosphate binding lysine (shown in Fig. 1) is present in both B0222.4 and Y66H1B.4. However, eliminating the conserved region surrounding this lysine from the comparison did not significantly affect the overall sequence similarity. To determine whether B0222.4 and/or Y66H1B.4 encode a functional SPL, cDNA from each transcript was created by reverse transcription from total C. elegans RNA, amplified by PCR, and cloned into the pYES2 yeast shuttle vector, in which genes are induced in the presence of galactose. Both constructs were then transformed into a haploid S. cerevisiae strain containing a null dpl1 allele, the sole endogenous SPL gene of this organism. This strain is extremely sensitive to the presence of d-erythro-sphingosine in the media due to an inability to catabolize this lipid. When active SPL proteins are expressed in this background, sphingosine sensitivity is abrogated. As shown in Fig. 2A, Y66H1B.4 expression in media containing galactose afforded substantial growth of the dpl1 strain on sphingosine, whereas B0222.4 expression supported only marginal growth (Fig. 2B). To determine whether B0222.4 and/or Y66H1B.4 were capable of restoring SPL activity to the dpl1 mutant, whole cell extracts of dpl1 strains expressing either Y66H1B.4 or B0222.4 were prepared and evaluated for activity against a radioactive dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate substrate. Although Y66H1B.4 expression restored SPL activity to the dpl1 strain, B0222.4 did not (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that Y66H1B.4 encodes the C. elegans SPL, and we have renamed this gene spl-1.Fig. 2Complementation of a yeast SPL mutant. A, functional complementation by Y66H1B.4 of yeast strain JSK133, which contains a null allele of the endogenous yeast SPL, DPL1. Saturated cultures of JSK133 transformed with pYES2 vector (dpl1 + vector) or with pYES2-Y66H1B.4 (dpl1+ Y66H1B.4) were adjusted for A600 = 5 and serially diluted as indicated. Cells were template-inoculated onto YEPD plates or plates containing sphingosine and galactose as a carbon source, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, same as above, except that strains include wild type, JSK133 plus vector, JSK133 plus pYES2-B0222.4 (dpl1 + B0222.4), and JSK133 plus pYES2-DPL1 (dpl1 + DPL1). This is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3SPL activity of Y66H1B.4 expressed in yeast. Whole cell extracts of yeast strains were evaluated for SPL activity. Relative and absolute SPL activities are shown for Y66H1B.4. For dpl1 versus dpl1 (Y66H1B.4), p < 0.003. This is representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)C. elegans SPL Is Expressed in a Tissue-specific Manner— The organization of the spl-1 gene is shown in Fig. 4. The coding region of spl-1 resides within a 3.2-kb sequence containing 10 exons and 9 introns on chromosome IV. The intragenic region between spl-1 and its nearest 5′ neighbor (hypothetical gene T07A9.1) is 521 nucleotides. Due to the small size of this region, Wormbase (available at www.wormbase.org) predicts that spl-1 may be a downstream gene in an operon with T07A9.1. Therefore, to evaluate gene expression from the spl-1 locus, GFP reporter constructs were created from both potential regulatory regions, which are located immediately 5′ to spl-1 and to the large intragenic region upstream of T07A9.1. Reporter constructs with and without nuclear localization sequences were created to aid in interpretation of the fluorescent signal. Reporter constructs and dpy-20+ plasmid pMH86 were simultaneously microinjected into the distal arm of the hermaphrodite gonad of dpy-20(e1362) worms. Transformants were identified by rescue of the Dpy phenotype (28Han M. Sternberg P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lines in which the F2 and subsequent generations demonstrated the rescue phenotype were considered stable and were analyzed for GFP expression. As shown in Fig. 5, GFP expression under regulation of the spl-1 immediate upstream region was pronounced and localized almost exclusively in the intestine. All cells of the intestine expressed spl-1. In line PS4246, which transmits the non-Dpy phenotype at 98%, most animals demonstrated a fluorescent signal in the region just posterior to the pharynx with no expression in the rest of the anterior gut. Strong expression was also observed in the posterior gut of most animals. No expression was detected in the gonad, body-wall muscle, pharynx, vulva, or epidermis. Although a low percentage of animals showed s"

(1998) FEBS Lett. 424, 63–68). MUPP1 PDZ domain 10 (PDZ 10) associates with Ser458-Ser-Val at the carboxyl-terminal tail of the 5-HT2C R. Both Ser458 and Ser459 are phosphorylated upon serotonin stimulation of the receptor (Backstrom, J. R., Price, R. D., Reasoner, D. T., and Sanders-Bush, E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23620–23626). To investigate whether phosphorylation of these serines in the receptor regulates MUPP1 interaction, we used several approaches. First, we substituted the serines in the receptor carboxyl tail with aspartates to mimic phosphorylation (S458D, S459D, or S458D/S459D). Pull-down assays demonstrated that Asp mutations at Ser458 significantly decreased receptor tail interaction with PDZ 10. Next, serotonin treatment of 5-HT2C R/3T3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of receptor interaction with PDZ 10. Effects of serotonin on receptor-PDZ 10 binding could be blocked by pretreatment with a receptor antagonist. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reverses the effect of serotonin, indicating that agonist-induced phosphorylation at Ser458 resulted in a loss of MUPP1 association and also revealed a significant amount of basal phosphorylation of the receptor. We conclude that 5-HT2C R interaction with MUPP1 is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at Ser458.

PDZ domains (or GLGF repeats) were named after three proteins identified over a decade ago: postsynaptic density-95, Drosophila Discs large, and zonula occludens-1 (3Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Most MAGUK proteins contain three PDZ domains, an Src homology 2 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain, each having different cellular roles. PDZ domains range from 80 to 100 amino acids in length and typically bind to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of target proteins including receptors, channels, and various signaling molecules to regulate subcellular localization, trafficking, recycling, and/or signaling (6Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 7Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol.

MUPP1, a protein containing 13 putative PDZ domains, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that bound to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the 5-HT2C R (1Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MUPP1 is expressed in many tissues, whereas the 5-HT2C R is a brain-specific protein (1Ullmer C. Schmuck K.

Science. 1988; 241: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The 5-HT2C R has classically been thought to couple to Gq activation; however, additional G protein families have been implicated, leading to the activation of different downstream signaling pathways including phospholipase A2, C, or D, and various cation channels (12Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Mayer S.E. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 991-996PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaufman M.J.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since PDZ-containing proteins can scaffold many signaling molecules together into a signal transduction complex, the interaction between MUPP1 and the 5-HT2C R was further investigated. The 5-HT2C R contains a PDZ binding motif, Ser458-Ser-Val, at its extreme carboxyl terminus, which is critical for interaction with PDZ 10 of MUPP1 (18Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A. Peles E. Bockaert J. Lubbert H. Ullmer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12974-12982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In an alternate approach to the yeast two-hybrid system, we independently show that PDZ 10 of MUPP1 is the primary site of interaction for the 5-HT2C R. Serotonin stimulation has previously been shown to promote phosphorylation of the two serine residues of the 5-HT2C R PDZ binding motif, Ser458 and Ser459 (2Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal serines of the 5-HT2C R regulates receptor interaction with MUPP1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether a modification of Ser458 and/or Ser459 of the 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail would alter PDZ 10 interaction. Ser458 and/or Ser459 of the receptor tail were mutated to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation (i.e. introduction of a negative charge). Next, cells expressing 5-HT2C Rs were treated with agonist or antagonist to assess the interaction of the 5-HT2C R with MUPP1. The results of these experiments support our hypothesis that phosphorylation is a key regulator of 5-HT2C R interaction with MUPP1. Furthermore, the results indicated that a significant amount of basal phosphorylation of the receptor may also play a yet undetermined role in regulating PDZ-protein interactions. Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies against amino acids 419–435 (amino acids RHTNERVARKANDPEPG) of the rat 5-HT2C R were generated as described previously (19Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Overlapping regions of MUPP1 containing two or three PDZ domains (Fig. 1), or one PDZ domain (PDZ 9, 10, or 11) were generated by reverse transcription-PCR, sequenced, and subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GST fusion proteins. MUPP1 PDZ 9, 10, or 11 were also subcloned into pGEMEX-1 (Promega), a T7 gene 10 fusion protein vector. MUPP1 PDZ 9–11 was also subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail (last 60 amino acids) with or without the PDZ binding motif (Ser458-Ser-Val) and a truncation mutant at residue 445 were subcloned into pGEMEX-1. The 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail with the PDZ binding motif was also subcloned into pGEX-4T1. The 5-HT2C R carboxyl tail Ser458-Ser-Val (WT) was modified to S458A, S458D, S459D, or S458D/S459D by PCR site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into pGEMEX-1. Escherichia coli was transformed with pGEX-4T1 constructs, induced to overexpress fusion proteins with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and analyzed. Bacterial lysates were obtained by first adding cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamide, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to resuspend the pellets. Resuspended pellets were sonicated for 20 s on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE to confirm overexpressed GST fusion protein by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using GST antibodies. pGEMEX-1 constructs were used for coupled transcription and translation using the TnT® in vitro translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the supplier's protocol to generate 35S-labeled proteins. Ten micrograms of GST fusion proteins or GST were size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with freshly prepared 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Solution was then replaced with 35S-labeled fusion proteins in 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline buffer and incubated with nitrocellulose membranes for 16 h at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed three times for 20 min at room temperature in 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize radiolabeled proteins. Western blot analysis using GST antibodies was used to document similar GST protein levels. NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with the 5-HT2C R (5-HT2C R/3T3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) until confluent (20Barker E.L. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 725-730PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed four times with Hanks' buffered saline solution (with Ca2+/Mg2+) and then serum starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h. Cells were treated without or with antagonist (1 μm 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide (BOL)) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to serotonin addition for 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was then removed, 1 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, and cells were scraped from plates and placed in an Eppendorf tube on ice. Membrane extracts were obtained using 300 μl of Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Membrane protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were added to the affinity columns. Western blot analysis using GST antibodies was used to determine that similar levels of fusion protein were pulled down. Twenty microliters of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed three times with PD buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40). Ten micrograms of GST fusion proteins or GST were incubated with the washed glutathione beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Five microliters of 35S-labeled fusion proteins or 50 μg of membrane extracts were added to the GST-glutathione beads and incubated for 2–3 h or overnight, respectively, at 4 °C. After incubation, GST-glutathione beads were washed six times (for assays with 35S-labeled fusion proteins) or three times (for assays with membrane extracts) with PD buffer. For pull-downs from 5-HT2C R/3T3 cell lysates, precipitated protein, containing the 5-HT2C R, was treated with peptide:N-glycanase F before SDS-PAGE (see below). Loading dye (6% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol plus a little bromphenol blue) was added to elute proteins. Eluates were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Autoradiography or PhosphorImager screen was used to visualize radiolabeled proteins. Western blot analysis using GST and 5-HT2C R antibodies were used to document GST fusion proteins and 5-HT2C R, respectively. After serum starvation, cells were treated with 100 nm serotonin for 30 min at 37 °C. After treatment, medium was aspirated to remove the serotonin, and cells were washed four times with Hanks' buffered saline solution. Serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then added, and cells were incubated for 10 or 30 min. Cells were then lysed, and a pull-down assay was performed as mentioned above. This assay was performed as previously described by Backstrom et al. (2Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown to confluence were serum-starved and treated with increasing amounts of serotonin for 15 min at 37 °C. This incubation time was previously shown to be the minimal amount of time that would result in maximal receptor phosphorylation. Cells were then lysed, and membrane extracts containing receptors were prepared. Western blot analysis using 5-HT2C R antibodies were used to document changes in 40- and 41-kDa bands, representative of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated 5-HT2C R, respectively. Following pull-downs from membrane extracts, beads were pelleted and washed once with PD buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Fifteen microliters of PD buffer containing 1% SDS was added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 58 μl of PD buffer was added, and after mixing, 15 μl of PD buffer containing 10% Triton X-100 was added. Finally, 2 μl of peptide:N-glycanase F (Glyko or New England Biolabs) was added, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After deglycosylation, 15 μl of 4× loading dye were added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Membrane extracts (50 μg) of untreated or serotonin-treated cells were incubated in PD buffer plus 50 units of calf intestinal (alkaline) phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, pull-down assays were carried out as described above. Alkaline Phosphatase Detection—Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 1% BSA/Tris blot buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% NaN3)for1hat room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with GST (1:1000 dilution) or 5-HT2C R (3–5 μg/ml) antibodies in 1% BSA/Tris blot buffer for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with Tris blot buffer alone for 10 min. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Jackson Immunolaboratories) were incubated with membranes for2hat room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with Tris blot buffer and once with Tris (150 mm pH 9.4) and then developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Chemilluminescence Detection—Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 8% milk/Tween 20 Tris buffer solution (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with GST (1:4000 dilution) or 5-HT2C R (0.5 μg/ml) antibodies in 2% milk/Tween 20 Tris buffer solution overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed four times for 5 min with Tween 20 Tris buffer solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:20,000 dilution; Jackson Immunolaboratories) were incubated with membranes for 45 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times for 15 min with Tween 20 Tris buffer solution and developed with the Pierce Supersignal West Dura® kit according to the supplier's protocol. Horseradish peroxidase signal was analyzed by Bio-Rad Flouro-S, and densitometric analysis was performed by QuantityOne (Bio-Rad) software. All bar graph data was analyzed with Graphpad Prism one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-test; p < 0.05 is significant, unless otherwise noted in a figure legend. GST alone was the background control for all GST fusion protein experiments, and graph data presented are background-subtracted. Data represent the means ± S.D. from several independent experiments. The 5-HT2CReceptor Selectively Interacts with MUPP1 PDZ 10 —The carboxyl region of MUPP1 containing the last four PDZ domains (PDZ 10 to PDZ 13) was originally identified by yeast two-hybrid screening for 5-HT2C R-interacting proteins (1Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear which PDZ domain interacted with the 5-HT2C R. Therefore, we set out to identify which domain(s) of MUPP1 interacts with the 5-HT2C R. Overlapping PDZ domain regions of MUPP1 were generated as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1). Purified GST-MUPP1 PDZ domains were used to pull-down in vitro translated 35S-labeled 5-HT2C R carboxyl terminus fusion protein, which consists of the last 60 amino acids harboring a PDZ binding motif, Ser458-Ser-Val. Fig. 2A illustrates that significantly more receptor tail interacted with PDZ 9–11 and PDZ 9–13. A weak interaction of the receptor tail over GST alone was observed with PDZ 12 and 13, suggesting that PDZ 9–11 is the primary 5-HT2C R interacting region. In protein overlay assays, GST-MUPP1 PDZ domain fusion proteins were blotted and probed with 35S-labeled 5-HT2C R carboxyl terminus, and the 5-HT2C R tail specifically interacted with PDZ 9–11 and PDZ 9–13; no other PDZ domains displayed a significant interaction with the receptor tail (results not shown). Thus, both protein overlay and pull-down assays consistently indicate that PDZ 9–11 is responsible for interacting with the 5-HT2C R tail. To further determine the specific site of interaction, GST fusion proteins of the individual PDZ domains, 9, 10, and 11 were made (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, GST-PDZ 10 was unstable when overexpressed in bacteria. Therefore, the ability to pull down the 35S-labeled 5-HT2C R tail by GST-PDZ 9 or 11 was compared with GST-PDZ 9–11. GST fusion proteins of PDZ 9 or 11 alone were not able to bind to the receptor tail as compared with GST-PDZ 9–11, which contains PDZ 10 (data not shown). In a complementary pull-down experiment, the individual MUPP1 PDZ domains 9, 10, and 11 were in vitro translated with [35S]methionine and pulled down by the 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 2B). The carboxyl tail of the receptor specifically interacted with PDZ 10 and not PDZ domain 9 or 11, further supporting PDZ 10 as the interacting region for the receptor tail. Next, we questioned whether regions upstream of the extreme carboxyl terminus of the 5-HT2C R are able to confer binding to PDZ 10. To address this question, we generated GST fusion proteins of the 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail missing only the last three residues (Δ PDZ) and the 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail ending at residue 445 (i.e. missing the last 15 amino acids). In an overlay assay, [35S]PDZ 9–11 was incubated with the different GST-5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal tail fusion proteins. As illustrated in Fig. 3, PDZ 9–11 binds to WT but not the 5-HT2C R carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. Mutation of Ser458 in the 5-HT2CReceptor Reveals Altered PDZ 10 Interaction—Studies previously demonstrated that Ser458 and Ser459 at the extreme carboxyl tail of the 5-HT2C R, the same region of the receptor necessary for PDZ 10 binding, are phosphorylated upon ligand activation (2Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A function for Ser459 phosphorylation in receptor resensitization was proposed; however, the role for Ser458 phosphorylation is unknown. Based upon crystal structures of PDZ domains (21Doyle D.A.

Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), Ser458 of the 5-HT2C R is predicted to be a critical residue for interacting with PDZ 10. We therefore hypothesized that agonist-mediated phosphorylation of Ser458 disrupts the interaction of MUPP1 PDZ domain 10 and its target, the 5-HT2C R. To test this hypothesis, the serine residues in the receptor tail were replaced with aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation. The last two serine residues of the 5-HT2C R carboxyl tail (Ser458-Ser459) were modified by PCR site-directed mutagenesis to contain S458A, S458D, S459D, or S458D/S459D substitutions. Wild-type and mutated 5-HT2C R tails were labeled with [35S]methionine and incubated with GST-PDZ 9–11. 5-HT2C R tail mutants containing S458A, S458D, and S458D/S459D substitutions displayed a marked loss of interaction to PDZ 9–11 (Fig. 4A). The S459D mutation, however, retained an ability to interact similar to wild-type interaction (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that Ser458 is an important residue in determining the interaction with PDZ 10. Serotonin Treatment Decreases the Ability of the 5-HT2CReceptor to Interact with PDZ 10 —Results from the 5-HT2C R tail mutants raise the possibility of a dynamic regulation of the interaction between the 5-HT2C R and MUPP1. Thus, we investigated whether agonist stimulation of the 5-HT2C R stably expressed in NIH-3T3 cells would also result in a loss of MUPP1 interaction. To determine whether serotonin stimulation had any effect on MUPP1-receptor interaction, cells were incubated with increasing amounts of serotonin, which have been shown to promote receptor phosphorylation (2Backstrom J.R.

The ability of the 5-HT2C R to bind to PDZ 10 was assessed by pull-down assays. Fig. 5A shows that cells treated with serotonin led to a dose-dependent decrease in receptor interaction with MUPP1. A 50% reduction in receptor binding to PDZ 10 was observed with a concentration 100 nm serotonin. Moreover, increasing serotonin concentrations caused a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylated receptor with a concurrent decrease in the amount of unphosphorylated receptor as determined by band shift phosphorylation assays (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the loss of PDZ 10 interaction with the receptor was a consequence of agonist binding with 5-HT2C Rs, cells were preincubated in the absence or presence 1 μm of BOL, a 5-HT2C R antagonist, for 15 min prior to the addition of serotonin. BOL antagonized a subsequent serotonin-mediated decrease in receptor pull-down (Fig. 6), thereby demonstrating that the loss of PDZ 10 interaction is a direct consequence of receptor activation. BOL alone had no effect. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment of the 5-HT2CReceptor Increases PDZ 10 Interaction and Reveals 5-HT2CReceptor Basal Phosphorylation—The reduction of 5-HT2C R binding to MUPP1 may be the direct result of receptor phosphorylation. We therefore investigated whether treatment of lysate containing receptor with alkaline phosphatase would restore MUPP1 interaction. Cells were treated with agonist, and cell lysates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase prior to pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 7A, alkaline phosphatase treatment resulted in more receptor pull-down in serotonin-stimulated cells. In the absence of serotonin, alkaline phosphatase treatment doubled the amount of receptor binding to PDZ 10 compared with untreated cells. These findings directly support a role for agonist-induced phosphorylation in disrupting 5-HT2C R binding to MUPP1 as well as uncover a potential function for previously reported basal phosphorylation of the receptor. Phosphorylation of the receptor is reversible; therefore, we investigated the activity of endogenous phosphatases against the receptor by washout experiments. Cells were treated with agonist and then washed thoroughly and incubated in serum-free medium for 10 or 30 min before lysis and pull-down assay. Fig. 7B demonstrates a time-dependent increase in 5-HT2C R binding to MUPP1 (Fig. 7B). These results are consistent with previously published data indicating a time-dependent dephosphorylation of the receptor (2Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 5-HT2C Rs are implicated in physiological processes such as cerebrospinal fluid production as well as illnesses and disorders including anxiety, migraines, and eating and sleeping disorders (27Roth B.L.

A thorough understanding of intracellular signaling by the 5-HT2C R, including its interaction with PDZ domain containing proteins, may give insight into the cellular mechanisms that underlie these diverse physiological processes. PDZ domain-containing proteins are involved in the localization of potassium channels and glutamate receptors in the synapse as well as localization of numerous other receptors and proteins (31Shieh B.H.

Utilizing the advantages provided by a cell-free methodology, we characterized phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2 (PDK2), the putative kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt on Ser-473.

Insulin initiates a complex array of intracellular signaling events (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). Upon insulin binding, the receptor becomes auto-phosphorylated on several critical intracellular tyrosine residues, thereby activating an intrinsic tyrosine kinase that can then phosphorylate cellular substrates. The major proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated by the activated insulin receptor include the insulin receptor substrate proteins (2White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), Shc (3Pelicci G.L. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cauallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicei P.G.

Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). These proteins do not have enzymatic activity. Rather, they serve as adaptor proteins capable of recruiting numerous downstream effectors that contain Src homology 2 domains (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R.

Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase mainly relevant to insulin signaling is a heterodimer consisting of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110). The regulatory subunit contains two Src homology 2 domains that can interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor proteins, most notably insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2. The major in vivo substrate for PI 3-kinase is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, found in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Insulin stimulation, thus, leads to the acute increase in the intracellular level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).The activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is markedly stimulated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (6Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon predominantly relies on the phosphorylation of Akt on two of its amino acid residues, 1) threonine 308 in the activation loop of the kinase catalytic domain and 2) serine 473 in the hydrophobic carboxy-terminal domain (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of both of these regulatory sites is inhibitable in vivo by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wort-mannin (8Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). The protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt on Thr-308 is the recently identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (9Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.

Despite intense investigative efforts, the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt on Ser-473, tentatively termed phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2 (PDK2), has resisted definitive purification (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 12Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). At least three models for Ser-473 phosphorylation have been proposed. Alessi and co-workers (14Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) demonstrate that PDK1 could be converted in vitro through interaction with a hydrophobic peptide (called PDK1-interacting peptide) into a form capable of phosphorylating Akt on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (14Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Whether this unprecedented mode of regulation occurs in vivo remains unclear. Toker and Newton provide data supporting an Akt autophosphorylation mechanism involving the Ser-473 site (15Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), similar to that of certain conventional protein kinase C isoforms (16Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). They suggest that Akt might be partially activated by phosphorylation of Thr-308 due to upstream PDK1, thereby allowing Akt to act upon itself by transferring a phosphate group onto Ser-473 (15Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible for PDK2 to be a distinct kinase yet to be characterized. In cells lacking PDK1, growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 did not occur, but phosphorylation of Ser-473 still remained intact, suggesting the existence of a PDK2 kinase distinct from PDK1 (17Williams M.R. Arthur J.S.C. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).It is self-evident that these competing models of Akt regulation have mutually exclusive features. However, a clear consensus concerning the nature of PDK2 has not been reached. We chose to address this issue using a novel approach. Using the subcellular components of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we have recently developed an in vitro assay reconstituting key aspects of PI 3-kinase-dependent insulin signaling (45Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We provide evidence obtained through this assay that PDK2 appears to be a cytoskeleton-associated kinase distinct from PDK1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (18Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10–14 days after initiating differentiation.Isolation of Subcellular Components—Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight. The cells were then rapidly washed three times with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained further for 15 min at 4 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm insulin. Cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 2 ml of ice-cold HES buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA)/dish containing protease inhibitors (0.082 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then homogenized at 4 °C by passing the cells 10 times through a Yamato SC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rpm. The plasma membrane (PM) fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation and sucrose cushion flotation as described previously (19Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and designated as either PM(–ins) or PM(+ins) according to whether the starting cell source was exposed to insulin. The low density microsomes (LDM) fraction was obtained from basal cells as described previously (19Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PM and LDM, subsequent to their isolation, were resuspended in IC buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). A highly concentrated cytosol (CYT) fraction was prepared by washing the 3T3-L1 adipocytes three times with ice-cold IC buffer and then removing the buffer as much as possible by aspiration followed by cell scraping and homogenizing with a ball-bearing homogenizer. The supernatant was recovered after an ultracentrifuge spin for 1 h at 200,000 × g. For the preparation of PM salt-extracted proteins, plasma membranes pelleted after sucrose cushion flotation were resuspended in 200 μlofIC buffer supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then subjected to centrifugation in a TLA-100.3 fixed angle rotor at 37,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet formed from this spin (PM(SW)) was resuspended in IC buffer. The 1 m NaCl was removed from the supernatant (Ext-LoS) using a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column that was pre-equilibrated with 2 ml of IC buffer. Equilibrated columns were centrifuged for 1 min at 300 × g before applying the sample to the top of the resin. Centrifugation of the sample through the spin column for 1 min at 300 × g removed the 1 m NaCl. For certain experiments, Ext-LoS was further centrifuged in a TLA-100.3 fixed angle rotor at 200,000 × g for 1 h to produce a supernatant (Ext-HiS) and a pellet (Ext-HiP). ExtHiP was resuspended in IC buffer, and Ext-HiS was desalted with a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column.In Vitro Assay—Reactions were prepared in a manner described previously (45Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared on ice by mixing in various combinations of LDM (∼2.5 mg/ml final concentration), CYT (∼ 3 mg/ml final concentration), and PM (∼0.5 mg/ml final concentration). Reactions were initiated with the addition of an ATP-regenerating system (final reaction concentrations, 1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated with rotation at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) containing 2% SDS and 1 mm EDTA. Certain in vitro reactions as indicated included 10 μm PIP3 (Calbiochem) in a sonication mixture of 100 μm phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 100 μm phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids). All phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids were obtained from Calbiochem. Bovine liver PI was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. For the preparation of PDK1-immunodepleted CYT, pre-cleared CYT was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) bound with anti-PDK1 polyclonal sheep IgG (Upstate Biotechnology catalog #06–637; 5 μg of IgG/mg of CYT). For experiments addressing the salt requirement for Akt phosphorylation, the salt content of the IC buffer used in the in vitro reactions (normally 140 mm potassium glutamate and 5 mm NaCl) was altered as indicated.Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Protein samples from the in vitro assay were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phospho-specific antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated forms of Akt were obtained from New England Biolabs. Antibodies directed against integrin-linked kinase (ILK), paxillin, and integrin β1 receptor were purchased from Pharmingen. PDK1 antibody used for immunoblot analysis (catalog #06-906) as well as antibodies specific for vinculin, insulin receptor, and caveolin were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Actin antibody was obtained from Chemicon. The Arp3 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. John Cooper (Washington University School of Medicine).Expression of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-Akt1 and GST-Akt1(K179A) in 293 Cells—pEBG2t-Akt1 and pEBG2t-Akt1(K179A) DNA constructs that have been used to overexpress GST-Akt fusion proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from Dr. Dario Alessi (University of Dundee) (9Alessi D.R.

Pooled transfectants were selected by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg/ml G418. GST-Akt1 and GST-Akt1(K179A) fusion proteins were purified from the transfected 293 cells as previously described (9Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExamination of Akt Phosphorylation Using an in Vitro Assay—Early insulin-stimulated events downstream of PI 3-kinase, including Akt activation, occur with reasonable efficiency in our novel cell-free system (45Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This assay involves recombining in various combinations three subcellular fractions of 3T3-L1 adipocytes prepared by differential centrifugation; that is, the plasma membrane PM(–ins) or PM(+ins), depending on whether the intact cell source had been exposed to insulin at 4 °C before fractionation, LDM, and CYT. After mixing of the components, the in vitro reaction is initiated by the addition of an exogenous ATP source and then incubated at 37 °C for up to 15 min. By using this methodology, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473 is reconstituted in a manner dependent on PI 3-kinase and ATP.We utilized this system to investigate the molecular regulation of Akt, taking advantage of experimental manipulations made possible by unhindered access to all reaction components. To clarify the role of PDK1 in the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473, we performed our in vitro reaction using a CYT fraction from which PDK1 had been immunodepleted. Among the reaction components used, PDK1 was found predominantly in the CYT fraction (Fig. 1A), consistent with localization observed by others (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 20Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The faint band with a slightly retarded mobility observed in the PM fraction might be either a cross-reacting protein or a post-translationally modified form of PDK1. The LDM was essentially devoid of PDK1. Immunodepletion of CYT with an anti-PDK1 antibody successfully removed PDK1 (CYT-PDK1). In contrast, mock immunodepletion of CYT with an irrelevant antibody had no effect on PDK1 content (CYT-CON).In an in vitro reaction combining immunodepleted CYT with PM, the lack of PDK1 resulted in greatly diminished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308. However, insulin-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation occurred normally (Fig. 1B, left panels). There is some evidence to suggest that the phosphorylation of Akt in vivo takes place after its recruitment to cellular membranes (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that PDK2 might be membrane-associated, a reaction was performed by combining CYT with PM that had been salt-washed with 1 m NaCl (PM(SW)). Salt washing of PM abrogated insulin-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation. However, insulin-stimulated Thr-308 still occurred (Fig. 1B, middle panels). The inclusion of LDM to the reaction rescued insulin-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation from being inhibited by salt extraction of PM (Fig. 1B, right panels).Collectively, the data strongly suggest that PDK2 might be a kinase distinguishable from PDK1. This was supported by the fact that independent manipulations (i.e. immunodepletion of PDK1 and salt extraction of PM) segregated these two kinase activities in complementary fashion (i.e. inhibiting PDK1 while leaving PDK2 intact and vice versa). In contrast to the predominantly cytosolic localization of PDK1, PDK2 appeared to be associated with PM and LDM and was largely absent from the cytosol.ILK has been recently identified as a candidate for PDK2. The activity of ILK is apparently increased by insulin stimulation in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (21Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Using transfected cells, S. Dedhar and co-workers provide evidence suggesting that ILK can phosphorylate Akt on Ser-473 (22Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, the data regarding ILK are not conclusive. There is even uncertainty that ILK is a functional kinase, as several critical residues normally found in the catalytic domain of protein kinases are not conserved in ILK (23Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A.

ILK may, thus, regulate the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 through an indirect mechanism (23Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).To address the role of ILK in our system, immunoblot analysis using an ILK antibody was performed on 50 μg of each of the subcellular fractions (Fig. 1C). ILK was found enriched in the PM fraction relative to the CYT and LDM. However, the amount of ILK in the cytosolic fraction was significant considering the fact that our in vitro reactions typically contained five times the amount of cytosolic proteins relative to PM proteins. This observation is inconsistent with our expected profile for PDK2, which should be absent from the cytosol. In addition, although the amount of ILK in the PM was reduced with salt washing, there was still a significant amount remaining. This behavior did not correlate with the PDK2 activity that was observed. These data indicated that the presence of ILK might not be sufficient for Ser-473 phosphorylation, but they did not rule out the possibility that ILK might be a necessary cofactor.The localization of PDK2 was also independently confirmed by another approach. We investigated whether the addition of exogenous PIP3 to our in vitro reaction could bypass the requirement for PI 3-kinase altogether, thus allowing the phosphorylation of Akt to occur in a non-insulin-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The addition of PIP3 to CYT alone resulted in the efficient phosphorylation of Thr-308, consistent with the localization of PDK1 predominantly in the cytosol. However, the phosphorylation of Ser-473 occurred only marginally, consistent with PDK2 being largely absent from the cytosol. When PIP3 was added to a reaction containing CYT and LDM, the Thr-308 signal was not further enhanced relative to that produced by a reaction containing CYT alone. In contrast, PIP3 addition to CYT and LDM produced a robust Ser-473 signal, confirming the presence of PDK2 activity associated with the LDM. Heating the LDM at 65 °C for 10 min completely inhibited the PIP3-stimulated Ser-473 activity, suggesting that a catalytic protein was responsible for the PDK2 activity in the LDM rather than an ancillary thermostable cofactor (data not shown). Similar effects were observed when PIP3 was added to a reaction containing CYT and PM. The presence of PM significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser-473 but not Thr-308. Salt extraction of the LDM did not affect Thr-308 phosphorylation and only marginally reduced Ser-473 phosphorylation. Approximately 50% of the total protein in the LDM could be extracted with 1 m NaCl. In contrast, salt extraction of the PM almost completely suppressed PIP3-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation but had no effect on Thr-308 phosphorylation. In this case, ∼30% of the PM proteins were removed with the salt wash. The data again support the idea that PDK2, in contrast to PDK1, was mainly associated with the membrane fractions and absent in soluble form.Fig. 2The addition of PIP3 to the in vitro reaction can bypass the requirement for PI 3-kinase. 10 μm PIP3 in a sonication mixture of 100 μm phosphatidylcholine and 100 μm phosphatidylserine was added or not to various 3T3-L1 adipocyte components isolated from basal cells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of ATP. PM(SW) and LDM(SW) are PM and LDM, respectively, that were salt-washed with 1 m NaCl during the isolation procedure. The reaction samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis using phospho-Akt antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to PIP3, we tested other phosphatidylinositol lipids for their ability to stimulate Akt phosphorylation. Only PIP3 and PI 3,4-bisphosphate, but not PI 4,5-bisphosphate, PI 3-phosphate, or PI, could stimulate Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation (Fig. 3), confirming the class Ia PI 3-kinase-dependent nature of both PDK1 and PDK2 (5Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Notably, the PDK2 activity associated with the PM did not significantly differ in lipid specificity compared with the PDK2 activity associated with the LDM.Fig. 3Phosphoinositide specificity of PDK1 and PDK2. 10 μm PIP3, PI 3,4-bisphosphate (P2), PI 4,5-bisphosphate, PI 3-phosphate (P), or PI in a sonication mixture of 100 μm phosphatidylcholine and 100 μm phosphatidylserine were added or not to an in vitro reaction containing PM and CYT or LDM and CYT isolated from basal cells.

Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The enrichment of PDK2 in membrane fractions may contribute to technical difficulties experienced in attempts at purifying this activity. Our initial efforts at reconstituting PDK2 activity from the salt extract of membranes were unsuccessful until we discovered that high concentrations of chloride (>100 mm) could completely inhibit PDK2 activity. This observation is illustrated in Fig. 4. In vitro reactions containing PM and CYT were carried out in the presence of 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl (KGlu), 140 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm NaCl (KAc), 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl (KCl), or 145 mm NaCl. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 were almost completely suppressed in the presence of 145 mm chloride (Fig. 4, top panels). To address whether PDK1 and PDK2 activities were directly inhibited by chloride as opposed to an indirect effect involving an earlier signaling step, in vitro reactions were performed using exogenous PIP3 (Fig. 4, lower panels). The robust PIP3-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation observed in the presence of potassium glutamate or potassium acetate was completely inhibited at high chloride concentrations. The PIP3-stimulated Thr-308 phosphorylation was also severely inhibited at high chloride concentrations but was readily apparent with longer film exposures. The effect of chloride is probably not observed in vivo because the intracellular concentration of this ion is low (<5 mm). Nevertheless, buffers containing chloride in excess of 100 mm are routinely used in kinase assays and protein purification, which may in part explain some of the past difficulty in identifying PDK2.Fig. 4Chloride inhibits PDK1 and PDK2 enzymatic activity.

Escherichia coli lacking glutathione reductase and glutaredoxins (gor–grxA–grxB–grxC–) barely grows on sulfate. We found that incubation of PAPS reductase with oxidized glutathione leads to enzyme inactivation with simultaneous formation of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and the active site Cys-239. A newly developed method based on thiol-specific fluorescent alkylation and gel electrophoresis showed that glutathionylated PAPS reductase is reduced by glutaredoxins via a monothiol mechanism. This glutathionylated species was also observed in poorly growing gor–grxA–grxB–grxC– cells expressing inactive glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) C9S/C12S. However, it was absent in better growing cells expressing monothiol Grx2 C12S or wild type Grx2. Reversible glutathionylation may thus regulate the activity of PAPS reductase in vivo.

Sulfur is an ingredient of all living organisms. The first, most common form of sulfur in nature is inorganic sulfate, which needs to be further reduced for incorporation in a living cell. Prototrophic bacteria, for example, use inorganic sulfate ( SO42−, S+ VI) as primary source for the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids and cofactors (1Schwenn J.D. Z. Naturforsch. 1994; 49c: 531-539Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sulfate is first activated to adenylylsulfate (APS) 1The abbreviations used are: APS, adenylylsulfate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Grx, glutaredoxin; HED, 2-hydroxyethydisulfide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PAP, adenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate; PAPS, phosphoadenylylsulfate; PR, phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase; TR, thioredoxin reductase; Trx, thioredoxin. and then to 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) by ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase. Subsequently, PAPS is reduced by PAPS reductase (PR) to sulfite ( SO32−, S+ IV) and adenosine-3′5′-bisphosphate (PAP). Sulfite is reduced to sulfide (S2–,S–II) by sulfite reductase, and, thereafter, is incorporated in O-acetyl serine (OAS) by OAS-(thiol)lyase to give the primary product of sulfate assimilation, cysteine. PAPS reductase (EC 1.8.99.4) is composed of two identical subunits of 28 kDa. It is devoid of chromophores and contains a single cysteine per subunit in a highly conserved ECGLH motif, which is identified as the redox-active center of the enzyme (2Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reduction of sulfate to sulfite by PR requires two electrons during which the cysteines of PR are oxidized to a disulfide. The oxidized enzyme is inactive and needs to be reduced for the reduction of PAPS to continue. Kinetic data (2Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J.

Structure. 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) implicate a ping-pong mechanism for its reduction. In the first step, shown here in Reaction 1, PRSHSH+PAPS→PRSS+PAP+SO32−Reaction 1 reduced PR catalyzes the reduction of PAPS, leading to oxidized PR, free sulfite, and PAP. Upon oxidation the enzyme dimer undergoes conformational changes leading to a significant decrease in apparent molecular weight and the inability to bind PAPS (2Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Krone F.A. Westphal G. Schwenn J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the second step, oxidized PR is reduced by thioredoxin as shown in Reaction 2, PRSS+TrxSHSH→PRSHSH+TrxSSReaction 2 or glutaredoxin, which is depicted in Reaction 3, PRSS+GrxSHSH→PRSHSH+GrxSSReaction 3 with electrons from thioredoxin reductase (TR) and NADPH or glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase, and NADPH. Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins are small (9–14 kDa) ubiquitous proteins that utilize their two redox-active cysteines (CXXC motif) to catalyze the reduction of disulfides (6Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas thioredoxins and glutaredoxins can reduce their substrates by using both active site cysteines (dithiol mechanism) (7Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), glutaredoxins can also utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin N-terminal cysteine (monothiol mechanism) (8Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to reduce intracellular disulfides, glutaredoxins may also reduce the mixed disulfides that form between a protein thiol and GSH. This is a reaction that is not catalyzed by thioredoxins. Escherichia coli contains two thioredoxins (Trx1 and Trx2) and three glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3) (9Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Trx1, Trx2, and Grx1 can reduce the disulfide that forms on ribonucleotide reductase 1a (RNR1a) upon the reduction of ribonucleotides with comparative efficiencies, whereas Grx3 is only a weak reductant in vitro (10Laurent T.C.

Other functions for Trx1 include the reduction of methionine sulfoxide via methionine sulfoxide reductase, whereas Trx2 participates in the antioxidant response as part of the OxyR regulon. Grx1 is also a member of the OxyR regulon, but Grx2 and Grx3 are not (14Potamitou A. Neubauer P. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17775-17780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With levels at least 10-fold higher than those of Grx1, Grx2 and Grx3 are highly abundant proteins in E. coli (15Potamitou A. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18561-18567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and contribute up to 98% of the GSH-dependent oxidoreductase activity, using the disulfide between β-mercaptoethanol and GSH as a substrate (HED assay) (11Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Grx2 is an atypical glutaredoxin with a molecular mass of 23.4 kDa and structural similarities to mammalian GSH S-transferases (16Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because of its high abundance (up to 1% of total soluble protein) and catalytic efficiency, it contributes to >80% of the cellular GSH-mixed disulfide reducing activities (in the HED assay) (17Vlamis-Gardikas A.

The enzyme is also highly active in the reduction of the mixed disulfide between glutathione and arsenate reductase (19Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Grx2 is involved in the antioxidant response, as mutants lacking Grx2 have increased levels of carbonylation of their intracellular proteins after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Glutaredoxins and thioredoxins are not only direct antioxidants, but may also participate in the signal transduction of redox-induced cellular responses (overviews in Refs. 20Cartmel-Harel O. Stortz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and 21Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 2: 811-820Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Combined E. coli null mutants for glutathione reductase and the three glutaredoxins (gor–grxA–grxB–grxC–) barely grow on sulfate (S+VI) but grow normally on sulfite (S+IV) or methionine (S–II) (22Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because these mutants contain sufficient amounts of thioredoxin to reduce PR (15Potamitou A. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18561-18567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), this disturbed growth must represent some sort of inhibition of PR activity not based on the reduction of the enzyme's disulfide that is formed upon the reduction of PAPS. Growth of gor–grxA–grxB–grxC– could be restored with monothiol or wild type Grx2 in trans but not with the inactive C9S/C12S species (22Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A.

Enzymatic Assays—PAPS reductase activity was measured as an acid-labile sulfite formation from [35S]PAPS at 30 °C (28Schwenn J.D. Schriek U. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 93-102Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (100 μl) contained 50–500 ng ml–1 PAPS reductase, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm Na2SO3, 100 μm [35S]PAPS, 100 μm Trx1, and 1 μm thioredoxin reductase from E. coli, and 5 mm NADPH. Oxidized glutathione, yeast glutathione reductase (Sigma), and glutaredoxins were added as indicated. For determination of the activity of glutaredoxin-treated oxidized, reduced, and glutathionylated enzyme, the assay mixtures (5 μg of PR, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) were desalted on Sephadex-G25, and the activity was determined in the absence of further reductants in a single turnover experiment (100 mm Tris/HCl pH 8, 10 mm Na2SO3, and 100 μm [35S]PAPS; 5-min reaction time). [35S]PAPS (1,700 Bq nmol–1) was prepared from [35S]sulfite (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Schriek and Schwenn (25Schriek U. Schwenn J.D. Arch.

GSH-mixed disulfides were assayed in a reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm reduced glutathione, 100 μm NADPH, yeast glutathione reductase, 1 μm glutaredoxin, and glutathionylated PR as indicated. Glutaredoxins catalyze the reduction of mixed disulfides using GSH as electron donor. The resulting GSSG is reduced by glutathione reductase with electrons from NADPH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of glutaredoxin. The decrease in A340 was used for quantification of the GSH-moieties in the UV-2100 photometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto) at 25 °C. Fluorescent Experiments—5 μg of PAPS reductase in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl in a total volume of 20 μl was incubated with 5 mg of a reduced glutaredoxin for 30 s in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm reduced glutathione. The samples were alkylated and labeled with 0.5 mm 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein (5-IAF, Sigma; solved in N,N-dimethylformamide) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark before they were separated by SDS-PAGE (8–16%) and analyzed on a UV table (Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA). Growth of E. coli—To determine the redox status of PR in cell-free extracts and for immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were grown overnight in LB, washed twice with cold M9 medium, and inoculated in fresh M9 medium with 33 mg liter–1 Leu and Ile, 100 mg liter–1 ampicillin, and 0.1% arabinose to an A600 of 0.14. Cells were grown in 300-ml cultures at 170 rpm and 37 °C until they reached stationary phase. The cells were then collected, incubated with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min on ice to stop further reactions of thiol groups, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in TE buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and frozen at –20 °C. Purification of Antibodies—Rabbit sera were adjusted with ammonium sulfate to 50% of saturation and left stirring at 4 °C overnight. The precipitated IgG fraction was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dialyzed extensively against PBS, pH 7.5. Affinity-purified antibodies for PAPS reductase were prepared using an Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad) on which 5 mg of PAPS reductase had been previously immobilized using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Prior to the application of the IgG fraction, columns were equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 500 mm NaCl and, finally, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After sample loading, columns were subsequently washed with the same buffers, and bound antibodies were eluted with a pulse of 0.1 m acetic acid-formic acid, pH 2.1. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9, aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. Immunoprecipitation—Frozen cells were washed once with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm EDTA and resuspended in 3 ml of the same buffer. Cells were incubated for 45 min with 1 mg ml–1 lysozyme on ice. Cells were sonicated, treated with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The cell-free lysate supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 35 mg of affinity-purified polyclonal PAPS reductase antibodies while shaking, and then for another hour with 350 ml of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were spun down, washed twice with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm EDTA, resuspended in 1% SDS, and boiled for 20 min before SDS-PAGE. Western Blotting—The BioRad system was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 20 min at room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). It was further washed and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (1:500 for anti/PR-antibodies and 1:2000 for anti/GSH-antibodies). The membrane was washed with 150 mm NaCl for 20 min and then with TBST for additional 20 min, followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako) using a dilution of 1:4000 for PR antibodies and 1:2000 for GSH antibodies in TBST. The blots were developed by chemiluminescence using the Western Lightning kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and visualized using the MiltiImage Light cabinet (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed on a PE Biosystems Voyager 6061 (Applied Biosystems) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) system. Tryptic digestion was performed using sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The peptides were diluted in 75% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with an equal amount of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of this solution was allowed to crystallize on the applicator plate before ionization. Growth Properties of E. coli DHB4gor–grxA–grxB–grxC–— Combined E. coli null mutants for glutathione reductase and Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3 (DHB4gor–grxA–grxB–grxC–) barely grow in the presence of sulfate, but they grow well in the presence of sulfite, cysteine, or methionine (22Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Consistent with previous findings (22Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), transformants with the monothiol Grx2 grew faster and reached the highest optical density (A600) at stationary phase (2.4). The wild type Grx2-containing cells reached an OD of 1.9, and the no-thiol Grx2-containing cells only an OD of 1.0 at stationary phase, as described previously for the non-transformed strain (22Vlamis-Gardikas A. Potamitou A. Zarivach R. Hochman A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10861-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Redox Status of PAPS Reductase in Vivo—To investigate whether the limited growth of the null mutant was caused by an arrest of PR in the oxidized state, we determined the redox state of the enzyme in vivo. PR is a homodimeric enzyme whose active site is formed by an intermolecular dithiol-disulfide couple between the only cysteines at position 239 (2Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As there are no other covalent links between the two subunits, the reduced and oxidized forms of the enzyme can be separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, where the reduced enzyme corresponds to an apparent Mr of 30 kDa, and the oxidized enzyme to 60 kDa. No oxidized PR could be detected in the null mutant transformed with the no-thiol Grx2 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) or in any other strain (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibition of cell growth in the particular strain was not caused by an arrest of PR in its oxidized conformation. Reversible Inhibition of PAPS Reductase by Oxidized Glutathione—As the GSH/GSSG ratio in the gor– strain would be expected to shift more toward oxidized glutathione, we investigated whether GSSG affects PR activity. The enzyme was incubated with different amounts of GSSG before reduction of PAPS was performed with electrons delivered from Trx1, Trx reductase (TrxR), and NADPH (Fig. 3). Following incubation with GSSG, the activity of PR decreased exponentially until no PAPS reduction was detectable. This inhibition pattern is characteristic for pseudo first order kinetics and suggested a covalent modification of PAPS reductase by GSSG as the basis for the inactivation, which, as shown in Reaction 4, E+GSSG→E−SG+GSHReaction 4 is most likely due to the formation of a mixed disulfide between the enzyme and glutathione. The non-linear curve fitting of these results was made assuming pseudo-first order kinetics. Calculated from the first-order rates obtained for the different GSSG-concentrations, the second-order rate constant was 80.4 ± 5.6 m–1 min–1, indicating a rapid reaction between PAPS reductase and GSSG. As the inhibition of PR was likely due to formation of a mixed disulfide between the active site thiol and glutathione, we tried to restore enzymatic activity by the addition of reductants. The addition of DTT or glutathione reductase could not restore the enzymatic activity of PR. When an additional glutaredoxin was added to the reaction mixture, the activity of the enzyme was restored to the former extent in less than 3 min (data not shown). All E. coli glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3) as well as their monothiol (CXXS)-mutants (Grx1C14S, Grx2C12S, and Grx3C15S) were capable of reactivating PR in that time period. Glutathionylation of Cysteine 239 —To confirm the glutathionylation of the active site cysteine 239, reduced and GSSG-treated PAPS reductase were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 4). Tryptic digestion of the reduced protein generated a peptide mass of 900.413 ± 0.017 (n = 2) corresponding to the partly cleaved C-terminal fragment Arg-Glu-Cys239-Gly-Leu-His-Glu-Gly with a calculated molecular weight of 900.399. GSSG-treatment induced a signal with the size of m/z = 1206.455, which is compatible with the formation of a disulfide between Cys239 and glutathione (calculated m/z 1206.474). These results indicated that Cys239 can form a mixed disulfide with glutathione. Oxidation and Reduction of Glutathionylated PR—Highly purified oxidized and glutathionylated PR (1.93 ± 0.08 GSH per PR) were analyzed using thiol-specific alkylation with fluorescent mm 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Oxidized and glutathionylated PR exhibited virtually no fluorescence or activity (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the Cys239 thiol of reduced PR was accessible for alkylation (Fig. 5, lane 3) and active in single turnover experiments (Fig. 5, panel I). The remaining portion of the 30-kDa protein in the oxidized protein (lane 1) corresponds to redox-inactive C-terminal truncated protein without any cysteine (5Savage H. Montoya G. Svensson C. Schwenn J.D. Sinning I. Structure. 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reduced Grx1 reduced both the PR disulfide and the mixed disulfide between PR and GSH in the presence and absence of GSH (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5). Reduced monothiol Grx1C14S reduced the two PR species in the presence of GSH, but formed a stable mixed disulfide with PR in the absence of GSH (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). Grx3, as well as its monothiol mutant Grx3C15S, reduced the glutathionylated form of PR in the presence of GSH (Fig. 5A, lane 9 and 11) but not the intramolecular PR disulfide (Fig. 5A, lanes 8 and 10). As seen in the reactivation assays, DTT or GSH alone could not reduce glutathionylated PR, as they did not increase the amount of free thiols of the glutathionylated form (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 12). Remarkably, in all preparations the existence of free thiols in PR corresponded to protein in the active conformation (sections I and II). Glutathionylation of PR in Vivo—Was glutathionylated PR the reason for the limited growth of the gor–grxA–grxB–grxC– strain in M9 media free of reduced sulfur? Antibodies raised against GSH-moieties on bovine serum albumin (31Hjelle O.P. Chaudhry F.A. Ottersen O.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reacted specifically with glutathionylated PR and showed no cross reactivity with reduced or oxidized PR (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–3). No glutathionylated PR was detected in extracts from gor–grxA–grxB–grxC– transformed with Grx2C12S (Fig. 6, lane 6). The mixed disulfide species was detected in extracts from transformants encoding wild type Grx2 or the no thiol Grx2C9S/C12S mutant (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). From the density of the bands on the blot, 20% of the PR in the pISCGrx2 transformants was glutathionylated (2.8 of 14 ng detected). 40% was the estimation for the pISCGrx2C9S/C12S-transformants (6.2 of 15.9 ng detected). Regulation of biological activity by the reversible modification of protein thiols is a growing concept in cell signaling. A fine tuning in the DNA binding properties of the transcription factor OxyR centers on Cys199, which can be hydroxylated, nitrosylated, or glutathionylated, with each modification resulting in differential binding of the protein to DNA; glutathionylated OxyR has the highest transcriptional activity (32Kim S.O.

Glutathionylation of Cys62 of the eukaryotic NF-κB subunit p50 lead to loss of DNA binding activity (33Pineda-Molina E. Klatt P. Vazquez J. Martina A. de Lacoba M.G. Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14134-14142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas nitric oxide treatment of c-Jun lead to nitrosylation/glutathionylation of Cys269 with concomitant loss of DNA binding activity (34Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. de Lacoba M.G. Padilla A.C. Martinez-Galisteo E. Barzena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Deglutathionylation of Cys374 in G-actin resulted in a 6-fold increase in the rate of its polymerization (35Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of dopamine, was inhibited by reversible glutathionylation (36Borges C.R. Geddes T.J. Watson J.T. Kuhn D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48295-48302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The same has been reported for protein kinase Cα and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (37Barett W.C. DeGnore J.P. König S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6699-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Nitrosylated mammalian thioredoxin (Cys69) has antiapoptotic properties (38Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), whereas its in vitro reducing activity to insulin disulfides is abolished by glutathionylation of the non-active site Cys72 (39Casagrande S. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Massignan T. Salmona M. Chang G. Holmgren A. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9745-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Consistent with the concept of glutathionylation in modifying biological activity, we propose that PR is inhibited by the formation of a mixed disulfide between cysteine 239 and GSH. E. coli glutaredoxins can reverse this inhibition by reducing the mixed disulfide. As precedent for this hypothesis, human glutaredoxin can reduce the mixed disulfide for both G-actin and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, thus reversing the effects of glutathionylation and restoring biological activity (35Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 37Barett W.C. DeGnore J.P. König S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6699-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The gene encoding PR (cysH) is located in the cysJIH operon and transcribed in a coordinated way with other genes, all belonging to the cys regulon (reviewed in Ref. 40Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 514-527Google Scholar). Genes within this regulon are only transcribed when sulfur is limiting and no forms of reduced sulfur are available for the cell. This regulation is controlled by the negatively auto-regulated transcription activator CysB and the inducer N-acetyl serine, which is derived from the cysteine precursor O-acetyl serine. No other form of kinetic regulation has been reported previously for the sulfate reduction pathway. This was demonstrated by a mutant that cannot repress this pathway and accumulates large amounts of sulfide (41Borum P.R. Monty K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 53-55Crossref Google Scholar). Regulation of PR activity by glutathionylation introduces another level of complexity in the overall regulation of sulfite biosynthesis. What could be the biological relevance of this control? Reduction of PAPS is linked to loss of electrons, which means loss of reducing equivalents. Under conditions favoring protein glutathionylation (e.g. oxidative stress), the unhindered continuation of electron flow via the PR pathway would further deteriorate cell homeostasis by using electrons that would have otherwise been used to reverse undesired oxidations. Therefore, stopping the activity of PR under conditions favoring its glutathionylation could be considered an adaptation of the cell to severe oxidative stress. Neurons constitute another example in which a multilevel regulation in the production of an oxidant and the responses against it could be regulated in a coordinated manner at many levels. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of dopamine, a potent oxidant, is inhibited by reversible nitrosylation of a structural cysteine (36Borges C.R. Geddes T.J. Watson J.T. Kuhn D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48295-48302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At the same time, dopamine-induced oxidative stress leading to the apoptosis of rat neurons may be offset by glutaredoxin activity, which activates NF-κB via Ref1 (42Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1335-41334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The glutaredoxin-driven signaling pathways can include both the Ras phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling cascade and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (43Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21618-21626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In view of the findings of this work, a more complete picture emerges for the catalytic mechanism of PR (Fig. 7). In a “normal” reducing cell environment, reduced PR is a homodimer. PAPS can bind to this reduced form (Fig. 7, R), to yield sulfite, PAP, and oxidized PR with an intra-molecular disulfide bridge between the active site cysteines (Cys239) (Fig. 7, reaction 1). Dimeric oxidized PR migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass (60 kDa) higher than that of the reduced form (30 kDa). The disulfide of the oxidized enzyme can be reduced by Trx1, Trx2, or Grx1 but not the other glutaredoxins (Fig. 7, reaction 2) (4Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Åslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 44Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). If the intracellular environment is somewhat oxidizing (e.g. the gor– strain), a mixed disulfide may form between Cys239 and glutathione, rendering the enzyme inactive. All glutaredoxins can catalyze the reduction of this mixed disulfide (Fig. 7, reaction 4). Formation of protein-glutathione-mixed disulfides is of physiological relevance for E. coli. Up to 2% of the total glutathione content (10–20 μm) is in the form of protein-mixed disulfides, and this value can be increased, as for example in trxA–grxA– mutants (5–7%) (45Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, extensive glutathionylation of protein substrates has been identified to include chaperons, cytoskeletal proteins, cell cycle regulators, and enzymes participating in the intermediary metabolism (46Lind C. Gerdes R. Hamnell Y. Schuppe-Koistinen I. von Löwenhielm H. Holmgren A. Cotgreave I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Such a study has not, to date, been performed for E. coli. Glutaredoxins and their monothiol activity would be the molecules expected to key regulate deglutathionylation reactions and reverse related changes in biological activity. The identification and characterization of further proteins that undergo reversible S-glutathionylation and are specifically related to the glutaredoxin species will be necessary for a deeper understanding of cellular redox regulation and signaling. We are grateful to Professor Ole Petter Ottersen from the University of Oslo for the antibody against GSH. We thank Dr. Jochen Kruip from the Ruhr-University Bochum for help with mass spectrometry, Mathias Lundberg from our department for valuable suggestions, and Lena Ringdén for excellent secretarial work."
https://openalex.org/W2075069012,"Human UDP-Gal transporter 1 (hUGT1) and the human CMP-Sia transporter (hCST) are similar in structure, with amino acid sequences that are 43% identical, but they have quite distinct transport substrates. To define their substrate recognition regions, we constructed various chimeras between the two transporters and demonstrated that distinct submolecular regions of the transporter molecules are involved in the specific recognition of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia (Aoki, K., Ishida, N., and Kawakita, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21555–21561). In a further attempt to define the minimum submolecular regions required for the recognition of specific substrates, we found that substitution of helix 7 of hCST into the corresponding part of hUGT1 was necessary and sufficient for a chimera to show CST activity. Additional replacement of helix 2 or 3 of hUGT1 with the corresponding hCST sequence markedly increased the efficiency of CMP-Sia transport. For UGT activity, helices 1 and 8 of hUGT1 were necessary (but not sufficient), and helices 9 and 10 or helices 2, 3, and 7 derived from hUGT1 were also required to render the chimera competent for UDP-Gal transport. The in vitro analyses of a chimera with dual specificity indicated that it transported both UMP and CMP and mediated exchange reactions between these nucleotides and nucleotide sugars that are recognized specifically by either of the parental transporters.

Nucleotide sugar transporters are membrane proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. They play an indispensable role in constructing the sugar chains of glycoconjugates. The transporters carry nucleotide sugars into the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, in which they are used by specific transferases as precursors of sugar chains (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Kawakita M.

More than simply functioning as a passive entrance route of nucleotide sugars into the organelles, the transporters may regulate the amounts of nucleotide sugars available in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus and consequently may affect the sugar chain composition of a cell (6Kumamoto K. Goto Y. Sekikawa K. Takenoshita S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4620-4627PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the roles of transporters in regulating sugar chains and, in turn, various aspects of cellular functions, it is indispensable to define which substrate(s) each transporter recognizes and to understand how and with what stringency the transporter discriminates between its own substrate(s) and irrelevant nucleotide sugars. The functions of nucleotide sugar transporters have long been studied by analyzing the properties of transporter-deficient mutant cells and by in vitro characterization of the transport activity using microsomal fractions from natural sources. In recent years, the genes encoding several kinds of nucleotide sugar transporters have been cloned from several species (Refs. 7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol.

As to the substrate specificity of nucleotide sugar transporters, it had long been assumed that each of the transporter family members was specialized for one nucleotide sugar and transported the particular nucleotide sugar into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus in exchange for a corresponding nucleoside monophosphate that was concomitantly exported from the organelles. This simplified view has been challenged because Muraoka et al. (10Muraoka M. Kawakita M. Ishida N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Goto S. Taniguchi M.

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of substrate recognition by nucleotide sugar transporters, we have been analyzing the properties of chimeric transporters constructed as hybrids of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia transporters (7Aoki K.

In one of our previous studies (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we constructed some chimeric transporters that exhibit both UGT and CST activities and proposed that different regions of a transporter protein critically contribute to the recognition of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. Here, we continued our attempt to define more precisely the submolecular regions that are necessary for substrate recognition, and we were able to identify regions that are indispensable for specific recognition of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia as well as groups of submolecular regions whose subsets in particular combinations, rather than all of these regions, are required for establishing or improving the recognition of a particular substrate. We also compared the kinetic as well as substrate recognition properties of chimeric and parental transporters and found that both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia transporters are intrinsically competent to recognize both UMP and CMP as the antiport substrate. Materials—UDP-[6-3H]Gal (60 Ci/mmol), CMP-[6-3H]Sia (20 Ci/mmol), and [5-3H]CMP (20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and [5-3H]UMP (19 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.

Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Chimera H1 was constructed by ligation of the large fragment of chimera H1-a (see below and Table I) with the small fragment of chimera G1 obtained after digestion with BstEII and NotI. Chimera H2 was constructed by ligating the large fragment of chimera C(7)/U with the small fragment of chimera H2-a after digestion with EcoRI and PstI. Chimeras I1–I5 and other intermediate chimeras were constructed by the two-step PCR method described previously (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments to be connected were amplified separately by the first PCR. The inside primers for each first PCR were 36 nucleotides long, and each consisted of an 18-nucleotide sequence located directly upstream and downstream, respectively, from the junctions of the intended chimera. Thus, the two fragments amplified in the first PCR had overlapping sequences around the junction. The N-terminal outside primers contained an EcoRI site as well as a hemagglutinin tag sequence, and the C-terminal outside primers possessed a NotI site. The second PCR was performed using the two fragments amplified by the first PCR as templates and the two outside primers as primers. The templates used in the first PCR to construct the N- and C-terminal fragments, respectively, of each chimera were as follows: for I1–I3, E2 and hCST; for I4, E3 and hCST; for I5, I5-a and hCST; for I5-a, I5-b and hUGT1; for I5-b, hUGT1 and hCST; for H1-a, hUGT1 and hCST; and for H2-a, B1 and hUGT1. All chimeric cDNAs constructed by this method were sequenced to rule out PCR-induced mutations. Cell Cultures and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary cell strain K1 and its derivatives Lec2 (a CST-deficient mutant) (29Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Lec8 (a UGT-deficient mutant) (30Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (31Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections for both transient expression and stable expression were performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transformants were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 10 days and cloned by limiting dilution. Assessment of the UGT and CST Activities—UGT and CST activities of chimeric molecules were assessed as described previously (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the UGT activity, UGT-deficient Lec8 cells were transfected with a chimeric cDNA, cultured for 1 day, transferred onto a chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Rochester, NY), incubated overnight, and then fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 6 min. The fixed cells were stained with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) for 30 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Subsequently, they were incubated with an appropriate primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin and phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and then incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with water and mounted with Permafluor (Immunotech, Marseilles, France). Fluorescence labeling was visualized under a Carl Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. The CST activity of chimeras was assessed by a similar method in which CST-deficient Lec2 cells and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) (EY Laboratories, Inc.) were used instead of Lec8 cells and G. simplicifolia lectin II, respectively. Subcellular Fractionation of Yeast—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH500 (MATα ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) was transformed by a lithium acetate procedure (33Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The cells were cultured to a density of A600 = 0.4, and cupric sulfate was added to the medium at a final concentration of 2 mm at 3 h before harvesting. The cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, resuspended in spheroplast solution (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaN3, and 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 2 mg of zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) per g of packed cells, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and disrupted by passing the suspension three times through a thin pipette tip. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and debris. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer. The protein concentrations were determined with BCA reagent (Pierce). In Vitro Assessment of Transport Activity—The in vitro transport assay was performed essentially as described previously (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The reaction was started by addition of the membrane preparation (50 μg of protein) to the reaction mixture (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dimercaptopropanol, and 3H-labeled nucleotide sugar or nucleotide (0.64 μCi/reaction)). The reaction mixture (100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C, diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 1 mm MgCl2) to stop the reaction, and poured onto a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filter was washed three times with stop buffer and dried, and the radioactivity trapped on the filter was measured in a toluene-based scintillator. Minimum Structural Requirements for CST Activity—In one of our previous studies, we demonstrated that chimeric transporters E2 and G1 are able to transport both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia (Fig. 1) (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This indicates that helices 2, 3, and 7 of hCST in the hUGT1 context are sufficient for a chimera to exhibit CST activity. To investigate whether any of these helices are nonessential for the CST activity, we constructed a number of diagnostic chimeras and examined their transport activity. The chimeras discussed in this work are summarized in Fig. 1. To evaluate the UGT and CST activities, a chimeric cDNA was transiently expressed in Lec8 or Lec2 cells, and the cells were examined to determine whether their characteristic mutant phenotype, viz. binding of G. simplicifolia lectin II or PNA lectin on their surface, was abolished as a result of the restoration of nucleotide sugar transport (Fig. 2; also summarized in Fig. 1). Fig. 2A shows that chimeras H1 and H2 exhibited CST activity. This indicates that either one of two hCST-derived helices, helix 2 or 3, may be dispensable and substitutable with its hUGT1 counterpart provided that the other is available. Upon further analysis, it was finally shown that chimera C(7)/U, in which only helix 7 is derived from hCST, was competent for CMP-Sia transport as judged by the complementation of the CST-deficient phenotype of Lec2 cells. This is shown convincingly in Fig. 2B in an experiment using stable transformants rather than transient transformants. Fig. 2B shows the PNA binding property and the expression of the chimeric protein in a cell line stably expressing C(7)/U protein. The cells bound virtually no PNA on their surface. Therefore, the hCST sequence in helix 7 is necessary and qualitatively sufficient for eliciting CST activity. However, it should be noted that the CST activity of C(7)/U was quantitatively lower than that of chimeras H1 and H2 as judged by their effectiveness in complementing the Lec2 phenotype. The presence of hCST-derived helix 2 or 3 together with helix 7 of hCST rendered the transporters able to exhibit potent CST activity. We reported previously that a chimera with hCST-derived helices 4–7in the hUGT1 context is unable to transport CMP-Sia (chimera F1 in Ref. 7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); but subsequently, stable transformant clones expressing the chimera were isolated, and the clones were shown to be able to correct the genetic defect of Lec2 cells (data not shown). It should be noted that helices 4–6 do not increase the ability of a chimera to transport CMP-Sia as do helices 2 and 3.Fig. 2Analyses of UGT and CST activities of chimeric transporters. A, Lec8 and Lec2 cells were transfected with the indicated chimeric cDNAs to assess their UGT and CST activities, respectively. Two days after transfection, the cells were double-stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins (G. simplicifolia lectin II (GS-II) for Lec8 cells and PNA for Lec2 cells; green) and antibodies (an anti-hUGT1 antibody for chimeras H1, H2, and C(7)/U and an anti-hCST antibody for chimeras I1–I5). The binding of the antibodies was detected with an Alexa 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (red). The two fluorescence images and a Nomarski image of the same field are merged. Bars = 20 μm. The expected terminal oligosaccharide structures on cells with a given phenotype and their reactivity for lectins are schematically shown below the images. B, Lec2 cells were transfected with chimeric C(7)/U cDNA, and stable transformants were cloned. The cells of a representative clone were stained with PNA and the anti-hUGT1 antibody as described for A to assess the expression of the chimeric transporter and its CST activity. Bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Minimum Structural Requirements for UGT Activity—It was shown previously that chimeras containing either hUGT1-derived helices 1, 8, 9, and 10 or hUGT1-derived helices 1–8 exhibit UGT activity, but those with hCST-derived sequences in either helix 1 or 8 do not (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This indicates the importance of these two helices, but it remains to be examined whether the presence of hUGT1-derived helices 1 and 8 is sufficient for recognizing UDP-Gal as a substrate. Chimeras I1–I5 were thus constructed to define the submolecular regions contributing to the recognition of UDP-Gal. Chimera I1 had only helices 1 and 8 with hUGT1 sequences in the hCST background, whereas chimeras I2–I5 had additional hUGT1-derived helices together with these two helices. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, chimera I1 could not transport UDP-Gal. Helices 1 and 8 of hUGT1 are therefore necessary (but not sufficient) for chimeras to elicit UGT activity. Chimera I2 did not express UGT activity, but chimera I3 did, indicating that the C-terminal loop region is not required for the UGT activity, but that the region from helices 8 to 10 is likely to be. However, the necessity for helix 9 has not yet been conclusively proven. It should be noted that the requirement for helix 10 (and probably helix 9) is not absolute because chimera I5 manifested UGT activity. This indicates that helices 2, 3, and 7 of hUGT1 could substitute for helices 9 and 10 to make a chimera competent for UDP-Gal transport. hUGT1-derived helices 2 and 3 were necessary for the UGT activity in this context because chimera I4 was unable to transport UDP-Gal. Substrate Specificity of hUGT1, hCST, and UDP-Gal/CMP-Sia-transporting Chimera G1—To examine the biochemical properties of hUGT1, hCST and their hybrids, the transporters were expressed heterologously in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, and the transport of various substrates was studied directly using the microsomal vesicles obtained from the yeast cells expressing these transporters. The dependence of the transport activity of hUGT1, hCST, and chimera G1 on substrate concentration is illustrated in Fig. 3. The Km value of hUGT1 for UDP-Gal and that of hCST for CMP-Sia were 5.5 and 60 μm, respectively. Chimera G1 showed almost the same affinity as hCST for CMP-Sia, with a Km value of 45 μm, whereas its affinity for UDP-Gal was much lower than that of hUGT1, which was 180 μm. The kcat values of the transport reactions cannot be readily compared because the amounts of transporters expressed in the microsomes are not the same and do not allow direct comparison. It is believed that UGT exports UMP from the Golgi apparatus in exchange for UDP-Gal, whereas CST exchanges CMP for CMP-Sia. To clarify which nucleoside monophosphate the chimeric transporter G1 can transport in exchange for UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, we examined the transport of UMP and CMP by chimera G1 using microsomal vesicles obtained from yeast cells. Fig. 4 shows that chimera G1 transported UMP in an amount comparable to hUGT1. This implied that the chimera was able to mediate the exchange between UMP and either of its nucleotide sugar substrates. We also tried to determine whether the yeast microsomal vesicles showed CMP uptake dependent on heterologously expressed nucleotide sugar transporters and their chimeras, but this attempt was unsuccessful because negative control vesicles prepared from the yeast cells transformed with the vector alone incorporated almost the same amount of CMP as those from yeast cells expressing hUGT1, hCST, or chimera G1 (data not shown). Because of this endogenous CMP transport activity in yeast microsomes, we were unable to directly assess the ability of chimera G1 and its parental transporters to transport CMP. To gain further information concerning the substrate specificity of the nucleotide sugar-nucleoside monophosphate antiport systems, we carried out “exchange assays.” In this type of assay, a radiolabeled substrate was first incorporated into the microsomal vesicles at 30 °C for 1 min, and then another nonradioactive substance at 100 times higher concentration was added to the reaction mixture. If exchanges between the first and second substrates took place, radioactive substrate that had been incorporated in the vesicles during the first step of incubation would be released during the second step of incubation. Fig. 5 (A–C) shows that the transporters carried out exchanges not only between nucleotide sugars and nucleoside monophosphates, but also between nucleotide sugars. The vesicles from the yeast cells expressing hUGT1 readily released radioactive UDP-Gal when UMP, CMP, UDP-Gal, or UDP-GalNAc was added to the external medium as the second substrate (Fig. 5A). A moderate release of UDP-Gal was also observed upon addition of AMP, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-Glc. The exchange properties of chimera G1 could not be determined probably because the specific incorporation of UDP-Gal at 10 μm was very low due to its low affinity for UDP-Gal (data not shown). Fig. 5 (B and C) shows the exchanges between CMP-Sia and various nucleotides or nucleotide sugars by hCST and chimera G1. CMP-Sia was released from vesicles expressing hCST in exchange for AMP, UMP, CMP, or CMP-Sia, but not for other nucleotide sugars, whereas chimera G1 mediated the exchange between CMP-Sia and nucleotide sugars recognized by hUGT1, including UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, as well as CMP-Sia, the nucleotide sugar recognized by hCST. It is worth pointing out that these constitute the sum of the substances that serve as substrates for hUGT1 and hCST. Both hUGT1 and hCST showed a qualitatively similar specificity for nucleoside monophosphates. It was rather unexpected that CMP promoted UDP-Gal release from hUGT1-expressing vesicles and that UMP caused CMP-Sia release from hCST-expressing vesicles. Even a purine nucleotide, AMP, significantly promoted the release of nucleotide sugars, although GMP was completely inert in this respect. We reported above that hCST-expressing vesicles did not accumulate UMP significantly when incubated with 10 μm [3H]UMP. The affinity of hCST for UMP may be lower than that of hUGT1, so the movement of UMP across the microsomal membranes was observable only at higher concentrations of UMP. As shown in Fig. 5 (D and E), the exchange of UMP with various nucleoside monophosphates and nucleotide sugars was assayed using vesicles prepared from yeast cells transformed with hUGT1 and chimera G1. Fig. 5D shows that AMP, UMP, CMP, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GalNAc induced the release of UMP from hUGT1-expressing vesicles. In addition to these substances, CMP-Sia was also active in releasing UMP from the chimera G1-expressing vesicles. These results indicate that chimera G1 acquired the combined repertoires of hUGT1 and hCST and transported UMP and CMP as well as UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, and CMP-Sia. They also indicate that these substrates could be exchanged in any combination between the two compartments across the membrane. In our previous studies, we constructed chimeric transporters between hUGT1 and hCST to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the substrate recognition by nucleotide sugar transporters and found that some chimeras exhibit both UGT and CST activities (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This indicate that UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia are critically recognized at distinct submolecular regions in a transporter protein. In the present work, we further examined the properties of these and other chimeras to define the requirements for dual substrate recognition more precisely and to determine their substrate spectra in more detail. We have shown that a helix 7-containing segment of hCST alone was sufficient in an otherwise hUGT1 context to confer the ability to recognize CMP-Sia on the chimera C(7)/U. So far, every chimera with an hCST-derived helix 7-containing region was found to be competent in transporting CMP-Sia. Although the presence of the hCST stretch containing helix 7 was qualitatively sufficient for eliciting the CST activity, it should be noted that additional substitution of either helix 2 or 3 of the C(7)/U chimera by the hCST counterpart markedly enhanced the efficiency of CMP-Sia transport, as inferred from the fact that chimeras H1 and H2 were much more effective in correcting the genetic defect of Lec2 cells. This indicates that multiple submolecular regions contribute to recognizing appropriate substrates properly and efficiently, some of which are indispensable or particularly important for the occurrence of specific recognition, whereas others are involved in increasing the strength of the specific interaction. The fact that chimera C(7)/U recognized CMP-Sia implies that the helix 7 region of the hCST sequence contains the CMP-Sia-recognizing motif. We are currently trying to define in detail the CMP-Sia-recognizing motif by site-directed mutagenesis. The requirements for specific recognition of UDP-Gal are more complicated because the recognition process appears to involve multiple submolecular regions. We showed previously that helices 1 and 8 of hUGT1 are indispensable for UGT activity (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that these helices alone in the hCST context are not sufficient for a chimera to recognize UDP-Gal. Either a region containing helices 2, 3, and 7 or one containing helices 9 and 10 together with helices 1 and 8 is required to confer the UDP-Gal transport activity on a chimeric transporter. The motifs involved in the recognition of UDP-Gal are likely dispersed spatially in the transporter molecule, and the nucleotide sugar is recognized as a result of interactions at multiple points in the substrate-binding site. Some of these contact points, including those on helices 1 and 8, are critically important, whereas either the subset on helices 2, 3, and 7 or the one on helices 9 and 10 may be dispensable provided the other subset is available. The affinities of chimera G1, as a representative of the dual substrate-specific chimeras, for its substrates were compared with those of the parental transporters, hUGT1 and hCST, using microsomal membrane vesicles prepared from S. cerevisiae cells expressing these heterologous transporters. The Km value of hUGT1 was in the range reported before, but that of hCST determined here was considerably higher than those reported previously for reasons that are unclear at the moment (12Segawa H.

The Km value of chimera G1 for UDP-Gal (180 μm) was much higher than that of hUGT1, whereas its affinity for CMP-Sia was almost the same as that of hCST. Substitution of helices 2, 3, and 7 of hUGT1 thus resulted in a significant reduction of affinity for UDP-Gal. This is quite reasonable because these helices constitute a subset of hUGT1 helices that participate together in recognizing UDP-Gal. We showed previously that chimera G1 transports both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, but the activity for UDP-Gal under the standard conditions (at 1 μm substrate) is much lower than that of the parental transporter hUGT1 (7Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that this difference in UDP-Gal transport activity may be largely explained in terms of the difference in affinity for UDP-Gal, although the kcat values of the transport reaction cannot be readily compared because the amounts of transporters expressed in the microsomes are not the same and because we have no reliable measure of the amount of the transporter protein. Gao et al. (17Gao X.-D. Nishikawa A. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4424-4432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently reported mutations that affect the affinity of the yeast GDP-Man transporter for its substrate. Although chimera G1 was not as active as the parental transporters, in particular hUGT1, it was able to work in cells efficiently enough to complement the defects of both Lec2 and Lec8 cells. It should be noted here that intracellular nucleotide sugar concentrations are estimated to be 60–200 μm for UDP-Gal and 70–500 μm for CMP-Sia (40Chiaramonte M. Koviach J.L. Moore C. Iyer V.V.

Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In view of these values, the Km value of chimera G1 for UDP-Gal may not be too high for the transporter to work with reasonable efficiency in cells. Decreased affinity of a chimeric transporter for CMP-Sia would similarly be tolerated by Lec2 cells in complementation for the defective glycosylation system of the cells. It was unexpected that UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia were exported via hUGT1 and hCST, respectively, in exchange for both UMP and CMP. hUGT1 and hCST may not strictly discriminate between UMP and CMP, although the affinity of hCST for UMP may not be very high because direct measurement of transport did not detect accumulation of UMP in CST-expressing membrane vesicles. Chiaramonte et al. (40Chiaramonte M. Koviach J.L. Moore C. Iyer V.V. Wagner C.R. Halcomb R.L. Miller W. Melançon P. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14260-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) recently examined the substrate specificity of CST in detail and reported that CST can transport UMP, although less efficiently than CMP. We reported recently that UGT is not as specific for UDP-Gal as had been widely believed and is also able to transport UDP-GalNAc across the membranes (12Segawa H. Kawakita M. Ishida N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The present “substrate exchange” assay further revealed that UDP-GlcNAc and perhaps UDP-Glc added to the external aqueous phase at 1 mm were exchanged with UDP-Gal as well as UMP trapped inside the membrane vesicles. Because these nucleotide sugars are not transported by hUGT1 in a direct uptake assay carried out at lower substrate concentrations (1 μm), their affinity for hUGT1 must be significantly lower than that of UDP-Gal. The physiological significance of these low affinity substrates remains to be elucidated, but it may not be easily dismissed in view of the fact that the cytoplasmic concentration of nucleotide sugars is of the order of 10–4m. In contrast to hUGT1, the specificity of hCST for nucleotide sugar substrates was quite strict, and hCST did not use nucleotide sugars other than CMP-Sia even at the higher concentrations at which the substrate exchange assays were carried out. The molecular basis for this strict specificity as opposed to the rather broad specificity of hUGT1 is intriguing, but quite obscure at present. Further analysis of the significance of the CMP-Sia specificity-conferring stretch (40 amino acid residues containing helix 7), which was identified in this study, would provide valuable information on this issue."
https://openalex.org/W2085050530,"SNAREs represent a superfamily of proteins responsible for the last stage of docking and subsequent fusion in diverse intracellular membrane transport events. The Vamp subfamily of SNAREs contains 7 members (Vamp1, Vamp2, Vamp3/cellubrevin, Vamp4, Vamp5, Vamp7/Ti-Vamp, and Vamp8/endobrevin) that are distributed in various post-Golgi structures. Vamp4 and Vamp5 are distributed predominantly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane, respectively. When C-terminally tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, the majority of Vamp4 and Vamp5 is correctly targeted to the TGN and plasma membrane, respectively. Swapping the N-terminal cytoplasmic region and the C-terminal membrane anchor domain between Vamp4 and Vamp5 demonstrates that the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of these two SNAREs contains the correct subcellular targeting information. As compared with Vamp5, Vamp4 contains an N-terminal extension of 51 residues. Appending this 51-residue N-terminal extension onto the N terminus of Vamp5 results in targeting of the chimeric protein to the TGN, suggesting that this N-terminal extension of Vamp4 contains a dominant and autonomous targeting signal for the TGN. Analysis of deletion mutants of this N-terminal region suggests that this TGN-targeting signal is encompassed within a smaller region consisting of a di-Leu motif followed by two acidic clusters. The essential role of the di-Leu motif and the second acidic cluster was then established by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2060840701,"This study examines the steady state activity and in vitro motility of single-headed (S1) and double-headed (HMM) myosin VI constructs within the context of two putative modes of regulation. Phosphorylation of threonine 406 does not alter either the rate of actin filament sliding or the maximal actin-activated ATPase rate of S1 or HMM constructs. Thus, we do not observe any regulation of myosin VI by phosphorylation within the motor domain. Interestingly, in the absence of calcium, the myosin VI HMM construct moves in an in vitro motility assay at a velocity that is twice that of S1 constructs, which may be indicative of movement that is not based on a “lever arm” mechanism. Increasing calcium above 10 μm slows both the rate of ADP release from S1 and HMM actomyosin VI and the rates of in vitro motility. Furthermore, high calcium concentrations appear to uncouple the two heads of myosin VI. Thus, phosphorylation and calcium are not on/off switches for myosin VI enzymatic activity, although calcium may alter the degree of processive movement for myosin VI-mediated cargo transport. Lastly, calmodulin mutants reveal that the calcium effect is dependent on calcium binding to the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin. This study examines the steady state activity and in vitro motility of single-headed (S1) and double-headed (HMM) myosin VI constructs within the context of two putative modes of regulation.

Lastly, calmodulin mutants reveal that the calcium effect is dependent on calcium binding to the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin. Myosin VI was the first myosin demonstrated to move toward the pointed (–) end of an actin filament (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Google Scholar). This discovery was based on the hypothesis that reverse direction would require a redesign of the domain of myosin that couples changes in the state of the nucleotide binding pocket and actin-myosin interface to movements of the myosin light chain binding domain (the myosin “lever arm”). Indeed, cryoelectron microscopy revealed that upon ADP release, the effective myosin VI lever arm rotates in the opposite direction (i.e. toward the pointed end of the actin filament) compared with other characterized myosins (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Google Scholar). The light chain-binding region of each head of the myosin VI dimer is thought to consist of a single calmodulin bound to the heavy chain “IQ” motif. This light chain binding region is generally believed to act as a “lever arm” that amplifies nucleotide state-dependent structural changes within the core of the myosin motor domain (for review, see Refs. 2Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Google Scholar and 3Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 182-194Google Scholar). For both myosin II and myosin V, the length of the “lever arm” has been shown to correspond to the step size associated with a single ATPase cycle (4Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Google Scholar, 5Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Google Scholar). Recent kinetic and single molecule data demonstrate that myosin VI has a high duty ratio (i.e. remains strongly bound to actin for >90% of its actomyosin ATPase cycle) and is processive (6De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 32373-32381Google Scholar, 7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y. Iwaki M. Wazawa T. Iwane A.H. Saito J. Ikebe R. Katayama E. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy studies of myosin VI bound to actin showed a very compact effective “lever arm” that appears too small to account for the large step size of myosin VI (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Google Scholar, 7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Google Scholar). Furthermore, the single molecule data reveal that myosin VI has a broad distribution of step sizes centered on 30 nm (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Google Scholar), which also is not consistent with a lever arm mechanism. Thus, it is unclear what role the region containing the IQ motif of myosin VI is playing in motility. To provide further insight into the mechanism of movement, we examined the motility of myosin VI S1 and HMM constructs. The expectation based on myosin V is that for a lever arm mechanism, the asymmetry of the lever arm swing (9Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Google Scholar) will allow an ensemble of the S1 constructs to move actin filaments at a high percentage of the velocity of the HMM construct. Whereas the light chain-binding region of myosin VI may not function as a conventional lever arm, the fact that it contains calmodulin could allow some form of regulation by calcium. As shown for myosin V, there could be altered motor function of myosin VI as a function of calcium concentration (10Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Google Scholar, 11Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Google Scholar). A recent report suggested that calcium binding to myosin VI serves as an “on/off” switch for myosin VI motility (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar). Herein, we perform a more detailed investigation of the nature of calcium regulation of myosin VI using S1 and HMM myosin VI constructs. Myosin VI, like a number of class I myosins, has a putative phosphorylation site in one of its actin binding loops (the “HCM” loop) (13Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Google Scholar). There is evidence that Thr406 is a PAK phosphorylation site (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar, 14Buss F. Kendrick-Jones J. Lionne C. Knight A.E. Cote G.P. Luzio P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1535-1545Google Scholar), and recently Yoshimura et al. (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar) raised the possibility that phosphorylation of the loop serves as an “on/off” switch for motility. However, this mechanism is inconsistent with a recent kinetic study of myosin VI using mutants T406E and T406A, designed to mimic the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated loop, respectively (6De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 32373-32381Google Scholar). Those results suggested that phosphorylation does not alter the rate-limiting step in the actomyosin VI ATPase cycle (ADP release); rather, phosphorylation increases the rate of phosphate release, thereby increasing the duty cycle. Since ADP release also limits in vitro motility, the expectation, based on the work of De La Cruz et al. (6De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 32373-32381Google Scholar), was that phosphorylation would not be an on/off switch for either ATPase activity or motility, contrary to the conclusions of Yoshimura et al. (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar). To resolve the apparent contradictions pertaining to the mechanism and regulation of movement of myosin VI on actin filaments, we examined the in vitro motility and solution kinetics of both single- and double-headed myosin VI with different levels of phosphorylation and at different calcium concentrations. Additionally, we examined the site of calcium action using calmodulin mutants with either N- or C-terminal calcium binding eliminated. Myosin VI Expression and Purification—To create single-headed, S1-like myosin VI constructs (S1), porcine myosin VI wild-type cDNA (15Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Google Scholar) was truncated at Gly840. A FLAG tag (encoding GDYKDDDDK) was inserted at the C terminus to facilitate purification (16Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Google Scholar), and a Myc tag (encoding EQKLISEEDL) was inserted preceding the FLAG tag for use in in vitro motility assays (17Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar). The recombinant heavy chain protein contains the motor domain and the single calmodulin/light chain-binding site (IQ motif). The double-headed, HMM-like construct was truncated at Arg994 to include 20 native heptad repeats of predicted coiled-coil with a C-terminal leucine zipper (GCN4) to ensure dimerization and improve protein yield (18Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Google Scholar) followed by the Myc and FLAG tag sequences. For comparative motility studies, we used two myosin V constructs, single-headed, 1-IQ (S1-like) and double-headed, 6-IQ (HMM) proteins. The double-headed construct was produced as previously described (7Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Google Scholar). Construction of the single-headed construct involved truncation of the myosin V heavy chain at Lys909. As for myosin VI, the FLAG and Myc epitope were added for purification and motility, respectively. Expression of the recombinant single- and double-headed fragments of myosin VI was accomplished via infection of SF9 insect cells with a viral expression vector (baculovirus) capable of driving high level expression of foreign proteins. The SF9 cells were co-infected with recombinant virus expressing the myosin VI heavy chain and a recombinant virus for calmodulin expression. Details of the protein expression and purification have been published (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Google Scholar, 19Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Google Scholar). Greater than five separate protein preparations were used in the experiments described in this study to account for any preparation-specific effects. Calmodulin Mutants—To generate calmodulin with either the N- or C-terminal calcium binding sites eliminated, the cDNA of chicken calmodulin was mutated to make E104A,E140A for the C-terminal mutant and E31A,E67A for the N-terminal mutant. The mutant cDNA constructs were then inserted into a viral expression vector for co-transfection with the myosin VI constructs or into a bacteria expression vector to generate exogenous calmodulin for use during the kinetic and motility experiments. Protein and Reagents—mantADP 1The abbreviation used is: mantADP, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ADP. was synthesized as previously described (20Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from acetone powder as described (21Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Google Scholar) and gel-filtered. Phalloidin (Sigma) was added to stabilize the F-actin following polymerization and dialysis into the appropriate buffer. Apyrase at 0.02 units/ml (Sigma) was used to remove contaminating ADP. The expressed proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels to determine purity of the preparation, and the protein concentrations were measured colorimetrically using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The solutions used in both the kinetic measurements and the in vitro motility assay were at an ionic strength of 78 mm and contained 0.37 mm free Mg2+. They were composed of 10 mm imidazole, 46 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm total EGTA (pH 7.3). The calcium concentration was varied by adjusting the relative amounts of K+-EGTA and Ca2+-K+-EGTA or by the addition of CaCl2 for the pCa 3.0 and pCa 4.0 solutions while maintaining total EGTA at 2 mm. The addition of Na2ATP to the different pCa solutions was adjusted to maintain a final [Mg-ATP] of 2 mm. All experimental solutions contained 6 μm excess calmodulin unless otherwise noted. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Myosin VI Thr406— Phosphorylation of myosin VI was accomplished using a constitutively active recombinant PAK3 protein (provided by G. Coté, Queen's University) following procedures described previously (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of myosin VI was performed by incubation with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Briefly, the myosin VI was treated with 250–500 units of λ-phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2. Untreated samples were incubated in the same reaction buffer without the addition of λ-phosphatase. For blot analysis, anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA) and used at a 1:250 dilution following standard electrophoretic and blotting techniques. Image analysis was performed using Kodak image software (Eastman Kodak Co.). The band intensities were determined relative to the PAK3-treated sample on each blot. Six separate blots were analyzed using five different protein preparations (both S1 and HMM), and the results were pooled to determine the average intensities of the untreated and λ-phosphatase-treated myosin VI constructs. Stopped-flow Experiments and Steady State ATPase Measurements— Transient kinetic measurements were performed as previously described (6De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 32373-32381Google Scholar) at either 25 or 30 °C with an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow device (Surry, UK) in either single mix or sequential mix mode. For the stopped-flow experiments, all of the reagent concentrations are described prior to 1:1 mixing for measurement. mantADP was directly excited at 365 nm, and the fluorescence was measured using a 400-nm long pass filter. N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC)-labeled phosphate-binding protein (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Google Scholar) was excited at 425 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored using a 455-nm colored glass filter. mantADP Release—ADP release from actomyosin VI was determined by preincubating either 1 μm (S1) or 0.5 μm (HMM) in the appropriate pCa solution containing 50 μm mantADP and 5 μm F-actin. The actomyosin VI-mantADP complex was mixed 1:1 with 4 mm Mg-ADP. A single exponential was used to fit the time course of the fluorescence decrease. The experiments were performed at 30 °C. Transient PiRelease—Phosphate release was measured using the stopped-flow apparatus in sequential mix mode. Myosin VI S1 (4 μm; starting concentration) was mixed with Mg-ATP (400 μm), aged for 300 ms to populate the actomyosin-ADP-Pi state, and then mixed with F-actin. The initial burst was fit by a single exponential with a slope. 2 mm ADP was added to the F-actin solution to limit further ATP binding. N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC)-labeled phosphate binding protein (PBP) was added to the initial myosin and actin solutions to produce a final PBP concentration of 4 μm. All solutions and the stopped-flow were preincubated with a Pi mop solution containing 0.5 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 250 μm 7-methylguanosine. The experiments were performed at 25 °C. Steady State ATPase—The Mg-ATPase activity of the myosin constructs was determined using the NADH-coupled assay in the stopped-flow or spectrophotometer by monitoring the absorbance change at 340 nm. The ATPase solution was composed of the described pCa solutions with 200 μm NADH (Sigma), 250 μm phosphoenol pyruvate (Sigma), 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 50 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma) and included 0.025–0.1 μm myosin VI heads. The solutions also contained 0–30 μm F-actin and 6 μm calmodulin (unless otherwise noted). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm Mg-ATP. The assays were performed at 30 °C for direct comparison with the motility data. The transient kinetic data was initially analyzed using the software supplied with the stopped-flow apparatus. Further analysis and the generation of figures were completed using Sigmaplot 4.0 or Microsoft Excel. In Vitro Motility Assay—Single- and double-headed myosin VI (or myosin V) motility was measured at 30 °C using standard procedures (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Google Scholar). The activating solutions were composed of the described pCa solutions supplemented with 0.3–0.5% methylcellulose and 2.5 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, and 2 mm dithiothreitol to inhibit photobleaching. The single- and double-headed myosin VI constructs were attached to the nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslips via an antibody directed against the C-terminal Myc tag (23Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 39: 23-49Google Scholar). The Myc antibodies were added to the flow cell, incubated for 2 min, and washed out, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to block nonspecific sites. The myosin VI was left to incubate for 2 min, followed by washing with solution containing bovine serum albumin. This was followed by the addition of 5 μm sheared unlabelled F-actin to block any noncycling myosin molecules (“dead heads”). Following two washes with 2 mm ATP to remove the excess sheared actin and two washes to remove the ATP, 20 nm rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin was added to the flow cell and incubated for 1 min, and the excess was washed out. The activating solution was added to the flow cell, and the sliding speed of the actin filaments was quantified using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a low light level camera. The raw data were recorded onto videotape and analyzed offline using a motion analysis system (Santa Rosa, CA), as described previously (23Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 39: 23-49Google Scholar). Phosphorylation State of Expressed Wild-type Myosin VI—In Fig. 1A, the untreated, wild-type myosin VI S1 following expression and purification from SF9 cells is shown with myosin VI treated with either PAK3 or λ–phosphatase, probed on a Western blot with an anti-phosphothreonine antibody. The untreated myosin VI samples show relatively high levels of threonine phosphorylation, whereas incubation with λ-phosphatase (+λ) greatly reduced the reactivity to background levels. Similar background levels are observed with the T406E mutant, whether or not it has been exposed to λ-phosphatase or PAK3 treatment, suggesting the antibody is reacting only with the phosphorylated Thr406. Following treatment with PAK3, the intensity of the heavy chain reactivity is increased slightly (Fig. 1A; +PAK) when compared with the untreated myosin VI construct. Several separate preparations were analyzed to determine the level of myosin VI phosphorylation without any further treatment. The blots showed consistently high levels of phosphorylation at Thr406 in the untreated samples (Fig. 1B). Under our culture conditions (serum-containing media), the S1 and HMM myosin VI constructs expressed in SF9 cells are consistently isolated in a highly phosphorylated state that can be subsequently dephosphorylated by λ-phosphatase. Assuming that PAK3 treatment resulted in near 100% phosphorylation, the isolated myosin VI constructs are ∼80% phosphorylated. Steady State ATPase as a Function of Phosphorylation of Thr406—Fig. 2, A and B, depicts the actin-activated ATPase activity of untreated or λ-phosphatase-treated myosin VI S1 and HMM, respectively, as a function of actin concentration. As shown, neither the Vmax nor the KATPase are altered by the level of phosphorylation in either the single- or double-headed construct. PiRelease as a Function of Phosphorylation of Thr406—Previous work showed that the major kinetic difference due to mutations at Thr406 (T406E and T406A) was the rate of Pi release from actomyosin VI (4Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Google Scholar). The release rate was ∼3-fold greater for T406E (50 versus 18 s–1) at 40 μm actin. Accordingly, we measured the rate of Pi release from actomyosin VI with or without phosphorylation of Thr406. At 40 μm actin, the rate was 31.4 ± 1.4 s–1 for the phosphorylated S1 construct and 27.3 ± 2.7 s–1 for the dephosphorylated construct. In Vitro Motility as a Function of Phosphorylation of Thr406—We next addressed whether or not the rate of actin filament sliding is affected by phosphorylation of Thr406 (Table I). The myosin was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min either with or without added λ-phosphatase and then applied to the flow cell to determine the sliding speed. The velocity was unaffected by the level of myosin VI Thr406 phosphorylation. Note that the protocol used for λ-phosphatase treatment, 30 min at 30 °C, leads to a reduction in the in vitro motility rates observed with untreated proteins.Table IComparison of in vitro motility of wild type myosin V and VI constructsActin filament velocityS1, single-headedHMM, double-headednms-1Myosin V322 ± 32459 ± 45Myosin VI (untreated)131 ± 20307 ± 39Control (for λ-phosphatase)238 ± 64Treated (+ λ-phosphatase)222 ± 65 Open table in a new tab Actin-activated ATPase Activity as a Function of Calcium Concentration—To examine the effect of calcium on myosin VI function, actin-activated ATPase assays on single- and double-headed constructs were performed over a range of calcium concentrations from pCa 9.0 to pCa 4.0. The Vmax and KATPase values for the low and high calcium concentrations are provided in Table II with the ATPase rates, at 30 μm F-actin, plotted over the complete calcium range in Fig. 3. The HMM ATPase rates were similar at all [Ca2+]; however, a slight increase is observed at higher [Ca2+]. The ATPase rate of myosin VI S1 was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) at calcium concentrations higher than pCa 5.0 when compared with the rates obtained at pCa 9.0. There is no significant difference in the pCa 5.0 ATPase rate versus either pCa 4.0 or pCa 3.0 rates.Table IIEffect of [Ca2+] on myosin VI actin-activated ATPase activitypCa 9.0pCa 4.0KATPaseVmaxKATPaseVmaxμMhead-1s-1μMhead-1s-1S1 (single-headed)5.7 ± 0.75.3 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.1HMM (double-headed)1.2 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Control experiments were performed to determine whether excess calmodulin was necessary to maintain maximal activity of the myosin VI constructs. For these experiments, 0–30 μm wild-type chicken calmodulin, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, was mixed with myosin VI S1. The actin-activated ATPase activity was measured in a pCa 4.0 or pCa 9.0 solution at 30 °C using the NADH-coupled assay, as described in the legend to Fig. 2 and under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 20 μm F-actin. At both pCa 4.0 and pCa 9.0, the ATPase rates were similar regardless of the calmodulin concentration, in agreement with the results of Yoshimura et al. (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar). The activity ranged from 4.2 to 4.6 s–1 at pCa 9.0 and from 3.0 to 3.3 s–1 at pCa 4.0 (data not shown). Further, as shown previously by Yoshimura et al. (12Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Google Scholar), control steady state measurements indicated that the phosphorylation state did not significantly change the calcium dependent effect observed when the calcium concentration was elevated from pCa 9.0 to pCa 4.0 (data not shown). In Vitro Motility as a Function of Calcium Concentration— The results of in vitro motility assays on single- and double-headed myosin VI over the calcium range pCa 9.0 to pCa 3.0 are shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of calcium, the HMM species moves actin filaments at slightly greater than twice the speed of the S1 constructs (307 versus 131 nms–1). This is a much greater difference than was seen in the case of single-headed versus double-headed myosin V (Table I). At high calcium concentrations, the speed of both constructs is reduced, but to a much greater extent for the HMM construct. Increasing the calcium concentration reduced the single-headed myosin VI motility from 131 to 80 nms–1, a reduction to 60% from pCa 9.0 speeds, whereas the myosin VI HMM motility was reduced to 30% of the pCa 9.0 motility, dropping from a speed of 307 to 103 nms–1. The greatest reduction in sliding speed is observed between pCa 6.0 and pCa 5.0 for the HMM construct, thus over a physiological calcium concentration range. At high calcium concentrations, the motility is similar for the single- and double-headed constructs. mantADP Release Rates as a Function of Calcium Concentration—In the absence of Ca2+, the rate of mantADP release from the actomyosin VI S1 complex was 5.2 ± 1.1 s–1; however, in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+, the rate was reduced to 3.7 ± 0.8 s–1 (Table III). Similar rates of dissociation of mantADP were measured in the presence and absence of calcium for the myosin VI HMM complexed with actin and mantADP. At high calcium concentration (pCa 4.0), the maximal steady state ATPase rates of the single- and double-headed constructs were both nearly identical to the ADP release rate (Tables II and III). However, at low calcium concentrations (pCa 9.0), the activity per head of the HMM species is approximately half that observed for the S1 species and half of the ADP release rate.Table IIIEffect of [Ca2+] on mantADP release rate of wild type myosin VIpCa 9.0pCa 4.0s-1MVI (S1, single-headed)5.2 ± 1.13.7 ± 0.8MVI (HMM, double-headed)5.4 ± 0.43.6 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Site of Action of Calcium—Whereas calcium binding to calmodulin probably mediates the effect on myosin VI activity, it was unclear which calmodulin binding sites are involved. Thus, the myosin VI S1 construct was expressed with a calmodulin mutant that either eliminated both C-terminal calcium binding sites (E104A,E140A) or both N-terminal calcium-binding sites (E31A,E67A). The isolated protein was assayed for the effect on actin-activated ATPase activity. As summarized in Fig. 5, the elimination of calcium binding to the C-terminal sites did not block the calcium effect on myosin VI. However, the removal of the N-terminal calcium-binding sites eliminated a calcium effect on the myosin VI ATPase activity. Myosin VI Phosphorylation at Thr406—We have shown that myosin VI, in our hands, is expressed and purified under conditions that maintain the myosin in a highly phosphorylated state (Fig. 1). Assuming that PAK3 phosphorylates nearly 100% of the myosin, we find ∼80–90% of both myosin VI heads are phosphorylated following purification. Blot analysis and densitometry of the T406E mutant suggests that other threonines within our constructs are not phosphorylated by PAK3 or dephosphorylated by λ-phosphatase (Fig. 1). Further controls using an anti-phosphoserine antibody show no changes in phosphorylation following PAK3 or λ-phosphatase treatment (data not shown). The data demonstrate that the kinetic parameters of the actin-activated ATPase for the single- or double-headed wild-type myosin VI are unchanged whether or not Thr406 is phosphorylated (Fig. 2). The kinetics in either case are intermediate to the values published for the T406E and T406A S1 mutants (6De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 32373-32381Google Scholar), which differed primarily in the KATPase and the actin-activated rate of Pi release. The lack of a change in the KATPase as a function of phosphorylation suggests that the rate of Pi release from actomyosin VI is unchanged. Indeed, in the present experiments, a comparison of the Pi release rate at 40 μm actin revealed no effect of phosphorylation. The rate measured in this study for the wild-type protein with or without phosphorylation of Thr406 (∼30 s–1) was intermediate to the values measured for the T406E and T406A mutants (6De La Cruz E."

To understand interactions of competitive antagonists at the atomic structural level, we studied binding of the curare derivatives d-tubocurarine (d-TC) and metocurine to AChBP using computational methods, mutagenesis, and ligand binding measurements. To account for protein flexibility, we used a 2-ns molecular dynamics simulation of AChBP to generate multiple snapshots of the equilibrated dynamic structure to which optimal docking orientations were determined. Our results predict a predominant docking orientation for both d-TC and metocurine, but unexpectedly, the bound orientations differ fundamentally for each ligand. At one subunit interface of AChBP, the side chain of Tyr-89 closely approaches a positively charged nitrogen in d-TC but is farther away from the equivalent nitrogen in metocurine, whereas, at the opposing interface, side chains of Trp-53 and Gln-55 closely approach the metocurine scaffold but not that of d-TC. The different orientations correspond to ∼170° rotation and ∼30° degree tilt of the curare scaffold within the binding pocket. Mutagenesis of binding site residues in AChBP, combined with measurements of ligand binding, confirms the different docking orientations. Thus structurally similar ligands can adopt distinct orientations at receptor binding sites, posing challenges for interpreting structure-activity relationships for many drugs.

The superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels activated by acetylcholine (ACh), 1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; d-TC, d-tubocurarine; MD, molecular dynamics simulation; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and serotonin mediate rapid synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system. Their strategic position in the pathway of information flow makes them strategic loci for disease processes as well as logical targets for drugs used clinically. The synaptic protrusion of these channels contains a ligand binding domain, which harbors structural components specialized for binding agonists and competitive antagonists. The ligand binding domain is formed at interfaces between subunits where conserved aromatic and hydrophobic residues are clustered (1Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 3: 431-446Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 3Karlin A. Akabas M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In the nicotinic receptor found at the motor endplate, the alpha subunit forms one face of the ligand binding domain, whereas a non-alpha subunit, gamma, delta or epsilon, forms the other face. Studies of subunit chimeras and site-directed mutations have pinpointed key residues critical for stabilizing bound agonists and antagonists. In particular, residues on both alpha and non-alpha subunits are critical for binding competitive antagonists of the curare family, suggesting that these antagonists prevent ACh binding by bridging the subunit interface (4Fu D-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for understanding ligand binding at the atomic structural level recently arose with the discovery of acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), a soluble protein homologous to the ligand binding domains of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Moreover, the crystal structure of AChBP elegantly confirmed the subunit interface hypothesis of the ligand binding site and provided atomic coordinates of residues known to be essential for binding agonists and antagonists (6Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). AChBP therefore emerges as a prototype for gaining in-depth understanding of how small ligands bind to an acetylcholine binding site. A competitive antagonist from the curare family, d-tubocurarine (d-TC), was found to bind with high affinity to AChBP (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to understand binding of d-TC and its methylated analog metocurine at the atomic structural level by applying computational methods in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and measurements of antagonist binding. Unexpectedly, our computational results predict that these two structurally similar ligands bind to AChBP in distinctly different orientations where each ligand contacts different side chains at the subunit interface. These predictions are confirmed by mutagenesis of key interface residues in AChBP followed by measurements of ligand binding. The results have profound implications for understanding ligand binding to pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Materials—125I-α-Bungarotoxin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and d-tubocurarine (d-TC) chloride was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The fully methylated analog of d-tubocurarine, metocurine iodide, was a gift from the Eli Lilly Co. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 HEK) were from the American Type Culture Collection. Molecular Dynamics and Ligand Docking Simulation—We employed a docking strategy that allows flexibility in both the ligand and the protein to predict structures of the complexes formed between AChBP and either d-TC or metocurine. We first carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for AChBP in the presence of explicit solvent molecules at room temperature using the AMBER 7 program (9Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2670) Google Scholar) and collected multiple frames of the equilibrated dynamic AChBP structure. Then we ran ligand docking simulations to each frame of the AChBP structure using the AUTODOCK 3.0.3 program (10Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar), with rotation allowed around bonds to hydroxyl and methoxy groups of each curare analog. We then employed a cluster analysis to identify predominant modes of ligand docking and found a predominant docking orientation for each ligand. A further MD simulation was performed to refine the predominant receptor-ligand complex, and the time average structure was output as the final docked structure. Atomic coordinates of AChBP (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1I9B). To prepare the protein structure for docking, water, ions, and HEPES were first removed from the crystal structure. AChBP was then solvated in a water box, using the TIP3P model for water molecules extended at least 10 Å in each direction from the solute (24,274 water molecules included), and 60 Na+ and 15 Cl– counter ions were added to neutralize the system by employing the LEAP module of the AMBER 7 program (parm99 force field included). The system was first energy-minimized then heated for 30 ps to 298 K, and the Particle Mesh Ewald method was employed to calculate long range electrostatic interactions. Following the heating step, the system was maintained at 298 K, and the MD simulation was computed at 1.0-fs intervals with frames collected every 1.0 ps. After 500 ps of simulation, the system reached equilibrium and trajectories from the subsequent 1500-ps MD simulation were collected for docking computation. During the simulation, the SHAKE algorithm was turned on to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the non-bonded interaction cutoff was set to 8.0 Å. From each of the 1500 frames of the dynamic AChBP structure, atomic coordinates of one pair of the binding site-forming subunits (subunits A and B from the crystal structure) were collected for docking computation. Partial charges were then assigned to each atom of AChBP using the AMBER force field, which employed the restrained electrostatic potential charge model. Crystal structures of metocurine (11Sobell H.M. Sakore T.D. Tavale S.S. Canepa F.G. Pauling P. Petcher T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and d-TC (12Codding P.W. James M.N.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1973; 29: 935-942Crossref Google Scholar) were used to prepare the ligands for docking (Fig. 1). Hydrogen atoms were added by employing QUANTA, followed by a 500-step energy minimization of all the hydrogen atoms using the CHARMM module in QUANTA. Partial charges were assigned to each atom of the ligand using the semi-empirical charge model-1 (CM1) in the AMSOL 6.7.2 program (13Winget P. Thompson J.D. Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 106: 5160-5168Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following settings: the SM5.4PDA solvation mode, the AM1 semi-empirical method, water as solvent, and the “TRUSTE” optimizer and “CHARGE” set to +2 based on the net charge of both ligands. Docking computations were performed using the AUTODOCK 3.0.3 program. Non-polar hydrogens were removed from each ligand, and their partial atomic charges were united with the bonded carbon atoms. For each frame of the AChBP structure, the ligand was arbitrarily positioned at the subunit interface using QUANTA, then docking computations were performed 10 times using the Lamarkian genetic algorithm, with grid sizes 40 × 40 × 40 (grid spacing, 0.375 Å), yielding 10 docked conformations per frame. Parameters for the docking computation were assigned default values. The resulting 15,000 docked orientations for each ligand produced by AUTODOCK 3.0.3 were analyzed by grouping them into clusters with similar ligand orientations. We employed a cluster analysis that classified structures as similar by specifying translational and rotational limits of the docked ligands. We used 1 Å as the translation cutoff for the distance between mass centers of the different docking orientations and 10° as the rotation cutoff for the corresponding differences in rotation axis and rotation angles. For both d-TC and metocurine, one docking orientation predominated and was selected as the most probable structure of the AChBP-ligand complex. The resulting AChBP-ligand complexes were further refined by energy minimization with explicit water molecules and counter ions using the SANDER module of AMBER, followed by a 30-ps heating step and then a 500-ps equilibration MD simulation using the parm99 force field and Particle Mesh Ewald methods described above. CM1 partial atomic charges were assigned to each atom of the ligands to mimic their electrostatic properties in the MD simulation. Time-average structures of the AChBP-ligand complexes from the 500-ps equilibration were output as the final ligand-bound structures. 2Note: PDB files of the protein-ligand complexes are available upon request from the corresponding author. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The previously described synthetic cDNA encoding AChBP (7Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deernick T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the cytomegalovirusbased vector pRBG4 (8Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an MF2 epitope tag was constructed in-frame with the C-terminal coding sequence. Starting with the human alpha7 cDNA subcloned into pRBG4 (28Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we isolated a 3860-bp HindIII to SalI fragment and ligated that with a 575-bp HindIII to BspEI fragment, derived from the AChBP cDNA, and a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide that included the MF2 epitope with a stop codon at the end. The 5′-end of the resulting construct contained five unwanted codons from alpha7; these were removed by bridging BsgI and HindIII sites with a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide. The final coding region therefore begins with the human alpha7 signal peptide (MRCSPGGVWLGLAASLLHVSLQ), which is followed by the AChBP coding sequence and terminates with the MF2 epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK). Point mutations were constructed using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The final AChBP construct and all mutations were confirmed by automated dye terminator sequencing. Expression and Purification of Mutant Receptors and Ligand Binding Measurements—293 HEK cells were transfected with mutant or wild type subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation (14Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two to three days following transfection, wild type or mutant AChBP secreted into the culture medium was purified in one step using anti-MF2 coupled to an agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For a typical determination of competitive antagonist binding, 100 μl of culture medium was combined with 100 μl of anti-MF2-agarose suspended in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.002 mm aprotinin, 0.01 mm pepstatin A), and 200 μl of Tris buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the washing process was repeated two more times. The immobilized protein was suspended in Tris buffer containing protease inhibitors and stored on ice until use. Purity and size of the protein were determined by elution from the agarose gel, electrophoresis on an SDS-PAGE gel, and transfer to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose paper. Protein detection was accomplished with a chemiluminescence kit (Roche Applied Science, Manheim, Germany) using biotin-conjugated anti-MF2 to label the protein, and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and luminol for detection. Ligand binding was measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding by modification of the previously described method (15Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AChBP immobilized on agarose was suspended in Tris buffer at a concentration of ∼1 nm in α-bungarotoxin binding sites and incubated with competitive antagonist for 15 min. 125I-α-Bungarotoxin at a final concentration of 5 nm was added and allowed to bind for 4 min to allow occupancy of approximately half of the total binding sites. The binding reaction was terminated by dilution in Tris buffer, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The washing process was repeated a second time, and radio-activity bound to the pellet was quantified using a γ-counter. The initial rate of toxin binding was calculated to yield the fractional occupancy, Y, and the competition measurements were analyzed according to the equation, 1−Y=1/(1+([ligand]/Kapp)n)(Eq. 1) where n is the Hill coefficient and Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant. To understand binding of competitive antagonists to AChBP at the atomic structural level, we studied binding of d-TC and metocurarine (Fig. 1) using computational methods combined with mutagenesis of key binding site residues and experimental determinations of ligand binding. Because proteins are intrinsically flexible, we employed a computational strategy that accounts for this key property. We therefore used molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to generate an ensemble of protein structures accessible to the ligand and computed docking of ligand to each snapshot of the dynamic structure (16Carlson H.A. McCammon J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In MD simulation, the structure reaches an energy minimum when a plateau is reached in the root mean-squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of atomic distances as a function of time. For AChBP in the presence of explicit water molecules and counter ions, such a plateau is achieved after ∼500 ps of MD simulation, as measured by the r.m.s.d. of either the alpha carbons or all heavy atoms (Fig. 2). The subsequent 1.5-ns period therefore represents the AChBP structure in dynamic equilibrium; the corresponding 1500 frames were collected for computation of ligand docking. Application of AUTODOCK 3.0.3 to these frames generated 10 docked structures per frame to give a total of 15,000 docked structures. We then grouped these into structurally similar clusters by specifying translation and rotation limits of the center of mass of the ligand within the binding pocket (see “Experimental Procedures”). For both ligands, our cluster analysis reveals a predominant ligand orientation within the binding pocket (cluster 1), as well as several smaller clusters with different orientations (clusters 2–6; Fig. 3). For metocurine, comparison of clusters 1 and 2 reveals only a minor shift within the binding pocket, whereas for d-TC, clusters 1 and 2 represent fundamentally different orientations (Fig. 3, lower panel). To assess relative energies of stabilization of d-TC in clusters 1 and 2, we ran a 500-ps MD simulation of the two clusters, extracted 50 frames, and evaluated binding energy of each frame using the MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area) method within AMBER 7 (29Srinivasan J. Cheatham III, T.E. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9401-9409Crossref Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). By this method, the mean energy of cluster 1 was 23 kcal/mole more negative than that of cluster 2, indicating that cluster 1, which is most probable, is also the most stable. These findings agree with previous work showing that the predominant orientation produced by AUTODOCK agrees with bound ligand orientations observed in x-ray structures (30Osterberg F. Morris G.M. Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. Proteins. 2002; 46: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our final predicted structure was obtained by energy minimization of the average structure of the predominant cluster followed by a 500-ps MD simulation of the AChBP-ligand complex. Unexpectedly, despite having identical molecular scaffolds and rigid cyclic structures, d-TC and metocurine are predicted to bind to AChBP in distinctly different orientations (Fig. 4). For d-TC, the tertiary nitrogen atom (N1 in Figs. 1 and 4) juxtaposes the aromatic side chain of Tyr-89 of the principal face of the binding site, whereas for metocurine, the equivalent nitrogen is remote from Tyr-89 and framed by Tyr-192 of the principle face and Trp-53 of the complementary face. This difference in positioning of N1 arises from a 170° rotation of the curare scaffold about the N1–N2 axis, plus a 30° tilt normal to the axis. Consequently, the cis-methoxy groups of metocurine are positioned for favorable hydrophobic interaction with Gln-55 at the complementary face of the binding site, whereas the equivalent methoxy and hydroxyl groups of d-TC penetrate deep into the subunit interface away from key binding site residues. For both ligands, common stabilizing residues include Trp-143 and Tyr-192 from the principal face of the binding site and Leu-112 and Met-114 from the complementary face. Table I lists computed distances between positively charged nitrogen atoms of the two ligands and key residues at the principal and complementary faces of the AChBP binding site. For each ligand the distances correspond to the orientation in the most probable cluster (cluster 1 in Fig. 3); for d-TC, distances are also listed for cluster 2. These inter-atomic distances indicate cation-π interactions that are common for both ligands as well as interactions that are unique for each one. A common interaction involves the indole ring of Trp-143 and the positively charged nitrogen N1 in both ligands; the separation of 4–5 Å is within the range expected for a stable cation-π interaction (27Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ring center of Tyr-89 is more than 1 Å closer to N1 in d-TC than to the equivalent nitrogen in metocurine, whereas the ring center of Trp-53 is 1.5 Å closer to N1 in metocurine than to the counterpart in d-TC. The ring center of Tyr-192 is closer to N1 of metocurine compared with N1 in d-TC, but Tyr-192 also has a large area of contact with both ligands, suggesting similar stabilization of each. Other obvious candidates for stabilization include the two negatively charged residues Asp-108 and Glu-110 on the complementary face of the binding site, but these are far away from charged nitrogens in either ligand.Table IDistance measurement for long range electrostatic interaction between positive charge centers of ligands and AChBP residuesAtoms for measurementMetocurined-Tubocurarine (1)d-Tubocurarine (2)ÅN1(ligand)-6′ ring center (Tyr-89, P subunit)6.24.86.1N1(ligand)-6′ ring center (Trp-53, C subunit)5.26.78.8N1(ligand)-6′ ring center (Trp-143, P subunit)5.13.67.5N1(ligand)-6′ ring center (Tyr-192, P subunit)5.06.53.4N2(ligand)-CG(Asp-108, C subunit)10.815.715.8N2(ligand)-CD(Glu-110, C subunit)7.210.111.1 Open table in a new tab For d-TC the orientation in cluster 2 lacks important interactions present in the most probable cluster 1. In cluster 2 the ring center of Tyr-89 is more than 1 Å farther away from N1 than in cluster 1. Also in cluster 2, the ring center of Trp-143 is more than 2 Å farther away from N1 than in cluster 1. The lower frequency of occurrence, the lower energy of stabilization, and the following mutagenesis results indicate that cluster 2 is not the predominant orientation of bound d-TC. To test our computational results indicating different orientations of d-TC and metocurine bound to AChBP, we mutated residues from each of the seven loops that form the ligand binding site (1Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 3: 431-446Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), transfected each mutant construct into 293 HEK cells, and purified soluble AChBP from the culture medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both wild type and mutant AChBP express in robust quantities and migrate as sharp bands on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 5). The apparent molecular mass of ∼24 kDa is in good agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of 23.8 kDa and suggests little or no glycosylation. A noteworthy exception is the mutation K34S in binding site loop D, which did not express and thus could not be examined. Also, despite robust expression of protein, the mutations Y185F and Y192T did not bind detectable amounts of α-bungarotoxin (not shown), preventing further study. Binding of each ligand was determined by competition against the initial rate of α-bungarotoxin binding. d-TC binds to native AChBP with a dissociation constant of 67 nm, similar to the previously reported value of 93 nm (6Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), whereas metocurine binds with a dissociation constant of 119 nm (Table II). Moreover, mutation of key binding site residues alters ligand affinity in accord with our computational predictions of the predominant orientation of each ligand. The mutations W53F and Q55L elicit large changes in metocurine affinity, whereas they do not affect d-TC affinity (Figs. 6 and 7). On the other hand, the mutation Y89T diminishes d-TC affinity but does not affect metocurine affinity. The mutagenesis results also confirm that a common set of residues stabilizes both ligands, including Trp-143, Tyr-192, Leu-112, and Met-114. Residues that do not contribute to ligand binding are also confirmed and include Thr-57, Asp-108, and Glu-110. Thus, our results from computation, mutagenesis, and ligand binding measurements demonstrate that d-TC and metocurine bind to AChBP in distinctly different orientations.Table IIBinding parameters for metocurine and d-tubocurarine to wild type AChBPAChBP (wt)Metocurined-TubocurarineMeanSDMeanSDKapp (nM)119 (15)aNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of independent measurements.3767 (22)20Hill coefficient0.960.200.760.14Mutagenesis of AChBP, binding affinity changes for metocurine and d-tubocurarineLog (Kmut/Kwt)MutationMetocurined-TubocurarineMeanS.D.MeanS.D.W53F0.88 (8)0.150.06 (6)0.18Q55L-0.54 (3)0.05-0.02 (5)0.01T57V0.13 (1)0.15 (5)0.12Y89T0.14 (2)0.050.80 (5)0.18D108N-0.05 (2)0.020.02 (3)0.06E110Q-0.14 (3)0.020.1 (4)0.13L112K1.13 (2)0.121.53 (4)0.23M114Y0.78 (2)0.170.75 (2)0.11M114T1.05 (1)1 (1)W143F0.75 (3)0.100.80 (2)0.06H145Y0.26 (3)0.120.44 (2)0.15Y192F-0.47 (5)0.23-0.32 (6)0.14D160A-0.03 (1)-0.03 (2)0.13D161A-0.3 (1)-0.52 (1)Y164T-0.8 (5)0.19-0.91 (3)0.25a Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of independent measurements.

J. Neurobiol. 2002; 3: 431-446Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Demonstration that curariform ligands distinguish between the two binding sites of the heteropentameric AChR suggested that the different subunits neighboring the alpha subunits give rise to this distinction (17Sine S.M.

Subunit omission experiments, together with measurements of curare binding, confirmed that the non-alpha subunits are responsible for the ability of competitive antagonists to distinguish between the two binding sites (19Blount P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of chimeric subunits and site directed mutations showed that seven distinct regions, far apart on the protein chain, converge to form the ligand binding site; three regions originate from the alpha subunit and four from the non-alpha subunit (1Sine S.M.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The precise atomic interactions between curare and the binding site remained unknown, but promise for determining these arose with the discovery and structural determination of AChBP (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), a prototype of the ligand binding site of nicotinic receptors. The present work uses a computational approach incorporating protein flexibility to define docking orientations of d-TC and metocurine and tests the predicted orientations by mutagenesis combined with measurements of ligand binding. Our results show that d-TC and metocurine bind to AChBP in distinct orientations in which the curare scaffold rotates 170° around the nitrogen-nitrogen axis and tilts 30° normal to this axis to contact different residues in the binding site. The standard method for computing ligand docking orientation is to use a high resolution x-ray crystal structure combined with a single, favored conformer of the ligand. Such rigid body docking provides tremendous advantages in the speed of the calculations but neglects the intrinsic flexibility of the protein. Recently, however, molecular dynamics simulations have been used to generate an ensemble of snapshots of the dynamic protein to which rigid body docking computation is applied (21Kua J. Zhang Y. McCammon J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8260-8267Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Lin J.-H. Perryman A.L. Schames J.R. McCammon J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5632-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The combination of these two well-established procedures, molecular dynamics simulation and rigid body docking, accounts for flexibility inherent to proteins and allows for the theoretical possibility of conformational selection in the ligand binding process, which is an alternative pathway to the induced fit mechanism, but can yield the same final complex. Our approach includes partial flexibility of the ligand in which rotation about several bonds is allowed, but the cyclic scaffold of the ligand is maintained in the rigid conformation of the x-ray structure. The x-ray structure of d-TC was found to be similar to the structure determined by NMR (23Fraenkel Y. Gershoni J.M. Navon G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that the conformation in the crystal approximates that in solution. Thus our computational analysis of curariform ligand binding to AChBP is made possible by the availability of x-ray structures of both AChBP and the curare derivatives, established MD and docking methods, and the high processing speed of present day computer clusters. What is the root cause of the different orientations of d-TC and metocurine bound to AChBP? Both ligands have the same hydrocarbon scaffold, well-defined hydrophobic concave and hydrophilic convex faces, and two electron-deficient nitrogen atoms. Also, the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring bearing nitrogen N2, and the connecting benzene and phenol rings have similar orientations in d-TC and metocurine (12Codding P.W. James M.N.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1973; 29: 935-942Crossref Google Scholar). However, in metocurine, methylation of N1 in the second tetrahydroisoquinoline ring causes it to rotate away from the center of the molecule, producing a more open structure and an increase of the N1–N2 distance from 8.97 to 10.7 Å (11Sobell H.M. Sakore T.D. Tavale S.S. Canepa F.G. Pauling P. Petcher T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Codding P.W. James M.N.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1973; 29: 935-942Crossref Google Scholar). The docked orientations described here indicate that the conformations of free d-TC and metocurine are minimally altered when bound to AChBP. Thus the differences in bound orientations of the two ligands owe to the tertiary configuration of N1 in d-TC versus the quaternary configuration in metocurine, leading to a more compact structure of d-TC relative to metocurine and different distances separating N1 and N2. The present results illustrate the versatility of the binding site in AChBP to dock curariform ligands. Despite their very different bound orientations, d-TC and metocurine bind with affinities that differ by only 2-fold; the higher affinity of d-TC likely results from penetration of its more compact structure deeper into the binding pocket. However, both ligands are nearly completely enveloped by the binding site, maximizing van der Waals contacts, and the presence of two electron-deficient nitrogen atoms in each ligand ensures that at least one of these will be stabilized by the aromatic-rich binding pocket through cation-π interactions. These include stabilization of N1 by Trp-143 in both ligands of the principal face of the binding site and, differentially, for d-TC, by Tyr-89 of the principal face, and for metocurine, by Trp-53 of the complementary face. Tyr-192 of the principal face stabilizes both ligands but in different ways. For metocurine there is the expected π-cation interaction with N1, but for d-TC the distance of separation is too great; instead Tyr-192 makes a π-π interaction through contact with the benzene ring of d-TC. For both ligands, nitrogen N2 is located at the periphery of the docked structure and is not involved in electrostatic interactions. N2 is too far away from aromatic residues in the center of the binding pocket, and, although it is theoretically close enough to be stabilized by Asp-108 and Glu-110 at the periphery, our mutagenesis results indicate no contribution of either negatively charged side chain. A variety of hydrophobic interactions are also established with both ligands. For metocurine, the concave hydrophobic face fits into a bulge created by the disulfide-bonded cysteines 187 and 188 that form a hairpin between β-strands 9 and 10 of the principal face. For d-TC, on the other hand, the concave hydrophobic face rotates away from this hairpin to juxtapose with Met-114 from the complementary face. Similarly, Leu-112 of the complementary face makes hydrophobic contacts with the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring harboring N2 in both ligands, although opposite faces of the ring are contacted by Leu-112. The mutations M114T and L112K cause the greatest losses of affinity among the mutations studied, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are major sources of stabilization for each ligand. Conversely, Gln-55 of the complementary face closely opposes the benzene ring of metocurine, perhaps making a carbamino-π contact, whereas Gln-55 is far from d-TC, owing to its deeper penetration into the binding pocket; the mutation Q55L selectively enhances affinity of metocurine, presumably through enhanced hydrophobic contacts. Our overall results show that both d-TC and metocurine are stabilized by residues from both subunits at the binding site interface, in agreement with extensive studies of ligand binding to the nicotinic receptor at the motor endplate. However, contrary to expectations, the two ligands bind in fundamentally different orientations to AChBP, interacting with different residues in the binding pocket. These findings raise the possibility that, for the AChR at the motor endplate, different curariform ligands bind in different orientations, while still relying on contributions from both subunits at the binding site interface. Using homology models of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (24Le Novere N. Corringer P.J. Changeau J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

https://openalex.org/W1967830896,"In Escherichia coli, three different types of proteins engage the SecY translocon of the inner bacterial membrane for translocation or insertion: 1) polytopic membrane proteins that prior to their insertion into the membrane are targeted to the translocon using the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor; 2) secretory proteins that are targeted to and translocated across the SecY translocon in a SecA- and SecB-dependent reaction; and 3) membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains, requiring SRP for targeting and SecA for the translocation of the periplasmic moiety. In addition to its role as a targeting device for membrane proteins, a function of the bacterial SRP in the export of SecB-independent secretory proteins has also been postulated. In particular, β-lactamase, a hydrolytic enzyme responsible for cleavage of the β-lactam ring containing antibiotics, is considered to be recognized and targeted by SRP. To examine the role of the SRP pathway in β-lactamase targeting and export, we performed a detailed in vitro analysis. Chemical cross-linking and membrane binding assays did not reveal any significant interaction between SRP and β-lactamase nascent chains. More importantly, membrane vesicles prepared from mutants lacking a functional SRP pathway did block the integration of SRP-dependent membrane proteins but supported the export of β-lactamase in the same way as that of the SRP-independent protein OmpA. These data demonstrate that in contrast to previous results, the bacterial SRP is not involved in the export of β-lactamase and further suggest that secretory proteins of Gram-negative bacteria in general are not substrates of SRP.

To target newly synthesized proteins to the SecYEG translocon of the inner bacterial membrane, Escherichia coli employs two different protein targeting routes. Secretory proteins destined for the periplasmic space or the outer membrane are recognized posttranslationally by the cytoplasmic chaperone SecB and are subsequently transferred to SecA, which translocates the preprotein across the SecYEG channel in an ATP-dependent manner (1Behrmann M.

Upon binding of SRP, ribosome-associated nascent chains of membrane proteins are cotranslationally targeted to FtsY, the bacterial homologue of the SRP receptor, and are finally inserted into the lipid bilayer through the SecYE translocon (3MacFarlane J.

Targeting of these proteins to SecY is exclusively mediated by SRP and FtsY, leading to a stable binding of ribosome-associated nascent chains to the translocon. Translocation of the periplasmic moiety across the inner membrane, however, requires the activity of SecA. There is conflicting evidence as to the involvement of SRP in the targeting of a subset of secretory proteins like β-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), or ribose-binding protein (11Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The depletion of either FtsY or Ffh concomitantly leads to decreased translocation of these proteins, suggesting that SRP and its receptor are involved in their export across the inner bacterial membrane (11Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R.

Cell. 1990; 63: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because these proteins are considered to be SecB-independent, it had been proposed that SRP functions as an export-specific chaperone rather than a targeting factor for β-lactamase, PhoA, and ribose-binding protein, replacing SecB during export (11Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The interpretation of in vivo Ffh and FtsY depletion experiments is, however, complicated by the observation that targeting and integration of SecY is SRP-dependent. Decreasing the cellular concentrations of either SRP or FtsY simultaneously reduces the concentration of active translocons, making it difficult to differentiate between those export defects caused primarily by SRP/FtsY depletion and those originating from diminished concentrations of SecY (6Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Seluanov A.

However, signal sequence mutants of the SecB-independent secretory protein PhoA can be cross-linked to SRP provided that the hydrophobicity of the signal sequence is increased by inserting multiple leucine residues (7Valent Q.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Binding of trigger factor to OmpA nascent chains subsequently prevents SRP binding to OmpA. In the absence of trigger factor, however, SRP can be cross-linked to the OmpA signal sequence (18Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Among the SecB-independent secretory proteins, β-lactamase has always been considered to be a bona fide SRP substrate, in particular because its signal sequence is more hydrophobic than signal sequences of other secretory proteins (7Valent Q.A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2001; 79: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, so far no detailed in vitro analyses have been performed to really study the involvement of SRP in the targeting pathway of β-lactamase. Our analyses using protease protection assays, flotation gradient experiments, and chemical cross-linking demonstrate that targeting and export of β-lactamase proceed independently of the SRP pathway.

Restriction enzymes and other reagents for cloning and DNA purification were purchased from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, FR Germany), Qiagen (Hilden, FR Germany), and Novagen (Schwalbach, Germany). Cell Growth and General Techniques—E. coli strains for plasmid isolation were cultured in Luria Broth. For the preparation of inner membrane vesicles, cells were cultured in phosphate-buffered medium as described by Müller and Blobel (20Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell extracts for in vitro transcription and translation were prepared from cells grown either on S30 medium (20Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or on S150 medium (21Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When required, antibiotics were added to the culture medium at the following concentrations: 50 μg of ampicillin/ml, 25 μg of kanamycin/ml, and 10 μg of tetracycline/ml. Plasmid Construction—pJMSKK, a kanamycin-resistant pBlue-script derivative, was constructed as follows. The ampicillin resistance gene (bla) of pBluescript SK+ was excised with BspHI and the vector blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The bla gene was replaced with the kanamycin cassette from pFDX2322, cut with NaeI and SpeI, and also blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. pJMSKK was used to construct a vector carrying the bla gene under T7 promoter control. For this, the bla gene of pBluescript SK+ was excised with BspHI, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ligated into the EcoRV site of pJMSKK. The constructed plasmid was termed pJMSKK Bla7. For the construction of the secA36 allele under T7-RNA polymerase control, genomic DNA of the SecA36 mutant GN42 was amplified using the primer SecA1 (5′-GAGATTTTCATATGCTAATCAAATTGTTAAC-3′) and SecA2 (5′-CGCAGAATCCTCGAGCTTTTACTTCAACAG-3′) introducing an NdeI and an XhoI cleavage site. After restriction digest the PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET19b under the control of the T7 promoter. The resulting plasmid was termed pET19b-SecA36 and coded for a SecA36 derivative carrying an N-terminal His10 tag to expedite purification.

For the purification of His10-SecA36, pET19b-SecA36 was transformed into the E. coli strain TUNER(DE3) pLysS. Cells were grown at 37 °C overnight on Luria Broth supplemented with d-glucose (1%), washed, and subcultured on the same medium lacking glucose. At an A600 of 0.5, cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, incubated further until at an A600 of 1.5–1.8, and harvested. After resuspension in 50 mm triethanolamine acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCH3COO (KOAc), 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, cells were disrupted using a French press at 8000 pounds/square inch in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 30,000 × g, the supernatant was subjected to high speed centrifugation (150,000 × g), and SecA36 overproduction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the supernatant and subsequent Coomassie staining. For further purification the supernatant was buffer-exchanged in 2.5-ml steps on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), to adapt the salt conditions to 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 300 mm KOAc, suitable for further purification using the TALON® IMAC System (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The buffer exchanged supernatant was supplemented with Complete/EDTA protease inhibitor mixture and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and 3.5 ml of this material was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 ml of the Talon resin. Washing was performed according to the manufacturer's manual with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 300 mm KOAc. After washing, the resin with the bound protein was filled into 2-ml gravity-flow columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and proteins were eluted stepwise with increasing imidazole concentrations (0–150 mm). SecA36 fractions were analyzed on a Coomassie-stained SDS gel, and pure SecA36 containing fractions were pooled. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. In Vitro Reactions—The composition of the transcription/translation system of E. coli and the purification of its components, the preparation of INV, the flotation gradient analysis, and proteinase K protection assay employed in this study have been described previously (1Behrmann M.

Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Synthesis of nascent chains was achieved as described in Beck et al. (18Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), in the presence of RNase H (1 unit/25 μl), 10 μg/ml 10Sa RNA antisense oligonucleotide (25Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), and 0.5 μg/μl oligonucleotide Bla-175 (5′-GCAGGCATCGTGGTGTCACG-3′). Chemical cross-linking using DSS (Pierce) was performed as described previously (18Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The in vitro reactions for subsequent cross-linking experiments were performed in the presence of HEPES-NaOH instead of triethanolamine acetate. Immunoprecipitation was performed in 4–6-fold scaled up reactions using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against trigger factor and Ffh, covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose matrix (26Alconada A. Gartner F. Honlinger A. Kubrich M. Pfanner N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 263-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sample Analysis and Quantification—All samples were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (13, 15, or 7–17%). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by PhosphorImaging using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. In Vitro Synthesis and Translocation of β-Lactamase—For analyzing its targeting to and its translocation across the E. coli membrane, the β-lactamase gene of pBluescript II was cloned under a T7-dependent promoter in a kanamycin-resistant pBluescript derivative. In vitro synthesis was performed using a highly purified E. coli cell extract. Transport of β-lactamase was analyzed using inside-out inner membrane vesicles (INV) and was compared with the transport of the SRP-dependent inner membrane protein mannitol permease (MtlA) and the SRP-independent outer membrane protein OmpA. As shown in Fig. 1, when synthesized in the absence of INV all three substrates were sensitive toward proteinase K digestion, but became protease-resistant in the presence of INV. Protease protection of both OmpA and β-lactamase in the presence of INV was accompanied by signal sequence cleavage as indicated by the presence of a protease-resistant band of lower molecular mass. The lower molecular mass of the membrane-protected fragment of MtlA (MtlA-MPF) is due to the cleavage of the large C-terminally located cytoplasmic domain. The transport efficiency into INV of β-lactamase is lower than the transport efficiency of OmpA, a phenomenon which has also been observed in vivo. A SecY Mutation Interfering with Efficient SecA Binding to the Translocon Blocks β-Lactamase Transport—Although both the SRP-dependent and the SecA-dependent protein targeting pathways converge at the SecYEG complex in the inner bacterial membrane, we have shown recently (27Koch H.G. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by using translocon mutants that different domains of SecY and different components of the translocon are engaged by both processes. These translocon mutants were assayed for their ability to transport β-lactamase. As shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), the translocation of β-lactamase is completely blocked in INV prepared from the secY mutants secY39 and secY205. A severe translocation defect is furthermore observed in INV from a secG deletion strain and in SecE-depleted INV. In these translocation assays using mutant INV, the effects of transport on β-lactamase are indistinguishable from those of transport on the SRP-independent secretory protein OmpA (Fig. 2, middle panel) but clearly different from those on the integration of the SRP-dependent substrate MtlA (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The integration of MtlA is not significantly influenced by the secY205 mutation and the secG deletion. The biochemical characterization of the secY205 mutant had revealed that the translocation defect originates primarily from reduced SecA binding to the mutant SecY (28Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and consequently, the transport of SecA-independent proteins like MtlA is not impaired by this mutation. The function of SecG is also specifically associated with the SecA function (29Nishiyama K. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and does not seem to be required for SecA-independent protein transport (27Koch H.G. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The secY39 mutation affects both the SecA-dependent as well as the SRP-dependent protein transport. However, the effects on β-lactamase and OmpA translocation are more severe than on MtlA integration. A complete block of MtlA integration can only be observed in SecE-depleted INV (Fig. 2, middle panel). SecE depletion concomitantly leads also to reduced SecY concentrations, because in the absence of SecE, SecY is rapidly degraded by the membrane-bound protease FtsH (30Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), resulting in a transport defect for both SecA- and SRP-dependent proteins. In summary, these data indicate that β-lactamase translocation depends on the same domains of SecY and the same components of the translocon as the translocation of the SRP-independent substrate OmpA which argues for a SecA-dependent translocation of β-lactamase. The SecA dependence was directly tested by utilizing a new assay system for SecA-dependent proteins, based on the biochemical complementation of the secY205 mutant INV with a mutant SecA (28Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A systematic search for secA mutations suppressing the secY205 phenotype led to the isolation of allele-specific suppressors, one of which is the secA36 mutant, carrying a single amino acid substitution within the high affinity ATP-binding site of SecA (28Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By using PCR we amplified the secA36 allele from the mutant strain GN42 and cloned it into a T7-dependent expression vector for overexpression and purification. The purified SecA36 was then tested for its ability to suppress in vitro the translocation defect of the secY205 INV. As shown in Fig. 3 (top panel), in the absence of SecA36, no β-lactamase translocation into secY205 INV was observed; the presence of SecA36, however, enhanced β-lactamase translocation significantly (Fig. 3, top panel, compare lanes 6 and 12). Purified wild type SecA, on the other hand, was unable to overcome the SecY205 defect (data not shown). Enhanced translocation of β-lactamase in the presence of SecA36 was not only observed for secY205 INV but also for wild type INV, which is in agreement with the enhanced ATPase activity of SecA36. As a control, we also tested the effect of SecA36 on the translocation of the SecA-dependent OmpA (Fig. 3, lower panel). Like for β-lactamase, the addition of SecA36 greatly enhanced the translocation of OmpA into secY205 INV and also into wild type INV. These data demonstrate that β-lactamase, despite being a SecB-independent protein, requires SecA for translocation in the same way as the SecB-dependent protein OmpA. Ribosome-associated Nascent Chains of β-Lactamase Are Not Cotranslationally Targeted to the SecY Translocon—In principle, the observation that export of β-lactamase is catalyzed by SecA does not exclude an involvement of SRP during the targeting of β-lactamase to the SecYEG complex. SRP-dependent targeting and SecA-dependent translocation as individual steps have been identified in the export of bacterial membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains (8Neumann-Haefelin C.

Using the bacterial artificial chromosome approach, we have cloned and characterized the human UGDH promoter. The core promoter of –644 nucleotides conferred reporter gene activity in transient transfection assay of a variety of cell types, including MRC5 fibroblasts and the HepG2 hepatoma cell line. The minimal promoter of –100 nucleotides contains a functional inverted TATA box. No consensus CAAT sequence was found up to –2133 nucleotides. The expression of UGDH was up- and down-regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and hypoxia, respectively. TGF-β enhanced the activity of all the deletion constructs, except the minimal promoter. Hypoxia slightly increased the activity of the short promoter-containing constructs but decreased that of the –374 nucleotides and core promoter constructs. The core promoter contained numerous GC-rich sequences for the binding of Sp1 transcription factor. Bisanthracycline, an anti-Sp1 compound, decreased UGDH mRNA expression and inhibited the core promoter constructs activity. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays after TGF-β stimulation demonstrated an increased DNA binding of the nuclear extract proteins to the two Sp1 sequences located in the –374-bp promoter. By contrast, nuclear extract proteins from hypoxia-treated cells demonstrated a decreased binding of the consensus Sp1 sequence. These results indicate that numerous Sp1 cis-acting sequences of the UGDH core promoter are responsible for up- and down-regulation of the gene after TGF-β stimulation and in hypoxic conditions, respectively.

EC 1.1.1.22) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of UDP-glucuronate from glucose. In animals, it constitutes the unique pathway for glucuronate formation (1Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because glucuronate is a component of glycosaminoglycans, the mutation inactivation of UGDH (sugarless) abolishes glycosaminoglycan assembly and, consequently, abolishes GAG-dependent growth factor signaling. For example, such a mutation was shown to induce cardiac valve malformation in zebrafish (2Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or the “wingless” and “no white eyes” phenotypes in Drosophila (3Binari R.C. Staveley B.E. Johnson W.A. Godavarti R.

Wegrowski Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structure of the enzyme is well conserved between the species and phyla. The cloned mammalian proteins from different species showed overall 97% identity. The human sequence has 27% identity with the Escherichia coli ortholog, with 100 and 60% identity of the NAD+ binding and the catalytic sites, respectively (8Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Bontemps Y.

Glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans and hyaluronan are ubiquitous components of extracellular matrix and pericellular spaces. There is a growing body of information on the implication of GAGs in cell behavior, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, spreading, migration, and cancer growth and metastasis (9Iozzo R.V.

TGF-β is the most potent stimulator of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, including that of hyaluronan. Its action, however, depends on the cell type (12Bassols A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of GAGs is also modulated by oxygen cell status. Hypoxic endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts enhanced heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate ratio, which led to an increase of basic fibroblast growth factor reactivity on the cell surface (13Karlinsky J.B.

It was also shown that the level of intracellular UDP-glucuronate could influence GAG synthesis (1Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The knowledge of the cytokine regulation of UGDH expression is scanty. The human UGDH was shown to be an early response gene after interleukin-1β treatment of ocular fibroblasts (15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), as well as an early androgen response gene in breast cancer (16Lapointe J. Labrie C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4486-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was also up-regulated by fetal serum (8Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

TGF-β signaling in the cells is initiated through receptor-dependent Ser/Thr kinase phosphorylation of SMAD3 (18Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which forms a heterodimer complex with SMAD4 (19Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The complex is translocated into the nucleus where it activates its target genes (20Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). SMAD proteins, however, cooperate with other transcription factors to activate the promoters of different genes. In several systems, Sp1 is a powerful intermediate of the TGF-β signaling cascade. For example, Sp1 drives TGF-β activation of promoters such as the collagen α1(I) (21Cutroneo K.R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2000; 27: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and α2(I) chains (22Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

The involvement of Sp1 in the TGF-β-mediated induction of different genes is mediated by its interaction with the canonical GC-rich sequences, implicating the formation of a complex with phosphorylated SMAD3.

Several genes are activated through Sp1 after TGF-β treatment and export proteins, and it was proposed that Sp1 is a major regulator of the expression of extracellular proteins (31Verrecchia F. Rossert J. Mauviel A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 755-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In TAT-less promoters, Sp1 can also drive the basal activity of the gene (32Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. Casola S. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the regulation of UGDH expression. The expression of its mRNA was studied in different cell strains of human origin. We cloned the human UGDH promoter and defined its minimal sequence and basal activity. We showed that the core promoter of 650 bp is activated under TGF-β treatment through numerous Sp1 sites. On the other hand, in HepG2 cells, which harbored a high constitutive level of UGDH activity, we demonstrated that hypoxic conditions led to the down-regulation of this enzyme by nuclear depletion/inactivation of the same Sp1 protein. We thus proposed that Sp1 transcription factor may be a universal modulator of UGDH expression and, by modulating the enzyme level, may control the UDP-glucuronate level in different metabolic pathways, including GAG synthesis. Cell Culture—The following cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: HepG2 (ATCC number HB-8065, hepatocellular carcinoma); MCF7 (ATCC number HTB-22, adenocarcinoma cell line); K562r and K562s (resistant or sensitive to doxorubicin treatment, respectively) derived from K562 (ATCC number CCL-243, leukemia, chronic myeloid) (33Grant S. Turner A. Nelms P. Yanovich S. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 808-814PubMed Google Scholar); HT1080 (ATCC number CCL-121, fibrosarcoma cell line); MG63 (ATCC number CRL-1427, osteosarcoma cell line); and MRC5 (ATCC number CCL-171, normal lung fibroblasts). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany). NCTC2544 cells (ICLC number HL97002, skin keratinocytes cell line) were obtained from Interlab Cell Line Collection. Cells were cultured in the media recommended by the supplier, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before TGF-β stimulation, confluent MRC5 cells were preincubated for 18 h in a medium containing 0.5% FCS, and the stimulation was performed as indicated in the figure legends. For studies involving hypoxic conditions, HepG2 cells were cultured to confluence, then the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were purged with 100% N2 for 15 min and then incubated with 0.1–20% O2/5% CO2/balance N2) for 24 h. Oxygen concentration was monitored with an Oxypocket oxymeter (Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France). Northern Blot—Total RNA from different cell lines were extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate method and separated on 1.1% denaturing gel electrophoresis. After capillary transfer and UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized at 60 °C with random priming-labeled 496-bp insert containing a part of human open reading frame UGDH (8Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed and exposed to X-Omat-AR film in an intensifier screen containing cassette at –80 °C for various periods. After stripping, membranes were rehybridized with full-length cDNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, a generous gift of Prof. P. Fort, Montpellier, France) (34Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar) or with the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 cDNA probe (35Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Promoter Cloning and Plasmid Constructions—The DNA from the BAC RP11-472B18 (BACPAC Resource Center at the Children's Hospital, Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) was digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme, and the fragments were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel followed by a Southern blot. The blot was hybridized with a 165-bp probe containing the 5′ portion of UGDH cDNA (6Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. Wegrowski Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A 3-kb fragment, which gave a weak hybridization band with the probe, was excised from the gel, subcloned into a pBluescript plasmid, and fully sequenced. The resulting sequence was analyzed with the Transfac data base (36Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and MatInspector algorithms (37Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar), using the Transcription Element Search System (available at www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess). A 2.133-kb EcoRI/SacI fragment containing 50 bp from exon 1 and 2.083 kb from the 5′ untranslated region was subcloned into pGL2-basic (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) and named the –2133 construct. Additional constructions were made using restriction endonucleases: HincII/SacI for the –644 construct and PvuII/SacI for the –100 construct, respectively. Other constructs were made using PCR-amplified pBluescript containing the 3-kb fragment with forward primers containing KpnI site (for –249 construct, 5′-TTAGGTACCCTGAGCTGGCCAAAGCGGA/5′-TCGGACAGCACCTTCCTACG; for –196 construct, 5′-TTAGGTACCCAGCCAGGACCAGCCC/5′-TCGGACAGCACCTTCCTACG; and for –165 construct, 5′-AATGGTACCTGAGCGTGAAGGAAATAGGG/5′-TCGGACAGCACCTTCCTACG) or with a forward primer containing the HincII site (for –374 construct, 5′-TCGTCGACCCACGACCGC/5′-TCGGACAGCACCTTCCTACG). The amplimers were digested by KpnI/SacIorby HincII/SacI and subcloned into pGL2-basic. Mutation in the inverted TATA box was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam Zuidoost, The Netherlands) with the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TCGCAGGCAAAAGCCCCCAAATACGGGCTCAGGCC and 5′-GGCCTGAGCCCGTATTTGGGGGCTTTTGCCTGCGA. The PCR was performed on the –100 construct according to the manufacturer's instruction. All plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis constructs were sequenced to confirm the intended structure. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—UGDH promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs (3 and 1 μg for MRC5 and HepG2 cells, respectively) were co-transfected into MRC5 cells or HepG2 cells with 25 ng of pRL-TK vector, containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter upstream of Renilla luciferase gene using the Fugene-6® transient transfection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h of incubation in the appropriate media, MRC5 and HepG2 cells were harvested and lysates were prepared. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Lumi-One luminometer (Bioscan, Washington, D. C.) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent flasks of TGF-β-treated or untreated MRC5 or from HepG2 cells incubated under normal aerobic conditions or under 1% O2 (see hypoxia experiments above), as described by Dignan et al. (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing consensus Sp1 site (underlined: 5′-CCCTTGGTGGGGGCGGGGCCTAAGCTGCG) and an His-mutated counterpart (5′-CCCTTGGTGGGTTGGGGGCCTAAGCTGCG, mutated bases in boldface) were purchased from Geneka, Montreal, Canada. The oligonucleotides corresponding to three potential Sp1 sites on UGDH promoter were as follows: Sp1–253 (5′-CGCGGTAGGGGCGGAGCGCTGA); Sp1–276 (5′-CACGCAGCCCCGCCCAGCGCCG); and Sp1–312 (5′-GCGGCGCGCCCCCGT CCCCTGGTC). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed overnight and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (New England BioLabs). Nuclear proteins (7.5 μg/assay) were incubated at room temperature, in a reaction solution containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 50 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments, a 100× molar excess of non-labeled competitor oligonucleotides was added, as indicated in the figures legends. After 15 min, the 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (1.75 fmol) was added, and the incubation was followed by another 30 min at room temperature, in a total volume of 20 μl. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature and 120 V for 4 h. The gels were dried, and complexes were revealed by autoradiography. For supershift assay, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 μl of antiserum (0.2 mg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h before analysis by EMSA as described above. Human anti-Sp1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-420) and from Geneka. Human anti-Sp3 polyclonal immunoserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-644). The Sp1 anti-sera specifically detect the presence of the Sp1 transcription factor, whereas the Sp3 anti-serum lightly cross-reacted with the Sp1 transcription factor (verified by Western blot, data not shown). Nonspecific IgGs were incubated with the nuclear extracts as described and used as negative control. Nuclear extract from HeLa cells (Geneka) were used as positive control. Basal Expression of UGDH mRNA, Effects of TGF-β, and Hypoxia—It was previously shown that UGDH is ubiquitously expressed in all analyzed tissues (8Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We used a panel of different human cells in culture to establish the basal expression of the enzyme. All the tested cells expressed a double transcript of UGDH mRNA of 2.8 and 3.4 kb (Fig. 1), with a slightly different proportion of those two transcripts. The lowest mRNA expression was observed in umbilical vein endothelial cells and in monocytes, whereas HepG2 hepatoma cells displayed the highest level. The mRNA abundance suggests that the transformation of these epithelial cells of hepatic origin had little or no influence on UGDH expression. Skin fibroblasts and MRC5 embryonic pulmonary fibroblasts expressed an intermediate level of UGDH mRNA. In dermal fibroblasts, we observed some variability of the expression, depending on the age of donor, biopsy site, and cell passage number. Consequently, we decided to use MRC5 fibroblasts, which give more constant results as a model of low UGDH expression, to analyze the TGF-β stimulatory effects, and the HepG2 hepatoma cells as a model of high UGDH expression, to analyze the hypoxia inhibitory effects. Because TGF-β is a major growth factor able to influence GAG synthesis, we studied its effects on UGDH expression by MRC-5 cells. TGF-β increased the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into GAG fraction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In parallel, TGF-β enhanced the steady-state level of UGDH mRNA. Both transcripts were equally affected (Fig. 2B). The effect was time-dependent, with pronounced expression after 8 h of stimulation (Fig 2C). The expression was maximal after 12-h stimulation and persisted for 24 h. Cycloheximide had an additive effect (Fig. 2D), indicating that the stimulation did not need new protein synthesis and that UGDH is a direct response gene after TGF-β treatment. The late response of UGDH suggests, however, that the mechanism of stimulation may be complex and involve the recruitment of different transcription factors. Hypoxia is another factor capable of influencing GAG synthesis (13Karlinsky J.B. Rounds S. Farber H.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For that reason, we studied the effect of oxygen status on the UGDH mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. Twenty-four hours of hypoxia inhibited the steady-state UGDH mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Hypoxia also reduced the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into the GAG in HepG2 cells cultures (Fig. 3B). The effect was similar in MRC5 cells (not shown). Characterization of UGDH Promoter—To investigate the mechanism of the regulation of UGDH expression by TGF-β and hypoxia, the 3-kb genomic fragment, including the exon 1 was cloned from a BAC containing a part of the human chromosome 4p (6Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. Wegrowski Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). From this construction, a subcloned fragment of 2183 bp, limited by EcoRI and SacI, was fully sequenced (Fig. 4). It contained 50 bases of the previously determined 5′ untranslated region. A detailed computer analysis using the Transfac (36Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and MatInspector (37Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) algorithms revealed a high probability score for the presence of the promoter. The inverted TATA box was located 22 bases upstream from the transcription start site, and no consensus CAAT sequence was found. The proximal fragment of 374 bp contained seven consensus sequences for Sp1 transcription factor and one consensus sequence for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (39Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). To ascertain the transcriptional promoter activity, a panel of constructions containing different lengths of the 5′-flanking region coupled to firefly luciferase reporter gene was generated (Fig. 5A). The transient transfection of the constructs drove the luciferase activity resulting from the promoter activity in both MRC5 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 5B). The luciferase level was always higher in HepG2 cells compared with MRC5 fibroblasts, even for the shortest constructs. Increasing the length of the promoter up to –644 bp enhanced the basal expression of the reporter gene. The longest construct, containing 2133 bp of the promoter, displayed about 30% of the activity compared with the –644-bp construct, suggesting the presence of inhibitory elements. The shortest construct (–100 bp) showed low, but measurable, promoter activity. This sequence contained only one Sp1 consensus site and an inverted TATA box. Mutation of this box decreased the reporter gene activity to the background level (Fig. 5C), indicating that –100 bp may be defined as a minimal promoter for the UGDH gene and that the inverted TATA box is necessary for its activity. Influence of TGF-β and Hypoxia on Promoter Activity—The constructs containing different lengths of the UGDH promoter were transiently transfected to MRC5 cells and HepG2 cells to study the mechanisms of TGF-β and hypoxia effects, respectively. TGF-β (10 ng/ml) had no effect on minimal and –2133-bp promoters but enhanced the activity of all the constructs up to –644 bp (Fig. 6A). The strongest stimulation was observed for the constructs of –374 and –644 bp. These fragments contain six and eleven additional Sp1 consensus sequences, respectively (Fig. 4). When the plasmids were transiently transfected into the HepG2 cells maintained in 1% O2, the activity of the constructs –165 and –196 bp were enhanced about 2-fold in comparison to the cells cultured in 20% O2. The constructs containing –374, –644, and –2133 bp were strongly inhibited in hypoxic conditions suggesting that the hypoxia inhibitory site was located between –249 and –374 bp. This portion of the promoter contains three Sp1-binding sequences. Implication of SP1 in UGDH Promoter Activity—Recently, it was shown that bisanthracycline (WP-631) acts as a selective inhibitor of Sp1 transcription factor (40Martin B. Vaquero A. Priebe W. Portugal J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We used this compound to further study the implication of Sp1 in the activity of UGDH promoter. WP-631 at a concentration of 1 μm slightly inhibited basal UGDH mRNA level in MRC5 fibroblasts and completely abolished the stimulatory effect of TGF-β (Fig. 7A). In MRC5 fibroblasts, WP-631 did not influence the activity of –100-bp and –165-bp constructs, indicating that the Sp1 cis-acting elements of these sequences are not involved in the regulation of UGDH promoter. In keeping with the mRNA results, WP-631 inhibited all the longer promoter constructs and suppressed the stimulatory effect of TGF-β (Fig. 7B). More intense inhibition was obtained when WP-631 was added to the cultures of HepG2 cells. At the concentration of 1 μm, WP-631 significantly inhibited UGDH mRNA level (Fig. 8A). Moreover, in this cell line, WP-631 inhibited all the constructs activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). The role of Sp1 was further investigated by EMSA studies with nuclear extracts, using a consensus Sp1 sequence DNA fragment. The nuclear ex"

The mechanisms of molecular recognition reactions between biological molecules are not well known, and few systems have been analyzed in detail. We investigate here the reaction between an apoprotein and its physiological cofactor (apoflavodoxin and flavin mononucleotide) that binds reversibly to form a non-covalent complex (flavodoxin) involved in electron transfer reactions. We have analyzed the fast binding reactions between the FMN cofactor (and shorter analogs) and wild type (and nine mutant apoflavodoxins where residues interacting with FMN in the final complex have been replaced). The x-ray structures of two such mutants are reported that show the mutations are well tolerated by the protein. From the calculated microscopic binding rate constants we have performed a Φ analysis of the transition state of complex formation that indicates that the binding starts by interaction of the isoalloxazine-fused rings in FMN with residues of its hydrophobic binding site. In contrast, the phosphate in FMN, known to contribute most to the affinity of the final holoflavodoxin complex, is not bound in the transition state complex. Both the effects of ionic strength and of phosphate concentration on the wild type complex rate constant agree with this scenario. As suggested previously by nmr data, it seems that the isoalloxazine-binding site may be substantially open in solution. Interestingly, although FMN is a charged molecule, electrostatic interactions seem not to play a role in directing the binding, unlike what has been reported for other biological complexes. The binding can thus be best described as a hydrophobic encounter at an open binding site. Molecular recognition begins when two molecules approach and establish interactions of certain strength.

The binding can thus be best described as a hydrophobic encounter at an open binding site. The active form of many proteins is a non-covalent complex between a polypeptide (the apoprotein) and a cofactor. Most flavoproteins are in this category (1Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). Among them, flavodoxins have been widely used to quantitate the energetics of apoprotein-cofactor complexes (2Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Google Scholar, 3Mayhew S.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar) because they can be conveniently overexpressed, deprived from the FMN cofactor, and reconstituted. Studies carried out on several flavodoxins indicate that a large part of the binding energy derives from interactions of the phosphate moiety of FMN with hydrogen donors situated at the N terminus of the first α-helix (Fig. 1). The isoalloxazine, redox, fused ring, sandwiched between aromatic residues in the complex, is the second binding energy spot of the cofactor, whereas the ribityl hardly contributes to stabilize the complex (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar). The strength of a complex derives, in the end, from a balance between the rate constants of binding and dissociation. Although the association of small molecules may be governed by the rates of diffusion in the solvent (8Smoluchowski M.V. Z. Phys. Chem. 1917; 92: 129-168Google Scholar), where large molecules such as proteins are involved, significantly slower rates of association are typical because the molecular encounters often occur in inappropriate orientations (9Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Google Scholar, 10Nortrup S.H. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3338-3342Google Scholar). In many cases, particularly in protein-protein complexes, a non-native complex is invoked to be formed initially, before the rate-limiting step takes place (11Selzer T. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 409-419Google Scholar). Acceleration of binding reactions can be achieved if the interacting molecules can attract each other so that the diffusion limit is overcome or the approaching orientation is optimized. As the chief long distance attractive forces are electrostatic, acceleration of binding rates is often ascribed to electrostatic attraction between ligand and protein-binding site (12Wade R.C. Luty B.A Demchuk E.D. Madura J.D. Davis M.E. Briggs J.M. McCammon J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 65-69Google Scholar, 13Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Google Scholar, 14Scheinerman F.B. Norel R. Honig B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-159Google Scholar). In this respect, acceleration of the binding rate constant of a protein-protein complex without alteration of its dissociation rate constant has been engineered, giving rise to an increase in binding energy (15Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 537-541Google Scholar). Clearly, our understanding of the stability of functional complexes and our ability to modulate it when required is expected to benefit from a deeper comprehension of the mechanisms driving binding and dissociation. Flavodoxin is an interesting model to investigate the mechanism of protein/ligand association. Among the flavodoxins that from Anabaena is particularly well suited because both the holo and apo x-ray structures are available (Fig. 1 and Ref. 16Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Google Scholar), and in addition, an extensive characterization of the solution behavior of the two forms has been performed (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar, 17Genzor C.G. Perales-Alcón A. Sancho J. Romero A. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22338-22344Google Scholar). The binding of FMN to apoflavodoxins from several species seems to occur in one step (5Pueyo J.J. Curley G.P. Mayhew S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 855-861Google Scholar, 25Gast R. Müller F. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1978; 61: 1353-1363Google Scholar), although the molecular details are not known. The flavin cofactor contains a charged phosphate moiety that could in principle facilitate an electrostatic orientation and approximation to the apoflavodoxinbinding site. In fact, inspection of the x-ray structure of the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena (17Genzor C.G. Perales-Alcón A. Sancho J. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 329-332Google Scholar) indicates that the phosphate-binding site is well formed, whereas the isoalloxazine pocket is closed by one of the aromatic residues interacting with FMN in the functional complex (Trp57). It is thus tempting to speculate that the binding of FMN starts by association at the phosphate-binding site. Conflicting with this hypothesis, solution studies on the structure of the Anabaena (20Langdon G.M. Jimenez M.A. Genzor C.G. Maldonado S. Sancho J. Rico M. Proteins. 2001; 43: 476-488Google Scholar) and Azotobacter (26Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Google Scholar) apoflavodoxins suggest that the isoalloxazinebinding site is very flexible. This flexibility is also evidenced by the different x-ray structures observed for the Trp57 loop in wild type and mutant Anabaena flavodoxins (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar). In addition, it should be noticed that the x-ray structure of Anabaena apoflavodoxin with the preformed phosphate-binding site bears a bound sulfate anion (17Genzor C.G. Perales-Alcón A. Sancho J. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 329-332Google Scholar), which might be responsible for the observed local folding of the region. Thus, a different binding scenario, inspired by the structural evidence in solution, is one of binding at an opened isoalloxazine-binding site. We explore here the two possibilities by investigating the binding kinetics of FMN (and its shortened analogue, riboflavin) to wild type Anabaena apoflavodoxin and to mutants involving the two aromatic residues (Trp57 and Tyr94) that sandwich the isoalloxazine ring (the x-ray structures of two such mutants is reported) and the two threonines at the phosphate-binding site (Thr12 and Thr15). Determination of a low resolution structure for the transition state of complex formation by Φ analysis (27Fersht A.R. Matouscheck A. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 771-782Google Scholar) of mutant binding rate constants together with the observed influence of the ionic strength and phosphate concentration on the binding kinetics allow us to discriminate between the two proposed binding scenarios. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutant flavodoxins used in this work (W57Y, W57F, W57L, W57A, Y94W, Y94F, Y94L, and Y94A (19Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Google Scholar) and T12V and T15V (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar)) have been prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the Anabaena PCC 7119 flavodoxin gene, cloned in Escherichia coli (28Fillat M.F. Borrias W.E. Weisbeerk P.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 187-191Google Scholar), by using the method of Deng and Nickoloff (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar) as implemented in the Transformer™ kit (2nd version) from Clontech. Expression, Purification, and Protein Quantitation—The expression and purification of flavodoxin mutants were essentially as described previously (18Genzor C.G. Beldarraín A. Gómez-Moreno C. López-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Google Scholar). Apoflavodoxins were prepared by treatment with 3% trichloroacetic acid (2Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Google Scholar), followed by dialysis and ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. The purity of each flavodoxin preparation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of mutant apoflavodoxins in solution was determined using an extinction coefficient calculated from the total amount of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the protein (30Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The concentration of wild type apoflavodoxin was determined using the extinction coefficient of 34.1 mm–1 cm–1 (18Genzor C.G. Beldarraín A. Gómez-Moreno C. López-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Google Scholar), very similar to the theoretical one calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (30Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Initial crystallization trials were performed using the sittingdrop vapor diffusion method at 295 K. The search for suitable crystallization conditions was conducted with 96-condition Hampton Screens 1 and 2 (31Jankarik J. Kim S.J.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Google Scholar) with drops assembled using 1 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solutions. The two mutant crystals (W57L and Y94F) appeared as clusters of rectangular cross-section rods growing from a common nucleation site, from solutions containing ammonium sulfate. These twinned crystals were not suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments. Attempts to improve the quality of the crystals were performed using a fine grid screen for ammonium sulfate concentrations (3–3.5 m) and varying the pH of the solutions using the counter-diffusion method on agarose gels (32Biertümpfel C. Basquin J. Suck D. Sauter C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1657-1659Google Scholar). Crystals of W57L flavodoxin were grown from 3.5 m ammonium sulfate buffered with 0.1 m MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. pH 6.0. The Y94F crystals were grown from 3.2 m ammonium sulfate buffered with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Both mutant crystals required a few weeks to a few months to grow to a suitable size for diffraction measurements. The largest rod had maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm. For the diffraction experiments, crystals were flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. The crystallization solution, mixed with 25% glycerol, was used as cryoprotectant. Data were collected for W57L with a Marccd detector at the DESY-X11 and for Y94F using a MAR image plate scanner in X31 beamlines at Hamburg, Germany. Data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computer Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). For the high resolution W57L mutant, the 1.2-Å resolution assigned to the structure reflects the I/σ(I) = 3.8. To our knowledge, the W57L mutant diffracted to a higher resolution than any previously examined flavodoxin.

Open table in a new tab The Y94F and W57L mutant structures were solved using molecular replacement methods. The oxidized structure of long chain flavodoxin from Anabaena (Ref. 16Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1FLV) was used as the search model. The AMoRe system of programs (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) was used to complete the rotation and translation search as well as to apply the resulting values. FMN Purification—FMN from wild type and mutant flavodoxins was purified to >99% by high pressure liquid chromatography using a C-18 column (from Vydac) and a methanol gradient (0–30%) in 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. In addition, FMN from Sigma was purified to >95% following the same procedure. Rate Constants of Flavin Binding—Rapid kinetics were performed and analyzed using an Applied Photophysics SX17.MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer interfaced with an Acorn 5000 computer. Rate constants for flavin binding were determined from reaction of flavin with apoflavodoxin under pseudo first-order conditions (excess flavin), using the quenching of flavin fluorescence to monitor flavin binding. The concentration of apoprotein in the binding mixture was 0.5 μm for the complexes with FMN, 1.0 μm for the wild type apoflavodoxin-riboflavin complex, and 2.5 μm for the mutant apoflavodoxin complexes with riboflavin. Absorption spectra were recorded after each determination to calculate precisely the concentration of each reactant. Reactions were usually carried out in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. In some experiments, NaCl was added to study the influence of ionic strength on the binding rate. To study the influence of phosphate concentration on the formation of the wild type flavodoxin complexes, a 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, buffer containing NaCl and sodium phosphate at a constant ionic strength of 500 mm was used. Rate constants as a function of temperature (from 5 to 43 °C) for the wild type apoflavodoxin-FMN complex were obtained by reaction of 0.5 μm wild type apoflavodoxin with 50 μm FMN in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. X-ray Structures of the W57L and Y94F Holoflavodoxins— The structures of the W57L and Y94F Anabaena flavodoxin mutants were determined from data collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at a 1.2- and 2.1-Å resolution, respectively. The folding shows clearly the α/β topology of this class of proteins, a five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices at either side. The analysis of the secondary structure shows that the three-dimensional structures of the mutants are essentially superimposable with that of the wt protein (not shown). Indeed, the bulk of the folding did remain the same in each mutant when compared with the wt holoflavodoxin, including the loop bearing residue 57, which seems quite flexible in apoflavodoxin (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar). However, the hydrogen bonding network around the FMN is slightly different. The high resolution data collected for the W57L mutant allow the analysis of a detailed electron density map, partly shown in Fig. 2A, in which the atom positions of the flavin ring are clearly delineated. The FMN cofactor is tightly but non-covalently bound to the protein and is well defined (average B-factor = 8.3 Å2). Table II shows the FMN group interactions to neighboring protein atoms of flavodoxin in the wild type (16Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Google Scholar) and the two mutant structures. Only the hydrogen bonds with favorable geometry have been taken into account. Most of the interactions are similar to those in other flavodoxin structures (16Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Google Scholar, 35Smith W.W. Pattridge K.A. Ludwig M.L. Petsko G.A. Tsernoglou D. Tanaka M. Yasunobu K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 737-755Google Scholar, 36Fukuyama K.

The phosphate group establishes O NH hydrogen bonds to residues of the N terminus of helix 1 (Gln11–Thr15), plus further contacts to Oγ of Thr15. The ribityl moiety is also stabilized by several hydrogen bonding contacts to backbone and side chain atoms. As can be observed in Table II, a small decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds together with a moderate lengthening of the hydrogen bonds at the phosphate loop may contribute to the reported lower affinity of the mutant complexes relative to wild type (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar). On the other hand, the isoalloxazine ring is embedded in the protein, stacked between the aromatic groups Trp57 and Tyr94 in the wild type structure. It is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds to backbone atoms of segments Gly61–Leu62 and Asn97–Gln99. Compared with the wild type flavodoxin, the isoalloxazine-binding site is more accessible to solvent in the W57L mutant (Fig. 2) and similarly accessible in the Y94F one. The ensuing cavity originated in the W57L mutant by the absence of the tryptophan side chain is partially filled through a network of interactions involving three water molecules. The differences between the two mutant holoflavodoxin structures and the wild type one are thus very minor, and in no case did new interactions appear that could complicate the analysis of the kinetic data. We will assume for the purpose of discussion that the rest of the mutants behave similarly and tolerate the introduced mutations without significantly modifying the structure of the binding site. This is quite likely the case as their spectroscopic properties and their redox potentials are similar to those of wild type (19Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Google Scholar).Table IIInteractions at the FMN-binding siteFMN atomsProtein atomsDistanceW57LY94FWild typeaFrom Ref. 16.N3O Asn972.872.822.92O2NH Gln993.162.943.22O4NH Gly602.772.782.86O2′O Thr562.792.702.70O3′Oδ2 Asp1462.602.632.65Nζ Lys143.31O5′Oγ1 Thr882.903.20OP1NH Thr123.272.863.27NH Gly133.183.123.16NH Lys142.823.012.82Oγ1 Thr122.64OP2NH Gln112.992.802.81NH Thr123.123.343.06OP3NH Thr152.862.752.78Oγ1 Thr152.643.072.65a From Ref. 16Rao S.T.

Open table in a new tab Binding of FMN to Wild Type Apoflavodoxin in 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 25 °C—The time course of the fluorescence decrease associated to the binding of FMN to wild type apoflavodoxin is shown in Fig. 3. The trace can be fitted to a single exponential equation, and the observed initial fluorescence corresponds to that of unbound FMN, which suggests that the entire binding process is being observed. These data together indicate that the binding of FMN to wild type Anabaena apoflavodoxin follows a simple two-state mechanism with no intermediates accumulating during the reaction, as was reported for the Peptostreptococcus, Azotobacter, and Desulfovibrio flavodoxins (5Pueyo J.J. Curley G.P. Mayhew S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 855-861Google Scholar, 25Gast R. Müller F. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1978; 61: 1353-1363Google Scholar). The inset in Fig. 3 shows that the observed rate constant is proportional to FMN concentration, when FMN is in excess, and that it passes through the origin. From the slope of this linear dependence, the microscopic kon can be calculated at 1.15 (±0.05) × 105m–1 s–1 (Table III).Table IIIAssociation and dissociation rate constants of FMN/apoflavodoxin complexesProteinKonaIn 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, at 25 ± 0.1 °C.

The temperature dependence of the association rate constant has been studied. The Arrhenius plot in Fig. 4 shows the linear dependence expected when no change in reaction mechanism occurs in the temperature range analyzed. At higher temperatures, the plot is no longer linear (not shown), which is very likely due to apoflavodoxin partial unfolding (22Irún M.P. Garcia-Mira M.M. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 877-888Google Scholar). From the plot, we calculate the following transition state thermodynamic parameters: ΔH‡ = +10.9 (±0.2) kcal mol–1, ΔS‡ = +1.34 (±0.02) cal mol–1 K–1, and ΔG‡ of + 10.5 (±0.2) kcal mol–1. The transition state for complex formation is thus mainly destabilized in enthalpic grounds. Rate Constants of FMN Binding to Mutant Apoflavodoxins— The rate constant of binding of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex has been, additionally, determined for nine flavodoxin mutants (Fig. 5 and Table III). All mutants bind FMN more slowly than wild type (except T15V whose binding is as fast as that of wild type). The kinetics corresponding to the seven mutants where either Tyr94 or Trp57 at the isoalloxazine-binding site has been replaced are monoexponential, whereas the two mutants where either Thr12 or Thr15 at the phosphate-binding site was replaced by valines can be best fitted to double exponentials. In these two mutants, the fast phase accounts for 90% total fluorescence change, and its linear dependence of protein concentration, which passes through the origin, has been used to calculate the rate constants reported in Table III. For the mutants at positions 57 and 94, whose binding mechanism seems two-state, koff values have been calculated from the association constants in Table III and the reported equilibrium binding constants (7Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Google Scholar). In most cases, with the exception of Y94A, the mutations produced only limited changes in the association rate constants. In seven of the nine mutants analyzed, including residues at positions 12, 15, 57, and 94, the association rate constant is only decreased up to 2-fold. Because most of the residues in contact with FMN in the holoflavodoxin have been mutated, these moderate decreases of the rate constants suggest that, in the rate-limiting step of the association of the two molecules, the interactions between the cofactor and specific sid"

To explain this unusual property of the enzyme, we analyzed the crystal structures of diol dehydratase in complexes with cyanocobalamin and (R)- or (S)-1,2-propanediol. (R)- and (S)-isomers are bound in a symmetrical manner, although the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the substrate and the active-site residues are the same. From the position of the adenosyl radical in the modeled “distal” conformation, it is reasonable for the radical to abstract the pro-R and pro-S hydrogens from (R)- and (S)-isomers, respectively. The hydroxyl groups in the substrate radicals would migrates from C(2) to C(1) by a suprafacial shift, resulting in the stereochemical inversion at C(1). This causes 60° clockwise and 70° counterclockwise rotations of the C(1)–C(2) bond of the (R)- and (S)-isomers, respectively, if viewed from K+. A modeling study of 1,1-gem-diol intermediates indicated that new radical center C(2) becomes close to the methyl group of 5′-deoxyadenosine. Thus, the hydrogen back-abstraction (recombination) from 5′-deoxyadenosine by the product radical is structurally feasible. It was also predictable that the substitution of the migrating hydroxyl group by a hydrogen atom from 5′-deoxyadenosine takes place with the inversion of the configuration at C(2) of the substrate. Stereospecific dehydration of the 1,1-gem-diol intermediates can also be rationalized by assuming that Asp-α335 and Glu-α170 function as base catalysts in the dehydration of the (R)- and (S)-isomers, respectively.

R-CHCH2OH→R-CH2CHO+H2O |OH Reaction 1 Kinetic measurements provided some clues to solve the enigma of apparent lack of stereospecificity of diol dehydratase. When each enantiomer of 1,2-propanediol is run independently, the rate with the (R)-isomer is 1.7–1.8 times higher than that with the (S)-isomer (3Zagalak B. Frey P.A. Karabatsos G.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 24: 3028-3035Google Scholar, 4Yamane T. Kato T. Shimizu S. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, when racemic 1,2-propanediol is used as substrate, the (S)-isomer reacts at a faster rate than the (R)-isomer (6Jensen F.R. Neese R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 62: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This reversal is because of the ratio of Km values (Km(R)/Km(S) = 3.1–3.2). These lines of evidence suggested that the (R)- and (S)-isomers are bound to the enzyme in two different modes with different catalytic efficiency and binding affinity. In other words, the enzyme recognizes the enantiomers as “different” substrates. The stereochemistry of the diol dehydratase reaction established by the labeling experiments is summarized as follows (Fig. 1A). It was shown by Rétey et al. (7Rétey J. Umani-Ronchi A. Seibl J. Arigoni D. Experientia. 1966; 22: 502-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that [18O]- and unlabeled propionaldehydes are formed from [1-18O]-(S)- and [1-18O]-(R)-1,2-propanediols, respectively. This indicated that 1,1-gem-diol is formed as an intermediate. The initial migration of an OH group from C(2) to C(1) is stereoselective, and the dehydration of the resulting gem-diol undergoes steric control by the enzyme, with only one of the two OH groups on the prochiral center being eliminated. However, the absolute configurations of the gem-diol intermediates and why and how a specific hydroxyl group undergoes elimination remained to be elucidated. The hydrogen atom moves to the adjacent carbon atom without exchange with solvent protons (8Brownstein A.M. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1199-1200Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Abeles and co-workers (3Zagalak B. Frey P.A. Karabatsos G.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 24: 3028-3035Google Scholar) demonstrated that the pro-S and pro-R hydrogen atoms on C(1) of (S)- and (R)-1,2-propanediols, respectively, migrate to C(2). The migrating OH group is replaced by the hydrogen atom with an accompanying inversion of the configuration at C(2) (3Zagalak B. Frey P.A. Karabatsos G.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 24: 3028-3035Google Scholar, 9Rétey J. Umani-Ronchi A. Arigoni D. Experientia. 1966; 22: 72-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, when the enantiomeric pair of ethylene glycols labeled stereospecifically with deuterium and tritium is used as substrates, racemic products are obtained (10Arigoni D. Zagalak B. Friedrich W. Vitamin B12. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1979: 389-410Google Scholar). This indicated that rapid internal rotation in the intermediate occurs before the hydrogen recombination.

Dolphin D. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar). In the diol dehydratase reaction, X and H are the OH group on C(2) and a hydrogen atom on C(1), respectively, and a water molecule is subsequently eliminated from a gem-diol intermediate. This has now been accepted as a general mechanism for all the AdoCbl-dependent intramolecular group-transfer reactions (26Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar, 27Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar), in which a hydrogen atom migrates from one carbon atom of the substrate to an adjacent carbon atom in exchange for group X that moves in the opposite direction. That is, the enzyme-coenzyme interaction leads to the activation of the Co–C bond of the coenzyme. Substrate binding triggers the homolysis of the Co–C bond, forming the adenosyl radical and cob(II)alamin. The adenosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, producing a substrate-derived radical and 5′-deoxyadenosine. The substrate radical rearranges to the product radical, which then abstracts a hydrogen atom back from 5′-deoxyadenosine. This leads to the formation of the product and regeneration of the coenzyme. The three-dimensional structures of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes have been solved to understand their fine mechanisms of action (28Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12607-12617Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) substrate 1,2-propanediol. The O(1) and O(2) of the substrate are hydrogen-bonded to the respective pair of amino acid residues, namely (Glu-α170 and Gln-α296) and (Asp-α335 and His-α143), respectively (29Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The 1,2-propanediol bound at the active site was assigned to the (S)-isomer, although the crystals were grown in the presence of racemic substrate. The structure-based mechanism of reaction with the (S)-isomer has been proposed (29Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 33Shibata N. Masuda J. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Toraya T.

Structure. 2000; 8: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To confirm this assignment and to solve the mechanism of reaction with the (R)-isomer, we crystallized the diol dehydratase·CN-Cbl complexes in the presence of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers and analyzed their three-dimensional structures. The conformations of the enzyme-bound 1,1-gem-diol intermediates from enantiomeric substrates were modeled. Based on the crystal structures and the models, we elucidated the stereochemical courses of the diol dehydratase reaction with the (R)- and (S)-isomers. We propose here the reason why diol dehydratase is apparently not stereospecific for the enantiomers, although hydrogen abstraction and recombination, as well as OH group migration, proceed in stereospecific manners. Materials—(R)-1,2-Propanediol was purchased from TCI, Tokyo, Japan. (S)-1,2-Propanediol was synthesized by reduction of l-lactide (TCI, Tokyo, Japan) with LiAlH4 and purified by distillation under reduced pressure. Crystalline AdoCbl was a gift from Eizai, Tokyo, Japan. All other chemicals were reagent grade commercial products and used without further purification. Purification of Enzyme and Substitution of Racemic 1,2-Propanediol by Enantiomeric Substrates—Diol dehydratase of Klebsiella oxytoca ATCC 8724 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by the following modification of the method described previously (35Tobimatsu T.

The enzyme extracted from the crude membrane fractions with 1% Brij35 was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column, and the column was washed with 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% racemic 1,2-propanediol and 1% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, as described previously. The column was washed again with 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% (R)- or (S)-1,2-propanediol and then eluted with the same buffer containing 0.15 m KCl, 2% (R)- or (S)-1,2-propanediol, and 20 mm sucrose monocaprate. After addition of LDAO to a concentration of 0.1%, the apoenzyme was concentrated and incubated with 4 mm CN-Cbl. The resulting enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was dialyzed against 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% (R)- or (S)-1,2-propanediol, 0.1% LDAO, and 20 μm CN-Cbl to remove excess unbound CN-Cbl. Crystallization—The final solution contained 50–60 mg/ml of each enzyme·CN-Cbl complex. Crystals of (R)- or (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound enzyme·CN-Cbl complex were grown by the sandwich-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C against a reservoir containing 15% (w/v) PEG6000, 0.23 m ammonium sulfate, 0.02 m Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and 0.2% LDAO (29Shibata N.

Data Collection—For both complexes, the diffraction data sets were collected at the BL41XU beamline, SPring-8, Japan. The crystal of (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound form was transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 15% PEG20000, 17.5% ethylene glycol, and other components of the protein drop except 1,2-propanediol and PEG6000, which had been used for the crystals grown in the presence of racemic 1,2-propanediol. In the case of (R)-isomer, crystals were dissolved in several cryoprotectant solutions available, but the addition of PEG400 directly to a protein drop to a final concentration of ∼20% kept crystals intact. For both forms, the crystal was transferred into a cryo-stream with a cryo-loop and was flash-cooled at 100 K. A total of 180 ° of data were measured. All diffraction data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Two kinds of starting models, substrate-bound (29Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12607-12617Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) forms of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex, for structure determination were used for the first refinement step to cross-check influence of model bias of (S)-1,2-propanediol molecule that had been assigned to the substrate-bound form so far. Coordinates of (S)-1,2-propanediol were deleted from the original substrate-bound structure. Refinement and model building were carried out with CNS (39Brünger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and XFIT (40McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). After rigid-body refinement, 2mFo–DFc electron density maps of (R)-1,2-propanediol from both starting models clearly indicated that C(3) atom of (R)-1,2-propanediol shares the similar position to that of (S)-1,2-propanediol. As expected, the (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound form clearly displayed the same binding mode as observed in the structures crystallized in the presence of racemic 1,2-propanediol (29Shibata N. Masuda J.

Each model was built with rounds of manual rebuilding, positional refinement, and individual B-factor refinement, using all data between 30 and 2.3 Å for the (R)-1,2-propanediol-bound form and between 30 and 1.8 Å for the (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound form. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraint was applied for the (R)-1,2-propanediol-bound form.

Open table in a new tab Geometry Calculation and Modeling Study—The first αβγ unit of the (αβγ)2 heterohexamer was used for geometry calculation and modeling study of the active-site vicinity of the crystal structures published so far, because the average B-factor of the first unit is much lower than that of the second unit. In this paper, that is the case for the (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound form, 23.1 Å2 for the first unit and 36.0 Å2 for the second unit. In the case of (R)-isomer-bound form, however, the average B-factor of the (R)-1,2-propanediol molecule of the first unit (25.8 Å2) is slightly higher than that of the second unit (23.5 Å2), and the overall B-factor of the first αβγ unit (37.6 Å2) is slightly lower than that of the second unit (39.4 Å2), but they are comparable with each other. The part of the final 2mFo–DFc electron density map covering the second substrate is clearer than that of the first molecule. The second unit, therefore, is used for geometry calculation and modeling study in this paper. The coordinates of the adenosyl group in the “distal” conformation are derived from the superimposed model of the adenosyl group on the adenine ring of the enzyme·adeninylpentylcobalamin complex (34Masuda J. Shibata N. Morimoto Y. Toraya T. Yasuoka N. Structure. 2000; 8: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Libraries for bond length and bond angle are based on the original topology and parameter files of CNS. Modeling of 1,1-gem-diol intermediates was performed with XFIT, followed by hydrogen generation and energy minimization with CNS. As a result of the energy minimization, the distance between O(1) and O(2) of the 1,1-gem-diol intermediate molecule is shorter than that of the 1,2-propanediol molecule for both (R)- and (S)-isomers. Fitting of the 1,1-gem-diol intermediate molecule on the 1,2-propanediol molecule was performed as follows: (i) overlap the O(1)–O(2) line of 1,1-gem-diol intermediate molecule on that of 1,2-propanediol molecule so that the center of the lines of both molecules share the same position; (ii) minimize the distance between C(5′) of the adenosyl group and C(2) of the 1,1-gem-diol intermediate molecule by rotations of the ribose moiety around the glycosidic linkage and of the 1,1-gem-diol molecule around the O(1)–O(2) line.

Overall structures of both complexes were essentially identical to each other except for the substrates bound at the active site. As shown in Fig. 2B, the configuration and the conformation of the (S)-1,2-propanediol fitted to the electron density map were the same as those in the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex crystallized in the presence of racemic 1,2-propanediol (29Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Structure. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This provided a definite proof for our previous assignment of the (S)-isomer to the electron density map. In contrast, the electron density contoured for the (R)-enantiomer was quite different from that for the (S)-isomer (Fig. 2A). It rather resembles that corresponding to the 1,2-propanediol that is bound to the active site of glycerol dehydratase (32Yamanishi M. Yunoki M. Tobimatsu T. Sato H. Matsui J. Dokiya A. Iuchi Y. Oe K. Suto K. Shibata N. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Toraya T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), an isofunctional AdoCbl-dependent enzyme. It should be noted that the hydrogen-bonding interactions between substrate and the active-site amino acid residues are the same in the (R)- and (S)-1,2-propanediol-bound forms of the enzyme. That is, O(1) is hydrogen-bonded to -COO– of Glu-α170 and Nϵ2 of Gln-α296 and O(2) to -COO– of Asp-α335 and Nϵ2 of His-α143. Previously, we assumed that (R)- and (S)-1,2-propanediols are bound to the active site in the opposite orientation as mirror images with their C(1)–C(2) bonds aligned and that Glu-α170 and Asp-α335 might at least partially share a common catalytic function (43Toraya T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 106-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although this pseudo-symmetry was not the case, it became evident that there is another plane of symmetry relating the (R)- and (S)-substrates bound by diol dehydratase. Stereospecificity of Hydrogen Abstraction from Substrates— Abeles and co-workers (3Zagalak B. Frey P.A. Karabatsos G.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 24: 3028-3035Google Scholar) demonstrated that the pro-R and pro-S hydrogen atoms on C(1) of (R)- and (S)-1,2-propanediols, respectively, migrate to C(2). The enzyme-bound AdoCbl serves as an intermediate hydrogen carrier, first accepting a hydrogen atom from C(1) of the substrate to C(5′) of the coenzyme and then, in a subsequent step, giving a hydrogen back to C(2) of the product (11Frey P.A.

Fig. 3, A and B shows the structures of the active sites of the (R)- and (S)-isomer-bound forms of the enzyme·cobalamin complex, respectively. The position of the adenosyl radical in the distal conformation was obtained by the modeling study, as described previously (34Masuda J. Shibata N. Morimoto Y. Toraya T. Yasuoka N. Structure. 2000; 8: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); that is, the adenine moiety of the coenzyme adenosyl group was superimposed on that of the enzyme-bound adeninylpentylcobalamin, and the ribose moiety was rotated around the glycosidic linkage so that C(5′) could come closest to C(1) of the (R)- and (S)-isomers. Fig. 3C shows that the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers are bound to the active site of the enzyme in a symmetrical mode as the mirror image with respect to the plane including K+, O(1), and O(2). The distances from C(5′) of the adenosyl radical to C(1)-HR, C(1)-HS, and C(2)-H of (R)-1,2-propanediol are 1.45, 2.53, and 3.73 Å, respectively. The angle of C(4′)–C(5′)–C(1)HR is 137.6°. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the adenosyl radical abstracts the pro-R hydrogen atom from C(1) of the (R)-isomer. In contrast, the distances from C(5′) of the adenosyl radical to C(1)-HR, C(1)-HS, and C(2)-H of (S)-1,2-propanediol are 2.55, 1.46, and 3.59 Å, respectively. The angle of C(4′)–C(5′)–C(1)HS is 128.5°. Thus, it is also quite reasonable for the radical to abstract the pro-S hydrogen atom from C(1) of the (S)-isomer. These predictions are just as expected from the experimental resul"

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is highly expressed in adult SCs, and changes in its expression can regulate signaling through Erb B2, a co-receptor that mediates the effects of neuregulins in promoting SC growth and differentiation. We examined the hypothesis that hyperglycemia-induced changes in Cav-1 expression and p75NTR signaling may contribute to altered neurotrophism in DPN by modulating SC responses to neuregulins. In an animal model of type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia induced a progressive decrease of Cav-1 in SCs of sciatic nerve that was reversed by insulin therapy. Treatment of primary neonatal SCs with 20–30 mm d-glucose, but not l-glucose, was sufficient to inhibit transcription from the Cav-1 promoter and decrease Cav-1 mRNA and protein expression. Hyperglycemia prolonged the kinetics of Erb B2 phosphorylation and significantly enhanced the mitogenic response of SCs to neuregulin1-β1, and this effect was mimicked by the forced down-regulation of Cav-1. Intriguingly, nerve growth factor antagonized the enhanced mitogenic response of SCs to neuregulin1-β1 and inhibited the glucose-induced down-regulation of Cav-1 transcription, mRNA, and protein expression through p75NTR-dependent activation of JNK. Our data suggest that Cav-1 down-regulation may contribute to altered neurotrophism in DPN by enhancing the response of SCs to neuregulins and that p75NTR-mediated JNK activation may provide a mechanism for the neurotrophic modulation of hyperglycemic stress.

Murakawa Y. Sima A.A. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 408-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One etiologic factor in DPN is an altered neurotrophism (2Apfel S.C. Arezzo J.C. Brownlee M. Federoff H. Kessler J.A. Brain Res. 1994; 634: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) that may contribute to the substantial degenerative changes that Schwann cells (SCs) progressively undergo in DPN. Given the critical role of SCs in establishing appropriate axon-glial interactions necessary for neuronal regeneration, it is important to understand fully the interplay of molecular signals operative during their response to prolonged hyperglycemic stress. Altered neurotrophism in DPN is associated with decreased production of neurotrophic factors (2Apfel S.C. Arezzo J.C. Brownlee M. Federoff H. Kessler J.A.

However, it is unclear whether neurotrophic factor signaling through p75NTR may regulate SC responses to hyperglycemic stress. Developmentally, p75NTR signaling in SCs has been linked to cell migration (6Bentley C.A. Lee K.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7706-7715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Anton E.S. Weskamp G.

(New York). 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). However, adult SCs do not undergo substantial death following nerve injury (10Grinspan J.B. Marchionni M.A. Reeves M. Coulaloglou M. Scherer S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and no evidence exists that p75NTR contributes to apoptosis of adult SCs in DPN. Indeed, recent evidence (11Vincent A.M. Brownlee M. Russell J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Russell J.W. Sullivan K.A. Windebank A.J. Herrmann D.N. Feldman E.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) suggests that p75NTR may protect SCs against oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by supraphysiologic (150 mm) levels of glucose. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a structural protein of specialized lipid raft domains called caveolae (13Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and is expressed in sensory neurons (dorsal root ganglia) (14Galbiati F. Volonte D. Gil O. Zanazzi G. Salzer J.L. Sargiacomo M.

Glia. 1999; 27: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), target cell populations critically affected in DPN. Cav-1 may have an important role in SC physiology because it is a cholesterol-binding/shuttling protein (16Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), and cholesterol consists of about 25% of myelin lipid (17Fu Q. Goodrum J.F. Hayes C. Hostettler J.D. Toews A.D. Morell P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, Cav-1 can inhibit the activity of the Erb B2 tyrosine kinase receptor for neuregulins (18Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Neuregulins can influence SC responses at multiple stages of development through their potent effects on controlling SC cell proliferation and differentiation (19Lemke G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Erb B2 and Erb B3 are highly expressed in pre-myelinating SCs, and the down-regulation of Erb B2 receptors decreases mitogenic signaling by axon-derived neuregulins and facilitates myelination (20Garratt A.N. Voiculescu O. Topilko P. Charnay P. Birchmeier C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although the expression of Erb B2 decreases, it is not absent in mature myelinated SCs (10Grinspan J.B. Marchionni M.A. Reeves M. Coulaloglou M. Scherer S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent intriguing data suggest that chronic activation of Erb B2 in differentiated SCs induces demyelination and may contribute to peripheral neuropathies (21Zanazzi G. Einheber S. Westreich R. Hannocks M.J. Bedell-Hogan D. Marchionni M.A. Salzer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, decreased Cav-1 levels following nerve injury (22Mikol D.D. Scherer S.S. Duckett S.J. Hong H.L. Feldman E.L. Glia. 2002; 38: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) may remove an inhibitory regulation of Erb B2 and enhance cellular responses to neuregulins. However, whether prolonged diabetes may decrease Cav-1 expression in peripheral nerve and contribute to altered neurotrophism in DPN by affecting the response of SCs to neuregulins is unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of hyperglycemia and neurotrophin signaling on the regulation of Cav-1 expression in SCs and the response to neuregulins. We demonstrate that either hyperglycemia or forced down-regulation of Cav-1 is sufficient to alter biologically relevant responses of SCs to neuregulin1-β1. Additionally, we provide support that p75NTR-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) can attenuate the effect of hyperglycemia on altering Cav-1 expression and signaling through the neuregulin/Erb B2 ligand-receptor cassette. Collectively, our data suggest that hyperglycemia-induced changes in Cav-1 and p75NTR may contribute to altered neurotrophism in DPN by affecting the response of SCs to neuregulins. Streptozotocin-induced Diabetes and Insulin Therapy—Male rats (200–250 g) were rendered diabetic with an intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved immediately before injection in 1 ml of sterile 10 mm sodium citrate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 4.5. Control animals were treated similarly but received only a 1-ml injection of the sodium citrate vehicle. Fasting blood glucose levels (overnight fast) were determined after 1 week using a commercial glucometer (Precision QID), and animals exhibiting a blood glucose level of ≥300 mg/dl (∼17 mm) were deemed diabetic and enrolled in the study. If necessary, non-diabetic animals were re-injected, and the procedure was repeated. Two control plus three diabetic animals were randomly assigned to groups maintained for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 17 weeks following their initial designation as diabetic. All animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard rat chow and water. Blood glucose levels for control and STZ-treated animals were determined again immediately prior to euthanizing the animals and were 87 ± 16 mg/dl (n = 12) and 431 ± 66 mg/dl (n = 17), respectively. Sciatic nerves were rapidly dissected from the euthanized animals, freed from connective tissue, placed in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek), and frozen on dry ice. Eight-week old male C57BL/6 mice received either a 0.4-ml intraperitoneal injection of buffer or 180 mg/kg STZ. Diabetic mice were monitored closely for symptoms of hyperglycemia that included polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. Only STZ-injected mice with reduced body weight and blood glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dl were included in the diabetic group. All mice received water and mouse chow ad libitum. In order to control blood glucose levels, slow-release insulin pellets (Linshin Canada, Inc., Ontario, Canada) were implanted subcutaneously in 6-week-old diabetic mice. Each mouse initially received two pellets (each pellet releases 0.1 unit/day), and glucose levels were then monitored weekly. Certain mice then received 1–2 additional pellets to maintain lowered blood glucose levels. After 2 weeks of insulin therapy, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg body weight) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Perfused mice were immersion fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, the sciatic nerves removed, freed from connective tissue, and placed in OCT compound as described above. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Transverse and longitudinal serial cryostat sections (10 μm) were obtained at the University of Kansas Medical Center Histology Core Facility, and frozen sections were stored at–80 °C. Sections of sciatic nerve were fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, washed 2× with 10-min changes of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and blocked with 3% gelatin in PBS for 20 min. The slides were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min and incubated with a 1:300 dilution of monoclonal Cav-1 antibody 2234 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 90 min at room temperature. Alternatively, some sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody against flotillin-1 (1:300 dilution). To identify the localization of Cav-1 in SCs, sections were co-stained with a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against S100β (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), an established marker for SCs (23Tikoo R. Zanazzi G. Shiffman D. Salzer J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the sections were incubated with AlexaFluor 488 (green) rabbit anti-mouse (1:400 dilution) or AlexaFluor 568 (red) goat anti-rabbit (1:800 dilution) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature. The slides were washed and coverslips mounted with Permount. Images were captured on a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope. To obtain a semi-quantitative estimate of the loss of Cav-1 immunoreactivity, its staining intensity was normalized to the intensity of S100β. The intensity of the green (Cav-1) and red (S100β) signals surrounding the nerve fibers in 60 randomly selected areas of each nerve cross-section was assessed using Adobe Photoshop. Schwann Cell Preparation and Culture—Sciatic nerves were dissected from postnatal day 2 or day 3 Sprague-Dawley rat pups, and SCs were isolated essentially as described (24Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The nerves were rinsed with Leibovitz's L15 medium (L15) and incubated with 0.1% collagenase in L15 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The tissue was then treated with L15 medium containing 0.25% trypsin plus 0.1% collagenase for an additional 30 min, and protease activity was inactivated with DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were triturated through a fire-polished glass pipette and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated plates (50 μg/ml) in low glucose (5.5 mm) DMEM containing 5% FCS and 2 μm forskolin (complete medium). The cells were grown in the presence of 10 μm cytosine arabinoside for 4 days to rid the cultures of the faster growing fibroblasts and passaged upon confluency after approximately 1 week in culture. The Schwann cells were subcultured upon confluency and used for no more than 6 passages. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analyses—After the indicated treatments, the cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and Complete protease inhibitors). After removing cell debris, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the Amersham Biosciences ECL reagents as described by the manufacturer. Antibodies against phospho-Erb B2 (12352-R), Erb B2 (C-18), JNK (FL), and phospho-JNK (G-7) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (25Sprott K.M. Chumley M.J. Hanson J.M. Dobrowsky R.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cloning of Rat Caveolin-1 Promoter and Construction of pLuc-EGFP Reporter Plasmids—A 7-kb rat Cav-1 genomic DNA fragment was isolated from PAC clones (BACPAC Resource, Oakland, CA) and ligated into the SpeI site of pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 2660-bp Cav-1 promoter region (upstream of the ATG in exon 1) was identified by DNA sequencing (GenBank™ accession number AF489529) and showed 79 and 89% identity to the promoter regions of the human and mouse Cav-1 genes, respectively. To construct the single vector dual-reporter gene system, we used the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as the backbone. The egfp gene was excised from pEGFP (N1) (Invitrogen) with BamHI and NotI, and the fragment ends were partially filled using the Klenow fragment and dGTP, dATP, and dTTP. The vector pRL-CMV (Promega) was cut with NheI and XbaI to remove the Renilla reniformis luc gene, and the ends were partially filled in using the Klenow fragment in the presence of dCTP, dATP, and dTTP. The egfp gene was inserted into the modified pRL-CMV vector, replacing the Renilla luciferase cDNA, and re-named pEGFP-CMV. To obtain the egfp gene containing the upstream CMV immediate early promoter, and a downstream poly(A) signal, pEGFP-CMV was digested with BamHI and BglII, and the resulting fragment was inserted into a SalI site of the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector creating pLuc-EGFP. To prepare pLuc-EGFP containing elements of the rat Cav-1 promoter, the 2660-bp Cav-1 promoter region was amplified with the flanking primers: 5′-ACGCGTGAGAAG AGGAAATGCCTCTGCG-3′ and 5′-GGCGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCATGTCTACGTATTTACCCCCAGACAT-3′ (extra MluI and NarI sites shown in boldface) and inserted into the TOPO-PCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The 2.6-kb promoter region was subcloned into pLuc-EGFP, and truncated promoter constructs were prepared using convenient restriction sites present in the promoter. The caveolin-1 promoter constructs (Cav1-Pr) created were Cav1-Pr(–2.6 kb), Cav1-Pr(–2.2 kb), Cav1-Pr(–1.3 kb), Cav1-Pr(–0.5 kb), and Cav1-Pr(–0.2 kb). Cell Transfection and Luciferase Activity Measurements—Native SCs were grown in 6-well plates to ∼90% confluency prior to transient transfection using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with a 400-μl mixture containing 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 4 μg of pLuc-EGFP (empty vector control) or the indicated Cav-1 promoter construct in serum-free low glucose DMEM. After1hin the transfection mixture, the cells were incubated in complete medium for 24 h. Typically, the medium was then changed to low glucose DMEM (5.5 mm) containing 2% FCS, and the cells were treated with 30 mm d-glucose in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml mouse 2.5S NGF (Harlan Bioproducts, Cincinnati, OH) for an additional 16–24 h. At the end of the treatment, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 400 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 30 min. To measure firefly luciferase activity, 20 μl of the cell lysate was added to 100 μl of the luminol substrate, and light emission was measured in a Packard Luminometer. Because the reporter construct constitutively expresses EGFP from the CMV immediate early promoter, transfection efficiency was qualitatively assessed by visualizing EGFP expression by fluorescent microscopy and quantified using 250 μl of the cell lysate. The lysate was transferred to a 96-well plate, and green fluorescence was measured in a FL600 Microplate Fluorescence Reader with filter characteristics of 485 nm for excitation and 530 nm for emission. Relative Quantification of mRNA by Real Time PCR—Schwann cells were placed in DMEM, 2% FCS and treated with buffer or the indicated concentration of d-glucose in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml NGF for 24 h. Three dishes of cells for each treatment were combined to isolate total RNA using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual genomic DNA was degraded by incubation with RNase-free DNase I for 10 min at 25 °C, and the enzyme was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 10 min. To generate cDNA, 45 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 100-μl reaction containing 1× MLV buffer (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μg of oligo(dT) 15-mer primer, 120 units of Rnasin, and 300 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. After 2 h at 42 °C, the polymerase was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and 2 μl of each sample (900 ng) was used directly for real time PCR analysis. Real time PCR analyses were performed using a Cepheid Smart Cycler System. Table I lists the sequences of the primers and fluorescent hybridization probes and the resulting amplicon size. The 5′-end of the fluorescent hybridization probe for Cav-1 was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein and the 3′-end with the Black Hole Quencher dye, BHQ1 (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., San Francisco). β-Actin mRNA was used for normalization, and the 5′-end of the fluorogenic hybridization probe for β-actin was labeled with carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) and the 3′-end with the BHQ2 quencher dye. The master mix for the multiplex real time PCRs contained 1× z-TaqMan buffer, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 120 nm of the β-actin forward and reverse primers, 400 nm of the forward and reverse Cav-1 primers, 250 nm of each fluorogenic hybridization probe, and 1 unit of z-Taq polymerase. Template cDNA was added to give a 25-μl total volume, and PCR conditions were one cycle at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 45–50 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C.Table IProbe and primer sequences used for real time PCRGeneCav-1β-ActinForward primer5′-ATGTCTGGGGGTAAATACGTAGAC-3′5′-CAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTG-3′Reverse primer5′-GATGGAATAGACACGGCTGA-3′5′-TAACAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3′Fluorescent probe5′-FAM-CGTGCATCAAGAGCTTCCTGATT-BHQ1-3′5′-ROX-AGCAGATGTGGATCAGCAAGCAG-BHQ2-3′Amplicon size450 bp159 bp Open table in a new tab Relative quantification of the real time PCR was based upon the amplification efficiency of the target and reference genes and the cycle number at which fluorescence crossed a prescribed background level, cycle threshold (Ct) (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25424) Google Scholar). Because the experimental goal was to quantify relative changes in Cav-1 mRNA following glucose and NGF treatment, the relative expression ratio (R) was determined by using Equation 1, R=(Etarget)ΔCt(target)(control-treatment)(Ereference)ΔCtreference(control-treatment) (Eq. 1) In this mathematical model, the amplification efficiency (E) in the exponential phase of the real time PCR is given by E = 10(–1/slope) and is derived in separate PCR by plotting the Ct versus the input concentrations of authentic target and reference cDNA templates (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25424) Google Scholar). Over a broad range of DNA concentrations, both Cav-1 and β-actin cDNA showed similar (1.98 and 1.95, respectively) real time PCR amplification efficiencies (data not shown). Because the fluorescent hybridization probes for Cav-1 and β-actin bind in a sequence-specific manner and were labeled with fluorescent dyes with different emission spectra, the two templates were co-amplified together in subsequent reactions. Preliminary optimization experiments indicated that no difference existed in the Ct values at a given amount of Cav-1 and β-actin cDNA regardless of whether the templates were amplified in separate reactions or multiplexed in the same reaction.

To prepare the antisense Cav-1 adenovirus, the coding sequence of canine Cav-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned in the reverse orientation into pAdTrack-CMV. Blank and recombinant adenoviruses were prepared as described (27Li G. Faibushevich A. Turunen B.J. Yoon S.O. Georg G. Michaelis M.L. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), amplified in 293 cells, purified by two rounds of centrifugation over CsCl gradients, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol. Schwann cells were infected with adenoviruses for 24 h in complete medium prior to switching the medium to DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum for glucose treatment. Thymidine Uptake Assay—Native SCs were grown in 6-well plates until they were ∼50% confluent. The cells were washed in serum-free DMEM, placed in DMEM containing 2% FCS, and treated with the indicated concentration of glucose in the absence or presence of NGF for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with 6.3 nm (50 ng/ml) human recombinant neuregulin1-β1 epidermal growth factor domain (amino acids 176–246) (NRG1-β1) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for an additional 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added during the final 10 h of the incubation after which the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by 2× 15-min washes with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and 0.4 ml was used to assess the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into the DNA by scintillation spectrometry. [3H]Thymidine uptake was normalized to total protein that was determined from aliquots of the remaining lysate. In some experiments, cells were infected with the indicated titer of Cav-1 antisense adenovirus for 24 h prior to treating the cells with 50 ng/ml NRG1-β1 for an additional 24 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for the final 4 h of the incubation, and uptake into DNA was determined as described above. Cav-1 Is Expressed in SCs and Is Down-regulated in Sciatic Nerve in an Animal Model of DPN—Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat is a well characterized and widely used animal model for studying DPN in type 1 diabetes (29Hounsom L.

Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1997: 1009-1076Google Scholar). Male rats were treated with the drug vehicle or rendered diabetic with STZ, and the sciatic nerves were harvested over a course of 3–17 weeks following the initial designation of the animal as a diabetic. Cav-1 is highly expressed in endothelium (31Bucci M. Gratton J.P. Rudic R.D. Acevedo L. Roviezzo F. Cirino G. Sessa W.C. Nat.

Glia. 2002; 38: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical isolation of the total Cav-1 associated with caveolar membrane preparations from sciatic nerve has contributions from multiple cells types that may respond differentially to hyperglycemia. To circumvent this issue, we examined changes in Cav-1 expression specifically in SCs by immunofluorescence analysis of transverse sections of sciatic nerve that were double-labeled with a monoclonal antibody for Cav-1 and a polyclonal antibody against the SC-specific protein, S100β (23Tikoo R. Zanazzi G. Shiffman D. Salzer J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cav-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A) localized around nerve fibers throughout the entire nerve section in a pattern very similar to that seen for the S100β immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B). Indeed, merging the images shows co-localized regions of Cav-1 and S100β immunoreactivity surrounding most nerve fibers throughout the section (Fig. 1C), and this co-localization is clearly demonstrated in"
https://openalex.org/W2023612935,"Overexpression of SPRR1B in bronchial epithelial cells is a marker for early metaplastic changes induced by various toxicants/carcinogens. Previously, we have shown that the transcriptional stimulation of SPRR1B expression by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mainly mediated by a –150/–94 bp enhancer harboring two critical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements (TREs) and by Jun·Fra-1 dimers. Here, we show that a region between –54 and –39 bp containing an ETS-binding site (EBS) and a GC box is essential for both basal and PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription. In vivo footprinting demonstrated binding of transcription factors to these elements. However, unlike enhancer TREs, exposure of cells to PMA did not significantly alter the footprinting pattern at these elements. Mutations that crippled both the EBS and GC box suppressed both basal and PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription. Consistent with this, overexpression of EBS-binding proteins ESE-1 and ESE-3 significantly stimulated SPRR1B promoter activity. Furthermore, preceding SPRR1B transcription, PMA up-regulated mRNA expression of ETS family members such as ESE-1 and ESE-3. Although ESE-1 synergistically activated c-Jun- and PMA-enhanced SPRR1B transcription, coexpression of Sp1 and ESE-1 showed no synergistic or additive effect on promoter activity, indicating an obligatory role for AP-1 proteins in such regulation. In support of this notion, deletion or mutation of two functional TREs inhibited ESE-1- and Sp1-enhanced promoter activation. Thus, the interaction between ESE-1 and Sp1, and AP-1 proteins that bind to the proximal and distal promoter regions, respectively, play a critical role in the induction of squamous differentiation marker expression in bronchial epithelial cells.

BE cells, a direct target of inhaled toxicants/carcinogens, express mucous cell properties under normal conditions. However, in response to injury, they rapidly undergo changes in their structure and functions to repair the epithelium and display squamous or keratinized properties (3Reddy S.P.M. Ho Y.-S. Wu R. FASEB J. 1997; 1 (abstr.): A500Google Scholar). This phenomenon, which was initially thought to be a protective response to form a barrier against toxicants and pollutants, may lead to epithelial cell transformation and bronchial carcinogenesis if not properly restored (1Basbaum C. Jany B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L38-L46PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pfeifer A.M. Lechner J.F. Masui T. Reddel R.R. Mark G.E. Harris C.C. Environ.

Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the squamous differentiation process will be helpful to obtain additional insight into toxicant-induced BE cell injury, repair, and carcinogenesis. Cultured BE cells provide a good model system to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing both mucous and squamous cell functions (5Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Among the genes, overexpression of human SPRR1B (small proline-rich protein 1B) is a marker for early metaplastic changes in the bronchial epithelium. SPRR1B is highly inducible in BE cells both in vitro and in vivo upon exposure to a variety of agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K.

Hotchkiss J.A. Harkema J.R. Wright P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SPRR1B belongs to a multigene family consisting of two SPRR1 genes (SPRR1A and SPRR1B), seven SPRR2 genes (SPRR2A–SPRR2F), and one each of SPRR3 and SPRR4, which display a distinct expression pattern in various epithelial cell types (10Cabral A. Sayin A. de Winter S. Fischer D.F. Pavel S. Backendorf C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3837-3843PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to that in the airway epithelium, the expression of SPRR genes is abundant in various squamous tissues (8Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of their involvement in cornification, the regulation of SPRR expression not only plays an important role in the modulation of the barrier function of various epithelia, but also provides a greater flexibility to various internal tissues (11Steinert P.M. Candi E. Kartasova T. Marekov L. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4247-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the –150 bp SPRR1B promoter, containing two PMA- or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements (TREs) located at positions –139 and –109, plays a critical role in PMA-inducible SPRR1B expression in BE cells both in primary cultures and in established cell lines such as BEAS-2B clone S6 and H441 (6Reddy S.P.

Physiol. 2002; 282: L215-L225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that members of the AP-1 (activator protein-1) family, Jun (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D) and Fos (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2), differentially regulate PMA-inducible SPRR1B expression in BE cells (7Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y-S. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that an abnormal activation of AP-1 family members by toxicants plays a pivotal role in the induction of squamous cell functions in the bronchial epithelium. However, substantial experimental evidence indicates that, in addition to AP-1 proteins, the ETS transcription factor family also plays a regulatory role in epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. Nearly 35 ETS proteins that contain a highly conserved winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain have been reported thus far (14Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by inducible expression, modification, and/or activation by various extracellular signals, ETS proteins bind to the core consensus sequence 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ (henceforth referred to as the ETS-binding site (EBS)) (14Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Functional EBSs have been found in the promoter regions of a variety of genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation (14Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Some of the regulatory regions of extracellular matrix proteins and epidermal differentiation markers, including SPRR proteins, also contain EBSs in the vicinity of functional TREs (15Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that interaction of ETS transcription factors with other proteins such as AP-1 and Sp1 plays an important role in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (15Sark M.W.

In this study, we have investigated whether epithelium-specific ETS subfamily members ESE-1, ESE-2, and ESE-3 and Sp1 have a similar role in the regulation of SPRR1B expression in BE cells. Here, using in vivo footprinting and mutational analysis, we demonstrate that a region between –54 and –39 bp containing the EBS and GC box participates in the regulation of both basal and PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription. Mutation of these sites strongly suppressed both basal and PMA-inducible promoter activities. Overexpression of ESE-1, ESE-3, and Sp1 strongly stimulated SPRR1B transcription. Deletion of distal enhancer-containing TREs strongly suppressed such activation. Our results suggest that interplay between protein factors that bind at distal TREs and the proximal EBS and GC box is required for high level toxicant-inducible SPRR1B transcription in BE cells. Gene Expression Analyses—Primary cultured BE cells were isolated from human tracheobronchial tissues and cultured as described previously (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J.

Yankaskas) was maintained in serum-free hormone-supplemented medium. The NCI-H441 cell line (Clara-like bronchiolar pulmonary adenocarcinoma) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% serum according to the American Type Culture Collection data sheet. Cells were treated with either vehicle (Me2SO) or PMA (5 ng/ml for primary cultures, 20 ng/ml for H441 cells, and 100 ng/ml for S6 cells) for the indicated time periods. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was isolated, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed as previously described (7Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y-S. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P.

Briefly, cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence, followed by incubation with or without PMA for 12 h. Cells were subsequently treated with 0.1% DMS for 2 min at room temperature under respective culture conditions without serum. Genomic DNA was then isolated using the phenol/chloroform extraction method. As an in vitro control, protein-free genomic DNA was prepared and treated with DMS for 20 –30 s at room temperature. Both in vivo and in vitro treated genomic DNAs (3 μg) were subjected to piperidine treatment, and the cleaved DNA fragments were amplified by the ligation-mediated PCR method of genomic DNA sequencing (20Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed on a 6% denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel. Bands were detected following 24–48 h of autoradiography. DNA samples prepared from at least two separate batches of DMS-treated cells were analyzed to demonstrate the reproducibility of data. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from vehicle (Me2SO)or PMA-treated S6 cells were prepared, and EMSA was performed as described previously (7Patterson T. Vuong H.

Briefly, to determine GC box-binding proteins, 0.5 ng of 32P-end-labeled SPRR1B promoter fragments (wild-type or mutants; for sequences, see Table II) or double-stranded Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide was incubated with the nuclear extracts in buffer containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 μm EDTA, 500 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA. To determine ETS protein binding, nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated labeled probes in 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (15Sark M.W.

For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were mixed with 1–2 μg of antibody specific for ETS-1/2 (sc-112X), Sp1 (sc-59G), or ESE-1 (sc-17306X) (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and incubated on ice for 1–2 h prior to adding the labeled DNA probe. In Vivo Footprinting of the SPRR1B Proximal Promoter— Previously, using in vivo footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that a 57-bp fragment (–150 to –94 bp) containing two TREs at positions –139 and –109 (Fig. 1A) is essential for PMA-stimulated expression of SPRR1B in BE cells (6Reddy S.P.

Importantly, the sequences and positions of these sites are highly conserved among various SPRR family members (15Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA interactions at both coding (–71 to –29 bp) and noncoding (–69 to –18 bp) strands of the promoter (Fig. 1) were mapped at single nucleotide resolution by a genomic sequencing method in intact living cells that were untreated or PMA-treated. Compared with protein-free genomic DNA controls, both primary cultures of tracheobronchial epithelial (PTBE) cells (Fig. 1B) and the established nonmalignant BE cell line S6 (Fig. 1C) displayed strong in vivo footprints covering the –71/–29 bp SPRR1B promoter. On the coding strand, –36, –41, –42, and –45 G residues of the GC box displayed strong protection in both primary cultures and S6 cells compared with the respective naked DNA controls. On the noncoding strand, –39 and –44 G residues of the GC box also displayed protection. The –52 G residue of the EBS was protected (∼50%) compared with the naked DNA control (N) in both PTBE and S6 cells. However, there was no significant alteration of the reactivity of the –52 G residue upon PMA stimulation. Other protected G residues include the –56, –62, –63, and –66 residues flanking the EBS on the 5′-end. This region also contains a GATA-like sequence. Although the overall foot-printing pattern of the promoter is similar, protection in S6 cells was somewhat weak in comparison with the pattern observed in PTBE cells. This is consistent with the nature of a high level expression of SPRR1B in PTBE cells compared with transformed nonmalignant BE cells S6 and HBE-1 (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).These results indicate that the EBS and GC box located in the proximal promoter are occupied in vivo by protein factors that might play a regulatory role in SPRR1B expression in BE cells. The EBS and GC Box Regulate Both Basal and PMA-stimulated SPRR1B Transcription—To address the functional relevance of the in vivo footprints, we mutated the promoter spanning the EBS and GC box by a two-step PCR method in the context of the –620/+ 12 (referred to as 620-Luc) and –150/+ 12 (referred to as 150-Luc) bp 5′-flanking regions (Fig. 2A). Both wild-type and mutant promoter-reporter constructs (as depicted in Fig. 2A) were transiently transfected into S6 and H441 cells. We have chosen these two cell lines because both endogenous SPRR1B mRNA and promoter activity are strongly induced upon PMA treatment (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y-S. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P.

Physiol. 2002; 282: L215-L225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of the –150 bp promoter-reporter construct (150-Luc) was considered as 1. The reporter gene expression observed in the presence or absence of PMA is shown in Fig. 2B. Consistent with our previous studies (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y-S. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P.

Physiol. 2002; 282: L215-L225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), both the 620-Luc and 150-Luc constructs displayed a higher promoter activity that could be significantly induced upon PMA stimulation. However, mutations that crippled both the EBS and GC box (620EBS/GC-mt and 150EBS/GC-mt) strongly ablated the basal and PMA-inducible promoter activities, which were nearly comparable to that of the mutant lacking the TREs (620TRE-mt). Similar results were obtained in PTBE cells (data not shown). Thus, both in vivo footprinting and mutation studies suggest that the EBS and GC box located at –54 and –48 bp play a prominent role in SPRR1B transcription in BE cells. Overexpression of ESE-1 and Sp1 Up-regulates SPRR1B Transcription—To determine the role of the EBS and GC box, we selectively introduced mutations in the context of the –150 bp promoter (Fig. 3A) that contain necessary elements for PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription in BE cells (6Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y-S. Wu R.

Physiol. 2002; 282: L215-L225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant promoter constructs and treated with or without PMA as described under “Materials and Methods.” The mutation that crippled the EBS significantly suppressed both basal and PMA-inducible promoter activities (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the mutation that crippled the GC box did not have a significant effect on basal activity, whereas it had some effect on PMA-inducible expression. To determine whether the EBS and GC box are required for inducible expression, cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant promoter constructs along with expression vectors coding for ESE-1, ESE-3, Sp1, and Sp3, and luciferase activity was quantified. As shown in Fig. 3C, overexpression of ESE-1, ESE-3 (data not shown), and Sp1 strongly enhanced wild-type –150 bp promoter activity nearly 5-fold, whereas Sp3 did not have any significant effect. In contrast, the mutant promoter construct lacking both the EBS and GC box (EBS/GC-mt) did not respond to ESE-1 or Sp1. More importantly, even the basal promoter activity was decreased in this construct. Selective mutation of the EBS (EBS-mt) or GC box (GC-mt) also had a similar effect on inducible reporter gene expression. Although individual mutations of both the EBS and GC did not completely eliminate ESE-1- and Sp1-inducible expression, the inducible levels were nearly comparable to that of the basal promoter activity of the wild-type construct. Thus, these studies indicate the requirement of both the EBS and GC box for high level ESE-1-, Sp1-, and PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription in BE cells.

Involvement of ICA69 in neurosecretion has been suggested by the impairment of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions upon mutation of its homologue gene ric-19 in C. elegans. In this study, we have further investigated the localization of ICA69 in neurons and insulinoma INS-1 cells. ICA69 was enriched in the perinuclear region, whereas it did not co-localize with markers of synaptic vesicles/synaptic-like microvesicles. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation in INS-1 cells showed co-localization of ICA69 with markers of the Golgi complex and, to a minor extent, with immature insulin-containing secretory granules. The association of ICA69 with these organelles was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Virtually no ICA69 immunogold labeling was observed on secretory granules near the plasma membrane, suggesting that ICA69 dissociates from secretory granule membranes during their maturation. In silico sequence and structural analyses revealed that the N-terminal region of ICA69 is similar to the region of arfaptins that interacts with ARF1, a small GTPase involved in vesicle budding at the Golgi complex and immature secretory granules. ICA69 is therefore a novel arfaptin-related protein that is likely to play a role in membrane trafficking at the Golgi complex and immature secretory granules in neurosecretory cells.

[α-32P]GTP Overlay—INS-1 cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. [α-32P]GTP overlay assay was performed as previously described (22Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling was detected with the Bio-Imager Analyzer BAS-1800II (Fujifilm).

Huttner (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany) and Dr. R. Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen, Germany). Fractions were immunoblotted with pICA69 and synaptophysin antibodies. Fractionation of INS-1 cells on continuous sucrose density gradients (0.4–1.8 m sucrose) was performed as described (24Reetz A.

Fractions were immunoblotted for ICA69 (pICA69), synaptophysin, TGN38 (1:200), GM130 (1:200), syntaxin 6 (1:500), transferrin receptor (1:2,500), carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (1:2,000), and the 18-kDa fragment of secretogranin II (1:400). Semiquantitative measurement was performed with the Image Reader 2.2 software of the LAS-1000 imaging system (Fujifilm). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron Microscopy on gradient fractions was performed as described (27Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) using antibodies pICA69 (1:50) and anti-TGN38 (1:25) followed by goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with 10- and 6-nm gold particles, respectively. Immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryostat sections was performed as described (28Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) with minor variations. INS-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were simultaneously labeled with pICA69 (1:10) and anti-giantin (1:10) or anti-insulin (1:100) antibodies, followed by 6- and 12-nm gold-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively. As controls, primary antibodies were omitted. Data Base Searches and Structural Predictions—Data base searches were carried out with the programs BLASTP and PSI-BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59913) Google Scholar) using standard parameters against the nonredundant NCBI protein data base (release of November 27, 2001). Multiple sequence alignments were produced with the program ClustalX (30Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) and PredictProtein (33Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of Two Antibodies Directed against Distinct Epitopes of ICA69 —The localization of ICA69 in neurons and insulinoma cells was investigated by employing two distinct antibodies directed against ICA69. The first antibody consists of affinity-purified rabbit IgGs (polyclonal ICA69, or pICA69), which were raised against residues 471–483 at the C-terminal end of ICA69 (1Pietropaolo M. Castano L. Babu S. Buelow R. Kuo Y.L.S. Martin S. Martin A. Powers A.C. Prochazka M. Naggert J. Leiter E.H. Eisenbarth G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The second antibody was a monoclonal IgG (mICA69), which was obtained by mouse immunization with full-length recombinant ICA69 expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. To map the epitope recognized by mICA69, the N-terminal (amino acids 1–239) and C-terminal (amino acids 230–483) halves of ICA69 were independently expressed as 35S-labeled polypeptides by in vitro transcription/translation and incubated either with mICA69 or control mouse IgG for immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A). This analysis shows that mICA69 selectively immunoprecipitated the N-terminal ICA69 polypeptide, whereas control mouse IgG did not react with either ICA69 fragment. Whereas the N-terminal fragment of ICA69 has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, it migrated as a 35-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. The aberrant electrophoretic mobility of the N-terminal domain may account for the overall slower migration of native ICA69, which has a molecular mass of 54.6 kDa but migrates as a 60-kDa protein under the present conditions for SDS-PAGE (1Pietropaolo M. Castano L. Babu S. Buelow R. Kuo Y.L.S. Martin S. Martin A. Powers A.C. Prochazka M. Naggert J. Leiter E.H. Eisenbarth G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). By Western blotting on PNS from rat brain (Fig. 1B) and INS-1 cells (Fig. 1C), both mICA69 and pICA69 antibodies recognized indeed a protein doublet of 60 kDa (R f = 0.34 and 0.37, respectively). Given its detection with two antibodies directed against distinct ICA69 epitopes, this 60-kDa protein doublet is likely to represent ICA69. The amino acid sequence of ICA69 contains a second methionine at position 26. Initiation of translation at this alternative methionine may explain the presence of a protein doublet upon in vitro translation (Fig. 1A) and in cell extracts (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, mICA69 and pICA69 antibodies immunoprecipitated the same 60-kDa protein doublet from INS-1 cell extracts (Fig. 1D) and produced an identical particulate staining by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2A). Partitioning of ICA69 between cytosolic and particulate fractions (Fig. 1C) suggested that a pool of the protein is membrane-associated, despite lacking membrane targeting motifs.Fig. 2Confocal microscopy for ICA69 and markers of SLMVs, SVs, and SGs. A, mICA69 (pseudogreen) and pICA69 (pseudored) produced a nearly identical staining pattern in the perinuclear region of INS-1 cells (orange-yellow pseudocolor). N, nucleus. B, high power magnification of INS-1 cells double stained for ICA69 (pseudored) and synaptophysin (pseudogreen). While synaptophysin was enriched at neurite-like cell extensions (long arrow), ICA69 was concentrated in the perinuclear region (arrowhead). C, ICA69 (pseudogreen) did not co-localize with ICA512 (pseudored), a protein enriched in MSGs. D–F, distribution of ICA69 (pseudored) in mouse brain. Double labelings with GAD65 (D and E) and synaptophysin (F) as markers of SVs (both in pseudogreen). D, ICA69 immunoreactivity was prominent in Purkinje cells (PC, arrow), but not in the molecular layer (ML) or granular layer (GL), where most synaptic terminals of the cerebellar cortex are found. E and F, high power magnifications showing that ICA69 is associated with perinuclear structures (arrowheads), whereas it does not co-localize with GAD65 (E) or synaptophysin (F) in synaptic terminals around the cell bodies (arrows) and axon hillocks (asterisks) of Purkinje cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ICA69 Is Not Enriched in Neuronal Synaptic Vesicles and Synaptic-like-Microvesicles of INS-1 Cells—Previous studies suggested an association of ICA69 with neuronal SVs and SLMVs of insulinoma cells (3Pilon M. Peng X.-R. Spence A.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Dosch H.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3277-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Double immunofluorescence on INS-1 cells, however, showed that ICA69 immunoreactivity was concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2A), whereas virtually no signal was found at the tip of neurite-like extensions where synaptophysin and SLMVs are concentrated (Fig. 2B) (34De Camilli P. Vitadello M. Canevini M.P. Zanoni R. Jahn R. Gorio A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Johnston P.A. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ICA69 distribution was also different from that of ICA512, a protein enriched in mature secretory granules (MSGs) near the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C) (9Solimena M. Dirkx R.J. Hermel J.M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Double immunofluorescence on mouse cerebellar sections showed that ICA69 is found in the perinuclear region of Purkinje cells (Fig. 2, D–F). This pattern did not resemble that of GAD65, which is associated with SVs of GABA-ergic synapses around Purkinje cells and throughout the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 2, D and E) (24Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 36Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). There was also no co-localization of ICA69 with synaptophysin (Fig. 2F), a general marker of SVs and synaptic terminals (34De Camilli P. Vitadello M. Canevini M.P. Zanoni R. Jahn R. Gorio A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations were made upon subcellular fractionation of rat brain synaptosomes. As expected (37Navone F. Jahn R. Di Gioia G. Stukenbrok H. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2511-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), synaptophysin was concentrated in the LP2 fraction (crude SVs) and further enriched in the sucrose-gradient vesicle fraction (purified SVs), whereas ICA69 was most abundant in the LP1 (large membranes and cytoskeleton) and LS2 (synaptosol) fractions (not shown). These data indicated that ICA69 is neither enriched on neuronal SVs nor on SLMVs and MSGs of insulinoma cells. Localization of ICA69 to the Golgi Complex and Immature Secretory Granules by Confocal Microscopy—We compared the perinuclear pattern of ICA69 with that of proteins enriched in the Golgi compartment of INS-1 cells (Fig. 3, A–F). ICA69 was co-localized in part with TGN38 (Fig. 3A) and giantin (Fig. 3B). Giantin is a general marker of the Golgi complex (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), whereas TGN38 is enriched at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (38Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Reaves B. Horn M. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ICA69 also partially overlapped with the peripherally associated Golgi proteins β′COP (Fig. 3C) (40Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Finally, ICA69 overlapped in part with proinsulin, which is found in ISGs, but not in MSGs (Fig. 3E) (45Orci L. Ravazzola M. Perrelet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6743-6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Steiner D.F. Docherty K. Carroll R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It also co-distributed with insulin in the Golgi region but not near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3F). The significant, albeit partial, colocalization of ICA69 with Golgi markers GM-130 and TGN38 was confirmed in hamster insulinoma HIT-cells and mouse insulinoma MIN-6 cells (Fig. 4, A–I). These results suggested that ICA69 is broadly associated with the Golgi complex and, to a much lesser extent, with ISGs.Fig. 4Confocal microscopy for ICA69 (pseudored, left panels) and markers of the Golgi complex (pseudogreen, central panels) in hamster HIT (A–F) and mouse MIN6 (G–I) insulinoma cells. ICA69 partially overlaps significantly with TGN38 (A–C) and GM-130 (D–I). Merged images are shown in the right panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of ICA69 at the Golgi Complex and Immature Secretory Granules by Immunoelectron Microscopy—By immunoelectron microscopy on cryoultrathin sections of INS-1 cells, ICA69 was found on Golgi stacks close to giantin (Fig. 5A) and at budding sites of vesicles from the Golgi complex (Fig. 5B) and SGs (Fig. 5C). Overall, ICA69 was found on a minority of SGs (Fig. 5E), as identified by double gold immunolabeling with insulin (not shown). ICA69-positive SGs were most abundant in the central region of the cell (Fig. 5D), with a mean distance from the plasma membrane that was about twice the mean distance of ICA69-negative SGs and SGs in general (Fig. 5F). These data indicated that ICA69 is associated with the Golgi complex, whereas a minor pool is also found on ISGs, which are significantly more distant from the plasma membrane than the total of the SGs. Enrichment of ICA69 on the Golgi Complex by Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation of INS-1 cell extracts on sucrose density gradients separated two main peaks of ICA69 at 0.9 and 1.1 m sucrose (Fig. 6A). These fractions included the peaks of the TGN proteins TGN38 and syntaxin 6 (0.9 m sucrose) and the early Golgi marker GM130 (1.1 m sucrose) (Fig. 6B, left panel). The soluble pools of ICA69 and GM130 were recovered in light fractions (0.4–0.5 m sucrose), whereas low levels of ICA69 were detected in 1.2–1.4 m sucrose fractions. These last fractions contained the first peak of the SG marker CPE (Fig. 6B, middle panel), indicating the presence of ISGs, which are lower in density than the MSGs. A second pool of CPE was found in denser fractions (1.5–1.7 m sucrose) together with p18, a marker of MSGs (11Wendler F. Page L. Urbé S. Tooze S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Tooze S.A. Hollinshead M. Dittie A.S. Biochimie. 1994; 76 (Paris): 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The peaks of ICA69 were slightly shifted from those of synaptophysin and transferrin receptor, which overlapped in 1.0 m sucrose fractions (Fig. 6B, right panel) (48Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The gradient fractions were also examined by immunoelectron microscopy. The 0.9 m sucrose fraction contained membranous, ribbon-like structures that resemble Golgi stacks and were positive for ICA69 and TGN38 (Fig. 6C, left panel), whereas the 1.35 m sucrose fraction contained SGs positive for ICA69 (Fig. 6C, right panel). These data confirmed the association of ICA69 with Golgi membranes and, to a lesser extent, with ISGs. The Distribution of ICA69 Is Nocodazole- and BFA-sensitive—We analyzed whether drugs that affect the organization of the Golgi complex alter the distribution of ICA69 in INS-1 cells. Nocodazole treatment caused a major loss of ICA69 immunoreactivity in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7A). Some ICA69, however, could still be detected on TGN38-labeled Golgi fragments scattered throughout the cells. Treatment of cells with nocodazole followed by taxol causes a redistribution and mild destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton similar to what occurs in the prophase of mitosis (18Walenta J.H. Didier A.J. Liu X. Kramer H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 49Jean C. Tollon Y. Raynaud-Messina B. Wright M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In these conditions, ICA69 had a bipolar distribution that overlapped with TGN38 at opposite sides of the nucleus (Fig. 7B), near the centrioles (Fig. 7C). BFA causes the release of coatomers from Golgi membranes and the retrieval of resident Golgi enzymes into the endoplasmic reticulum by inhibiting guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF (50Jackson C.L. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 233-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also leads to the formation of a hybrid TGN-endosomal system near the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) by inhibiting the TGN-endosome recycling pathway (51Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.

To determine which domain of these proteins is associated with substrate specificity and subcellular localization, we constructed various chimeric MRP1/MRP2 molecules and expressed them in polarized mammalian LLC-PK1 cells. We examined the kinetic properties of each chimeric protein by measuring LTC4 and methotrexate transport in inside-out membrane vesicles, sensitivity to an anticancer agent, etoposide, and subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence methods. The following results were determined in these studies: (i) when the NH2-proximal 108 amino acids of MRP2, including transmembrane (TM) helices 1–3, were exchanged with the corresponding region of MRP1, Km(LTC4) values of the chimera decreased ∼4-fold and Km(methotrexate) values increased ∼5-fold relative to those of wild-type MRP2 and MRP1, respectively, whereas resistance to etoposide increased ∼3-fold; (ii) when the NH2-proximal region up to TM9 of MRP2 was exchanged with the corresponding region of MRP1, a further increase in etoposide resistance was observed, and subcellular localization moved from the apical to the lateral membrane; (iii) when two-thirds of MRP2 at the NH2 terminus were exchanged with the corresponding MRP1 region, the chimeric protein transported LTC4 with an efficiency comparable with that achieved by the wild-type MRP1; and (iv) exchange of the COOH-terminal 51 amino acids between MRP1 and MRP2 did not affect the localization of either of the proteins.

Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The primary distinguishing characteristic of MRP1 and its related proteins, MRP2, -3, -6, and -7, is an additional NH2-terminal region forming a membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) with five transmembrane (TM) helices; however, the function of MSD1 remains to be clarified (1Loe D.W.

This region is linked to the MDR-like core by a cytoplasmic loop (CL) of ∼130 amino acids, which is sometimes referred to as CL3 (17Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E.

The MRP1 homolog, MRP2/cMOAT, shows only a 49% amino acid identity to human MRP1; however, its secondary structure is similar to that of MRP1 (19Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. J. Mol.

In addition, MRP2 is involved in the transmembrane transport of some anticancer agents and confers a drug resistance pattern that is similar but not identical to that of MRP1. Resistance to vincristine and etoposide is markedly enhanced in MRP1 cDNA-transfected cells and is diminished in mrp1–/– cells (5Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M.

In contrast, our previous study showed MRP2 cDNA-transfected cells display resistance to vincristine but only low level resistance to etoposide (25Koike K. Kawabe T. Tanaka T. Toh S. Uchiumi T. Wada M. Akiyama S. Ono M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5475-5479PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kawabe T. Chen Z-S. Wada M. Uchiumi T. Ono M. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MRP2 transported the β-O-glucuronide conjugate of the tobacco-specific carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, with higher efficiency than MRP1, and GSH inhibited rather than stimulated uptake of this conjugate (27Leslie E.M.

Thus, MRP1 and MRP2 share several substrates in common, but the relative affinities of the two proteins for some of these substrates appear to vary markedly, and the substrate binding pockets of the two proteins must have some significant differences (28Keppler D. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 787-791PubMed Google Scholar, 29Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have identified regions and specific amino acids of MRP1 that are important for substrate binding (30Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C.

The most well characterized substrate of MRP1 is the cysteinyl leukotriene, leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Knock-out mice lacking mrp1 show an impaired response to a leukotriene-mediated inflammatory stimulus (36Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the mrp1-mediated efflux of LTC4 is involved in regulating dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes (36Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 37Robbiani D.F. Finch R.A. Jager D. Muller W.A. Sartorelli A.C. Randolph G.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). At present, LTC4 is the substrate with the highest affinity to MRP1 and mrp1 (Km ∼100 nm). MRP2 also shows relatively high affinity for this substrate; however, the Km(LTC4) of MRP2 is ∼10-fold higher than for MRP1 (38Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Bucholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley G.R. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cui Y. Buchholz J.K. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). Many MRP1 structure-function studies have been based on LTC4 transport activity. Gao et al. (30Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggested that the CL3 region between amino acids 204 and 281 is essential for LTC4 transport activity. A recent study indicated that the deletion of all transmembrane helices of MSD1 (MRP1-(204–1531)) had no effect on MRP1-mediated LTC4 transport (40Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that MSD1 may not participate in LTC4 transport. However, an LTC4 photolabeling study revealed that the 281 NH2-proximal amino acids of MRP1 were essential in the binding of LTC4 to the NH2-proximal half of the protein, and CL3 contained a region that is critical for the correct folding of MRP1 (33Qian Y.M. Qiu W. Gao M. Westlake C.J. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38636-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cys7 (TM1) mutation of MRP1 changed the NH2-terminal conformation and LTC4 transport activity (35Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, TM6 (MSD2) may contribute to LTC4 transport activity (34Haimeur A. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41326-41333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that several regions of MRP1 play an important role in the recognition and/or transport of LTC4. In contrast to MRP1, little is known about regions of specific amino acids responsible for MRP2 substrate specificity and affinity. Despite the close structural similarity between MRP1 and MRP2 proteins, their subcellular localization differs. MRP1 is present in the basolateral membrane, whereas MRP2 is localized to the apical membrane of polarized cells (41Evers R. Zaman G.J.R. van Deemter L. Jansen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C.J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15091-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Comparison of the primary structure of MRP2 with that of MRP1 revealed a 7-amino acid extension at its COOH terminus, the last 3 amino acids (TKF) of which comprise a PDZ-interacting motif. It has been reported that interaction of this motif with a PDZ domain-containing protein is important for the apical localization of membrane proteins (44Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 45Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In particular, the PDZ-interacting motif is a determinant for the apical localization of CFTR (46Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M. Moyer B.D. Cheng J. Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Cutting G.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MRP2 was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid system screen using a PDZ domain-containing protein as the bait (47Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the COOH terminus, particularly the PDZ-interacting motif, might be important for the apical sorting of MRP2. However, the experimental results that have been obtained by examining the role of this motif in apical targeting remain controversial. Harris et al. (48Harris M. Kuwano M. Webb M. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20876-20881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that the deletion of the TKF motif resulted in the basolateral targeting of MRP2. Using an NH2-terminal fusion of MRP2 to green fluorescent protein in transiently transfected cells, Nies et al. (49Nies A.T. Konig J. Cui Y. Brom M. Spring H. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1866-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), by contrast, showed that deletion of the COOH-terminal 11 amino acids, including the PDZ-interacting motif, did not abolish apical targeting but that deletion of 15 or more amino acids did have this effect in HepG2 cells. On the other hand, NH2-terminal MSD1 and/or CL3 are thought to be necessary for membrane routing, as shown by deletion experiments involving these regions in MRP1 and MRP2 (45Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 50Fernandez S.B. Hollo Z. Kern A. Bakos E. Fischer P.A. Borst P. Evers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31048-31055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It appears likely that this region of the MRP2 protein is involved in the integration into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, intracellular trafficking, and/or recycling by endocytosis. However, additional signals responsible for the differential targeting of the multidrug resistance proteins to particular membrane domains have not been determined. To identify the regions involved in determining substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and the subcellular localization of MRP1 and MRP2, we created a series of MRP1/MRP2 chimeras and tested them for their ability to transport LTC4, confer resistance to etoposide, and localize to a distinct membrane region. Materials—Vincristine, LTC4, and MTX were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide was obtained from Nippon Kayaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). LipofectAMINE 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]LTC4 (182.8 Ci/mmol) and [3H]MTX (5.90 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Lines and Culture—LLC-PK1 (polarized pig kidney epithelial cells) were purchased from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin, as described previously (26Kawabe T. Chen Z-S. Wada M. Uchiumi T. Ono M. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Determination of Protein Levels in Transfected Cells—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Kawabe T. Chen Z-S. Wada M. Uchiumi T. Ono M. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots of membrane vesicles (40 μg) were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. The MRP1 proteins were identified using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MRPm6, which reacts with an epitope close to the COOH terminus of MRP1 (amino acids 1511–1520) (51Hipfner D.R. Gao M. Scheffer G. Scheper R.J. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The MRP2 proteins were detected with the mAb M2III-6, which reacts with an epitope close to the COOH terminus of MRP2 (amino acids 1339–1541) (52Scheffer G.L. Kool M. Heijn M. de Haas M. Pijnenborg A.C. Wijnholds J. van Helvoort A. de Jong M.C. Hooijberg J.H. Mol C.A. van der Linden M. de Vree J.M. van der Valk P. Elferink R.P. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5269-5277PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with the mAbs for 2 h at room temperature and then with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Membranes were developed by chemiluminescence following the ECL protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Relative levels of protein expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using an Image Gauge V3.41 software (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). The relative protein expression levels were calculated by dividing the densitometry value obtained for 40 μg of total membrane protein from transfectants expressing the chimeric proteins by the densitometry value obtained for comparable amounts of total membrane proteins from transfectants expressing wild-type MRP2 proteins. Each comparison was performed at least three times in independent experiments, and the mean values were used for normalization purposes. Construction of Vectors Encoding MRP1/MRP2 Chimera Proteins—To generate the MRP1-(1–116)/MRP2 cDNA, an MRP1-(1–116) fragment was generated with 5′- and 3′-restriction enzyme sites, MluI and BlnI, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. PCR amplification was performed using the forward primer (5′-GCC GCa cgc gtC ACC GGC ATG GCG-3′) and the reverse primer (3′-CTC TCA ACC Cgga t c cTC TTT GTG ACC CCG GTC C-5′) with pJ3Ω-MRP1 (gift from Dr. P. Borst, The Netherlands Cancer Institute) as a template (substituted nucleotides are underlined; letters in italic type indicate restriction enzyme recognition sequences). The PCR product was isolated and subcloned into the EcoRV site (blunt-end ligation) of pT7 Blue-3 plasmid (Novagen). The pCIneo (Promega)-MRP2 construct was digested with BlnI and NotI to yield a fragment composed of nucleotides 322–4782 of MRP2. This 4.4-kb BlnI-NotI MRP2 fragment and the PCR product, which encoded nucleotides 1–369 of MRP1, were ligated to the MluI/NotI-digested pCIneo mammalian expression vector, obtained by triple ligation, to give the construct pCIneo-MRP1-(1–116)/MRP2. MRP1-(1–239)/MRP2, MRP1-(1–480)/MRP2, MRP1-(1–555)/MRP2, and MRP1-(1–846)/MRP2 were generated using the same method and the triple ligation procedure. To generate the MRP1 fragments, a forward primer was used to generate an MluI restriction site at the 5′-end, with MRP1 as template, the same as those used above. To engineer the other 3′-end, restriction sites of MRP1 fragments were used, with the following reverse primers (the corresponding changes in the restriction sites of the MRP1 fragments are indicated in parenthesis): MRP1-(1–239)/MRP2 (XhoI), 3′-CCG CCA TCG Gga gct cTT AGT TGG GAC ACT AGG TGG-5′; MRP1-(1–480)/MRP2 (AseI), 3′-GGT AGT GTC Gta att aCC CGT GGT ACT CCT GGT AG-5′; MRP1-(1–555)/MRP2 (HpaI), 3′-CTT TCC CGc aat tgT GGG TCC ACT TCC ACG GGT G-5′; MRP1-(1–846)/MRP2 (MfeI), 3′-GGG TAG AGT Cgt taa cAC GGC GGT GAG TAC TGC TAC-5′. To generate MRP2-(1–1480)/MRP1 cDNA, an MRP1-(1481–1531) fragment was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the 5′-restriction enzyme site BclI. PCR amplification was performed using the forward primer 5′-TGC ACC Gtg atc aCC ATC GCC-3′ and the reverse primer 3′-CCC AAT TAC GAA GCT CGT CT-5′ with pJ3Ω-MRP1 as template. Subsequent steps were performed by the same method (i.e. the triple ligation procedure) described above. The MRP1-(1–1480)/MRP2 vector was generated by PCR amplification of nucleotides 3881–4442 of MRP1 using a forward primer, 5′-GAG GCT CAA GGA GTA TTC AGA G-3′, and a reverse primer, 3′-CTG ACG TGG Cac tag tGG TAG-5′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BclI, and the fragment was isolated. The MRP2 cDNA clone was digested with BclI and NotI, leaving nucleotides 4413–4638 of MRP2 attached to the vector pT7 Blue-3. The digested vector and attached insert were then ligated to the EcoRI-BclI PCR product. The pJ3Ω-MRP1 construct was digested with NotI and EcoRI, yielding a fragment composed of nucleotides 1–3880 of MRP1 with a portion of the vector polylinker at its 5′ end. This 3.9-kb NotI-EcoRI MRP fragment was ligated to the EcoRI-digested construct. The insert was excised using NotI and transferred into a NotI-digested pCIneo expression vector to give the construct pCIneo-MRP1-(1–1480)/MRP2. The integrity of the hybrid constructs was confirmed by restriction analysis and by sequencing full-length constructs. Transient and Stable Transfection with Various Chimeric MRP1/MRP2 Expression Vectors—For transient transfections, wild-type and chimeric pCIneo-MRP1/MRP2 expression vectors were transfected into LLC-PK1 cells. Cells were seeded into two-well culture slides (Falcon) 48–72 h prior to transfection, and DNA (2 μg/well) was added using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 48 h, cells were washed with fresh medium. After 72–96 h, the LLC-PK1 cells were tested. For stable transfections, exponentially growing LLC-PK1 cells in 24-well plates (1.5 × 104) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in serum-free medium. Cells were incubated in the presence of 2 μg of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 0.8 μg of expression vector DNA for 24 h and washed with fresh medium. Cells were then incubated in selection medium containing 550 μg/ml G418 for 3–4 weeks. Stable transfectants were selected from the G418-resistant transfectants. We also isolated a G418-resistant mock transfectant, LLC-PK1/Vec, produced by transfection of the vector alone. Chemosensitivity Testing by Colony Formation Assay—Cell survival was determined by plating 3 × 102 cells from LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with chimera MRP1/MRP2 cDNAs in 35-mm dishes in the absence of drug treatment, which was added 24 h later. After incubation for 7 days at 37 °C, the colonies were counted following the Giemsa staining procedure (25Koike K. Kawabe T. Tanaka T. Toh S. Uchiumi T. Wada M. Akiyama S. Ono M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5475-5479PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kawabe T. Chen Z-S. Wada M. Uchiumi T. Ono M. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All drugs were freshly prepared in physiologic saline or dimethyl sulfoxide. Equivalent volumes of saline or dimethyl sulfoxide were added in all control experiments. The 50% lethal dose (IC50) for each cell line was determined from the doseresponse curves. IC50 values and S.D. values were obtained from the best fit of the data to a sigmoidal curve using GraphPad Prism™ software. Relative resistance was obtained by dividing the IC50 of cells transfected with vectors encoding either wild-type or MRP1/MRP2 hybrid proteins by the IC50 of cells transfected with the pCIneo vector alone. Immunofluorescence Study—The localization patterns of the immunoreactive MRP1/MRP2 chimeras in transiently transfected LLC-PK1 cells were determined by indirect fluorescent immunostaining. Cells were examined with an MRC-1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a × 100 objective. Cells were fixed by incubation in paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Labeling was performed using MRP1 (MRP m6) and MRP2 (M2III-6) mAb, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG, as described previously (23Hashimoto K. Uchiumi T. Konno T. Ebihara T. Nakamura T. Wada M. Sakisaka S. Maniwa F. Amachi T. Ueda K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1236-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For each transient transfection, at least 30 transfected (as observed by fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence) cells were counted on a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Membrane Vesicle Preparation—All steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Stably transfected LLC-PK1 cell monolayers were washed and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and washed by centrifugation (4000 × g for 10 min). The cell pellet was stored at –80 °C until"
https://openalex.org/W2107348902,"To localize the regions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that are responsive to activation by apoC-II, an apoC-II peptide fragment was cross-linked to bovine LPL. Following chemical hydrolysis and peptide separation, a specific fragment of LPL (residues 65–86) was identified to interact with apoC-II. The fragment contains regions of amino acid sequence dissimilarity compared with hepatic lipase (HL), a member of the same gene family that is not responsive to apoC-II. Using site-directed mutagenesis, two sets of chimeras were created in which the two regions of human LPL (residues 65–68 and 73–79) were exchanged with the corresponding human HL sequences. The chimeras consisted of an HL backbone with the suspected LPL regions replacing the corresponding HL sequences either individually (HLLPL-(65–68) and HLLPL-(73–79)) or together (HLLPLD). Similarly, LPL chimeras were created in which the candidate regions were replaced with the corresponding HL sequences (LPLHL-(77–80), LPLHL-(85–91), and LPLHLD). Using a synthetic triolein substrate, the lipase activity of the purified enzymes was measured in the presence and absence of apoC-II. Addition of apoC-II to HLLPL-(65–68) and HLLPL-(73–79) did not significantly alter their enzyme activity. However, the activity of HLLPLD increased ∼5-fold in the presence of apoC-II compared with an increase in native LPL activity of ∼11-fold. Addition of apoC-II to LPLHL-(77–80) resulted in ∼10-fold activation, whereas only ∼6- and ∼4-fold activation of enzyme activity was observed in LPLHL-(85–91) and LPLHLD, respectively. In summary, our results have identified 11 amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of LPL (residues 65–68 and 73–79) that appear to act cooperatively to enable substantial activation of human LPL by apoC-II. To localize the regions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that are responsive to activation by apoC-II, an apoC-II peptide fragment was cross-linked to bovine LPL. Following chemical hydrolysis and peptide separation, a specific fragment of LPL (residues 65–86) was identified to interact with apoC-II. The fragment contains regions of amino acid sequence dissimilarity compared with hepatic lipase (HL), a member of the same gene family that is not responsive to apoC-II. Using site-directed mutagenesis, two sets of chimeras were created in which the two regions of human LPL (residues 65–68 and 73–79) were exchanged with the corresponding human HL sequences. The chimeras consisted of an HL backbone with the suspected LPL regions replacing the corresponding HL sequences either individually (HLLPL-(65–68) and HLLPL-(73–79)) or together (HLLPLD). Similarly, LPL chimeras were created in which the candidate regions were replaced with the corresponding HL sequences (LPLHL-(77–80), LPLHL-(85–91), and LPLHLD). Using a synthetic triolein substrate, the lipase activity of the purified enzymes was measured in the presence and absence of apoC-II. Addition of apoC-II to HLLPL-(65–68) and HLLPL-(73–79) did not significantly alter their enzyme activity. However, the activity of HLLPLD increased ∼5-fold in the presence of apoC-II compared with an increase in native LPL activity of ∼11-fold. Addition of apoC-II to LPLHL-(77–80) resulted in ∼10-fold activation, whereas only ∼6- and ∼4-fold activation of enzyme activity was observed in LPLHL-(85–91) and LPLHLD, respectively. In summary, our results have identified 11 amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of LPL (residues 65–68 and 73–79) that appear to act cooperatively to enable substantial activation of human LPL by apoC-II.

Through their ability to hydrolyze triglycerides and phospholipids in a variety of circulating plasma lipoproteins, including chylomicrons and very low, intermediate, and high density lipoproteins, HL and LPL greatly influence lipid metabolism (7Semenkovich C.F.

HL and LPL are associated with cell surfaces through an interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and are thought to possess non-catalytic functions associated with the binding and clearance of various lipoproteins (10Amar M.J.

HL and LPL share a number of functional domains such as the Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad, heparin-binding domain, lid region, and lipid- and receptor-binding domains (15Wong H. Davis R.C. Thuren T. Goers J.W. Nikazy J. Waite M. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10319-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their similarity of lipolytic function, amino acid homology, and conservation of disulfide bridges, it is believed that HL and LPL share a similar structure (16Derewenda Z.S. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23112-23119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, however, differences remain in important enzyme characteristics such as relative heparin affinity, substrate specificity, and cofactor requirements. Unlike HL, LPL requires a specific cofactor, apoC-II, to hydrolyze triglycerides in chylomicrons (17Havel R.J. Shore V.G. Shore B. Bier D.M. Circ. Res. 1970; 27: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18LaRosa J.C. Levy R.I. Herbert P. Lux S.E. Fredrickson D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The importance of apoC-II for LPL function is emphasized by the observation of a significant accumulation of triglycerides in patients who have an inherited defect of the apoC-II gene (19Breckenridge W.C. Little J.A. Steiner G. Chow A. Poapst M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Initially, the study of chimeric lipases (20Davis R. Wong H. Nikazy J. Wang K. Han Q. Schotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21499-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dichek H.L. Parrott C. Ronan R. Brunzell J.D. Brewer H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a region in the N-terminal domain of LPL was responsible for cofactor activation because enzymes containing the N-terminal domain of LPL and the C-terminal domain of HL were still able to be activated by apoC-II. However, these chimeric enzymes were not activated by apoC-II to the same extent as native LPL. More recently, we reported that the 60 C-terminal amino acids of LPL also participate in apoC-II activation (22Hill J.S. Yang D. Nikazy J. Curtiss L.K. Sparrow J.T. Wong H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30979-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that regions in the N-terminal domain alone are not sufficient to achieve optimal activation. These results are more easily interpreted in the context of a head-to-tail dimer model (15Wong H. Davis R.C. Thuren T. Goers J.W. Nikazy J. Waite M. Schotz M.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6997-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which supports the hypothesis that apoC-II interacts simultaneously with regions located in the N- and C-terminal domains of opposing subunits that make up an LPL dimer (22Hill J.S. Yang D. Nikazy J. Curtiss L.K. Sparrow J.T. Wong H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30979-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To identify specific LPL amino acid residues that are responsive to cofactor, chemical cross-linking of apoC-II to LPL was undertaken. Cross-linking experiments identified a region from the N-terminal domain of LPL that interacted with apoC-II and whose role in activation was determined using chimeric lipases. The LPL fragment contains two candidate regions, one composed of 4 amino acids and the other of 7, that differ from HL, a highly related but cofactor-unresponsive lipase. A series of chimeras were constructed with the variable regions exchanged between the two lipases, and apoC-II responsiveness was determined. The results suggest that LPL residues 65–68 and 73–79 cooperate in cofactor activation and, moreover, that the functional responsiveness imparted by these LPL residues can be translocated to HL. Overall Strategy—A fragment of human apoC-II spanning residues 44–79 (apoC-II-(44–79)) was chemically cross-linked to purified bovine LPL (Sigma). The mixture was reduced and incubated with o-iodosobenzoic acid, which cleaves proteins at tryptophan and tyrosine residues (24Chaillan C. Kerfelec B. Foglizzo E. Chapus C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Fontana A. Dalzoppo D. Grandi C. Zambonin M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6997-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). o-Iodosobenzoic acid-generated peptide fragments were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and identified based on their size and sequence. Step 1—The cross-linker reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl 1,3′-dithiopropionate (SASD) was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. IODO-GEN (1 mg) was dried in microcentrifuge tubes, and SASD was added (1 mg in 1 ml of 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2) together with sodium iodide (100 μCi) and mixed briefly (2 min). The reaction mixture was removed from the tube and desalted to separate unbound radioisotope. Step 2—A cofactor·cross-linker complex composed of apoC-II-(44–79) (100 μm in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2) linked to the iodinated cross-linking reagent SASD was created (Fig. 1). The photolabile azido group in SASD required all steps to be carried out in dimmed room light or within darkened vessels. The cross-linker was used at a 3-fold molar excess over cofactor to maximize linkage via the succinimidyl moiety at neutral pH. Probable sites of apoC-II-(44–79) derivatization included the N terminus and/or basic residues at positions 48, 50, 55, and 76. Excess unbound cross-linker was removed by gel permeation chromatography prior to incubation with LPL. Step 3—The cofactor·cross-linker complex was incubated with bovine LPL (1 mg/ml) in quartz cuvettes at 4 °C. The samples were irradiated for 3 min by an ultraviolet light source placed 4 cm from the cuvettes, with a mirror positioned 2 cm behind. Some experiments contained a “dark control” sample, which was wrapped in foil during irradiation to determine the effect of the absence of UV light exposure. Other samples contained a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled cofactor to evaluate cross-linking specificity. Step 4 —Following UV radiation, samples were treated with dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mm. Reducing agent was used to sever the disulfide bond in the cross-linker moiety (Fig. 1) and served to transfer the iodine label, originally on the cofactor, to a region of LPL at or near the site of interaction. The cofactor provided the binding specificity and, after covalent attachment, was released by dithiothreitol reduction. The label, now attached to the enzyme, was then traced without further involvement of the cofactor. Typical yields of cross-linking reactions ranged from 2 to 5%. Step 5—Cleavage of LPL was performed with o-iodosobenzoic acid (4 mm). o-Iodosobenzoic acid has been demonstrated to selectively cleave proteins at tryptophan and tyrosine residues under relatively mild conditions (26Mahoney W.C. Hermodson M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3810-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Mahoney W.C. Smith P.K. Hermodson M.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cleavage at tyrosines was eliminated by the inclusion of p-cresol (1 mm), effectively making o-iodosobenzoic acid a tryptophan-specific reagent. SDS-16% polyacrylamide gels were used to separate peptide fragments (nine expected LPL fragments from 8 cleaved tryptophan residues and intact apoC-II (44–79) because it lacks tryptophans). Separated peptides were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) for autoradiography and N-terminal sequence analyses. Six chimeras were created that focused on the proposed apoC-II activation site of LPL (residues 65–68 and 73–79) (Fig. 2). Three of the chimeras had the HL backbone with the suspected regions of LPL replacing the corresponding sections of HL. These enzymes were designated HLLPL-(65–68), HLLPL-(73–79), and HLLPLD (where “D” is double chimera). Conversely, the remaining three chimeras consisted of an LPL backbone with the proposed regions exchanged with the corresponding sections of HL. These enzymes were designated LPLHL-(77–80), LPLHL-(85–91), and LPLHLD. To aid in purification of the enzymes, the chimeras and wild-type HL and LPL were constructed with a His6 tag. cDNAs for both wild-type HL and LPL had 6 histidines added to the C-terminal end, and these were used as templates for their respective chimeras. The histidine tag was added to wild-type HL and LPL using primers containing histidine codons. The first PCR consisted of the 5′-histidine primer and a 3′-flanking primer specific for the vector pcDNA3 (5′-HL/His6, CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT TGA GAT TTA ATG AAG ACC CA; 3′-primer/pcDNA3; 5′-LPL/His6, CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT TGA AAC TGG GCG AAT CTA CA; and 3′-primer/pcDNA3). The second PCR contained the 3′-histidine primer and the 5′-flanking primer specific to pcDNA3 (3′-HL/His6, ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG TCT GAT CTT TCG CTT TGA TG; 5′-primer/pcDNA3, AAA TGT CGT AAC AAC TCC GCC; 3′-LPL/His6, ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG GCC TGA CTT CTT ATT CAG AG; and 5′-primer/pcDNA3). The purified products were joined together in a third and final PCR using the flanking primers 5′-primer/pcDNA3 and 3′-primer/pcDNA3 for both HL and LPL. For chimeric construction, restriction endonuclease sites were added to primers defining the 5′ and 3′ termini of the construct to allow for directional cloning. Mutagenic primers (forward and reverse) were designed to span the corresponding boxed coding regions (Fig. 2) and to overlap with one another so that two PCR products could be combined together to form the final full-length cDNA in a third PCR. The primers used for each portion of the chimeras are shown in Table I.Table IPrimers used for chimeric constructionNameSequenceHIND5PKHLACT TAA GCT TGC CAC CAT GGA CAC AAG TCC CCT GTG T1LPLC2HLFORAAC TGG GTG CCA AAA CTT GTG GCC GCG CTG AAG1LPLC2HLREVGGC CAC AAG TTT TGG CAC CCA GTT TTC TAG CACBAM3PHLACG TGG ATC CAA GGA GTA AGA TTC ATT TAT T2LPLC2HLFORTAC AAG AGA GAA CCA GAC TCC GTG ACA GTG GGG CTG2LPLC2HLREVCAC GGA GTC TGG TTC TCT CTT GTA CAG CGC GGC CAC CATD1LPLC2HLFORAAC TGG GTG CCA AAA CTT GTG GCC GCG CTG TACD2LPLC2HLREVCAC GGA GTC TGG TTC TCT CTT GTA CAG CGC GGC CAC AAGHIND5PKLPLACG TAA GCT TGC CAC CAT GGA GAG CAA AGC CCT GCT C1HLC2LPLFORAGT TGG ATC TGG CAG ATG GTG GCC GCC CTG TAC1HLC2LPLREVGGC CAC CAT CTG CCA GAT CCA ACT CTC ATA CATBAM3PLPLACG TGG ATC CGA ATT CAC ATG CCG TTC TTT G2HLC2LPLFORAAG TCT CAG CCG GCC CAG CCA AAT GTC ATT GTG GTG2HLC2LPLREVATT TGG CTG GGC CGG CTG AGA CTT CAG GGC GGC CAC AAGD1HLC2LPLFORAGT TGG ATC TGG CAG ATG GTG GCC GCC CTG AAG Open table in a new tab Full-length cDNAs were purified, digested, and inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites. The DNA sequence was confirmed prior to transfection. Chinese hamster ovary Pro5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). To mediate the transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells, coprecipitates of plasmid DNA and CaPO4 were prepared (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate/DNA mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before it was added to a 50% confluent Chinese hamster ovary monolayer. Stably transfected cells were selected by growth in the presence of Geneticin (G418 sulfate; 500 μg/ml), and surviving colonies were selected and expanded. Cell clones expressing maximal quantities of lipase were identified by enzyme activity analysis. After growth to confluency in T-175 flasks, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 units/ml heparin. The medium was harvested and replaced every 24 h for an 8-day period. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell and tissue extracts (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.02 mm, and the harvested medium was stored at –80 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Thawed wild-type or chimeric HL medium (1 liter) was mixed with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column (2.6 × 25 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.35 m NaCl. Following a wash with 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.02 mm protease inhibitor, pH 7.2 (Buffer A), the lipase was eluted with 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.35 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.02 mm protease inhibitor, pH 7.2 containing 1.2% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) onto a heparin-Sepharose column (2.6 × 25 cm). This column was washed with 500 ml of Buffer A prior to elution with 250 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitor (0.02 mm), onto a 1 × 10-cm metal affinity column (QIAGEN Inc.). The column was washed with 25 ml of Buffer A before elution with 26 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.2. The eluent was collected in eight fractions, the first one being 5 ml and the rest 3 ml. Each fraction was assayed for activity, and the active fractions were concentrated in a Millipore filtration unit (molecular mass cutoff of 100,000 Da) to a final volume of ∼1 ml and stored at –80 °C. Wild-type LPL and the LPL chimeras were purified in the same manner with two exceptions. 1) The octyl-Sepharose step was omitted; therefore, the thawed medium was loaded directed onto the heparin-Sepharose column with no NaCl added. 2) Buffer A contained NaCl at 0.75 m, not 0.5 m. The purity of the enzyme preparation was determined by densitometry of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Trioleinase activity was measured using a triolein emulsion containing radiolabeled triolein as described previously (22Hill J.S. Yang D. Nikazy J. Curtiss L.K. Sparrow J.T. Wong H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30979-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ApoC-II-dependent lipase activity was determined by performing the assay in the presence of an apoC-II fragment spanning residues 44–79. This apoC-II fragment has been shown to have the same activating potential as full-length apoC-II (29Kinnunen P.K.J. Jackson R.L. Smith L.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Sparrow J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gartner F. Provenzano M. Fujimoto E. Goeke N. Olson B. Klenk D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar) using a Pierce micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit. Kinetic constants were determined using GraphPAD Prism Version 3.02 for Windows. Gels were fixed in 100 ml of 30% ethanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 30 min and then washed twice with 10% ethanol and three times with deionized water for 5 min/wash. The gels were soaked in 50 ml of SilverSNAP stain solution with 1 ml of SilverSNAP enhancer solution (Pierce) for 30 min with gentle shaking. The developer was removed, and the gels were washed with deionized water for 30 s. The gels were transferred to 50 ml of SilverSNAP developer with 1 ml of SilverSNAP enhancer for developing until bands appeared. Samples were mixed with 0.5 volume of buffer containing 2% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. The mixture was placed in boiling water for 5 min prior to loading onto a 10% acrylamide gel. Gels were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride hydrophobic membrane that was pretreated with 100% methanol for 10 s. The membrane was placed on filter paper and air-dried for 15 min. The blot was placed in 15 ml of 1% casein and 0.04% Tween 20 (antibody buffer) containing either a monoclonal antibody specific for human HL (22Hill J.S. Yang D. Nikazy J. Curtiss L.K. Sparrow J.T. Wong H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30979-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or a chicken polyclonal antibody raised against bovine LPL (a kind gift from Dr. O. Ben-Zeev) and incubated for 1 h. The blot was rinsed with PBS and washed for 5 min with fresh PBS, which was then repeated twice. Immunoblotting with the monoclonal or polyclonal antibody was detected with either anti-mouse IgG or anti-chicken IgG conjugated to biotin in 15 ml of antibody buffer for 20 min. After washing, the blot was incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The blot was developed with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) and exposed to chemiluminescent film (Amersham Biosciences). 200 μl of anti-LPL antibody 5D2 (a kind gift from Dr. John D. Brunzell) (31Babirak S.P. Iverius P.H. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1989; 9: 326-334Google Scholar) was added to each well of a Costar high binding enzyme immunoassay/radioimmunoassay plate at a dilution of 4 μg/ml as previously described (32Peterson J. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1165-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plate was sealed with a Mylar plate sealer and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The plate was washed three times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. After the third wash, 300 μl of PBS/Tween 20 was added per well, and the plate was then sealed and left overnight at 4 °C. The buffer was removed from the plate, and standards (purified bovine LPL) diluted to 0.1 μg/μl in 50% glycerol and 10 mm NaH2PO4 at pH 7.5, then 4 μl of this solution diluted in 796 μl of 4.56% bovine serum albumin in PBS to 0.5 ng/μl, controls (heparin challenge plasma), and samples (LPL, LPLHL-(77–80), LPLHL-(85–91), and LPLHLD) were added to the plate in quadruplicates at 200 μl/well. The plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed four times with PBS/Tween 20; 200 μ of 5D2 peroxidase solution (100 ml of PBS, 100 μl of Tween 20, and 50 μl of 5D2 peroxidase) was added per well; and the plate was sealed and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The plate was washed five times with PBS/Tween 20. In a darkened room, 200 μl of substrate (75 ml of citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 30 mg of o-phenylenediamine tablet (Sigma), and 150 μl of 3% hydrogen peroxide) was added per well, and the plate was covered and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10–20 min (the absorbance of the highest standard was 0.600–0.800). 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4 was added per well to stop color development, and the absorbance at 492 nm was determined. The model of human LPL was generated using, as a template, the 2.46-Å resolution structure of the human pancreatic lipase·colipase complex inhibited by a C11 alkyl phosphonate (Protein Data Bank code 1LPB) (33Egloff M.P.

The model was created using the 3D-JIGSAW algorithm (34Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J. Proteins. 1999; 3: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (amino acids 1–434 of the mature LPL sequence were modeled) and viewed/analyzed using Swiss-PdbViewer (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar). Binding of ApoC-II to LPL—Binding of the cofactor·cross-linker complex to LPL was assessed by its ability to stimulate lipase activity. The complex stimulated LPL activity to a similar extent as serum (∼7-fold) (data not shown), indicating that the presence of the cross-linker had little effect on lipase function. Furthermore, four of the five possible sites of linkage between apoC-II and the cross-linker (residues 44, 48, 50, and 55) are not found in the region of apoC-II believed to activate LPL (36Storjohann R. Rozek A. Sparrow J.T. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, it was concluded that the cofactor·cross-linker complex was suitable to probe the cofactor-binding site of LPL. LPL was incubated with the cofactor·cross-linker complex and then photolyzed, reduced, cleaved, and displayed on denaturing gels (Fig. 3). This autoradiograph of an SDS-16% acrylamide gel shows a single radiolabeled peptide fragment, which migrated below the 3.5-kDa standard, but above the dye front. Lane 2 shows the pattern of another sample run under identical conditions, except for the inclusion of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled apoC-II, and the reduction step was omitted. In this case (as for dark control samples), a 3.5-kDa band was seen; no band was detected corresponding to the band in lane 1. The band migrating at 3.5 kDa corresponded to the size of the apoC-II·cross-linker complex, whose identity was confirmed by microsequence analyses (data not shown). Thus, the 3.5-kDa band in lane 2 is the unbound cofactor·cross-linker complex; and significantly, inclusion of excess unlabeled apoC-II completely eliminated the lower band (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2), suggesting specific interaction between apoC-II and this portion of LPL. The mass of the labeled peptide (Fig. 3, lane 1) was determined to be 2.2 kDa by comparison with the migration positions of proteins with known molecular masses. Based on the locations of the 8 tryptophan residues in bovine LPL, the molecular mass of the labeled LPL peptide most closely corresponds to that of peptide 3, from residues 65 to 86 (Table II). This conclusion was supported by the determination of a valine residue at the N terminus of the labeled peptide (data not shown); only the sequence of peptide 3 begins with a valine residue.Table IISizes of bovine LPL fragments following cleavage at tryptophan residuesFragment no.Amino acid residuesMolecular mass DaN-terminal domain peptide11-556050256-64990365-862420487-1143080N- and C-terminal domain peptide5115-38229,500C-terminal domain peptide6383-3908807391-3933308394-3951109396-4485940 Open table in a new tab Construction of ApoC-II Activation Site Chimeras—Upon comparison of residues 65–86 of LPL with the corresponding region in HL, two regions of dissimilarity were identified (Fig. 2).

Although not essential for this process, the dimeric MobB increases the activation of molybdoenzymes, incorporating this cofactor by a mechanism that is not understood. The structure of MobB has been elucidated in two crystal forms, one of which has provided a model at 1.9-Å resolution with Rwork and Rfree values of 21.5 and 28.7%, respectively. The MobB subunit displays an α/β-fold arranged into a major and minor domain, the latter of which is inserted between the major and minor domains of the partner subunit, creating an elongated dimer constructed around a 16-stranded β-sheet. Structural homologues have been identified, and they include a number of nucleotide-binding proteins. Comparisons indicate that although the phosphate-binding regions are highly conserved, MobB lacks the elements of structure required to interact with and efficiently bind a nucleotide base. In the present structure, a sulfate is bound to the Walker A phosphate-binding motif of MobB. The possibility that MobB forms a complex with the nucleotide-binding MobA, the protein with which it is co-transcribed, is explored, and modeling suggests that such a MobA:MobB complex is feasible. This hypothesis is supported by recent biochemical evidence indicating that MobB interacts with several proteins involved in various stages of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis including MobA. We propose therefore that MobB is an adapter protein that acts in concert with MobA to achieve the efficient biosynthesis and utilization of molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide.

We propose therefore that MobB is an adapter protein that acts in concert with MobA to achieve the efficient biosynthesis and utilization of molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide. Molybdenum is an essential trace element associated with a diverse range of redox-active enzymes (1Stiefel E.I. Stiefel E.I. Coucouvanis D. Newton N.W. Molybdenum Cofactors and Model Systems. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 1-19Google Scholar). Such molybdoenzymes catalyze basic metabolic reactions in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles exploiting the redox chemistry of this second row transition metal. With the exception of the nitrogenases that contain an iron-molybdenum-sulfur cluster, molybdenum is integrated into the enzymes as the molybdenum cofactor (Moco), 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide; MPT, molybdopterin; SeMet, selenomethionine. which contains mononuclear molybdenum coordinated to an organic cofactor termed molybdopterin (MPT). Although Moco is the active form of the cofactor present in eukaryotes, most bacterial enzymes require the attachment of a nucleotide moiety onto the terminal phosphate group of the MPT side chain to be functionally active (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the active form of Moco is molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD, Fig. 1), molybdopterin covalently linked to GMP. The biosynthesis of Moco itself has been extensively studied and can be described in four stages (3Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Google Scholar): (a) conversion of a guanine nucleotide into a derivative termed precursor Z, (b) conversion of precursor Z into MPT, (c) chelation of molybdenum by MPT producing the molybdenum cofactor Moco, and (d) attachment of a nucleotide moiety to Moco, thus forming the active guanine dinucleotide form. Although it is not yet understood how Moco is inserted into molybdoenzymes, due to the intrinsic instability of the chemical species concerned, the intermediates and cofactor remain bound to proteins during the biosynthetic process until the final incorporation into the apomolybdoenzymes. In E. coli, there are five genetic loci involved in the biosynthesis of active Moco (moa, mob, mod, moe, and mog), and mutations in any of these result in the loss of all molybdoenzyme activities. It has been shown that the moaA and moaC gene products are required for the biosynthesis of precursor Z from the guanine nucleotide (3Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Google Scholar); that MPT is synthesized from precursor Z by the gene products of moaD, moaE, and moeB (4Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Google Scholar); that moeA and mogA are necessary for the incorporation of molybdenum (5Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Google Scholar, 6Leimkühler S. Angermüller S. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5930-5939Google Scholar); and that modABC are required for the acquisition and transport of molybdenum into the cell (7Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Google Scholar). The final step of this biosynthetic pathway requires the mob locus, which encodes functions that catalyze the synthesis of MGD from MPT and a GMP donor, most probably GTP (8Iobbi-Nivol C. Palmer T. Whitty P.W. McNairn E. Boxer D.H. Microbiology (Reading). 1995; 141: 1663-1671Google Scholar). The mob locus in E. coli contains two genes, mobA and mobB, arranged as a single transcription unit (8Iobbi-Nivol C. Palmer T. Whitty P.W. McNairn E. Boxer D.H. Microbiology (Reading). 1995; 141: 1663-1671Google Scholar, 9Plunkett G. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3391-3398Google Scholar). MobA is a well characterized monomeric enzyme capable of the synthesis of MGD from MPT and GMP, and it has been shown to activate the molybdoenzyme nitrate reductase (10Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Google Scholar). MobB is not essential for MGD production or activation of nitrate reductase; however, its presence significantly enhances the yield of the active enzyme (11Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of MobB (see Fig. 2A) reveals a putative nucleotide-binding motif, the Walker A motif ((G/A)XXXXGK(S/T), see Ref. 12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar). This motif is frequently referred to as the phosphate binding or P-loop, or alternatively, the G1 motif of bacterial GTPases (13Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Google Scholar) and is often predictive for nucleotide triphosphate binding, suggesting that the protein might be involved in the binding of the guanine nucleotide. MobB does display weak binding of GTP (Kd of 2.0 μm) and low GTPase activity (Km = 7.5 μm, turnover rate = 3 × 10–3 min–1, see Ref. 14Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 690-697Google Scholar). The crystal structures of MoaC (15Wuebbens M.M. Liu M.T. Rajagopalan K. Schindelin H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Google Scholar) have been solved and, with the exception of MobA, all form oligomers. This, along with biochemical evidence showing that MoeB and MoaD (22Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Google Scholar) and MobA, MobB, MogA, and MoeA (23Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Google Scholar) are involved in heterogeneous complex formation, indicates that protein-protein interactions are critical in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. The biological function of MobB is, unlike the other proteins discussed above, not clear. To investigate the role that MobB might contribute to Moco biosynthesis, we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of the E. coli protein. Cloning and Expression—The mobB gene from E. coli was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. Two oligonucleotide primers were designed (5′-CTA-GCA-CAT-ATG-ATA-CCG-TTA-CTC-GCC-3′ and 5′-GCA-CCA-CTC-GAG-TTC-GTT-CTG-CTT-TTG-3′) to introduce unique restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI, respectively (shown in bold). The PCR product was cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Positive clones were sequenced, and then following excision, the mobB gene was ligated into expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which ultimately produces a protein carrying a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus. The new plasmid was heat-shock-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB/ampicillin). Bacteria were cultured in LB/ampicillin media and grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the temperature was reduced to 20 °C. Cell growth continued for 16 h before cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. In addition to the expression of native MobB, selenomethionine (SeMet) MobB was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3) cells. Cultivation of this variant was done in M9 minimal media supplemented with the usual amino acids except that SeMet (50 μg/ml) was substituted for l-methionine. Protein expression was inducted, and cell growth was carried out in the same manner as for native MobB (above). Purification—Once harvested, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell at a pressure of 900 p.s.i. The insoluble cell fraction was separated by centrifugation (38,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered before being applied to a Ni2+-resin HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 10 column volumes of the buffer. Elution of the protein was achieved by running a linear gradient of 0 –500 mm imidazole. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing MobB were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The N-terminal His6 tag was cleaved with thrombin (10 units/mg) in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline for 5 h at 20 °C. The sample was then loaded onto a Poros HQ strong anion exchange column (Applied Biosystems). This column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 0 –500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions containing MobB were again pooled, analyzed, and dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then concentrated to 10 mg/ml for use in crystallization trials. Crystallization—Two crystal forms of MobB were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Monoclinic blocks (0.25 mm maximum dimension) were occasionally grown from a 4-μl drop that consisted of 2 μl of protein solution containing 5 mm MgCl2,5mm GDP, and 5 mm dithiothreitol as well as 2 μl of the reservoir solution comprising 150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. A hexagonal crystal form (rods of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm3) proved more reproducible than the monoclinic form and was obtained using a reservoir of 100 mm NaAc and 2 m (NH4)2SO4 at pH 4.6. Data Collection and Processing—A medium resolution multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected from the hexagonal crystal form of the SeMet protein at station ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using a CCD Area Detector Systems Corp. Q210 detector. These SeMet crystals belonged to the space group P6422 with unit cell dimensions a = 241.5, c = 49.2 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers (subunits A and B) giving a combined molecular mass of ∼39 kDa with 77% solvent content and a Matthew's coefficient (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar) VM of 5.4 Å3/Da. High resolution diffraction data were collected from a native monoclinic crystal on PX 9.6 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory using a CCD ADSC Q4 detector. This crystal form has space group P21 with a = 52.4, b = 64.8, c = 54.2 Å, and β = 97.7°. Here the solvent content for two molecules in the asymmetric unit was 48% (VM of 2.4 Å3/Da). Prior to each data collection, crystals were transferred through a cryoprotectant consisting of 50% glycerol and 50% of the relevant reservoir solution before being flashed-cooled to –173 °C in a stream of nitrogen. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using either MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; (Number 26)Google Scholar) or DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The initial structure of a MobB subunit was determined using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method of phase determination targeting the K-edge of selenium and using the hexagonal crystal form. MobB has five methionine residues per subunit, and a homodimer constitutes the asymmetric unit. The program SOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar, 29Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Google Scholar) identified 10 selenium positions that provided phases to 2.4 Å with an overall figure-of-merit of 0.48. The 10 selenium positions corresponded to the location of 5 SeMet residues in one subunit and 4 in the other subunit with one SeMet side chain displaying a dual conformation. Density modification (without the use of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging) using RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar) raised the figure-of-merit to 0.58. An initial round of model building, using O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), provided only 165 out of a possible 348 residues, 118 of which were associated with a single subunit. One subunit was reasonably well defined in the experimental density, but the other was of poor quality. This model was used for molecular replacement with the P21 data set to utilize the higher resolution data. The program AMoRe (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) provided a clear molecular replacement solution for two subunits using data within the resolution limits of 15–3 Å, which, after rigid body refinement, gave an R-factor of 47.7% and correlation coefficient of 44.1%. Prior to refinement using REFMAC (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar), 5% of the data were set aside for the calculation of the Rfree (34Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with a bulk solvent correction but without the use of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Rigid body refinement of the dimer was used to extend the resolution to 1.9 Å, and several cycles of refinement, inter-dispersed with rounds of model building, solvent, and sulfate identification, produced a model with an Rwork of 21.4% and Rfree of 28.7%. For completeness, this model was used to initiate refinement with the hexagonal data by superimposing the dimer onto the well defined subunit described above. Rigid body refinement and several rounds of graphics inspection, rebuilding, and refinement gave an Rwork of 31.1% and an Rfree of 33.8%. PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The Structure of MobB—Initial phases to 2.4 Å were obtained using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method for phase determination on the hexagonal crystal form. These crystals diffracted only to medium resolution and were poorly ordered but nevertheless enabled us to construct the first model of MobB. This model proved suitable for molecular replacement into and refinement with the high resolution native monoclinic data. Although the hexagonal crystal structure was subsequently refined, the data and resulting model are inferior to those derived from the monoclinic form, and consequently, our discussion concentrates on the 1.9-Å resolution structure. MobB consists of 175 residues with an approximate molecular mass of 19.4 kDa. The refined model comprises residues 6 – 45 and 58 –174 for subunit A and residues 6 –175 for subunit B; this accounts for 327 out of a possible 350 residues for this homodimer. Secondary structure elements were assigned by a combination of automated methods, using PROMOTIF (36Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar), and visual inspection. They are mapped onto the amino acid sequence in Fig. 2A. The MobB subunit exhibits a mixed α/β-fold with an overall topology of eight β-strands and seven α-helices (Figs. 2 and 3) and is divided into two domains. The major domain is constructed with a core six-stranded twisted parallel β-sheet with strand order 8-7-6-1-5-2, two helices on one side of the sheet (α1 and α7), three shorter helical sections on the other side (α3, α4, α6) with a single turn of helix (α5) at the C-terminal edge of the sheet. The minor domain consists of a distorted α2, then antiparallel strands β3 and β4. We note that α2 is only ordered in one of the two subunits that comprise the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Stereo view of the electron density for α2 of subunit B. The σA-weighted 2Fo – Fc map (49Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Google Scholar) was calculated from the final model and is contoured at the 1σ level. A stick representation of the protein is shown colored according to atom type: gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The symmetric dimer of MobB is formed by the insertion of a minor domain from one subunit between the major and minor domains of the other. Strands β3 and β4 from one subunit are positioned between β2 and β4 of the partner and arranged such that although β2 is parallel to β3, the β4 strands are antiparallel to each other (Figs. 2b and 3). This arrangement produces a dimer, with overall dimensions of ∼90 × 38 × 26 Å3, dominated by an elongated β-sheet composed of 16 strands. The sheet is flat in the central section of the dimer and twisted at either end (Fig. 3). The non-crystallographic symmetry 2-fold axis is perpendicular to the central section of the extended β-sheet. Although GDP was present in the crystallization conditions, we note that there was no electron density corresponding to the putative ligand in either crystal form. However, sulfate ions were identified binding at the Walker A motif that lies between β1 and α1. The oxyanion binding is likely influenced by the helix macrodipole of α1 (Fig. 3) (37Hol W.G.J. van Duijnen P.T. Berendsen H.J.C. Nature. 1978; 273: 443-446Google Scholar). Further details of the sulfate-binding site will follow. Structural Homologues—Sequence homology among GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) is well characterized (38Moller W. Amons R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 1-7Google Scholar), and the GDP-binding site is typically described by three highly conserved sequence motifs (39Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 12: 1347-1368Google Scholar). The first, the Walker A motif (13Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Google Scholar), occurs at residues 14 –21 (Fig. 2A). This phosphate-binding region adopts a well conserved structure in G-proteins, consisting of a β-strand and α-helix with a loop between them (39Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 12: 1347-1368Google Scholar). The helix dipole interacts favorably with the nucleotide phosphates. The conformation of the region surrounding the Walker A motif and the position of the sulfate ion in MobB follow the general trends displayed for phosphate binding by G-proteins. The second motif, dxxG, is linked to a conformational switch in G-proteins dependent on whether GDP or GTP is present. Although E. coli MobB carries the sequence DxxG close to the phosphate-binding loop at residues 51–54, we note that such a motif is absent in MobB homologues. The third motif, which is predicted to determine the specificity of an enzyme for guanine (NXXD), is not present in MobB. In addition to the conservation of three motifs, G-proteins share a common core structure of five α-helices and a six-stranded β-sheet. The β-sheet has five parallel strands and one antiparallel strand that, unusually for α-β-proteins, is placed at the edge of this sheet. Since MobB displays some of the basic structural elements of G-proteins, a search for structural homologues was considered necessary to investigate the possible function of the protein. An architectural comparison, using DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) and DEJAVU (41Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Google Scholar), indicted that the MobB subunit is structurally similar to a number of purine nucleotide-binding binding proteins including a nitrogenase iron protein (NIP; Protein Data Bank accession code 1FP6; Z score = 8.3; see Ref. 42Jang S.B. Seefeldt L.C. Peters J.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14745-14752Google Scholar), the ATPase MinD (Protein Data Bank accession code 1G3Q; Z score = 8.1; see Ref. 43Hayashi I. Oyama T. Morikawa K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1819-1828Google Scholar), and also the GTPase domain of the signal recognition particle receptor, FtsY (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FTS; Z score = 7.6; see Ref. 44Montoya G. Svensson C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Google Scholar). The Z-score is a measure of the statistical significance of the best domain-domain alignment and was determined by DALI. Typically, two dissimilar proteins will have a Z-score less than 2.0, and the MobB subunit matched with itself gives a Z-score of 27.3. The three structural homologues that were identified display similarities to the Ras-related GTPases. They were aligned on the most complete subunit of MobB using LSQKAB (45Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Google Scholar), and secondary structure matching was carried out using the secondary structure matching server at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/cgi-bin/ssmserver). The root mean squared fit was calculated from the Cα atoms of matched residues at the best superposition of the structures. The fractions of the Cα atoms in the MobB subunit that overlay on NIP, MinD, and FtsY are 71, 64, and 54% with root mean squared deviations of 3.2, 2.2, and 2.0 Å, respectively. The secondary structure elements of MobB found to align with all three structural homologues were β1, α1, the P-loop, β2, α4, β5, β6, β7, β8, and α7, which constitutes almost the entire major domain of MobB. Since the searches for structural homologues revealed homology only with the major domain, a further search was carried out using only the minor domains as organized in the dimer, but no structural homologues were identified. A superposition reveals that the phosphate-binding region (β1, the P-loop, and α1) assumes an almost identical conformation in all four structures (Fig. 5). ADP is present in the crystal structures of both NIP and MinD, and the nucleotides superpose well (not shown). The sulfate in the MobB structure occupies the same position as the β-phosphate group of the bound ADP molecules. This sulfate accepts hydrogen bonds from the main chain amides of Gly16, Gly18, Lys19, and Thr20, and we note that both NIP and MinD have identical residues at equivalent positions that interact with α- or β-phosphate oxygen atoms (Fig. 6). In both NIP and MinD, a threonine (Thr18, MinD numbering) binds the α-phosphate oxygen using the side chain hydroxyl and main chain amide group (43Hayashi I. Oyama T. Morikawa K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1819-1828Google Scholar), and in MobB, the equivalent residue (Thr21) interacts with a water molecule occupying the same position as an α-phosphate oxygen in the MinD complex (Fig. 6). It is likely that MobB would bind diphosphate in similar fashion to NIP and MinD.Fig. 6The sulfate environment in MobB (top) and the comparable binding of the diphosphate tail of ADP in MinD (bottom). Atoms are shown as spheres colored according to type; gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; green, phosphorus; yellow, sulfur. A water molecule in the MobB structure is colored cyan. Hydrogen bonding interactions are depicted as black dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although their interactions with oxyanions appear similar, the structural comparison of the four homologues reveals significant differences between MobB and the others in the nucleotide-binding pocket. MobB lacks a section of ∼20 residues between β8 and α6 (Fig. 5). In MinD and NIP, these residues extend the β8 and α6 equivalents of MobB and form a helix-loop combination that creates the nucleotide-binding pocket. In MinD, the helix is α9, and the extended helix is α10 (42Jang S.B. Seefeldt L.C. Peters J.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14745-14752Google Scholar, 43Hayashi I. Oyama T. Morikawa K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1819-1828Google Scholar). In particular two residues (with MinD numbering) Pro198 and Asp200, which are positioned on these extensions, are conserved in MinD and NIP and provide hydrogen bonding interactions between the main chain and the nucleotide. MobB is also different in the β7-loop-β8 section. In MinD, NIP, and FtsY, the strand corresponding to MobB β7 is extended toward the adenine position, creating an integral part of the nucleotide-binding pocket. This loop consists of about 10 amino acids (leading into α8 of MinD) with a structurally conserved asparagine in all three homologues (not shown). In MinD, this Asn171 directly contacts the base. In FtsY, further hydrogen bonds to the adenine are provided by an additional asparagine present in this loop (not shown) (44Montoya G. Svensson C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Google Scholar). From the structural overlay, it is obvious that MobB does not have the necessary structural features that are utilized by MinD, NIP, and FtsY to efficiently bind the nucleotide base. We conclude that MobB, on its own, would not be an efficient nucleotide-binding protein. Protein-Protein Complexes—MobB has the correct sequence and structural elements for the efficient binding of the phosphate tail of a nucleotide but not of the base. In contrast, a crystal structure of MobA, the protein that is co-transcribed with MobB, reveals that MobA has little interaction with the phosphate tail of the nucleotide but strong interactions with the base (21Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Google Scholar). Also, near the putative phosphate-binding region, there is a disordered loop that is highly conserved in MobA sequences and that is termed the consensus loop (20Stevenson C.E. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Google Scholar). This loop is glycine-rich but does not contain a phosphate-binding (Walker A) motif. Moreover, the N- and C-terminal ends of the consensus loop are directed away from the phosphate tail of the bound GTP and could not contribute to its binding (21Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Google Scholar). Consequently, the possibility of MobB binding the phosphate moiety of GTP in the MobA:GTP complex was explored. The sulfate bound to MobB occupies the equivalent position of the β-phosphate of ADP in the MinD complex (see above). Therefore, the ADP coordinates were taken from the aligned MinD structure and (without further manipulation) placed into the MobB structure. This ADP molecule was superimposed onto the bound GTP in the MobA complex. Since MobB is a dimer, another molecule of MobA was placed onto the second subunit of MobB in a similar fashion to generate a model for a putative MobA:MobB complex (Fig. 7). In this model, the GTP fits neatly into a pocket formed at the protein-protein interface with no steric hindrance. There is only one area where steric clash of Cα atoms might occur, around residues 121–125 in MobB and 154 –157 in MobA (Fig. 7). These regions along with several other sections of the proteins at the putative interface are conserved in homologous proteins. In MobA, this includes residues 75–79, 128 –134, 150 –158, and 182–192 (20Stevenson C.E. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Google Scholar), and in MobB, this includes residues 41–50 and 106 –111 (Fig. 2A). Residues 121–127, 142–145, and 155–159 of MobB are also located at the putative interface (Fig. 7). In addition, a number of disordered and presumably flexible regions of both MobA and MobB are positioned at this interface. In MobB, the N- and C-terminal ends of the disordered residues A46-A57 sit near this interface, and although the corresponding residues of the partner subunit (B46-B57) are well ordered, this section of the structure is stabilized by crystal lattice contacts. In the P6422 crystal form of MobB, this region is disordered in both subunits, which suggests that this section of the protein is conformationally labile. The same conclusion applies to the consensus loop of MobA, positioned at this putative MobA:MobB interface, which is poorly defined in the crystal structures solved with or without nucleotide bound. The high sequence conservation of sections of MobA and MobB that display conformational flexibility and that are placed at the putative MobA: MobB interface suggests that our model may have some merit and hints that such a protein-protein association may be beneficial for these proteins to act in concert during MGD biosynthesis. The function of MobB might therefore be that of an adapter protein during MGD biosynthesis. Specific protein-protein associations have already been shown to play a central role in the early stages of molybdenum-cofactor biosynthesis (46Rizzi M. Schindelin H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 709-720Google Scholar), and our modeling has suggested that MobB might form a protein-protein complex with MobA. It is particularly gratifying that during the course of this analysis, Magalon et al. (23Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Google Scholar), with the use of a bacterial two-hybrid approach, were able to demonstrate that MobB interacts with MogA, MoeA, and MobA in vivo. These observations are compatible with our postulated function of MobA as an adapter protein. Concluding Remarks—The crystal structure of MobB and comparisons with structural homologues provide clear evidence that MobB by itself is not designed for binding and processing nucleotides with high efficiency, although it does have a phosphate-binding loop characteristic of some nucleotide-binding proteins. Access to three-dimensional coordinates for MobA and MobB allowed modeling studies, which suggest that a MobA:MobB protein complex is feasible and that such a complex might enhance the efficiency of the conversion of Moco to MGD. Our analysis illustrates the value of three-dimensional knowledge in investigating a functional role for MobB and points the way forward for further biochemical studies required to clarify details of the role of this protein role in MGD biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2088095323,"When stimulated by glucose the pancreatic β-cell displays large oscillations of the intracellular free Ca2+concentration, resulting from intermittent Ca2+ entry from the outside and outflow from the inside, the latter process being mediated by the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). To understand the respective role of these two mechanisms, we studied the effect of glucose on PMCA and NCX transcription, expression, and activity in rat pancreatic islet cells. Glucose (11.1 and 22.2 mm) induced a parallel decrease in PMCA transcription, expression, and activity. In contrast the sugar induced a parallel increase in NCX transcription, expression, and activity. The effects of the sugar were mimicked by the metabolizable insulin secretagogue α-ketoisocaproate and persisted in the presence of the Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine. The above results are compatible with the view that, when stimulated, the β-cell switches from a low efficiency Ca2+-extruding mechanism, the PMCA, to a high capacity system, the Na/Ca exchanger, to better face the increase in Ca2+ inflow. These effects of glucose do not result from a direct effect of the sugar itself and are not mediated by the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration induced by the sugar.

These effects of glucose do not result from a direct effect of the sugar itself and are not mediated by the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration induced by the sugar. Ca2+ plays a major role in the mechanisms by which glucose stimulates insulin release from the pancreatic β-cell. The sugar induces the release of the hormone by generating both triggering and amplifying signals through distinct pathways (1Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). According to the first pathway, the metabolism of the sugar by the β-cell leads to an increase in intracellular ATP or ATP/ADP ratio, which closes the ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) 1The abbreviations used are: KATP, ATP-dependent K+ channel; KIC, α-ketoisocaproate; MOD, mean optical density; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; RT, reverse transcription; BSA, bovine serum albumin. channels. This closure depolarizes the plasma membrane, leading to the opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, with subsequent increase in Ca2+ inflow and rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which triggers the process of exocytotic release of insulin (1Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In addition to this action, glucose may further increase insulin release, a phenomenon that can be evidenced by blocking KATP channels or preventing the action of the sugar on it, while maintaining an elevated [Ca2+]i (1Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 2Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Asanuma N. Sato Y. Sharp G.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent data, however, suggest that glucose-induced membrane depolarization does not require inhibition of KATP channels and involves instead the activation of a volume-sensitive anion channel (3Best L. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whatever the case, a rise in [Ca2+]i is absolutely required for the triggering and amplifying pathways activated by glucose. To ensure intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, the entry of Ca2+ into the cell must be compensated by Ca2+ outflow, which in the β-cell, is mediated by two mechanisms, the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX). The PMCA belongs to the P-type family of transport ATPases. Four different genes corresponding to four isoforms PMCA1, PMCA2, PMCA3, and PMCA4 have been evidenced. Diversity among the ATPases is in addition generated by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts that may involve two major sites (for a review, see Refs. 4Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 148-159Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we identified the PMCA transcripts expressed in the β-cell and characterized them at these two alternative splicing sites (7Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Bollen A. Van Eylen F. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) is a mechanism extruding Ca2+ from the cell in exchange with Na+ without consuming any energy (8Herchuelz A. Plasman P.-O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 639: 642-656Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Up to now, three mammalian isoforms of NCX have been cloned, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, representing the products of three distinct genes. Although NCX1 is widely distributed in various tissues, NCX2 and NCX3 seem to be restricted to brain and skeletal muscle. Several splice variants of NCX1 and NCX3 have been described, each exhibiting a specific tissue distribution (for a review see Refs. 9Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 10Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Rat pancreatic islet cells, purified β-cells, and RINm5F and BRINBD11 cells express two NCX1 splice variants: NCX1.3 and NCX1.7 (11Van Eylen F. Svoboda M. Herchuelz A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Na/Ca exchange has a low affinity but a high capacity for Ca2+, whereas the Ca2+-ATPase has a high Ca2+ affinity but low capacity for the divalent cation (12Carafoli E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is considered that Na/Ca exchange takes care of large intracellular Ca2+ loads, whereas the Ca2+-ATPase performs the fine tuning of intracellular Ca2+ level around basal [Ca2+]i, namely 0.1–0.2 μm (12Carafoli E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using antisense oligonucleotides, we recently showed in the rat β-cell, that Na/Ca exchange was responsible for up to 70% of Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm upon membrane repolarization (13Van Eylen F. Lebeau C. Albuquerque-Silva J. Herchuelz A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, different lines of evidence suggest that glucose stimulates rat Na/Ca exchange activity (14Plasman P.-O. Lebrun P. Herchuelz A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E844-E850PubMed Google Scholar, 15Van Eylen F. Diaz-Horta O. Barez A. Kamagate A. Flatt P.R. Mubagwa K. Macianskiene R. Herchuelz A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previous work on the PMCA shows, on the contrary, that glucose inhibits PMCA activity (for a review, see Ref. 16Gagliardino J.J. Rossi J.P.F.C. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1994; 10: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, while two groups out of three found a direct inhibitory effect of glucose on enzyme activity (when added to the assay medium) (17Levin S.R. Kasson B.G. Driessen J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Hoenig M. Lee R.J. Ferguson D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Kotagal N. Colca J.R. Buscetto D. McDaniel M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a fourth group found no direct effect but showed that the activity of the ATPase was significantly inhibited when measured in islets previously incubated with glucose (20Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although found by three groups, glucose-induced inhibition of PMCA activity, whether by a direct or indirect effect, was found somewhat surprising and/or unexpected. It was suggested that inhibition of PMCA could contribute to the increase in [Ca2+]i that stimulates insulin release (17Levin S.R. Kasson B.G. Driessen J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Hoenig M. Lee R.J. Ferguson D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, such inhibition is consistent with the abovementioned view on the respective roles of PMCA and NCX in Ca2+ homeostasis (12Carafoli E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which in the case of the β-cell, could be formulated as follows: when stimulated by glucose, the β-cell is faced with a major increase in Ca2+ inflow and, therefore, switches from a low efficiency Ca2+ extruding mechanism, the PMCA, to a high capacity system, the Na/Ca exchanger. To ascertain such a view, we measured the effect of glucose on PMCA and NCX1 isoforms transcription, expression, and activity in rat islet cells. The data reveal that such processes are indeed reduced by glucose in the case of the PMCA but increased by the sugar in the case of the NCX. Islet Preparations—Pancreatic islets were isolated by the collagenase technique from the pancreas of fed albino rats (21Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). The islets were cultured in 1640 RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Merelbeek, Belgium) and containing glucose, α-ketoisocaproate, tolbutamide, and nifedipine when required. After incubation, the islets were pelleted for direct RNA extraction or centrifuged and resuspended in specific buffers to study PMCA and Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) activity. Isolated cells were used for immunofluorescence studies and protein expression. The method used to isolate pancreatic islet cells has been described elsewhere (22Gobbe P. Herchuelz A. Res. Commun. Chem. Path. Pharmacol. 1989; 63: 231-249PubMed Google Scholar). Design of Polymerase Chain Reaction Primers—Primer sequences used are described in Table I. To amplify the putative splicing area of NCX1 (GenBank™ accession number X68191), the primers were designed based on rat heart cDNA sequence. For PMCA isoform 1 (PMCA 1) (accession number J03753), PMCA isoform 2 (PMCA 2) (accession number J03754), and PMCA isoform 3 (PMCA3) (accession number J05087), the primers were designed based on rat brain cDNA sequence. For PMCA isoform 4 (PMCA 4) (accession number U15408), the primers were designed based on rat testis cDNA sequence.

The amplification was conducted in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 2400, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/60 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s and 17 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/60 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s increased by 20 s at each cycle for PMCA1; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/56 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s and 22 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/56 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s increased by 20 s at each cycle for PMCA2; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/56 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s and 27 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/57 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s increased by 20 s at each cycle for PMCA3; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/58 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/58 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s increased by 20 s at each cycle for PMCA4; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/63 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s and 24 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s/63 °C for 30 s/72 °C for 45 s increased by 20 s at each cycle for NCX; and then 72 °C for 7 min (final extension). Quantitative Comparison of PCR products—To determine the relative amounts of the NCX1 and PMCAs gene products, the semi-quantitative reverse-transcribed (RT-PCR) method was used (11Van Eylen F. Svoboda M. Herchuelz A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At the end of the amplification, a 10-μl aliquot was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in 1× TBE buffer. All experiments were carried out with 10 pmol of β-actin primers as internal control. The cDNA bands were quantified by scanning densitometry. Plasma Membrane Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The method to measure the PMCA activity was adapted from Gronda et al. (20Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After the incubation period, the tubes containing the medium plus the islets were centrifuged for 1 min at 1700 × g (4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitated islets were resuspended in 300 mm sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.24) at 4 °C. The islet suspension was then transferred to a microhomogenizer, washed twice at 4 °C, and homogenized in 1 ml of the same buffer. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was assayed in a 0.5-ml reaction volume. The method consists of monitoring the release of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP by islet homogenates incubated in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.24), 0.1 mm ouabain, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μmol of thapsigargin. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the tubes were transferred to an ice-cold water bath. After 1 min, 0.75 ml of 0.5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 5% (v/v) perchloric acid and then 0.6 ml of isobutanol were added to each tube. The mixture was stirred vigorously and then centrifuged at 1700 × g (4 °C). The radioactivity was measured in an aliquot of the organic phase by liquid scintillation and, from this value, the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated from ATP was calculated. Enzyme activity represents the difference between the activity measured in the medium described above in the presence or absence of 1 μm Ca2+. Protein concentration in the homogenates was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium) with BSA as standard. 45Ca2+ Uptake—The method used for the measurement of 45Ca2+ uptake in isolated pancreatic islets cells has been described previously (11Van Eylen F. Svoboda M. Herchuelz A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, the islets cells were preincubated at 37 °C during 30 min in 1 ml of a non-radioactive solution consisting in a Krebs-Ringer buffer (115 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,10mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4; gassed with ambient air), containing 2.8 mm glucose (Merck), 10 μm nifedipine (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 1 ml of the same medium containing in addition 45Ca2+ (10 μCi/ml). In some experiments, NaCl was iso-osmotically replaced by sucrose (241 mm, Merck). At the end of the incubation, the cells were separated from the incubation medium by using a combined lanthanum and oil technique (14Plasman P.-O. Lebrun P. Herchuelz A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E844-E850PubMed Google Scholar). Na/Ca exchange was evaluated by measuring Na+i -dependent 45Cao uptake. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The islets cells were plated on coverslips and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy 48 h after plating. After incubation, cells were washed with TBS (tris-buffered saline: 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), fixed for 20 min in 4% formol at pH 7.4 (4 °C), and washed with TBS. The cells were permeabilized in solution containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 197 μm MgCl2, 19.5 μm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.4, 4 °C), washed twice with TBS, and incubated in a blocking buffer containing 1% horse serum (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) in TBS for 20 min. The coverslips were overlaid with the primary antibody (SWant, rabbit anti-Ca2+-ATPase (isoform 1, 2, 3, or 4), and mouse anti-Na/Ca exchanger (isoform NCX1) diluted 1/1000 in TBS-1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) buffer for 1 h. Control cells were incubated in TBS-1% BSA buffer without primary antibody and washed three times with TBS. The cells were then treated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor™ 594 goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), diluted 1/400 in TBS-1% BSA for 45 min, and washed four times with TBS. The cells were incubated with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution (Molecular Probes) and washed twice with TBS. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and the cells were observed with an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a HBO 100-watt or XBO 100-watt illuminator and a ×100 objective, and photographed with a Dual-mode cooled charge-coupled device camera (C4880, Hamamatsu, Japan). Images were analyzed and quantified using TITN answares software (ALCATEL). Computer-assisted Microscopy for Quantitative Immunofluorescence—To measure PMCA and NCX expression in β cells, mean optical density was determined by means of a SAMBA 2005 computer-assisted microscope system (UNILOG, Grenoble, France) with a ×40 magnification lens (BX50 microscope, aperture 0.65; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Mean optical density (MOD) denotes staining intensity. Twenty fields of between 60,000 and 120,000 μm2 each were scanned for each preparation (see Refs. 23Choufani G. Saussez S. Marchant H. Bishop P.

A negative histological control slide (from which the primary antibody was omitted) was analyzed for each sample. MOD values of the negative control samples were automatically subtracted from their corresponding positive samples. Statistics—The results are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between data was assessed by using analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post test. Quantitative Analysis by RT-PCR of PMCA1–4 and NCX1 in Islets of Langerhans—To determine the effect of glucose and α-ketoisocaproate on PMCA1–4 and NCX1 transcription, the quantitative RT-PCR method was used. Several precautions must be taken to ensure that the amount of the amplified fragment is quantitatively related to the amount of template. Indeed, after a certain number of cycles, PCR reaches a plateau, depending on different individual factors. Therefore, the number of cycles corresponding to the exponential phase of the PCR amplification was first determined. PCR amplification was carried out using two specific primers flanking the putative splicing areas of PMCA1, PMCA2, PMCA3, and PMCA4 and NCX1 cDNA and focusing on cycles 26–32, 30–40, 36–42, 34–39, and 32–37, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the linear part of the amplification process differed from one isoform to the other. For PMCA1, 2, 3, and 4 and NCX1, cycles 27, 32, 37, 35, and 33, respectively, were chosen for further work. Because the amount of RNA obtained from pancreatic islets was very limited, the total RNA was reverse-transcribed in the corresponding cDNA, which was then serially diluted. The data were expressed in proportion to the amount of β-actin mRNA present in the respective preparations. Effect of Glucose on PMCA and NCX1 mRNA—Pancreatic islets were cultured with 2.8 mm, 11.1 mm, and 22.2 mm glucose for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to quantify PMCA and NCX1 isoforms mRNAs. Insulinotropic concentrations of glucose (11.1 and 22.2 mm) induced a significant linear decrease in PMCA1 and PMCA2 mRNA but failed to affect PMCA3 and PMCA4 mRNA (Fig. 2). In contrast, glucose induced a linear increase in NCX1.3 mRNA and a trend toward an increase in NCX1.7 mRNA (Fig. 2). At 11.1 mm glucose, PMCA1 and PMCA2 mRNA were reduced by 13 and 28%, respectively, whereas NCX1.3 was increased by 52%. At 22.2 mm glucose, the figures obtained were 31, 51, and 66%, respectively. Representative gels showing the effect of glucose on PMCA2 and NCX1 transcription are shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Representative gels of PMCA2 and NCX1 RT-PCR amplification after 24-h culture in the presence of various concentrations of glucose. A, PMCA2; B, NCX1. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. MW, 1-kb DNA ladder (sizes in bases).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate the time course of the decrease in transcription, the effect of glucose on PMCA2 and NCX1.3 mRNA levels were measured over shorter periods of time (3 and 6 h). Fig. 4 shows that high glucose affected PMCA2 and NCX1.3 mRNA levels after 6 h of incubation. No significant effect of glucose was observed after 3 h (data not shown). Effect of Glucose on PMCA and NCX1 Expression at the Protein Level—To quantify the effect of glucose on PMCA and NCX1 expression at the protein level, quantitative immunofluorescence was used. Again, the cells were exposed to glucose 2.8 or 22.2 mm for 24 h. Exposure to the high concentration of glucose decreased PMCA2 expression by about 28% (p < 0.001) but failed to affect the expression of PMCA1, PMCA3, and PMCA4 (p > at least 0.10, Fig. 5). In contrast, the sugar increased NCX1 expression by about 28% (p < 0.001, Fig. 5). Fig. 6 shows representative images illustrating the effect of glucose on PMCA2 and NCX1 (both NCX1.3 and NCX1.7) immunofluorescence.Fig. 6Representative images of immunofluorescent microscopy analysis of PMCA2 and NCX1 expression at the protein level.

The nuclei are labeled in blue (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Glucose on PMCA and NCX1 Activity—Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured by monitoring the release of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP by islet homogenates in the presence of ouabain and thapsigargin to ensure complete inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase and sarco(endoplasmic) reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity, without affecting the PMCA. Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was measured as intracellular Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake, in the presence of 10 μM nifedipine to block the effect of glucose on voltage-sensitive Ca2+-channels. Fig. 7 shows that Ca2+-ATPase activity was decreased when cultured for 24 h in the presence of 11.1 and 22.2 mm glucose (p < 0.025), whereas Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was increased under the same experimental conditions (p < 0.025). Effect of α-Ketoisocaproate on PMCA and NCX1 Expression and Activity—To confirm the results obtained with glucose, another metabolized insulin secretagogue (α-ketoisocaproate) was used. Fig. 8 shows that α-ketoisocaproate (10 mm) mimicked the effect of glucose to decrease PMCA1 and PMCA2 mRNA level by about 36% (p < 0.02) and 57% (p < 0.001), respectively, while failing to affect those of PMCA3 and PMCA4. Likewise, α-ketoisocaproate increased NCX1.3 mRNA levels by about 60% (p < 0.04) and induced a trend toward an increase in NCX1.7 mRNA. PMCA and NCX1 expression at the protein level showed a parallel tendency (Fig. 9). Thus, α-ketoisocaproate decreased PMCA1 and PMCA2 expression by 40 and 41% (p < 0.001) while failing to affect PMCA4 expression. Surprisingly, PMCA3 expression was also reduced by α-ketoisocaproate (–32%, p < 0.001). Last, like glucose, α-ketoisocaproate increased NCX1 expression by about 20% (p < 0.01). Effect of Nifedipine on PMCA and NCX1 Expression—To gain further insight into the mechanism by with glucose modulates PMCA and NCX1 expression, the effect of the sugar was examined in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine. Fig. 10 shows that nifedipine (10 μm) failed to suppress the effect of glucose on PMCA and NCX1 expression. In fact, in the presence of nifedipine, the effect of the sugar was even more marked than in its absence. Thus, in the presence of the antagonist, glucose inhibited PMCA1, 2, and 3, instead of PMCA2 alone in its absence (compare Figs. 5 and 10). Likewise, the effect of the sugar to increase NCX1 expression was of larger magnitude than in its absence, the sugar increasing NCX1 expression by 28 ± 5% and 63 ± 3% in the absence and presence of nifedipine, respectively (p < 0.0001). Ca2+ entry into the β-cell through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels may not be the sole mechanism by which glucose rises [Ca2+]i. Other mechanisms have been identified in β-cell mouse, like activation of store-operated channels and intracellular Ca2+ release through inositol-trisphosphate- or ryanodine-sensitive channels (34Gilon P.

However, it is unclear to which extent such mechanisms also operate in rat β-cells. Therefore, the effect of nifedipine on glucose-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was examined in rat β-cells. Fig. 11 shows that, in the absence of nifedipine, glucose (11 mm) induced a rapid and oscillating increase in [Ca2+]i. Such increase was completely blocked by 10 μm nifedipine. This indicates that, in the rat β-cell, mechanisms other than voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels do not contribute significantly to glucose-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, at least in the absence of a significant increase in Ca2+ inflow through such voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The present work provides convincing evidence that glucose represses PMCA but increases NCX1 transcription, expression, and activity in rat pancreatic islet cells. In view of the low amounts of PMCA and NCX expressed in islet cells, expression at the protein level was examined by quantitative immunofluorescence. Previous work showed a good correlation between results obtained using Western blotting and quantitative immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence (26Camby I. Belot N. Lefranc F. Sadeghi N. de Launoit Y. Kaltner H. Musette S. Darro F. Danguy A. Salmon I. Gabius H.J. Kiss R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 617: 585-596Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Nagy N.

Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The data were rather homogeneous in showing a parallel decrease in mRNA and protein levels of one of the four PMCAs, PMCA2. This is of great interest because PMCA2 is expressed in a limited number of specialized tissues like neurons, at variance with PMCA1 and PMCA4, which are transcribed in most tissues and may thus represent housekeeping enzymes (29Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18569-18576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brandt P. Neve R.L. Kammesheidt A. Rhoads R.E. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the β-cell is the sole non-neuronal tissue, so far identified, that shows the presence of substantial amounts of PMCA2 at the protein level, a finding that attests the special needs of β-cells in terms of Ca2+ homeostasis (7Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Bollen A. Van Eylen F. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glucose also decreased PMCA1 mRNA but failed to affect the PMCA1 level of expression, although the metabolized insulin secretagogue, α-ketoisocaproate, decreased both PMCA1 and PMCA2 transcription and expression. Likewise, in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, glucose reduced the expression of PMCA1, 2, and 3. Therefore, it is conceivable that, together with PMCA2, the expression of PMCA1 and PMCA3 is repressed by the sugar. In parallel with this decrease in expression, glucose reduced global PMCA activity when measured in islets previously incubated with glucose, in agreement with Gronda et al. (20Gronda C.M. Rossi J.P. Gagliardino J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the latter work, these authors observed a significant decrease in Ca2+-ATPase activity during the first 3 min of exposure to glucose with subsequent return toward control values. However, the enzyme activity measured at 60 min was still below the control value, even though this difference was not significant. Our data showing a dose-related inhibition of the ATPase activity after 24 h of incubation confirm that the inhibitory of the sugar is not transient. No attempt was made in the present study to measure any direct effect of glucose on enzyme activity. In contrast to its effects on PMCA, the sugar induced a dose-related increase in NCX1 transcription, expression, and activity. The isoform that appeared to be up-regulated at the mRNA level was NCX1.3, although there was a trend toward an increase in NCX1.7 transcription, with resulting increase in NCX1 global expression at the protein level (NCX1.3 plus NCX1.7) and activity. To identify pancreatic β-cell genes that are responsive to glucose, Webb et al. (32Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) recently carried out a microarray analysis of murine β-cell line MIN6 cells exposed to either high (25 mm) or low (5.5 mm) glucose for 24 h. The study demonstrated that many β-cell genes were glucose-responsive, with 78 demonstrating a 2.2-fold or greater change in transcript levels. The largest functional clusters identified were secretory pathway, metabolism, signaling, and transcriptional regulation transcripts. The microarray used in the latter study allowed interrogation of 6500 murine genes and expression sequence tags, including the sequences of NCX1 gene but apparently not those of the PMCA genes (32Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). With respect to NCX1, the study was negative but the authors only reported genes showing a 2.2-fold or greater change in transcript levels. In the present study, the maximum change did not exceed 66%. Another microarray analysis of intact human pancreatic islets using very stringent criteria also failed to show changes in PMCA and NCX1 transcripts levels (33Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffman S.C. Hirsberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The effects exerted in the present study by the metabolizable insulin secretagogue α-ketoisocaproate on PMCA and NCX1 expression and activity were similar to those induced by glucose, and even tended to be more marked than those induced by the sugar. Likewise, the effects of glucose on both PMCA and NCX1 were not suppressed by nifedipine. Although rather preliminary, the latter data suggest that the effects of glucose to modulate PMCA and NCX1 expression and activity do not result from a direct effect of the sugar or from a simple increase in Ca2+ entry or content of the β-cell, but may implicate more complex mechanism such as those evoked in the amplifying pathway of the sugar. Further work is required to identify such mechanisms of regulation. Taken as a whole, the present data confirm the view that, in response to a stimulation by glucose, the β-cell switches from a low efficiency Ca2+-extruding mechanism, the PMCA, to a high capacity system, the Na/Ca exchanger, to better face the increase in Ca2+ inflow. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a reciprocal change in PMCA and NCX1 expression and activity in response to a given stimulus in any cellular preparation or tissue. The up-regulation of NCX1 by glucose may have a further advantage, because NCX1, in addition to being able to extrude Ca2+, may also contribute to Ca2+ entry through reverse Na/Ca exchange and generate an inward current that may prolong the duration of the burst of spikes of electrical activity generated by glucose and hence enhance insulin release (15Van Eylen F.

In addition, the up-regulation of NCX1 could help to protect the β-cell against the deleterious actions of elevated glucose levels. Indeed, the sugar, when used at a high concentration was observed to trigger apoptosis in β cells, a process that was Ca2+-dependent (38Efanova J.B. Zaitsev S.V. Zhivotovsky B. Köhler M. Efendic S.

https://openalex.org/W2003363903,"Arsenate reductase (ArsC) from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and plays a role in bacterial heavy metal resistance. The high resolution x-ray structure of ArsC reveals the atomic details of the K+ binding site situated next to the catalytic P-loop structural motif of this redox enzyme. A full thermodynamic study of the binding characteristics of a series of monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and their influence on the thermal stability of ArsC was performed with isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Potassium has the largest affinity with a Ka of 3.8 x 10(3) m(-1), and the effectiveness of stabilization of ArsC by monovalent cations follows the binding affinity order: K+ > Rb+ > Cs+ > Na+ > Li+. A mutagenesis study on the K+ binding side chains showed that Asn-13 and Asp-65 are essential for potassium binding, but the impact on the stability of ArsC was the most extreme when mutating Ser-36. Additionally, the thermal stabilization by K+ is significantly reduced in the case of the ArsC E21A mutant, showing the importance of a Glu-21-coordinated water molecule in its contact with K+. Although potassium is not essential for catalysis, in its presence the kcat/KM increases with a factor of 5. Altogether, the interaction of K+ with specific residues in ArsC is an enthalpydriven process that stabilizes ArsC and increases the specific activity of this redox enzyme."

The following cellular processes were observed in vitro in a manner dependent on insulin, time of incubation, and exogenous ATP: 1) autophosphorylation and activation of the insulin receptor; 2) tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1); 3) association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 with phosphoinositide 3-kinase; 4) activation of the kinase Akt via its phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473; and 5) phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by activated Akt. The activation of Akt in vitro was abolished in the presence of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, thus recapitulating the most notable regulatory feature of Akt observed in vivo. Evidence is presented indicating that the critical spatial compartmentalization of signaling molecules necessary for efficient signal transduction is likely to be preserved in the cell-free system. Additionally, data are provided demonstrating that full Akt activation in this system is dependent on plasma membrane-associated IRS-1, cannot be mediated by robust cytosol-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and occurs in the complete absence of detectable IRS-2 phosphorylation in the cytosol and plasma membrane.

The activated receptor can then phosphorylate several intracellular protein substrates, most notably the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; CYT, cytosol; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; ins, insulin; LDM, low density microsomes; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PM, plasma membrane; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; CYT, cytosol; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; ins, insulin; LDM, low density microsomes; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PM, plasma membrane; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase. proteins (2White M.F.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins can recruit and activate the downstream effector, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) using inositol-containing phospholipids resident in the plasma membrane as substrates (4Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Many of the metabolic effects of insulin are absolutely dependent on PI 3-kinase activation. For example, insulin stimulation of glucose transport via translocation of the glucose transporter isoform Glut4 is completely blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (5Clark J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In vitro assays have proven to be enormously useful for many areas of cell biology. The earliest studies, to our knowledge, in which this experimental approach was applied to the investigation of insulin action occurred during the late 1970s when L. Jarett and co-workers noted that the direct addition of insulin to a purified adipocyte plasma membrane fraction resulted in numerous effects, including alterations in the phosphorylation of several proteins (6Seals J.R. McDonald J.M. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increased calcium binding by the plasma membrane (7McDonald J.M. Bruns D.E. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1542-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These investigators had very few guide-posts available at the time for interpreting their observations in a molecular context. Indeed, their work predated the cloning of the cDNA encoding the insulin receptor, which occurred in 1985 (8Ebina Y.E. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W.

More recently, the laboratory of C. R. Kahn employed subcellular fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes to reconstitute 1) the dynamic association of IRS-1/2 and PI 3-kinase with various cellular compartments (10Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and 2) the binding of Glut4 vesicles to the plasma membrane (11Inoue G. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These investigators employed components derived from cells that were treated in vivo with or without insulin (100 nm for 10 min at 37 °C). The extent of manipulations that can be performed in their assay may, thus, be potentially limited due to the likelihood of the insulin-dependent process under investigation already having occurred in vivo before the time the components of their assay are recombined in vitro. This limitation may explain why the insulin-stimulated association of Glut4 vesicles with the plasma membrane that they observed in vitro was wortmannin-insensitive and did not require ATP or cytosol (11Inoue G. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During the current era in which complete genomic sequence data can be used in conjunction with sensitive proteomic techniques, it may be possible to comprehensively catalog all of the factors that are involved in bringing about the cellular responses elicited by insulin. As such information accrues, the challenge will increasingly shift toward untangling the web of functional interrelationships that exist among the identified factors. Efforts to devise in vitro assays that reconstitute cellular processes should be maintained to keep pace with the rate of discovery in insulin action. In this report we describe a novel in vitro assay reconstituting key aspects of PI 3-kinase-dependent insulin signaling using subcellular components isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our data derived from this assay reinforce the functional significance of spatial compartmentalization exhibited by signaling components in the PI 3-kinase pathway. Cell Culture of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (12Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10–14 days after initiating differentiation. Isolation of Subcellular Components—Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight. The cells were then rapidly washed 3 times with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained further for 15 min at 4 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm insulin. Cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 2 ml of ice-cold HES buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA)/dish containing protease inhibitors (0.082 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then homogenized at 4 °C by passing the cells 10 times through a Yamato SC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rpm. The plasma membrane (PM) fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation and sucrose cushion flotation as described previously (13Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and designated as either PM(–ins) or PM(+ins) according to whether the starting cell source was exposed to insulin. The low density microsomes (LDM) fraction was obtained from basal cells as described previously (13Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PM and LDM subsequent to their isolation were resuspended in IC buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). A highly concentrated cytosol (CYT) fraction was prepared by washing the 3T3-L1 adipocytes 3 times with ice-cold IC buffer then removing the buffer as much as possible by aspiration followed by cell scraping and homogenizing with a ball-bearing homogenizer. The supernatant was recovered after an ultracentrifuge spin for 1 h at 200,000 × g. For the preparation of immunodepleted CYT, pre-cleared CYT was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose bound with the appropriate antibodies. A polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the RNA-binding protein syncrip served as the control. In Vitro Assay—Samples were prepared on ice by mixing in various combinations LDM (∼2.5 mg/ml final concentration), CYT (∼3 mg/ml final concentration), and PM(+ or –ins) (∼0.5 mg/ml final concentration). Reaction volumes ranging from 100 to 200 μl were adjusted as necessary with IC buffer. Reactions were initiated with the addition of either an ATP regenerating system (final reaction concentrations, 1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm MgCl2) or an ATP-depleting system (final reaction concentrations, 25 units/ml hexokinase and 5 mm glucose). Samples were rotated for 0–15 min in a 37 °C incubator. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) either containing 2% SDS and 1 mm EDTA (for samples to be run directly on SDS-PAGE) or 2% Triton X-100 and 40 mm EDTA (for samples to be immunoprecipitated). For certain in vitro reactions, as indicated, some of the following were also added (final concentrations): 1 mm DTT, 150 μm sodium vanadate, 1 μm microcystin-LR (Calbiochem), 100 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem), or 1 μg/100 μl reaction volume of recombinant human insulin receptor cytoplasmic β subunit-GST fusion protein (Calbiochem; 407697). Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Protein samples from the in vitro assay were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phospho-specific antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated forms of Akt or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of IRS-1 was accomplished by use of a polyclonal rabbit IRS-1 antibody raised against the carboxy-terminal 14 amino acids of rat IRS-1. Insulin receptor, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, IRS-2, Akt1–3, and Gab1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The Akt3 antibody used for immunoblot analyses was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Characterization of the Cell-free System—We have attempted to reconstitute key aspects of the insulin-signaling pathway using subcellular fractions derived from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We chose to use fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as the source material because they are highly responsive to insulin. These cells typically exhibit a ∼10–20-fold increase in glucose uptake in response to acute stimulation with insulin (14Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity to respond to this extent is acquired during the course of adipocyte differentiation, during which the expression levels of signaling components (such as the insulin receptor and IRS-1) (15Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reed B.C. Kaufman S.H. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10163-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and target molecules (such as the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4) (12Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) are dramatically increased. Subcellular fractionation protocols exist for adipocytes that allow the reproducible recovery of distinct subcellular components with relative ease (13Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jarett L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnielli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). An outline of our basic in vitro assay is provided in Fig. 1A. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the basal state were first cooled rapidly by washing with ice-cold media and then maintained at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin. The cold temperature incubation allowed insulin to bind its cell surface receptor but prohibited subsequent intracellular signaling events. After the cold temperature incubation, purified PM fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation and sucrose cushion flotation. The PM fractions are referred to as PM(–ins) or PM(+ins) according to whether or not the cell source was exposed to insulin. Basal cells were also used to obtain the LDM and CYT. The LDM is enriched in endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and insulin-responsive Glut4-containing vesicles as well as certain insulin-signaling molecules such as IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase (21Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In vitro reactions (∼100–200 μl) were prepared by mixing various combinations of the 3T3-L1 subcellular fractions (PM(–ins) or PM(+ins), LDM, or CYT) on ice. The reactions were initiated by the addition of an ATP regenerating system and then rotated for up to 15 min in a 37 °C incubator, thereby allowing insulin, carried through to this point in reactions containing PM(+ins) via high affinity interaction with its receptor, to exert its effects. The concentrations of PM, LDM, and CYT protein in a typical reaction were 0.5, 2.5, and 3 mg/ml, respectively. The delay in kinetics from what is observed in vivo is likely due in part to the time required for the temperature of the samples to rise from 4 to 37 °C and to the dilution of components in the cell-free system. The starting subcellular fractions were examined for the presence of insulin signaling molecules by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). The insulin receptor was highly enriched in the PM fraction, and the amount did not vary with exposure to insulin. IRS-1 and IRS-2 were found mainly in the LDM and, to a lesser extent, the cytosol fraction, as previously reported (10Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). IRS-3, which is present in primary adipocytes, is not expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the IRS proteins, Gab1 (another insulin receptor substrate) (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was found exclusively in the cytosol. The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was present to a significant degree in all three subcellular fractions. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 was mainly found in the cytosol. Akt1–3 isoforms were present almost exclusively in the cytosolic fraction. We were particularly interested in reconstituting insulin-dependent processes downstream of PI 3-kinase. The generation of PIP3 by PI 3-kinase leads to the activation of Akt by phosphorylation of two of its residues, Thr-308 and Ser-473 (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar) (numerics corresponding to the Akt1 isoform). Akt in turn can phosphorylate GSK-3 on Ser-21 (for the α isoform) or Ser-9 (for the β isoform) (25Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of Akt and GSK-3 in our in vitro system was examined by immunoblot analysis using appropriate phospho-specific antibodies. The phospho-specific Akt antibodies used in this study (Cell Signaling Technology) are capable of detecting both Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation (26Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although Akt2 has been reported to be the major isoform in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (26Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Summers S.A. Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, Akt was properly phosphorylated in vitro on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 in response to insulin in reactions containing PM (+ins), LDM, and CYT in the presence of 150 nm sodium vanadate and 1 μm microcystin-LR (lane 3). The occurrence of insulin-dependent signaling suggested that the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor, which contains the intrinsic tyrosine kinase, was properly oriented with respect to the membrane to access its substrates in the cell-free system. This conforms to our estimate using alkaline phosphatase activity as an ecto-domain marker (28Garen A. Levinthal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 29Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14746-14752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that 70% of the PM vesicles exhibited an inside-out orientation (data not shown). Moreover, the PM vesicles were apparently sealed, because Akt was not significantly activated by the direct addition of insulin to in vitro reactions containing PM(–ins) (lane 2). The addition of 100 nm wortmannin (lanes 4–6) or the absence of ATP (lanes 7–9) completely suppressed the insulin response. Reactions containing PM alone (lanes 10–12), CYT alone (lanes 13 and 14), and LDM alone (lanes 15 and 16) failed to result in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. The absence of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in reactions containing PM, LDM, or CYT alone as well as the absolute requirement for exogenous ATP indicates that the system was not significantly contaminated by unbroken cells. Inhibition by wortmannin indicates that the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation observed in vitro was PI 3-kinase-dependent. We attempted to optimize the conditions that elicited the maximal insulin response with regard to Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylation by performing the in vitro reactions in the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 3). Despite being enriched in signaling molecules such as PI 3-kinase and IRS-1/2 (21Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the LDM appeared to be dispensable for the phosphorylation of Akt. In fact, a stronger insulin-stimulated signal was consistently observed for both Akt phosphorylation sites in reactions excluding the LDM in the absence of the broad specificity Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin-LR. This suggested that LDM might contain a phosphatase activity capable of acting on Akt. Generally, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate appeared to elevate the signal for both Akt phosphorylation sites in reactions containing PM(+ins). However, at the same time, the corresponding control (basal) signal in reactions containing PM(–ins) was also elevated, thus blunting the discernable insulin response. Microcystin also increased the insulin-stimulated signal for both Akt phosphorylation sites. However, this phosphatase inhibitor elevated the basal signal only for the Ser-473 site. Some of the in vitro reactions were also performed in the presence of 1 mm DTT, which was included to mimic the reducing environment found inside cells (Fig. 3; lower two rows). DTT appeared to inhibit the phospho-Akt signal in most cases. There are at least two reasons to explain why DTT failed to facilitate signaling. First, a reducing environment such as that provided by DTT is required for optimal activity of certain tyrosine phosphatases, which can be expected to down-regulate insulin signaling (30Takakura K. Beckman J.S. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 31Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Second, DTT is known to inhibit the phosphatase-countering activity of vanadate (32Gordon J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3(α/β) on Ser-(21/9) mirrored that of Akt (Fig. 3). The empirical comparison of various conditions demonstrated that the optimal reaction for observing insulin-responsive phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 (i.e. the most dramatic fold difference between basal and insulin-stimulated signals) contained PM and CYT but excluded DTT, vanadate, and microcystin. Under these conditions both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions could occur because phosphatase inhibitors were not necessary for detecting insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The time course for insulin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation under the optimal conditions described above was ascertained by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Two bands at ∼160 and ∼95 kDa appeared in response to insulin, corresponding to the molecular mass of IRS-1/2 and the β subunit of the insulin receptor, respectively (Fig. 4A). Phosphotyrosine signals were completely absent when ATP was depleted from the reaction (Fig. 4A, last four lanes), thus ruling out the possibility of significant reaction contamination by intact cells. The identities of the two insulin-dependent phosphotyrosine bands were confirmed by solubilizing the reaction with 1% Triton X-100 and then immunoprecipitating with an antibody recognizing either the β subunit of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 (Fig. 4B). For both of these proteins, the phosphotyrosine signal peaked at 2.5 min from the start of the reaction and somewhat decreased thereafter, presumably due to dephosphorylation. We also examined the in vitro recruitment of PI 3-kinase to tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor proteins. After solubilizing the reaction with 1% Triton X-100, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins capable of co-immunoprecipitating with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase were detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). Insulin stimulated the association of PI 3-kinase with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein doublet corresponding to the molecular mass of IRS-1 and IRS-2, mimicking what occurs in vivo (10Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A minor population of PI 3-kinase was found to be complexed with a protein of ∼95 kDa, which may be the autophosphorylated β subunit of the insulin receptor. It is important to note that others have observed an in vivo association between PI 3-kinase and the activated insulin receptor (34Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The time course for the phosphorylation of Akt was assessed by immunoblot analysis using phospho-Akt-specific antibodies (Fig. 5A). Akt phosphorylation exhibited kinetics delayed relative to that of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, with the insulin-stimulated signal peaking at ∼10–15 min from the start of the reaction. The time course for GSK-3 phosphorylation was similar to that of Akt (Fig. 5A). As was observed for tyrosine phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 in vitro was completely dependent on exogenous ATP (Fig. 5A, last four lanes). Also, the addition of 100 nm wortmannin to the reaction completely abrogated insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473 and GSK-3(α/β) phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the in vitro kinase activities targeting both Akt sites and the subsequent GSK phosphorylation were PI 3-kinase-dependent, recapitulating in vivo characteristics (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Akt has been shown to translocate from the cytosol to the PM in response to insulin in intact cells (26Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the basal state, Akt1–3 isoforms were found almost exclusively in the cytosolic fraction in our system (Fig. 1B). It was possible, however, that by incubating cells on ice with insulin before isolating the subcellular fractions, the system was “primed,” causing a residual amount of Akt1–3 to translocate to the PM and be phosphorylated after the addition of ATP. By immunodepleting Akt from the cytosol, it could be determined which form of Akt, cytosolic or PM-associated, was phosphorylated in the cell-free assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, each of the Akt isoforms could be collectively immunodepleted from the cytosol. In vitro reactions containing various combinations of PM(+ or –ins), CYT, and CYT(-Akt) revealed that insulin-dependent Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylation required the presence of both PM and CYT (Fig. 6B). No detectable Akt or GSK-3 phosphorylation was observed with PM alone. Immunodepleting Akt1–3 from the cytosol almost completely blocked insulin-dependent Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that Akt phosphorylated during the cell-free incubation originated from the cytosolic fraction, thus recapitulating what appears to occur in vivo. Insulin-stimulated Akt Activation Does Not Require Cytosolic IRS Proteins in the Cell-free Assay—The preceding data demonstrate that early insulin signaling events dependent on PI 3-kinase up to and including Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylation appear to be faithfully reconstituted in the in vitro system. A cell-free system offers several advantages that would be extremely difficult or impossible to address in a satisfactory manner using an intact cell system. In particular, facile experimental access to all components of our system allows manipulations such as the introduction of membrane-impermeant reagents or the depletion of cellular factors, as was illustrated in Fig. 6 with Akt. As a further demonstration of this principle, we added a soluble recombinant insulin receptor kinase domain fusion prote"

Comparison of hGH structures, either free or bound to a single lactogenic or somatotrophic receptor, shows binding is associated with structural changes. Changes in hGH structure are unique when binding either lactogenic or somatotrophic receptors and they influence the spatial arrangement of residues constituting the second receptor-binding site. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a contiguous set of largely hydrophobic residues that forms a motif communicating between the two receptor-binding sites of hGH. The residues are external to the receptor-binding epitopes and were identified when their mutation reduced site 2 function without changing site 1 function. The motif includes Phe44, Leu93, Tyr160, Leu163, and Tyr164, located in two hydrophobic clusters between the receptor-binding sites. Their mutation to Glu disrupts hydrophobic interactions and reduces lactogenic activity between 4.7- and 85-fold with little effect on somatotrophic activity or spectroscopic properties. These differential effects indicate that loss of lactogenic activity is not a result of global mis-folding. We propose the loss of lactogenic activity results from disruption of specific hydrophobic clusters that disables the site 1 binding-induced structuring of the second receptor-binding site.

The residues are external to the receptor-binding epitopes and were identified when their mutation reduced site 2 function without changing site 1 function. The motif includes Phe44, Leu93, Tyr160, Leu163, and Tyr164, located in two hydrophobic clusters between the receptor-binding sites. Their mutation to Glu disrupts hydrophobic interactions and reduces lactogenic activity between 4.7- and 85-fold with little effect on somatotrophic activity or spectroscopic properties. These differential effects indicate that loss of lactogenic activity is not a result of global mis-folding. We propose the loss of lactogenic activity results from disruption of specific hydrophobic clusters that disables the site 1 binding-induced structuring of the second receptor-binding site. Human growth hormone (hGH) 1The abbreviation used is: hGH, human growth hormone. is a ligand of the subclass 1 of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily (1Bazan J.F. Proc. Nalt. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 2Kossiakoff A.A. de Vos A.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 52: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is able to bind and activate both lactogenic and somatotrophic receptors (3Hughes J.P. Friesen H.G. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 469-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of recombinant hGH is a treatment for some types of impaired stature and in elderly patients with reduced hGH blood concentrations (4Lippe B.M. Nakamoto J.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 179-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive structural work has been performed on hGH including crystallographic and mutational studies, which make hGH an attractive target to study the mechanics of protein function. A thorough understanding of the mechanism by which hGH binds and activates receptors is required for the rational design of agonists and antagonists of hGH and other family members, most significantly prolactin and placental lactogen. hGH binds two receptors on unique surface topologies of the ligand, with receptor dimerization occurring in a sequential fashion (5Cunningham B.C.

Muller Y.A. de Vos A.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The first binding occurs on a surface of hGH called site 1, followed by binding on site 2. X-ray crystallography structures are available for unbound hGH (Protein Data Bank code 1HGU) (7Chantalat L. Jones N. Korber F. Navaza J. Pavlovsky A.G.

The receptor-binding topologies of hGH (sites 1 and 2) are structurally distinct. The structural and functional binding epitopes of the hGH·hGHr (extracellular domain of the hGH receptor) complex at site 1 (12Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and site 2 (5Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) have been identified. Binding experiments with hGH and either the lactogenic or somatotrophic receptor describe extensively overlapping but non-identical receptor-binding sites on the ligand surface (13Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Comparison of the multiple crystal structures of hGH reveals that hGH undergoes structural changes induced by receptor binding at site 1 that are unique to the association with either lactogenic or somatotrophic receptors (Fig. 1) (14Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These changes include helical structuring of residues 38–49 and 90–99, resulting in the formation of mini-helix 1 and a lengthening of helix 2, respectively. These large changes in helical content are coupled with a 15° shift of helix 3 relative to the axis of the 4-helix bundle. The lengthening of helix 2 must also reduce the mobility of helix 3 because site 1 binding reduces the nonhelical residues connecting helices 2 and 3 from ∼13 to 3, positioning helix 3 in a more favorable position for site 2 binding. The articulation of helices 1 and 3 provides a groove that constitutes site 2 for either the lactogenic or somatotrophic receptor. Comparison of the structures of hGH bound to one extracellular domain of the somatotrophic receptor and hGH bound to two extracellular domains of the somatotrophic receptor suggests that these changes occur upon binding to the first receptor molecule. Previous mutational analysis has shown that Phe44, located in the mini-helix region, is required for lactogenic activity, but not for somatotrophic activity (15Peterson F.C. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21444-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although affecting biological activity, Phe44 is not located within the functional epitopes for either site 1 or site 2. Ligand-binding assays have been useful in detecting steric hindrance within a single binding site. Because our studies focused on the mechanical interaction between the two binding sites, we used a cellular bioassay that measures the composite of all factors, both steric and mechanistic (16Duda K.M. Brooks C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this way, we were able to discern an effect of hGH mutations that are not within the binding epitopes by their effect on activity. We hypothesize that only the first receptor-binding site is present in apo-hGH and that a conformational change induced by lactogen receptor binding at site 1 transduces across the hGH molecule via a series of hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the structuring of a functional site 2. We used mutagenic scanning of the N terminus of helix 4 and hydrophobic residues in the 2–3 loop to identify a series of residues that form a hydrophobic motif functionally linking the first and second binding sites. It is this motif that articulates the conformation change. The ability to bind both lactogenic and somatotrophic receptors not only allows us to distinguish the effects of lactogenic receptor binding from those of somatotrophic receptor binding, but also gives us the ability to discern effects of the motif from effects of global protein disruption. Several studies (17Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.A. Wells J.A. DeMeyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinol. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Goffin V. Kinet S.

In this work we identify a second category of hGH residues that may be useful in the development of antagonists include residues that inhibit the conformation required for binding of the second receptor molecule. Plasmids and Bacterial Strains—An f1 origin of replication was inserted into the pT7–7 plasmid (kindly provided by S. Tabor, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) generating the pT7–7f(–) phagmid. The positive strand was used for cloning, single-stranded DNA production, and expression of hGH. Escherichia coli strains DH5α, RZ1032, and BL21(DE3) were used for cloning, production of single-stranded DNA, and protein expression, respectively. This system was previously described (15Peterson F.C. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21444-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Peterson F.C.

Purif. 1999; 15: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins were evaluated for size and purity by 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared in 5% glycerol, 3% sodium SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of pyronin Y, placed in boiling water for ∼1 min, and 5–10 μg samples were placed on the gels. Gels contained sodium SDS without reducing reagent, were run at constant amperage, and were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Proteins were evaluated for homogeneity and size by comparison with molecular weight markers. Protein folding was evaluated by absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Mutants constructed included F44E, V90E, L93E, R94F, F97E, Y103E, L157E, K158E, Y160E, L163A, L163E, L163F, and Y164E. Protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchroninnic acid protein assay (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). FDC-P1 Somatotrophic and Lactogenic Assays—FDC-P1 cells containing either the human prolactin or hGH receptor were a gift from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). hGH dose-response curves were obtained as previously described (15Peterson F.C. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21444-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Duda K.M. Brooks C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, FDC-P1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, and 1 nm wild-type hGH (22Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One day before the assay, log-phase cells were collected and washed with non-supplemented RPMI 1640. Cells were washed and suspended in medium devoid of hGH and phenol red, but supplemented with 10% gelding horse serum. After 24 h, cells were collected and suspended in the same medium. Hormone stocks were diluted in this medium to the desired concentrations and added to 96-well plates in triplicate sets. Each well contained 15,000 FDC-P1 cells in a total volume of 100 μl. Plates were gently agitated and then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere for 48 h. Hormone-induced cell proliferation was assessed by a vital dye method by addition of 10 μl of Alamar Blue (Accumed International, West Lake, OH) per well, followed by a 4 h incubation. The oxidation-reduction of Alamar Blue was evaluated at 570 and 600 nm. These values were used to calculate the percent reduction of the dye, which is highly correlated with the number of cells (r2 > 0.99). The values obtained from dose-response studies were used to calculate ED50 values for the agonist phases by a four parameter fit method (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Protein Expression—Wild-type and all mutant hGHs were expressed and purified, yielding an average of 40 mg/liter of fermentation. All mutants, with the exception of L163E, co-migrated with wild-type protein on SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Reducing conditions showed the proteins to be greater than 95% pure, whereas the non-reducing conditions suggested that all proteins were folded homogeneously, and were similar to wild-type hGH with only small traces of dimerized protein present. The SDS-polyacrylamide non-reducing gel of L163E hGH contained many bands, corresponding to variously folded and dimeric proteins (data not shown). Protein Spectroscopy—UV absorption spectra were collected and corrected for background and light scatter. Spectra were normalized by dividing the absorbance at each wavelength by the value at 277 nm. All spectra were compared with that of wild-type hGH (Fig. 2). All mutants had similar curves, although five proteins varied significantly in their 250:280 nm ratio. These five proteins, L93E, R94F, L157E, L163E, and Y164E, showed increased 250:280 ratios of 42, 36, 36, 34, and 35%, respectively. With the exception of L163E, all fluorescent spectra had similar emission spectra when normalized at 338 nm (Fig. 3). L163E had a reduction in quantum yield of 29% as well as a secondary peak near 318 nm when compared with wild-type hGH. Only two other proteins had any significant variation in the spectra. V90E was red-shifted 4 nm, and R94F had an increased quantum yield of 18%. Circular dichroism spectra (Fig. 4) were typical of proteins with high helical content. Mutant proteins had molar ellipticity values at 222 nm within 10% of wild-type values except for V90E and L163E, which had 117.7 and 74.7% of wild type values, respectively.Fig. 3Fluorescence spectra of hGHs.

Results were normalized by identifying the wild-type hGH concentration providing the highest response and dividing the values for each dose of each protein evaluated in the assay by this number.Fig. 6FDC-P1 human lactogenic bioassay. Hormone doses were prepared and administered as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of two or more experiments. All proteins were evaluated in the same experiment. Each data point represents the average from triplicate wells. The maximum responses were normalized to the wild-type hGH maximal response. The large panel contains the dose response curves for mutants that had reduced lactogenic ED50 values. The inset contains dose response curves for all proteins tested. The average coefficient of variation for all data points was 2.03% with a range between 0 and 5.8%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The coefficient of variation for the measurement of lactogenic ED50 values averaged 14.7%. We selected a considerably higher 2-fold cutoff value, a disproportionate decrease in lactogenic and somatotrophic activities and the curve shapes of the lactogenic bioassay to identify the residues included in this motif. We have conservatively selected residues for inclusion in this motif because we believe that fold-changes less than a 2-fold loss might be accounted for by biological variation in between assays. Protein aggregation was not present at hGH concentrations used in the bioassays, based on light scattering data at 350 nm (data not shown), which was performed at 2 μm, twice the highest concentration used in the bioassays. F44E and Y164E hGHs had the greatest losses of activity in the FDC-P1 lactogenic assay relative to wild-type, 83.8- and 86.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 and Table I), and large decreases in lactogenic activity compared with relatively small changes in somatotrophic activity (Fig. 5 and Table I). Other hGH mutations that produced a significant loss in lactogenic activity included L93E and Y160E at 4.7- and 9.0-fold, respectively. These mutations had smaller effects on somatotrophic activities. Mutation of each of these four residues right-shifted the agonist phase of the dose-response curve, while not affecting the antagonist phase. Agonist activity requires both sites 1 and 2 to be functional, whereas antagonist activity requires only site 1 to be functional. Therefore, the data indicate that these mutations functionally uncouple site 1 from site 2. Based on these data the four residues were chosen for inclusion in the motif that propagates the conformation change from site 1 to site 2.Table ILactogenic and somatotrophic activities of recombinant hGHsFDC-P1 lactogenic assayFDC-P1 somatotrophic assayED50Relative fold loss of activityED50Relative fold loss of activitynMnMWT hGH1.761.000.07121.00F44E14783.80.5768.09V90E2.681.520.0981.38L93E8.224.660.2343.29R94F4.42.500.2723.82F97E2.161.230.1081.52Y103E1.981.130.1071.52L157E1.831.040.1371.92K158E2.151.220.1161.63Y160E15.89.000.1862.62L163E***a***, values could not be calculated.*********Y164E152.086.50.1512.12a ***, values could not be calculated. Open table in a new tab R94F hGH was not selected based on similar changes in both the lactogenic (2.5-fold) and somatotrophic (3.8-fold) bioassays. In both proliferation assays L163E, although promoting some proliferation, did not yield curves that could be analyzed for ED50 values. Because Tyr164 is part of the structural binding epitopes (8Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), binding studies were performed to ensure that loss of biological activity wasn't a result of a loss of binding at site 1. Wild-type and Tyr164 hGHs were placed in competitive I125 binding assay, and the relative Kd values were determined to be 0.047 and 0.070 nm, respectively. Leu163 Mutants—Because Leu163 hGH shows a highly altered structure by spectroscopic studies and was inactive in both the FDC-P1 somatotrophic and lactogenic bioassays, it was determined that the residue was critical to the global structure of the protein. To resolve the role of Leu163, more conservative amino acid substitutions, alanine and phenylalanine, were prepared. Both of these mutant proteins had full activity in the FDC-P1 somatotrophic assay. In the FDC-P1 lactogenic assay they showed a 3.5- and a 9.0-fold loss with alanine or phenylalanine, respectively (Table II). Therefore, this residue was also included in the motif that functionally couples site 1 to site 2.Table IILactogenic and somatotrophic activities of Leu163 mutants of hGHFDC-P1 lactogenic assayFDC-P1 somatotrophic assayED50Relative fold loss of activityED50Relative fold loss of activitynMnMWT hGH1.761.000.07121.00L163A hGH6.143.490.1301.83L163F hGH13.89.000.2353.30L163E hGH***a***, values could not be calculated.*********a ***, values could not be calculated. Open table in a new tab The residues identified to be biologically relevant by mutagenesis experiments are rearranged to form a more tightly packed structure upon binding to the lactogenic receptor (Fig. 7, Protein Data Bank codes 1HGU and 1BP3) (7Chantalat L. Jones N. Korber F. Navaza J. Pavlovsky A.G. Protein and Peptide Letters. 1995; 2: 333-340Google Scholar, 8Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Large changes include a structuring of mini-helix 1, an extension of helix 2 by structuring of the 2–3 loop, and a rotation of helix 3 with respect to helix 1. The mechanism proposed to drive the conformational change begins with Phe44. The lactogenic receptor binding at site 1 constrains Phe44 by promoting the formation of mini-helix 1, inserting Phe44 between Tyr160 and Tyr164 in the N terminus of helix 4. Phe44 insertion lengthens and subtly unwinds helix 4 relative to the helical axis. Helix 4 rotation is constrained C terminus to the disulfide bond at Cys165. Leu163 extends ∼180° away from the hydrophobic cluster of Phe44, Tyr160, and Tyr164. Lactogenic receptor binding promotes a subtle repositioning of Leu163 and interaction with the hydrophobic residue Leu93 located in the 2–3 loop. This association appears to be associated with the extension of helix 2 from residues in the 2–3 loop. This structuring also causes Tyr103, a site 2 determinant, to rotate toward site 2. Disruption of this mechanism is much more effective when mutations are made proximal to site 1, rather than site 2, as is seen in the ED50 values. F44E and Y164E, at the proximal end of the mechanism, have relative losses of activity of 83.8- and 86.5-fold, respectively. L93E and L163F at the distal end of the mechanism have relative losses in activity of 4.7- and 9.0-fold. A molecular graphics package (24Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39829) Google Scholar) was used to view the arrangement of residues in these regions in the lactogenic receptor-bound and -free forms of hGH (Fig. 7). All of the residues are found as a contiguous hydrophobic array lying between the receptor-binding sites. The residues form two hydrophobic clusters that are on either side of helix 4. The two clusters may interact, as each cluster contains residues on helix 4. Phe44, Leu157, Tyr160, and Tyr164 are located in hydrophobic cluster one, although Leu157 is not a member of the functional lactogenic motif. The second hydrophobic cluster contains Leu163, Val90, Leu93, Val96, and Phe97. Although each residue in the cluster was mutated to glutamic acid, only Leu163 and Leu93 reduced lactogenic activity. Using the crystal structure of hGH bound to one molecule of the lactogenic receptor (8Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), distances were measured from the two closest atoms in each residue pair, and a correlation between distance and loss of lactogenic activity was observed. Phe44 to Tyr164 and Phe44 to Tyr160 were the closest at 3.287 and 3.282 Å, respectively. Leu163 and Leu93 were next closest at 4.285 Å, whereas other residues in the hydrophobic clusters had distances greater than 7 Å. Distances were measured from the two closest atoms in each residue pair. Distances greater than 4.5 Å provide sufficient space for water, thus diminishing the disruption of the hydrophobic packing by the glutamic acid mutation. Therefore, residues that most closely articulate in these hydrophobic cores provide the greatest functional disruption when mutated. L163E hGH was the only mutant whose properties varied significantly in all three types of spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and biological activity, indicating that the mutation had altered the global folding of the protein. Accordingly, the somatotrophic assay also revealed a severe decrease in activity. The ED50 values could not be calculated for L163E hGH for either the lactogenic or somatotrophic assays. Interestingly, the somatotrophic assay curve showed several peaks and did manage to achieve 66% of the maximum response. The corruption of hydrophobic packing by replacing Leu163 with glutamic acid demonstrates the importance of packing in the interior of the protein for either lactogenic or somatotrophic activity. Loss of packing by replacement with a hydrophilic Glu resulted in a protein that assumes multiple conformations (as demonstrated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE), resulting in a protein that contains multiple transient folding states. The data for Leu163 shows that mutation to a glutamic acid created large disturbances in the structure of hGH and emphasizes the centrality of this hydrophobic residue for both protein stability and function. Unfortunately, due to the global consequences of this mutation, its membership in the hydrophobic motif that propagates a conformation change could not be either supported or dismissed based on this mutation alone. To further investigate this critical residue, the additional mutations (L163A and L163F) were prepared. Both of these mutations alter the steric properties at Leu163, without negating the hydrophobicity. This alteration in side chain affects the packing of the closely articulating residues of the second hydrophobic core. L163A had a modest 3.5-fold loss in lactogenic activity. This may be the result of a shorter side chain (loss of three carbons) offering less surface area for hydrophobic packing and may no longer be close enough to Leu93 to exert as strong of an effect. L163F had a loss of lactogenic activity of 9.0-fold and a somatotrophic loss of activity of 3.3-fold. This leucine to phenylalanine mutation increased the bulk (addition of three carbons) and likely prevented tight packing in the second hydrophobic cluster, or resulted in poor alignment of the helix 2 extension (residues 90–99). These two mutations provide evidence for including Leu163 in the lactogenic motif, as well as to support the argument for its centrality in maintaining the overall structure of hGH. Many of the mutantions studied in this work are located in the interior of hGH, making it important to establish that the mutants were folded correctly. This was verified in several ways. Full biological activity in the somatotrophic assays indicated that the structure had not been globally changed and that any local change only affected lactogenic activity. The various spectroscopic methods yielded more detailed information regarding the fold of the mutant proteins. Circular dichroism indicated that the helical structure was intact. The fluorescent spectra monitored the environment of the single tryptophan located in the hydrophobic core of the 4-helix bundle. This data indicated that the hydrophobic interior of the protein had not been disturbed. The 250:280 ratios in the UV spectra are important for evaluation of disulfide bond formation, as disulfide bonds absorb at 250 nm (whereas free cysteines do not). The absorbance of a disulfide bond at 250 nm is highly dependent on bond angle and tension (25Greenstein J.P. Winitz M. Chemistry of Amino Acids. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY1961: 1688-1723Google Scholar, 26Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 250:280 nm ratio is a measure of disulfide bond characteristics normalized to total protein concentration. The spectra indicate that although several of the mutants have disulfide bonds that are strained, all of the disulfide bonds are intact. R94F hGH serves as an interesting example. The large change in the 250/280 ratio indicates that the two disulfide bonds in R94F hGH are as strained as any of the mutations included within the motif. This single mutation only result in a 2.5- and 3.8-fold loss of lactogenic and somatotrophic activities, respectively, indicative of only modest structural disturbances. Therefore, the strains in disulfide bonds, although small, produce a large change in the 250 nm absorbance and are a sensitive probe for small mutation-induced structural changes. The shape of the dose-response curves from the FDC-P1 lactogenic bioassays are unlike typical bell-shaped dose-response curves. Several other papers have described the effects on biological and binding assays for hGH mutated within site 1 or site 2 (17Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.A. Wells J.A. DeMeyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinol. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hormones that activate via receptor dimerization are known to have bell-shaped dose-response curves. Mutations within site 1 that alter binding affinities either right or left shift both the agonist and the antagonist phases of the curve. This occurs because site 1 binding is involved in both the agonist and antagonist phases of the dose-response curves. Mutations in site 2 are indicated by modulations in the maximal biological response. The dose-response curves seen for the exosite mutations show a shift in the agonist phase without a concurrent and proportional shift in the antagonist phase. The maximal biological activity is difficult to discern in some cases, as the antagonist phase is reached before the agonist phase is complete. Because the antagonist phase represents a population of receptors that are predominantly in a 1:1 complex with hGH, the ID50 is representative of site 1 binding affinity. Therefore, a shift in the ED50 without a shift in the ID50 indicates that a loss of activity is not due to binding at site 1 (16Duda K.M. Brooks C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These curve shapes are consistent with the notion of an induced-fit model, where site 1 is always available for binding, but where site 2 requires binding at site 1 to induce the conformation change required to create site 2. Current theories for the mechanism of the sequential binding include a differential affinity model and a model in which free energy is provided through the stem-stem interactions of the two receptor molecules (17Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.A. Wells J.A. DeMeyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinol. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Pearce K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These models are not exclusive, and both play a role in receptor dimerization. We propose that the mechanism of the induced-fit model relies on a contiguous hydrophobic motif that propagates a site 1 binding-induced conformational change that orders and activates site 2. Such a model would complement the existing models to achieve a more complete mechanism of action. To conclude, we have found a unique motif that is required for the lactogenic activity of hGH but that is largely independent of somatotrophic action. Additionally, the concept of this type of motif may also be relevant in other ligand-receptor interactions among the proteins in the hGH superfamily and therefore be useful in the development of antagonists."
