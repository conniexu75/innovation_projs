https://openalex.org/W2009761723,"A retroviral vector system based on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was developed that, in contrast to a murine leukemia virus-based counterpart, transduced heterologous sequences into HeLa cells and rat fibroblasts blocked in the cell cycle, as well as into human primary macrophages. Additionally, the HIV vector could mediate stable in vivo gene transfer into terminally differentiated neurons. The ability of HIV-based viral vectors to deliver genes in vivo into nondividing cells could increase the applicability of retroviral vectors in human gene therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2093498435,"Angiogenesis is required for a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. The endothelial cell-specific mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Also, the expression of VEGF and its two receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR, is related to the formation of blood vessels in mouse and rat embryos. Mice homozygous for mutations that inactivate either receptor die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5. However, ligand(s) other than VEGF might activate such receptors. To assess the role of VEGF directly, we disrupted the VEGF gene in embryonic stem cells. Here we report the unexpected finding that loss of a single VEGF allele is lethal in the mouse embryo between days 11 and 12. Angiogenesis and blood-island formation were impaired, resulting in several developmental anomalies. Furthermore, VEGF-null embryonic stem cells exhibit a dramatically reduced ability to form tumours in nude mice."
https://openalex.org/W1974112332,"Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle. A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity. Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing, and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit (HD1) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library. As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p, these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2064310741,"Werner's syndrome (WS) is an inherited disease with clinical symptoms resembling premature aging. Early susceptibility to a number of major age-related diseases is a key feature of this disorder. The gene responsible for WS (known as WRN) was identified by positional cloning. The predicted protein is 1432 amino acids in length and shows significant similarity to DNA helicases. Four mutations in WS patients were identified. Two of the mutations are splice-junction mutations, with the predicted result being the exclusion of exons from the final messenger RNA. One of these mutations, which results in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein, was found in the homozygous state in 60 percent of Japanese WS patients examined. The other two mutations are nonsense mutations. The identification of a mutated putative helicase as the gene product of the WS gene suggests that defective DNA metabolism is involved in the complex process of aging in WS patients."

https://openalex.org/W2039405433,"Although steroid hormones are important for animal development, the physiological role of plant steroids is unknown. The Arabidopsis DET2 gene encodes a protein that shares significant sequence identity with mammalian steroid 5 alpha-reductases. A mutation of glutamate 204, which is absolutely required for the activity of human steroid reductase, abolishes the in vivo activity of DET2 and leads to defects in light-regulated development that can be ameliorated by application of a plant steroid, brassinolide. Thus, DET2 may encode a reductase in the brassinolide biosynthetic pathway, and brassinosteroids may constitute a distinct class of phytohormones with an important role in light-regulated development of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1963863239,"Kinesin is a two-headed motor protein that powers organelle transport along microtubules. Many ATP molecules are hydrolysed by kinesin for each diffusional encounter with the microtubule. Here we report the development of a new assay in which the processive movement of individual fluorescently labelled kinesin molecules along a microtubule can be visualized directly; this observation is achieved by low-background total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in the absence of attachment of the motor to a cargo (for example, an organelle or bead). The average distance travelled after a binding encounter with a microtubule is 600 nm, which reflects a approximately 1% probability of detachment per mechanical cycle. Surprisingly, processive movement could still be observed at salt concentrations as high as 0.3 M NaCl. Truncated kinesin molecules having only a single motor domain do not show detectable processive movement, which is consistent with a model in which kinesin's two force-generating heads operate by a hand-over-hand mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2007395018,"Many retinal functions are circadian, but in most instances the location of the clock that drives the rhythm is not known. Cultured neural retinas of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) exhibited circadian rhythms of melatonin synthesis for at least 5 days at 27 degrees celsius. The rhythms were entrained by light cycles applied in vitro and were free-running in constant darkness. Retinas from hamsters homozygous for the circadian mutation tau, which shortens the free-running period of the circadian activity rhythm by 4 hours, showed a shortened free-running period of melatonin synthesis. The mammalian retina contains a genetically programmed circadian oscillator that regulates its synthesis of melatonin."

https://openalex.org/W1996764508,"During aroused states of the brain, electroencephalographic activity is characterized by fast, irregular fluctuations of low amplitude, which are thought to reflect desynchronization of neuronal activity. This phenomenon seems at odds with the proposal that synchronization of cortical responses may play an important role in the processing of sensory signals. Here, activation of the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), an effective way to “desynchronize the electroencephalogram,” was shown to facilitate oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range and to enhance the stimulus-specific synchronization of neuronal spike responses in the visual cortex of cats."

https://openalex.org/W1989817592,"A GENERAL property of signal transduction pathways is that prolonged stimulation decreases responsiveness, a phenomenon termed desensitization. Yeast cells stimulated with mating phero-mone activate a heterotrimeric G-protein-linked, MAP-kinase-dependent signalling pathway that induces Gl-phase cell-cycle arrest and morphological differentiation (reviewed in refs 1, 2). Eventually the cells desensitize to pheromone and resume growth3. Genetic studies have demonstrated the relative importance of a desensitization mechanism that uses the SST2 gene product, Sst2p4–7. Here we identify a mammalian gene family termed RGS (for regulator of G-protein signalling) that encodes structural and functional homologues of Sst2p. Introduction of RGS family members into yeast blunts signal transduction through the pheromone-response pathway. Like SST2 (refs 8–10), they negatively regulate this pathway at a point upstream or at the level of the G protein. The RGS family members also markedly impair MAP kinase activation by mammalian G-protein-linked receptors, indicating the existence and importance of an SST2-like desensitization mechanism in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020200324,"Benefit-cost analysis can play an important role in legislative and regulatory policy debates on protecting and improving health, safety, and the natural environment. Although formal benefit-cost analysis should not be viewed as either necessary or sufficient for designing sensible public policy, it can provide an exceptionally useful framework for consistently organizing disparate information, and in this way, it can greatly improve the process and, hence, the outcome of policy analysis. If properly done, benefit-cost analysis can be of great help to agencies participating in the development of environmental, health, and safety regulations, and it can likewise be useful in evaluating agency decision-making and in shaping statutes."
https://openalex.org/W2034092404,"1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase [also known as beta(1-->3) glucan synthase] is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the synthesis of 1,3-beta-linked glucan, a major structural component of the yeast cell wall. Temperature-sensitive mutants in the essential Rho-type guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), Rho1p, displayed thermolabile glucan synthase activity, which was restored by the addition of recombinant Rho1p. Glucan synthase from mutants expressing constitutively active Rho1p did not require exogenous guanosine triphosphate for activity. Rho1p copurified with beta(1-->3)glucan synthase and associated with the Fks1p subunit of this complex in vivo. Both proteins were localized predominantly at sites of cell wall remodeling. Therefore, it appears that Rho1p is a regulatory subunit of beta(1-->3)glucan synthase."

https://openalex.org/W2033133245,"The enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the major structural component of the yeast cell wall, β(1→3)-D-glucan synthase (also known as 1,3-β-glucan synthase), requires a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein for activity. The GTP binding protein was identified as Rho1p. The rho1 mutants were defective in GTP stimulation of glucan synthase, and the defect was corrected by addition of purified or recombinant Rho1p. A protein missing in purified preparations from a rho1 strain was identified as Rho1p. Rho1p also regulates protein kinase C, which controls a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Experiments with a dominant positive PKC1 gene showed that the two effects of Rho1p are independent of each other. The colocalization of Rho1p with actin patches at the site of bud emergence and the role of Rho1p in cell wall synthesis emphasize the importance of Rho1p in polarized growth and morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W4241331546,"THE electrical resistivity of mammalian tissues varies widely1–5 and is correlated with physiological function6–8. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can be used to probe such variations in vivo, and offers a non-invasive means of imaging the internal conductivity distribution of the human body9–11. But the computational complexity of EIT has severe practical limitations, and previous work has been restricted to considering image reconstruction as an essentially two-dimensional problem10,12. This simplification can limit significantly the imaging capabilities of EIT, as the electric currents used to determine the conductivity variations will not in general be confined to a two-dimensional plane13. A few studies have attempted three-dimensional EIT image reconstruction14,15, but have not yet succeeded in generating images of a quality suitable for clinical applications. Here we report the development of a three-dimensional EIT system with greatly improved imaging capabilities, which combines our 64-electrode data-collection apparatus16 with customized matrix inversion techniques. Our results demonstrate the practical potential of EIT for clinical applications, such as lung or brain imaging and diagnostic screening8."

https://openalex.org/W2089298476,"Many of the cell fate decisions in precursor B cells and more mature B cells are controlled by membrane immunoglobulin (Ig)M heavy chain (mu) and the Ig alpha-Ig beta signal transducers. The role of Ig beta in regulating early B cell development was examined in mice that lack Ig beta (Ig beta-/-). These mice had a complete block in B cell development at the immature CD43+B220+ stage. Immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments rearranged, but variable (VH) to DJH recombination and immunoglobulin messenger RNA expression were compromised. These experiments define an unexpected, early requirement for Ig(beta) to produce B cells that can complete VDJH recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1984421966,"Vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) histogenesis depends on glia-guided migration of postmitotic neurons to form neuronal laminae. Previous studies have established that the neuronal protein astrotactin functions in murine cerebellar granule cell migration in vitro. The gene encoding astrotactin predicts a protein with three epidermal growth factor repeats and two fibronectin type III repeats. Astrotactin messenger RNA is expressed in postmitotic neuronal precursors in the cerebellum, hippocampus, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb, where migration establishes laminar structures. Fab fragments of antibodies to a recombinant astrotactin peptide blocked migration of cerebellar granule neurons in vitro along astroglial fibers. Transfection of astrotactin complementary DNA into 3T3 cells indicated that astrotactin acts as a ligand for neuron-glia binding during neuronal migration."

https://openalex.org/W2080055531,"Very few of the enzymes required for eukaryotic precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing have been identified. Ribonuclease (RNase) MRP was characterized as a nuclease that cleaves mitochondrial replication primers, but it is predominantly nucleolar. Previous genetic evidence revealed that this ribonucleoprotein is required, directly or indirectly, for cleavage of the yeast pre-rRNA in vivo at site A3. Here, an in vitro processing system that accurately reproduces this cleavage is described. Biochemical purification and the use of extracts depleted of the MRP RNA demonstrate that endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-rRNA is directly mediated by RNase MRP. This establishes a role for RNase MRP in the nucleolus."

https://openalex.org/W2012058446,"Nitric oxide (NO) is associated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of particular importance in infections caused by intracellular pathogens. An insertion mutation in the metL gene of Salmonella typhimurium conferred specific hypersusceptibility to S-nitrosothiol NO-donor compounds and attenuated virulence of the organism in mice. The metL gene product catalyzes two proximal metabolic steps required for homocysteine biosynthesis. S-Nitrosothiol resistance was restored by exogenous homocysteine or introduction of the metL gene on a plasmid. Measurement of expression of the homocysteine-sensitive metH gene indicated that S-nitrosothiols may directly deplete intracellular homocysteine. Homocysteine may act as an endogenous NO antagonist in diverse processes including infection, atherosclerosis, and neurologic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2054698310,"The LAG3 protein has several features in common with CD4, suggesting that it may be important in controlling T cell reactivity. However, mice with a Lag3 null mutation have now been shown to exhibit a defect in the natural killer cell, rather than the T cell, compartment. Killing of certain tumor targets by natural killer cells from these mice was inhibited or even abolished, whereas lysis of cells displaying major histocompatibility complex class I disparities remained intact. It appears that LAG3 is a receptor or coreceptor that defines different modes of natural killing."
https://openalex.org/W2029638795,"The mammalian sensory neocortex exhibits experience-dependent plasticity such that neurons modify their response properties according to changes in sensory experience. The synaptic plasticity mechanism of long-term potentiation requiring calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CaMKII) could underlie experience-dependent plasticity. Plasticity in adult mice can be induced by changes in the patterns of tactile input to the barrel cortex. This response is strongly depressed in adult mice that lack the gene encoding alpha-CaMKII, although adolescent animals are unaffected. Thus, alpha-CaMKII is necessary either for the induction or for the expression of plasticity in adult mice."

https://openalex.org/W2007701960,"The neocortex receives information about the environment and the rest of the brain through pathways from the thalamus. These pathways have frequency-dependent properties that can strongly influence their effect on the neocortex. In 1943 Morison and Dempsey described ""augmenting responses,"" a form of short-term plasticity in some thalamocortical pathways that is triggered by 8- to 15-hertz activation. Results from anesthetized rats showed that the augmenting response is initiated by pyramidal cells in layer V. The augmenting response was also observed in awake, unrestrained animals and was found to be dynamically modulated by their behavioral state."

https://openalex.org/W1970062083,"The bacterial transposon Tn7 usually moves through a cut-and-paste mechanism whereby the transposon is excised from a donor site and joined to a target site to form a simple insertion. The transposon was converted to a replicative element that generated plasmid fusions in vitro and cointegrate products in vivo. This switch was a consequence of the separation of 5'- and 3'-end processing reactions of Tn7 transposition as demonstrated by the consequences of a single amino acid alteration in an element-encoded protein essential for normal cut-and-paste transposition. The mutation specifically blocked cleavage of the 5' strand at each transposon end without disturbing the breakage and joining on the 3' strand, producing a fusion (the Shapiro Intermediate) that resulted in replicative transposition. The ability of Tn7 recombination products to serve as substrates for both the limited gap repair required to complete cut-and-paste transposition and the extensive DNA replication involved in cointegrate formation suggests a remarkable plasticity in Tn7's recruitment of host repair and replication functions."

https://openalex.org/W2011805419,Fullerenes (C60 and C70) in the Sudbury impact structure contain trapped helium with a 3He/4He ratio of 5.5 x 10(-4) to 5.9 x 10(-4). The 3He/4He ratio exceeds the accepted solar wind value by 20 to 30 percent and is higher by an order of magnitude than the maximum reported mantle value. Terrestrial nuclear reactions or cosmic-ray bombardment are not sufficient to generate such a high ratio. The 3He/4He ratios in the Sudbury fullerenes are similar to those found in meteorites and in some interplanetary dust particles. The implication is that the helium within the C60 molecules at Sudbury is of extraterrestrial origin.
