https://openalex.org/W1555121428,"(-)-Norepinephrine and other catecholamines inhibit basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities by 35 to 60% in homogenates of NG108-15 neuroblastoma x gloma hybrid cells and markedly reduce adenosine 3'35:'-monophosphate levels of intact cells, but do not affect guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels. The specificity of the NG108-15 receptor for ligands is that of an alpha receptor, possibly a presynaptic alpha 2 receptor. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase by norepinephrine is reversed by alpha receptor antagonists such as dihydroergotamine or phentolamine, but not by the beta receptor antagonist propranolol. The effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity initially is dependent on GTP; half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity by norepinephrine is obtained with 0.2 micron GTP. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by norepinephrine is reduced by 10 mM NaF and is abolished by 0.05 mM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Inhibitions of NG108-15 adenylate cyclase mediated by alpha receptors, opiate receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are not additive; this suggests that the three species of receptors can be functionally coupled to the same adenylate cyclase molecules or molecules regulating the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2001769819,Addition of acetate to a stationary phase culture of Escherichia coli in glycerol mineral salts medium containing phosphorus-32-labeled orthophosphate results in rapid loss of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity and concomitant incorporation of phosphorus-32 into the enzyme. This is the first example of protein phosphorylation in a bacterium in which the endogenous substrate for the protein kinase has been identified.

https://openalex.org/W1525790461,"A siderophore (microbial iron transport compound) was isolated from low iron cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens B6. The substance was characterized as a threonyl peptide of spermidine acylated with 3 residues of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the carbonyl group of 1 residue of the latter participating in an oxazoline ring with the beta-hydroxyl of the threonine moiety. The compound, N-[3-(2,3-dihydroxybenzamido)propyl]-N-[4-(2,3-dihydroxybenzamido)butyl]-2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-trans-5-methyl-oxazoline-4-carboxamide, was given the trivial name agrobactin. Exposure to acid opened the oxazoline ring to afford agrobactin A. Ferric agrobactin A and agrobactin A itself, but not agrobactin or its ferric complex, had some capacity to feed iron to enterobactin-deficient strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Agrobactin was produced by A. tumefaciens in response to iron deficiency and was able to reverse the iron starvation in this organism precipitated by the presence of a ferric complexing agent not utilized by the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1560509170,"The transport of ATP out of mitochondria and uptake of ADP and Pi into the matrix are coupled to the uptake of one proton (Klingenberg, M., and Rottenberg, H. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 73, 125--130). According to the chemiosmotic hypothesis of oxidative phosphorylation this coupling of nucleotide and Pi transport to proton transport implies that the P/O ratio for the synthesis and transport of ATP to the external medium is less than the P/O ratio for the synthesis of ATP inside mitochondria. A survey of previous determinations of the P/O ratio of intact mitochondria showed little convincing evidence in support of the currently accepted values of 3 with NADH-linked substrates and 2 with succinate. We have measured P/O ratios in rat liver mitochondria by the ADP pulse method and by 32 Pi esterification, measuring oxygen uptake with an oxygen electrode, and find values close to 2 with beta-hydroxybutyrate as substrate and 1.3 with succinate as substrate in the presence of rotenone to inhibit NADH oxidation. These values were largely independent of pH, temperature, Mg2+ ion concentration, Pi concentration, ADP pulse size, or amount of mitochondria used. We suggest that these are the true values of the P/O ratio for ATP synthesis and transport by mitochondria, and that previously reported higher values resulted from errors in the determination of oxygen uptake and the use of substrates which lead to ATP synthesis by succinate thiokinase."

https://openalex.org/W1532179928,"The mechanism of action of bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase. Aalpha (peptidyl-L-amino acid hydrolase; EC 3.4.12.2) has been investigated by application of cryoenzymologic methods. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis of the specific ester substrate O-(trans-p-chlorocinnamoyl)-L-beta-phenyllactate have been carried out with both the native and the Co2+-substituted enzyme in the 25 to –45 degrees C temperature range. In the –25 to –45 degrees C temperature range with enzyme in excess, a biphasic reaction is observed for substrate hydrolysis characterized by rate constants for the fast (kf) and the slow (ks) processes. In Arrhenius plots, ks extrapolates to kcat at 25 degrees C for both enzymes in aqueous solution, indicating that the same catalytic rate-limiting step is observed. The slow process is analyzed for both metal enzymes, as previously reported (Makinen, M. W., Yamamura, K., and Kaiser, E. T. (1976) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 3882-3886), to involve the deacylation of a mixed anhydride acyl-enzyme intermediate. Near –60 degrees C the acyl-enzyme intermediate of both metal enzymes can be stabilized for spectral characterization. The pH and temperature dependence of ks reveals a catalytic ionizing group with a metal ion-dependent shift in pKa and an enthalpy of ionization of 7.2 kcal/mol for the native enzyme and 6.2 kcal/mol for the Co2+ enzyme. These parameters identify the ionizing catalytic group as the metal-bound water molecule. Extrapolation of the pKa data to 25 degrees C indicates that this ionization coincides with that observed in the acidic limb of the pH profile of log(kcat/Km(app)) for substrate hydrolysis under steady state conditions. The results indicate that in the esterolytic reaction of carboxypeptidase. A deacylation of the mixed anhydride intermediate is catalyzed by a metal-bound hydroxide group."

https://openalex.org/W1598690553,"We have studied the effects of adenosine 3‘:5‘-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase on the phosphorylative and functional modification of bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. Incubation of partially purified tyrosine hydroxylase with cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of [gamma32P]ATP and 5 micron cAMP led to a 3- to 5-fold activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and to incorporation of [32P]phosphate into protein. When tyrosine hydroxylase preparations activated by exposure to enzymatic phosphorylating conditions were analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel electrofocusing, the radioactivity of 32P was coincident with the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, suggesting incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into tyrosine hydroxylase. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase preparation in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that the 60,000-dalton polypeptide subunit of tyrosine hydroxylase served as the phosphate acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1488892368,"Experiments were performed to determine if catecholamines can regulate control points in the gluconeogenic pathway, such as mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation and pyruvate kinase activity, via an alpha-adrenergic, adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-independent mechanism. Of a number of alpha agonists tested, only norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine caused an increase in mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. The effects of catecholamines on pyruvate carboxylation were not attenuated by 1-propranolol which abolishes changes in cyclic nucleotide levels but were blocked by alpha antagonists such as ergotamine, phenoxybenzamine, and phentolamine. Time course experiments demonstrated that the effects of catecholamines on the mitochondria and on carbohydrate metabolism correlated temporally with the concentration of epinephrine in the medium but not with the small changes in adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. The effects of catecholamines appeared to require extracellular Ca2+ ion. The observation that catecholamines do not increase gluconeogenesis to the same extent as glucagon was not due to a differential effect on mitochondrial CO2 fixation. Rather, catecholamines caused a smaller inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity than did glucagon. The effects of catecholamines on pyruvate kinase also appeared to be mediated by an alpha-adrenergic, adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1516749868,"The rat hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturation decreased by 3.7-fold in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats increased the enzyme activity by 7-fold. In marked contrast to glucose administration, fructose feeding in diabetic rats resulted in 20-fold stimulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturation, although both carbohydrates stimulated stearoyl-CoA desaturation in normal rats. Measurement of the microsomal electron transfer components showed no significant changes in the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase activity or in the concentration of cytochrome b5. However, the activity of the terminal desaturase changed in a parallel fashion as the amount of terminal desaturase reflect changes in the overall desaturation. Supplementation of various microsomes with the saturating amount of purified terminal desaturase resulted in the formation of similar amounts of catalytically active complex and increased the stearoyl-CoA desaturation to the same level suggesting that the changes in the amount of terminal desaturase reflect changes in the overall desaturation. The results support the suggestion that both insulin and the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism are involved in the regulation of terminal desaturase."

https://openalex.org/W1534116382,"The binding of nucleoside triphosphates to rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been determined in 0.05 M phosphate buffers by changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence and by direct binding measurements. These experiments have been performed over a wide range of pH, temperature, and effector concentration. Quenching of protein fluorescence is shown to measure binding of nucleotides to a site which is not the active site but rather a site responsible for inhibition of the kinetic activity. This site is relatively specific for either ATP or MgATP with free ATP binding about 10-fold more tightly than MgATP. A model to describe binding to this site as a function of pH and temperature is proposed. This model assumes that the apparent affinity for ATP is determined by protonation of two ionizable groups (per subunit) and that ATP binds exclusively to protonated enzyme forms. Several ligands which affect the apparent affinity for nucleotide binding at the inhibitory site act by shifting the apparent pK of the ionizable groups. NH4+ and citrate do not influence nucleotide binding to the inhibitory site. At pH 6.9 in 0.05 M phosphate, low concentrations of MgATP or MgGTP enhance the protein fluorescence due to binding at the active site. The fluorescence studies and direct binding studies show that there is one active site and one inhibitory site per subunit. As described elsewhere (Pettigrew, D. W., and Frieden, C. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3623-3627), there is a third nucleotide binding site on each subunit which is specific for cAMP, AMP, and ADP."

https://openalex.org/W1993421181,"When incubated in a calcium-free medium, isolated rat fasciculata cells showed neither an increase in the concentration of guanocine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) nor an increase in corticosterone production in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In response to submaximum and maximum steroidogenic concentrations of ACTH, corticosterone formation was directly proportional to increases in calcium concentration ranging from 0 to 2.5 mM. Higher concentration of calcium, however, inhibited maximal ACTH-induced steroidogenesis. In the absence of ACTH, calcium did not stimulate cyclic GMP accumulation and corticosterone formation. ACTH-induced corticosterone synthesis, preceded by an increase in cyclic GMP, was restored when ACTH and calcium were both present in the medium. Cyclic GMP or dibutryl cyclic GMP-induced steroidogenesis was substantially reduced in the absence of calcium, but in contrast to the ACTH effect a significant amount of corticosterone formation occurred without calcium. It is proposed that at the physiological concentrations of the hormone, calcium regulates the transduction of information between hormone receptors and guanylate cyclase."

Some of the physical properties of the enzyme include: a Stokes radius of 26.0 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 2.71 S, a diffusion coefficient of 8.20 X 10(-7) CM2/S, a frictional ratio of 1.23, and an isoelectric point of pH 4.5.

https://openalex.org/W1586801439,"Intraperitoneal injection of inorganic 32P into rats results in the incorporation of 32P into acetyl-CoA carboxylase without inactivation of the enzyme. Administration of epinephrine stimulates 32P incorporation and results in enzyme inactivation. Incubation of epididymal fat tissues with inorganic 32P also results in incorporation of 32P into carboxylase. This 32P incorporation reaches a maximum level in 3 h and it has no effect on carboxylase activity. Administration of epinephrine at the time of maximum phosphorylation (3 h) results in further phosphorylation and inactivation of carboxylase. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent which inhibits epinephrine action, blocks both the epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylation and the inactivation of the carboxylase. However, propranolol has no effect on that component of the phosphorylation which is unrelated to enzyme inactivation. These results establish that phosphorylation of carboxylase occurs in vivo at two different sites, only one of which results in enzyme inactivation. The phosphorylation site associated with enzyme inactivation is hormonally controlled."

https://openalex.org/W1534845879,"Results are presented which demonstrate that the 2-electron-reduced lipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.4.3) from Escherichia coli is a mixture of species. In catalysis, this enzyme cycles between the oxidized and the 2-electron-reduced forms. Three spectrally distinct species are indicated in the pH range 5.8 to 8.0 from measurements of the fluorescence and visible spectra during dithionite titration. These have the following properties. 1) A fluorescent form where the FAD is oxidized and the active center disulfide is reduced. This species is unable to charge transfer and predominates at low pH. 2) A form in which there is a facile charge transfer between thiolate and FAD (epsilon530 - 3300 M-1 cm-1). This species, which predominates at high pH, is very similar to the 2-electron-reduced pig heart enzyme at high pH. 3) A form where the flavin is reduced and the disulfide is oxidized. The spectra of these three species have been determined. Anaerobic reduction of the enzyme with stoichiometric dihydrolipoamide leads to the formation of the charge transfer species in less than 1 s. Subsequently, in a process requiring about 12 s, the charge transfer complex relaxes to a mixture of species observed in dithionite titrations. The pH dependence of the oxidation-reduction potential, the fluorescence, the charge transfer absorbance (530 nm), and the 455 nm absorbance indicates the presence of a base which is able to stabilize the thiolate anion generated upon reduction of the active center disulfide. The pH dependence of the oxidation-reduction potential indicates that the reduction of the enzyme by dihydrolipoamide involves 2 protons as well as 2 electrons. These potentials are somewhat more positive than those determined for the pig heart enzyme and thus explain the ready further reduction of the E. coli enzyme to the 4-electron-reduced enzyme. The pH-independent formation constant (Kf) for the disproportionation of 2-electron-reduced enzyme (2EH2 in equilibrium E + EH4) is about 55 as calculated from dithionite titrations. Therefore at equilibrium there is about 80% 2-electron-reduced enzyme, 1-% oxidized enzyme, and 10% 4-electron-reduced enzyme. The spectrum of fully formed 2-electron-reduced enzyme has been calculated at several pH values from these data. The results confirm the previous conclusion that lipoamide dehydrogenase from E. coli is qualitatively similar to the pig heart enzyme, differing only in certain quantitative features such as the distribution between the various forms at the 2-electron-reduced level."
https://openalex.org/W1633691276,"gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase purified following solubilization with Triton X-100 can associate with single-layered [14C]lecithin vesicles. Enzyme activity and radiolabeled vesicles were shown to co-migrate during Sepharose 4B chromatography and isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation. The enzyme-vesicle complex exhibits a density corresponding to that of a single enzyme molecule bound to a single vesicle, gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase purified following a solubilization with papain does not bind to vesicles. In addition, papain treatment of vesicles containing the Triton-purified transpeptidase results in the release of 95% of the transpeptidase activity without release of internally trapped [3H]sucrose. The released transpeptidase is chromatographically identical to the papain-purified transpeptidase. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase activity associated with both native membranes and with lecithin vesicles exhibits a temperature-induced transition in its energy of activation. In contrast, the proteolytic- and detergent-solubilized forms of the enzyme exhibit a single energy of activation over the entire temperature range. These results suggest that gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase binding to vesicles is due to a papain sensitive sequence of amino acids and that the enzyme.vesicle complex closely approximates the interaction and orientation of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase with brush border membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1561445718,"A Ca2+-triggered luciferin-binding protein (BP-LH2) from the bioluminescent marine coelenterate, Renilla reniformis, has been purified by conventional methods. One kilogram of processed animals yields approximately 2.7 mg of pure protein with an overall yield of 55%. Physicochemical studies show that BP-LH2 is a globular protein containing one single polypeptide chain with one disulfide bond. Ultracentrifugation studies, amino acid analysis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis show that BP-LH2 has an average molecular weight of 18,500. BP-LH2 has a Stokes radius of 23 A, a sedimentation coefficient, S020,w, of 2.3 S, and an isoelectric point of 4.3. The acidic nature of the protein was confirmed by amino acid analysis, which showed that 27% of the residues are acidic. The protein contains no carbohydrate, phosphate, or tryptophan. There is one noncovalently bound molecule of coelenterate type luciferin resulting in distinct protein spectral properties with absorption maxima at 276 nm (epsilon 0.1% 276 = 1.31) and 446 nm (episoln 0.1% 446 = 0.47) and a fluorescence emission at 520 nm (uncorrected). In the presence of Ca2+, BP-LH2 will react with Renilla luciferase to give the characteristic in vitro blue bioluminescence. Ca2+ binding produces a distinct change in the spectral properties of BP-LH2 including a 4-fold enhancement of tyrosine fluorescence at 332 nm and a 5-fold fluorescence enhancement at 520 nm. In addition, the visible absorption maximum shifts from 446 nm to 420 nm. The fluorescence enhancement at 320 nm occurs over the range from 1 to 10 micrometer Ca2+. BP-LH2 has two Ca2+-binding sites with an estimated Kd of 0.02 micrometer, in 10 muM Tris at pH 7.2. BP-LH2 was compared to several well studied Ca2+-binding proteins and was found to possess similar Ca2+-binding and physicochemical properties. This study clearly demonstrates that BP-LH2 is capable of triggering a bioluminescent flash in response to an intracellular Ca2+ transient."
https://openalex.org/W1569045824,"The rate constants which characterize the formation and breakdown of the noncovalent (E.P) and covalent (E-P) enzyme-phosphate intermediates on the alkaline phosphatase reaction pathway are known to be sensitive to the nature of the metal ion bound to the enzyme. 31P NMR saturation transfer has been demonstrated to provide a simple and sensitive method for measuring the metal ion dependence of these rates under equilibrium conditions. When the native Zn2+ was replaced by Cd2+, the 31P NMR spectrum at high pH revealed a new resonance at 12.6 ppm which has been assigned to the noncovalent enzyme.phosphate complex. Reconstituting the enzyme with enriched 113Cd2+ caused this unusually downfield-shifted resonance to appear as a doublet due to 113Cd-31P spin coupling (2J31P-O-113Cd = 30 Hz). This result provides the first unequivocal evidence for direct metal-phosphate interaction in alkaline phosphatase."

Both enzymes were inactivated and labeled on treatment with tritiated sodium borohydride and gave, upon subsequent hydrolysis, a radioactive acid. The previously reported identity of this acid as 2-hydroxybutanoic acid was disproved by several criteria. Other hydroxy acids were also proved to be different from the radioactive acid derived from urocanase. A large portion of the radioactive material from P. putida was found to be nicotinic acid by 1H NMR spectroscopy, gas-liquid chromatography of its methyl ester, and co-crystallization with authentic reference compounds both as the acid and as the hydrazide. A significant portion of the radioactive material derived from beef liver urocanase also co-crystallized with nicotinic acid. Sodium borohydride-treated inactive urocanase was partially reactivated by light. The action spectrum of the photoreactivation showed a maximum at 330 nm. Treatment of urocanase with sodium borodeuteride followed by hydrolysis afforded a sample of nicotinic acid which carried deuterium mainly in position 6. Both the reversible reducibility of urocanase and its action spectrum of photoreactivation suggest that urocanase contains an enzyme-bound nicotinamide nucleotide molecule which is essential for enzymic activity."

It also forms a complex with cytochrome oxidase with heme ratio of 1:1. This cytochrome c1.oxidase complex has been purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and is stable in media of high ionic strength (greater than 0.1 M) but dissociates as the pH deviates from neutral. The purified cytochrome c1 aggregates to an oligomer, presumably a pentamer. No agent has been found to depolymerize isolated c1 without denaturation. However, in the cytochrome c1.oxidase complex, these two cytochromes apparently were depolymerized to form smaller aggregates, if not monomeric units, as judged by sedimentation behavior. Cytochrome c1 also forms a ternary complex with cytochrome c and oxidase in the heme ratio of 1:1:1. This complex can be prepared by any of the following four methods: (i) c1 + c + oxidase: (ii) c1.c complex + oxidase; (iii) c1 + c.oxidase complex: or (iv) c + c1.oxidase complex. The mode of formation of these complexes is all from pure protein-protein interactions. Cytochrome c1 is also incorporated into phospholipid vesicles and these vesicles show about 200 molecules of phospholipid/cytochrome c1 in terms of heme.

https://openalex.org/W1484053846,"It is shown that natural abundance 13C NMR spectroscopy can be used to determine the structures and relative amounts of chemically modified forms of a histidine residue of a peptide or protein. The unfractionated product of the reaction of N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine with bromoacetate yields four resonances of nonprotonated aromatic carbons. These resonances are assigned (on a one-to-one basis) to C gamma of the intact amino acid, the two monocarboxymethylated derivatives (at N delta1 and N epsilon2), and the dicarboxymethylated derivative. The effect of pH on the chemical shift of C gamma is characteristic for each of the four species. This property is used to study the carboxymethylation of His-15 of hen egg white lysozyme upon treatment with iodoacetate. With the use of various reaction conditions, His 15 is carboxymethylated in detectable quantities only at N epsilon2. The spectra of the various reaction mixtures indicate which conditions are best for maximizing the yield of this derivative. A comparison of the spectrum of chromatographically pure [N epsilon2-carboxymethylhistidine-15]lysozyme with that of the intact protein indicates that the chemical modification does not significantly affect the conformation of the protein (at least in the regions of all aromatic amino acid residues)."

The compound causes both the reversible and irreversible phases of aggregation of human blood platelets at concentrations similar to those required for similar phases of aggregation by ADP itself. The spin-labeled ADP also rivals ADP as a substrate for pyruvate kinase. The interaction of intact human blood platelets and of isolated platelet membranes with the platelet-aggregating spin-labeled derivatives of ADP has been studied. The dramatic decrease in the ESR signal of the spin label is primarily due to chemical reduction of the nitroxide, rather than immobilization of the label. When platelets and spin-labeled ADP are mixed, a rapid burst of nitroxide reduction occurs, followed by a much slower reduction similar in time course to that seen for other spin labels. The rapid burst of reduction, but not the slow reduction, is inhibited by adenosine, an inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and by sulfhydryl-blocking agents. Experiments conducted with Ellman's reagent and platelet membranes or washed platelets revealed a 10 to 30% increase in the number of reactive membrane sulfhydryl groups when ADP was present. These results indicate that there is an increase in the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups on the platelet surface when platelets or membranes are stimulated by ADP."

Evidence suggests that NADH and NADPH support oxidation of both substrates via separate routes of electron transfer. Thus, 10 micron cytochrome c will inhibit NADPH-supported oxidation to 40 to 50% of control activity leaving NADH-supported oxidation unaffected. Also, treatment of microsomes with subtilisin diminishes NADPH-supported oxidation to 10 to 30% of control activity for either substrate to 70 to 90% of control activity while NADH-supported oxidative activity is virtually unaffected. Studies on the oxidase activities and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase as well as NADH-ferricyanide reductase have shown marked differences in activity in the presence of inhibitors. Thus, 9 mM 2'-AMP inhibits NADPH-cytochrome c reductase to 10 to 20% of control activity while NADPH-supported oxidative demethyl ation and deformylation are essentially unchanged. Mersalyl at 15 to 25 nmol/mg of microsomal protein inhibits both reductases to 20 to 40% of control activity; oxidative demethylation is unaffected and oxidative deformylation stimulated slightly when NADPH is used. Finally, antibody to NADPH-cytochrome c reductase inhibits oxidase activity for either substrate to 70 to 90% of control activity while reductase activity is inhibited to 10 to 30% of control activity."

Resonances due to histidine C-2 protons were observed over the full pH range for 3 of the residues; such resonances for the remaining 2 histidine residues broadened out as the pH was increased. Resonances due to histidine C-4 protons were also observed for 2 of the residues. The titration curves for both proteins were identical within experimental error. Resonances were assigned by comparison with histidine NMR titrations in ribonucleases from other species. Histidine 105, immediately adjacent to the site of attachment of a heterosaccharide side chain, has a C-2 proton chemical shift and pK that are insensitive to the large alteration in the bulk of the carbohydrate side chain. The chemical shifts of the C-2 proton of histidine 48 and of the C-4 proton of histidine 80, histidine residues that are close to one another and to another heterosaccharide side chain, show a similar insensitivity. The observations are direct evidence in support of the thesis that the heterosaccharides in porcine ribonuclease project away from the surface of the protein into the solution environment."
