Thus confusions in recall occurred mainly between B, C, P, T and V and between F, M, N, S and X. Subsequent work (for example, Wickelgren3) has confirmed and extended these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2013466291,"An olfactorily induced pregnancy failure in recently inseminated laboratory mice has been shown to result from enforced cohabitation with a strange or alien male, following which the female would return to oestrus1. The females were exposed for a period of 12, 24, 48, or 72 h, with maximum pregnancy failure (approximately 80 per cent) occurring at the two longer periods, and about half as many failures with 12 h exposure2,3. In the aforementioned experiments, the female was continually subjected to the presence of the strange male. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if multiple, short-term exposures of the newly inseminated female to strange males would reduce the pregnancy rate."

https://openalex.org/W1964120028,"MINK reproduction is characterized by several remarkable features, among which the variability of gestation length is of outstanding interest. Hansson1 and Enders2 have emphasized this variability (from 37 to 91 days) in their classic studies on mink reproduction. It is generally accepted that this range in gestation length is due to varying periods of delayed implantation, when the fertilized ova reside in the uterus for an extended period of time before nidation occurs. This communication reports some investigations which I made of the normal variations of gestation length in four modern colour phases (strains) of mink and the effects of the age of the female, the date of mating and litter size on gestation length."

https://openalex.org/W2062354210,"DURING the past 3 years we have been investigating the biological properties of a series of thiophens of tho following general formula (I): in which R is an alkyl or alkoxy group and the substituent X is an electron-withdrawing group such as halogen or nitro. These investigations resulted from the observation that the compound I.C.I. 45,514 (I, R = ethoxy, X = H) prevented the development of secondary inflamed lesions in rats injected into the foot-pad with a fine suspension of dead tubercle bacilli in liquid paraffin. The use of this syndrome for evaluating chemotherapeutic agents has already been described1,2."

https://openalex.org/W2986611839,"IN a recent note, Lomer and Greene1 have recommended the development of a 14-MeV fast-neutron source for radiotherapy. We feel that there are disadvantages to this approach. The relative biological effectiveness of fast neutrons is related to their linear energy transfer, which in turn varies inversely with the energy of the neutron2,3. It has been shown that cell-killing by 1—2 MeV neutrons (linear energy transfer, 50–60 keV/µ) is relatively independent of oxygen3. As the energy of the neutrons is increased, the effect becomes more oxygen-dependent4—30-MeV neutrons would have a linear energy transfer similar to 250-kV X-rays, and hence a similar oxygen-dependence. If one is to expect an improvement in the results of radiotherapy due to the relative oxygen-independence of the effect of fast neutrons, then one must attempt to use those neutrons the effects of which are relatively oxygen-independent; this cannot be claimed for 14-MeV neutrons (linear energy transfer 20 KeV/µ). A useful increase in effective linear energy transfer with depth of penetration in tissue has yet to be demonstrated: the neutrons will lose energy and become more densely ionizing but the γ-ray component of the total dose rises."

For a range of wave-lengths short compared with the size of its surfaces, and long compared with the size of the irregularities in these surfaces, specular reflexion will be obtained and an acoustic image of the sound source will be formed analogous to an optical image. In many situations, however, such as the approach of an external corner, an acoustic image may not be audible from the observer's position. In these cases sound scattered from the edges and irregularities may, or frequently may not, give the necessary warning. Such signals are, however, weak compared with those of the acoustic image with which we are chiefly concerned."

https://openalex.org/W2004818482,"CALCIUM ions are known to be practically immobile in the phloem of plants and are thus not re-translocated from older leaves1. Other elements manifesting low phloem mobility are zinc, boron and iron; the last-mentioned is also immobilized in the xylem in various circumstances2. Apparently, it has not been suggested that elements other than iron may be immobilized in the xylem2."

https://openalex.org/W2016220084,"ISOTOPICALLY labelled histamine ribonucleoside can be detected in the urine of experimental animals after intraperitoneal administration of either 2(ring)−14C-labelled histamine1, or similarly labelled histamine-adenine-dinucleotides2. However, in such experiments the quantities of histamine ribonucleoside recovered from the urine represent only a small percentage of the expected amount. This apparent disappearance of histamine ribonucleoside in vivo suggested the possibility of its combination with proteins. The incorporation of amines into proteins, probably through transamidation, was studied by Waelsch et al.3,4. A similar system, that is, a 100,000g supernatant of a guinea-pig liver homogenate3, was used in our investigations. Histamine ribonucleoside was prepared from histamine adenine dinucleotide phosphate5, as already described2. The degree of purity of this material was checked ionophoretically1,2, and only a single spot was observed in either tris-hydrochloric acid (pH 8.0) or sodium borate (pH 9.1). As shown in Table 1, there was appreciable incorporation of radioactivity into the acid insoluble fraction of the incubation mixtures when either histamine, or histamine ribonucleoside, or histamine-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate was used. This incorporation was Ca2+-dependent. Thus, in controls from which Ca2+ was omitted, very few scintillations were counted, and radioactivity approached background values (Table 1). When tested under conditions similar to those in Table 1, the guinea-pig liver supernatant used in our investigations was found free of activities capable of liberating inorganic phosphate from the dinucleotide. This may be partly due to the lack of the proper enzymes (that is, pyrophosphatases and phosphatases) and partly because of the lack of magnesium ions. In any event, this finding led us to the conclusion that the dinucleotide was probably attached as such on the protein molecule."
