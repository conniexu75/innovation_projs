https://openalex.org/W2042045767,"The human gut is colonized with a vast community of indigenous microorganisms that help shape our biology. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of the Gram-negative anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , a dominant member of our normal distal intestinal microbiota. Its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems. These and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2129999750,"Large, abrupt, and widespread climate changes with major impacts have occurred repeatedly in the past, when the Earth system was forced across thresholds. Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons, it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious. Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections. In light of these uncertainties, policy-makers should consider expanding research into abrupt climate change, improving monitoring systems, and taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and economies."
https://openalex.org/W2151742889,"The complete genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis V583, a vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate, revealed that more than a quarter of the genome consists of probable mobile or foreign DNA. One of the predicted mobile elements is a previously unknown vanB vancomycin-resistance conjugative transposon. Three plasmids were identified, including two pheromone-sensing conjugative plasmids, one encoding a previously undescribed pheromone inhibitor. The apparent propensity for the incorporation of mobile elements probably contributed to the rapid acquisition and dissemination of drug resistance in the enterococci."

https://openalex.org/W2047458612,"Although it has been known for some time that olfactory receptors (ORs) reside in spermatozoa, the function of these ORs is unknown. Here, we identified, cloned, and functionally expressed a previously undescribed human testicular OR, hOR17-4. With the use of ratiofluorometric imaging, Ca 2+ signals were induced by a small subset of applied chemical stimuli, establishing the molecular receptive fields for the recombinantly expressed receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and the native receptor in human spermatozoa. Bourgeonal was a powerful agonist for both recombinant and native receptor types, as well as a strong chemoattractant in subsequent behavioral bioassays. In contrast, undecanal was a potent OR antagonist to bourgeonal and related compounds. Taken together, these results indicate that hOR17-4 functions in human sperm chemotaxis and may be a critical component of the fertilization process."
https://openalex.org/W2035623537,"A large number of correlative studies have established that the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) alters the cell's sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Although the induction of the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) is commonly used as an indicator for the UPR, the direct role of the GRPs in conferring resistance to DNA damaging agents has not been proven. We report here that without the use of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers, specific overexpression of GRP78 results in reduced apoptosis and higher colony survival when challenged with topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and doxorubicin, and topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. While investigating the mechanism for the GRP78 protective effect against etoposide-induced cell death, we discovered that in contrast to the UPR, GRP78 overexpression does not result in G1 arrest or depletion of topoisomerase II. Caspase-7, an executor caspase that is associated with the ER, is activated by etoposide. We show here that specific expression of GRP78 blocks caspase-7 activation by etoposide both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect can be reversed by addition of dATP in a cell-free system. Recently, it was reported that ectopically expressed GRP78 and caspases-7 and -12 form a complex, thus coupling ER stress to the cell death program. However, the mechanism of how GRP78, a presumably ER lumen protein, can regulate cytosolic effectors of apoptosis is not known. Here we provide evidence that a subpopulation of GRP78 can exist as an ER transmembrane protein, as well as co-localize with caspase-7, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation studies further reveal endogenous GRP78 constitutively associates with procaspase-7 but not with procaspase-3. Lastly, a GRP78 mutant deleted of its ATP binding domain fails to bind procaspase-7 and loses its protective effect against etoposide-induced apoptosis.

Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle for the treatment of cancer. The complexity of drug resistance in human cancer strongly suggests the involvement of multiple pathways. One mechanism, both intrinsic and acquired, is the result of genetic alterations within cancer cells. Another mechanism may result from environmental conditions that occur naturally in solid tumors. Because of poor vascularization, solid tumors usually contain regions undergoing glucose starvation and hypoxia, resulting in acidosis and alterations in cell metabolism (1Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416PubMed Google Scholar). These pockets of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation occur in well differentiated, slow growing, non-metastatic tumors, as well as in rapidly growing, aggressive anaplastic malignancies. Stress conditions in cell culture, such as glucose starvation, commonly cause the glucose-regulated stress response (2Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (392) Google Scholar), which is part of a general cellular defense mechanism referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR) 1The abbreviations used are: UPR, unfolded protein response; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GRP, glucose-regulated protein; PI, propidium iodide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KDEL, Lys, Asp, Glu, Leu. 1The abbreviations used are: UPR, unfolded protein response; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GRP, glucose-regulated protein; PI, propidium iodide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KDEL, Lys, Asp, Glu, Leu. (3Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). One characteristic of the UPR is the induction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident stress proteins referred to as the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) (4Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The GRPs are Ca2+-binding chaperone proteins with protective properties. The best characterized GRP is GRP78, a 78-kDa protein also referred to as BiP. As a protein chaperone, GRP78 is known to form complexes with heterologous proteins that are processed through the ER (5Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Overexpression and antisense approaches in cell systems show that GRP78 can protect cells against cell death caused by disturbance of ER homeostasis (6Li L.J. Li X. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Liu E.S.

Whereas GRP78 overexpression could limit damage in normal tissues and organs exposed to ER stress, the anti-apoptotic function of GRP78 also predicts that its natural induction in neoplastic cells could lead to cancer progression and drug resistance (12Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In a variety of cancer cell lines, solid tumors, and human cancer biopsies, the level of GRP78 is elevated, correlating with malignancy (13Patierno S.R. Tuscano J.M. Kim K.S. Landolph J.R. Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6220-6224PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bini L. Magi B. Marzocchi B. Arcuri F. Tripodi S. Cintorino M. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hughes G. Pallini V. Hochstrasser D.F. Tosi P.

Treat. 2000; 59: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Using human cancer and other cell lines, a large number of stress induction studies show that a glucose-regulated stress response results in the induction of GRP78 and other coordinately regulated GRP genes correlating with cellular drug resistance (17Shen J. Hughes C. Chao C. Cai J. Bartels C. Gessner T. Subjeck J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3278-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18Chatterjee S. Trivedi D. Petzold S.J.

Anticancer Drug Des. 1999; 14: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the direct role of GRPs in conferring drug resistance has not been proven. This is because of the inherent problems associated with using stress inducers or deficiencies in certain cell functions to induce the GRPs, because the inducing conditions can exert other unknown pleiotropic effects, possibly affecting multiple cellular pathways. Furthermore, the mechanisms for the protective function of the ER localized GRPs in drug resistance are not understood. Many of the cytotoxic drugs, including topoisomerase inhibitors such as etoposide, initiate programmed cell death (23Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA damaging agents such as etoposide can trigger cell death through the p53-mediated caspase cell death signaling cascade, resulting in cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase-3 (24Schuler M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldstein J.C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7337-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Caspases-3, -6, and -7 are members of the apoptotic executing group of caspases with caspase-7 structurally and functionally most similar to caspase-3 (25Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Active caspase-7 has been shown to be associated with the mitochondria and the ER membranes, whereas caspase-3 remains cytosolic (26Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that similar apoptotic executioners function in different cellular compartments and act on distinct substrates, there is limited information on the contribution of organelles such as the ER in the apoptotic process. Through specific overexpression of GRP78 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human leukemia, and bladder carcinoma cell lines, we show that GRP78 overexpression directly confers resistance to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis, correlating with a higher survival rate in clonogenic assays. We discover that GRP78 overexpression differs from the UPR inducers in that it does not affect topoisomerase II level or arrest cells in G1. Upon etoposide treatment, caspase-7 is activated, and GRP78 overexpression suppresses its activation. However, the question remains as to how a protein such as GRP78 that is presumed to be an ER lumenal protein can interfere with caspase activation in the cytoplasm. Based on our discovery that a subpopulation of GRP78 can exist as an ER transmembrane protein and that its physical and functional interaction with procaspase-7 is dependent on the GRP78 ATP binding domain, a mechanism for GRP78 to confer resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis is presented. Cell Culture Conditions—The establishment of C.1 and AD-1 cell lines that are derivatives of CHO overexpressing wild-type or mutated hamster GRP78 has been described (9Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The CHO cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium with nucleosides supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin antibiotics. The C.1 and AD-1 cells were maintained in the above conditions in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml methotrexate but without added nucleosides. The establishment of stable T24/83 human transitional bladder carcinoma cell lines overexpressing human GRP78 or transfected with the empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1) has been described (28Werstuck G.H. Lentz S.R. Dayal S. Hossain G.S. Sood S.K. Shi Y.Y. Zhou J. Maeda N. Krisans S.K. Malinow M.R. Austin R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The T24/83 cell lines were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin antibiotics and 200 μg/ml G418. The human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin antibiotics. All the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Reagents—Etoposide (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 30 mm and stored at -20 °C. Methotrexate (Sigma) was dissolved in a minimum amount of 1 m NaOH, diluted with water to 1 μg/ml, and stored at -20 °C. Doxorubicin (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford, OH) at 2 mg/ml and camptothecin (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 mg/ml were supplied as isotonic solutions. Cell Cycle Analysis—Following seeding, exponentially growing cells were trypsinized at different days and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were treated with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase, and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min at room temperature. The cell cycle distributions were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (FACstar; BD Biosciences). The cell cycle distribution measurements were repeated three to four times. Clonogenic Survival Assays—Four thousand cells were seeded into 10-cm-diameter dishes. Two days after seeding, cells were treated with etoposide for 6 h, doxorubicin for 1 h, or camptothecin for 24 h at different concentrations as indicated. After drug treatment, the cells were grown in fresh medium for 10 to 14 days. The colonies were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with 10% Giemsa staining solution. The surviving fraction was determined by dividing the number of the surviving colonies in the drug-treated cells by the number of colonies in the non-treated control groups. Each assay was repeated three to four times. Annexin V Staining and FACS Analysis—CHO, C.1, and T24/83 cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One hundred μl of cell suspension was transferred to 5-ml plastic tubes, and 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (PharMingen) and 4 μl of 0.5 mg/ml PI were added. The cells were gently vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. Four hundred μl of binding buffer was added to each tube, and annexin V staining was analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Cells negative for both PI and annexin V staining are live cells, annexin V positive staining cells are early apoptotic cells, and PI positive and annexin V positive staining cells are primarily cells in late stages of apoptosis. The experiments were repeated two to three times. Caspase-7 Activation Assays—The cells were either non-treated or treated with 100 μm etoposide for 6 h and harvested after 24 h. The cells were suspended in 5 volumes of a hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 20 min, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and the cells were disrupted by douncing eight times in a 1-ml Wheaton Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was clarified again at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and designated as the cytoplasmic fraction. For in vitro caspase-7 activation assay, 150 μg of cell-free extract was incubated with various amounts of cytochrome c and dATP at 37 °C for 1 h. Equal amounts of total proteins were separated, and Western blotting was performed for caspase-7. Western Blotting—The cell lysate was prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subjected to immunoblot with antibodies against GRP78, GRP94, topoisomerase II, caspase-7, and β-actin as described (29Zhou Y. Lee A.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes containing the transferred proteins were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and were probed with the respective primary antibodies. For GRP78, an anti-KDEL mouse monoclonal antibody (SPA-827), an anti-GRP78 rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl ten amino acids of rat GRP78 (SPA-826) (StressGen, Victoria, Canada), or an anti-hamster GRP78 rabbit polyclonal antibody (gift from Dr. Linda Hendershot) (30Hendershot L.M. Wei J.Y. Gaut J.R. Lawson B. Freiden P.J. Murti K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at 1:3000, 1:2000, and 1:5000 dilution, respectively, was used. Dilutions for the other primary antibodies were as follows: anti-calnexin rabbit polyclonal antibody (SPA-865) (StressGen) at 1:2000, anti-calreticulin rabbit polyclonal antibody (SPA-600) (StressGen) at 1:3000, anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:5000, anti-caspase-7 mouse monoclonal antibody (10–1-62) (BD Biosciences) at 1:1000, anti-caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) at 1:1000, and anti-topoisomerase II mouse monoclonal antibody (SWT3D1) (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) at 1:1000. Respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the protein bands were visualized by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection Death Assay—The cytotoxicity assays have been described (31Reddy R.K. Lu J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with either CMV-neo-Bcl2 (gift of C. M. Zacharchuk, National Institutes of Health) (32Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M.B. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or expression vectors for wild-type hamster GRP78 or a GRP78 ATP-binding site mutant G227D (gift of L. M. Hendershot, St. Jude Hospital, Memphis, TN) (33Wei J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26677-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After drug treatment, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity remaining in the surviving cells. The percent cytotoxicity was calculated as described previously (32Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M.B. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA Fragmentation Assays—The cells were either non-treated or treated with 100 μm etoposide for 12 h and harvested after 48 h. The DNA fragmentation assays were performed using an apoptosis DNA ladder kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instructions (31Reddy R.K. Lu J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining and Image Analysis—CHO and C.1 cells were grown to 60% confluence in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL), washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. For detection of GRP78, the cells were stained with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-GRP78 (C-20) goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a 1:500 dilution of anti-goat Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). For detection of caspase-7, the cells were stained with anti-caspase-7 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) at a 1:500 dilution and a 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Labs). Cells were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI mounting medium (Vector Labs) and visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 dual-photon confocal microscope. The T24/83 cells were incubated with the same anti-GRP78 polyclonal antibody as described for the CHO cells. Whole cell images were subsequently captured and analyzed using Northern exposure image analysis/archival software (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—2 × 106 cells were lysed in 400 μlof extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate, with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and frozen and thawed three times. 500 μg of total protein extract from each sample was pretreated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with 5 μg of either anti-caspase-7 mouse monoclonal antibody or anti-caspase-3 antibodies for 2 h. Following the incubation period, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added, and the mixtures were rotated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed five times with the extraction buffer. The immunoprecipitate was released from the washed beads by the addition of 30 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), followed by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Isolation of Microsomes and Protease Digestion—Conditions for preparation of microsomes were as described (34Kang H.S. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5643-5649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, the cells were trypsinized, and after washing with cold PBS, were lysed by incubation in 10 volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), followed by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was immediately adjusted to 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet, representing microsomes, was rinsed briefly with cold water and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and used for proteolytic digestion and sodium-carbonated extraction studies. Sodium Carbonate Extraction—For separation of ER membranes from lumenal proteins, the microsome pellet was resuspended in 50 volumes of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 1 h. The suspension was then centrifuged for 1 h at 240,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet, which represents ER membrane, was rinsed with cold water and resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Proteins present in the ER lumen were recovered from the supernatant by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The pellet was washed three times with acetone, air-dried, solubilized in the 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Limited Tryptic Digestion of Microsomal Proteins—For trypsin digestion reactions, the microsomes were incubated with trypsin (0.01% or 0.05%) for 30 min at room temperature. The proteolytic cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. 10-20 μg of total protein from each reaction was analyzed by Western blot. Specific Overexpression of GRP78 Confers Resistance to Topoisomerase Inhibitors through Protection against Drug-induced Apoptosis—A CHO cell line derivative (C.1) has been established that has stably integrated high copy numbers of a dihydrofolate reductase plasmid expressing the hamster GRP78 protein (9Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the immunoblots of whole cell extracts showed 5-fold higher GRP78 level in C.1 cells compared with the parental CHO cells, whereas the level of GRP94, also an ER-localized chaperone protein, and a 45-kDa unidentified protein (X) recognizable by the anti-KDEL antibody was relatively constant in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). In situ immunofluorescence imaging using anti-GRP78 antibody further revealed that in both CHO and C.1 cells, the majority of GRP78 was concentrated in the perinuclear region, consistent with its location in the ER (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the immunoblot analysis, the intensity of the immunofluorescent signal for GRP78 was greater in the majority of C.1 cells compared with CHO cells. To examine directly whether specific overexpression of GRP78 can lead to the development of drug resistance, CHO and C.1 cells were exposed to various drugs, and cell survival was measured using clonogenic survival assays. Various dosages of etoposide (also referred to as VP16), adriamycin (also referred to as doxorubicin), and camptothecin were tested. Both etoposide and adriamycin are inhibitors of topoisomerase II, and camptothecin is a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Typical results for each of the drugs tested were shown in Fig. 2. The surviving fractions for the cell lines were calculated based on the surviving colony number compared with the non-treated control. With all three drugs, C.1 cells overexpressing GRP78 conferred higher resistance than CHO cells. These experiments establish that specific overexpression of GRP78, in the absence of the UPR, is sufficient to render CHO cells more resistant to topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. To determine whether GRP78 protects the cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis, CHO and C.1 cells were either nontreated or treated with etoposide and labeled with annexin V and PI. The apoptotic cells were identified by annexin V labeling. For CHO cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased 10-fold (from 9 to 90%) upon etoposide treatment; for C.1 cells, the increase was 4.7-fold (from 15 to 70%) (Fig. 3A). More extensive DNA fragmentation was also detected in etoposide-treated CHO but not C.1 cells (Fig. 3B). These results support that GRP78 overexpression suppresses etoposide-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of GRP78 in a Human Bladder Carcinoma Cell Line Suppresses Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—To extend the observations of the CHO cell derivatives to human cancer cell lines, we utilized a pair of stably transfected human transitional bladder carcinoma T24/83 cell lines selected and cultured under identical conditions. The cell line, referred to as T24/83-GRP78, overexpressed human GRP78, and the other line, referred to as T24/83-pcDNA, was stably transfected with the empty expression vector pcDNA (28Werstuck G.H. Lentz S.R. Dayal S. Hossain G.S. Sood S.K. Shi Y.Y. Zhou J. Maeda N. Krisans S.K. Malinow M.R. Austin R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis followed by normalization against β-actin revealed a 3-fold increase in the level of GRP78 expression in the T24/83-GRP78 cells as compared with T24/83-pcDNA cells (Fig. 4A, inset). Overexpression of GRP78 in T24/83-GRP78 cells did not affect the expression level of ER chaperone proteins GRP94, protein disulfide isomerase and calreticulin, or heat shock protein HSP47 (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). Whole cell imaging revealed much greater GRP78 immunofluorescence for the T24/83-GRP78 cells, confirming the results of the immunoblots (Fig. 4B). In the same cells, it is evident that the majority of GRP78 was concentrated in the perinuclear region, consistent with ER localization. Nonspecific staining was not observed in either T24/83 cell lines immunostained with normal goat IgG (data not shown). In agreement with the CHO cell lines, T24/83 cells overexpressing GRP78 exhibited more resistance to etoposide in clonogenic survival assays (Fig. 4A). Similar protection was observed for adriamycin and camptothecin (data not shown). For T24/83-cDNA cells, etoposide treatment increased the percentage of annexin V-labeled cells 2.7-fold (from 7 to 19%), as compared with an increase of 1.4-fold (from 8 and 11%) for T24/83-GRP78 cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, there were less apoptotic cells in etoposide-treated T24/83 cells overexpressing GRP78 than the cells stably transfected with the empty vector. This is consistent with a higher sensitivity of the T24/83-pcDNA cells to etoposide in clonogenic survival assays.

https://openalex.org/W2054652969,Volcanic aerosols from the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption greatly increased diffuse radiation worldwide for the following 2 years. We estimated that this increase in diffuse radiation alone enhanced noontime photosynthesis of a deciduous forest by 23% in 1992 and 8% in 1993 under cloudless conditions. This finding indicates that the aerosol-induced increase in diffuse radiation by the volcano enhanced the terrestrial carbon sink and contributed to the temporary decline in the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide after the eruption.
https://openalex.org/W1977203585,"Classical genetic screens can be limited by the selectivity of mutational targeting, the complexities of anatomically based phenotypic analysis, or difficulties in subsequent gene identification. Focusing on signaling response to the secreted morphogen Hedgehog (Hh), we used RNA interference (RNAi) and a quantitative cultured cell assay to systematically screen functional roles of all kinases and phosphatases, and subsequently 43% of predicted Drosophila genes. Two gene products reported to function in Wingless (Wg) signaling were identified as Hh pathway components: a cell surface protein (Dally-like protein) required for Hh signal reception, and casein kinase 1alpha, a candidate tumor suppressor that regulates basal activities of both Hh and Wg pathways. This type of cultured cell-based functional genomics approach may be useful in the systematic analysis of other biological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2011234336,"One important action of growth factors is their participation in tissue repair; however, the signaling pathways involved are poorly understood. In a model of corneal wound healing, we found that two paracrine growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), induced rapid and marked activation and prompt nuclear accumulation of phospho-p38 (p-p38) and -ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), but not of JNK (p-JNK1/2), in corneal epithelial cells. Interruption of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways by pretreatment with inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 and subsequent stimulation with HGF or KGF abolished the activation and nuclear localization. Inhibition of either one of these mitogen-activated protein kinases, p38 or ERK1/2, induced a robust cross-activation of the other. In immunofluorescence studies of wounded cornea, p-p38, unlike p-ERK1/2, was immediately detectable in epithelium after injury. Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 blocked migration of epithelial cells almost completely. In contrast, PD98059 seemed to slightly increase the migration, through concomitant activation of p38. Unlike ERK1/2, p38 did not significantly contribute to proliferation of epithelial cells. Inhibition of either the ERK1/2 or p38 pathway resulted in delayed corneal epithelial wound healing. Interruption of both signaling cascades additively inhibited the wound-healing process. These findings demonstrate that both p38 and ERK1/2 coordinate the dynamics of wound healing: while growth factor-stimulated p38 induces epithelial migration, ERK1/2 activation induces proliferation. The cross-talk between these two signal cascades and the selective action of p38 in migration appear to be important to corneal wound healing, and possibly wound healing in general, and may offer novel drug targets for tissue repair.

The cross-talk between these two signal cascades and the selective action of p38 in migration appear to be important to corneal wound healing, and possibly wound healing in general, and may offer novel drug targets for tissue repair. One of the most important events in wound repair is the coverage of the defective area by migration of residual epithelial cells. Concomitant with migration, cells undergo phenotype alterations. A second important event in the repair process, cell proliferation, occurs later. Induction of signals that allow the cells to respond to these events is not well understood, although growth factors are implicated in this highly complex and interactive process. One signaling pathway linked to growth factor response is comprised of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol; DMEM-F12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12; Me2SO, dimethylsulfoxide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HCE, human corneal epithelial cells; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; MEK, MAPK kinase; p38, p38 MAPK; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PD98059, MEK inhibitor; p-ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2; p-JNK, phospho-JNK; p-p38, phospho-p38; RCE, rabbit corneal epithelial cells; SB203580, p38 inhibitor.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol; DMEM-F12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12; Me2SO, dimethylsulfoxide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HCE, human corneal epithelial cells; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; MEK, MAPK kinase; p38, p38 MAPK; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PD98059, MEK inhibitor; p-ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2; p-JNK, phospho-JNK; p-p38, phospho-p38; RCE, rabbit corneal epithelial cells; SB203580, p38 inhibitor. There are three main MAPK cascades: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK, also known as SAPK), and p38. These serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate both cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. ERKs are predominantly activated by mitogenic factors, while JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by stress-inducing stimuli such as UV light, heat shock, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Depending on cell type, p38 can be involved in development, differentiation, proliferation, and survival (2Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that p38 modulates cell migration. Specific inhibitors of p38 reduce platelet-derived growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration (3Hedges J.C. Dechert M.A. Yamboliev I.A. Martin J.L. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. J.

Corneal epithelium can be injured by different mechanisms, including disorders such as aging or tear deficiency, or injury caused by microorganisms, chemicals, or mechanical damage, e.g. laser surgery. Injury triggers the release of growth factors and cytokines (7Wilson S. Chen L. Mohan R. Liang Q. Liu J. Exp. Eye.

Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Liang Q. Mohan R.R. Chen L. Wilson S.E. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar). Corneal epithelial wound healing is a highly complex, dynamic process that involves migration, proliferation, and differentiation of epithelial cells. One of the experimental advantages of studying this tissue is its avascular nature, which excludes blood-borne mediators from the repair process. In this study, we employed a corneal organ culture wound model that allowed us to monitor epithelial wound closure (13Chandrasekher G. Bazan H.E.P. Curr. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because stromal-epithelial interactions are important in the corneal repair process, two paracrine growth factors, hepatocyte (HGF), and keratinocyte growth factors (KGF), which are synthesized in corneal stroma and act on receptors expressed in corneal epithelial cells, were used in these studies (14Wilson S.E. Walker J.W. Chwang E.L. He Y.G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2544-2561PubMed Google Scholar). Both HGF and KGF activate the ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/p70 S6 kinase pathways and are involved in corneal wound healing (11Chandrasekher G. Kakazu A.H. Bazan H.E.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Liang Q. Mohan R.R. Chen L. Wilson S.E. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar). In other cells, such as lung fibroblasts, ERK1/2 positively regulates cyclin D1, which could implicate this kinase in cell proliferation. In contrast, p38 may be a negative regulator of cyclin D1 (15Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of this kinase in halting proliferation. Recent studies have shown that migrating corneal epithelial cells do not progress through the cell cycle, while peripheral corneal epithelial cells do (16Zieske J.D. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the latter cells there are increases in the expression of cyclins D and E (17Joyce N.C. Meklir B. Joyce S.J. Zieske J.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 645-655PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, migrating, nondividing epithelium does not exhibit nuclear localization of these markers (18Chung E.H. Hutcheon A.E. Joyce N.C. Zieske J.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1952-1958PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the MAPKs may have important regulatory functions in both migration and proliferation of corneal epithelial cells during wound healing. This prompted us to investigate the involvement of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in response to the actions of HGF and KGF during corneal repair. Materials—Rabbit eyes were obtained from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers, AK). Human recombinant double-chain hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was a gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The MEK (MAPK-K) inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), p-p38, and p-JNK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase) as well as anti-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1 and JNK2) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-ERK1 and anti-p38 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). For immunofluorescence, ERK2, p-ERK1/2, p38, and p-p38 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody and ECL Western blotting system were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All SDS-PAGE reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. The horseradish peroxidase protein marker detection kit was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—Rabbit (RCE) and human (HCE) corneal epithelial cells were used in the present study. Rabbit eyes were shipped on ice in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution containing antibiotics and antimycotic (Pel-Freeze Biologicals, Rogers, AK). Eyes were kept at 4 °C and used no later than 24 h after enucleation. Corneas were collected in sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM-F12, 1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. The endothelia and Descemet's membranes were removed with a sterile scalpel, and RCE cells were cultured essentially as described earlier (19Hurst J. Ma X. Bazan H.E.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 790-795PubMed Google Scholar). First passages of RCE cells were used at 80–90% confluence. Immortalized HCE cells that express the HGF and KGF receptors were obtained from Dr. R. W. Beuerman (Department of Ophthalmology, LSUHSC), and maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics BioWhittaker Europe) supplemented with appropriate growth factors and antibiotics. HCE cells were passaged twice per week using trypsin, which was neutralized by KGM (10% fetal bovine serum). Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in KGM and then seeded at a 1:3 split ratio. A large pool of cells was frozen at initial passage to avoid higher passage. All experiments were performed between passages 25–45 and at 60–70% cell confluence. Western Blotting—RCE cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight in DMEM-F12 without serum or growth factors then stimulated with HGF or KGF (20 ng/ml) for different times (11Chandrasekher G. Kakazu A.H. Bazan H.E.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 50 μm PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of MEK) or 20 μm SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38) before stimulation with growth factors. Inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and similar concentrations (0.01%) were added to controls. Activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK was evaluated by Western blot using phosphospecific antibodies. Total protein was determined using anti-ERK1, anti-p38, and anti-JNK1/2 antibodies. Briefly, 40 μg of protein/well were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans Blot electrophoretic transfer unit. The membranes were blocked for nonspecific protein with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus 0.05% Tween 20 and then probed with the specific primary antibody. The membranes were then washed six times (5 min per wash) with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 to remove unbound antibodies and further incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies. Separated proteins were visualized by an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Intensities of the respective bands were examined by densitometric analysis (Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst program). Corneal Organ Culture Wound-healing Model—Epithelial debridement wounds were made to central rabbit corneas using a battery-operated mechanical device (Algerbrush II, Alger Co., Inc. Lago Vista, TX). The central part of the cornea was marked with 7-mm surgical trephine and the epithelium was gently scraped off, without damaging the basement membrane. The wounds were also compared with scalpel-derived wounds (13Chandrasekher G. Bazan H.E.P. Curr. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) both by microscopy and stained with 0.5% methylene blue, and by immunohistochemistry and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. They were determined to be topographically smoother, more regular, and more consistent in shape and area of the wound as compared with scalpel-derived wounds, with the basement membrane intact (data not shown). The wounded corneas were carefully harvested leaving 1 mm of scleral rim, rinsed three times in DMEM F-12 containing appropriate antibiotic and antimycotic solutions, and cultured in vitro as described earlier, with some modifications (13Chandrasekher G. Bazan H.E.P. Curr. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Foreman D.M. Pancholi S. Jarvis-Evans J. McLeod D. Boulton M.E. Exp. Eye. Res. 1996; 62: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) on 1% agarose mounts at 37 °C with 5:95%: CO2/air. Agarose mounts were prepared on polypropylene copolymer cups, which closely match corneal curvature, using DMEM-F12 medium with antibiotics. Corneas were pretreated 4 h with SB203580 (20 μm) and/or PD98059 (50 μm), and then incubated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for 24 h. Corneas without any treatment incubated under similar conditions were used as a 24-h control. For the zero time control, they were stained immediately after injury with 1% alizarin red for 2 min and then fixed in 95% ethanol for 1 min. Photographs were made on a dissecting microscope (Shimadzu Nikon) with an attached Sony camera, recorded by Adobe Photoshop software. They were analyzed for uncovered wound areas by a computer digitizer and an image-analysis program (Image Pro-Plus, Media Cybernetics, MD) operated by a technician to whom specific specimen treatments were unknown. Immunohistochemistry—HCE cells were plated in 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slides, and upon reaching 50–60% confluence, were serum-starved overnight in keratinocyte basal medium (KBM: KGM without growth factors) and then stimulated with HGF or KGF (20 ng/ml) 15 min. In some experiments cells were pretreated for 1 h with SB203580 (20 μm) or PD98059 (50 μm) and then stimulated with HGF or KGF. After a brief wash with cold PBS, the cells were fixed and permeabilized for 6 min with methanol (prechilled at –20 °C), extensively washed with PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat normal serum in PBS. Cells were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies against ERK2 (1:200), p38 (1:200), p-ERK1/2 (1:100), and p-p38 (1:100) at 4 °C, 16 h. After three washings with PBS, they were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50) at room temperature for 45 min. After extensive washing with PBS, the cells were mounted in aqueous mounting fluid (Lerner Laboratories) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200 equipped with a Nikon digital camera DXM1200). Negative controls for immunostaining were cells incubated with mouse IgG without specific primary antibody. To detect the expression of MAPK in corneal tissues, rabbit corneas were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compounds (Miles Inc.), and 6-μm serial cryostat sections were prepared, air-dried, and stored at –80 °C. Immunofluorescence staining for ERK2, p-ERK1/2, p38, and p-p38 was performed as described above. Cell Proliferation Assay—RCE cells were seeded into 96-well microplates at 5000 cells/well, allowed to attach (4–6 h), and then incubated in DMEM-F12 with 1% fetal bovine serum overnight at 37 °C. Cells were supplemented with growth factor (HGF) and/or inhibitors (PD98059 and SB203580) and incubated at 37 °C for 24, 48, or 72 h. Each condition was performed in octuplicate; medium was changed at 48 h. Proliferation was measured by a CyQUANT cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) as previously described (21Chandrasekher G. Ma X. Lallier T.E. Bazan H.E.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1422-1428PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Migration Assay—RCE cell migration assays were performed with modifications to earlier reports (22Edin M.L. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Rieck P.W. Cholidis S. Hartmann C. Exp.

RCE cells were seeded into 60-mm Petri culture dishes, and a straight line was gently carved diametrically across the center, outer, bottom surface of each dish with a scalpel. The cells were allowed to attach and grow to confluence. Cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium, then scraped from one side of the marked line and washed two to three times with medium to remove all loose or dead cells. Dishes were carefully checked under microscope to confirm complete removal of cells from the scraped side and photographed (0 h). Cells were then stimulated with HGF with or without inhibitors (SB203580 and PD98059) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Control dishes were similarly scraped and incubated without addition of any growth factor and/or inhibitor. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and similar concentrations of Me2SO (0.01%) were added to control dishes to determine its effect on cell migration. Cells that migrated across the marked reference line were photographed under phase-contrast microscope fitted with a Sony color video camera, and images were recorded by Adobe Photoshop software. Numbers of cells that migrated across the reference line in treated and control dishes were manually counted in at least 10 different fields at ×10 magnification and averaged. The data were quantified as average numbers of cells that migrated across the reference line. In other experiments, cells that migrated were immunostained with anti-p-p38 or anti-p-ERK1/2 antibodies as described above and were analyzed for the localization of p-p38 or p-ERK1/2. In parallel experiments, cells that migrated across the reference line at 24 h were carefully removed by scraping and subjected to Western blot analysis using p-p38, p-ERK1/2, p38, and ERK1 antibodies, as described above. Statistical Analysis—The significance of data was analyzed by Student's t test. Values with p < 0.05 were considered as significantly different. Stimulation of MAPK by HGF and KGF—The effects of these growth factor treatments on ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in RCE cells were analyzed by Western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies against active phosphorylated forms of these kinases as described under ”Experimental Procedures.“ Previous studies showed that HGF and KGF stimulate ERK1/2 in corneal epithelial cells (11Chandrasekher G. Kakazu A.H. Bazan H.E.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Liang Q. Mohan R.R. Chen L. Wilson S.E. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar); here we report that both HGF and KGF increased the phosphorylated form of p38 by ∼2.5- and 4-fold respectively, while there was no change in total p38 (Fig. 1, A and B). HGF-mediated activation of p38 peaked at 10 min and was maintained up to 30 min (Fig. 1A). KGF, on the other hand, produced an increase of p-p38 up to 120 min (Fig. 1B). Activation of p38 was weaker but more sustained than activation of ERK1/2, which had a peak activation at 10–15 min with HGF treatment and a phosphorylation peak between 5 and 15 min with KGF, followed by deactivation at 30 min (Fig. 1, A and B, middle panel). JNK1/2 was present in the cells, but was not activated by these growth factors. Cross-activation of p38 and ERK1/2 in Corneal Epithelial Cells Stimulated with HGF and KGF—Inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 cascade by PD98059 in RCE cells treated with HGF produced a 14-fold increase in activated p38 (Fig. 2, A and B). However, preincubation with PD98059 alone did not have any discernible effect on p-p38. Similarly, when RCE cells were preincubated for 1 h with SB203580 and stimulated with HGF for 15 min, p-p38 was inhibited, and a 10-fold stimulation of ERK1/2 was observed, compared with control. Pretreatment with SB203580 alone did not increase activation of p-ERK1/2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Total p38 and ERK1/2 did not noticeably change with similar treatments. We next examined by immunostaining the subcellular distribution of ERK1/2 and p38 in HCE cells stimulated by HGF and KGF as well as the effect of the MAPK-specific inhibitors. We used HCE cells for these studies, because they grow in a more dispersed pattern, and they stain more clearly with the antibodies that we used, than do RCE. We observed similar responses with both HCE and RCE (data not shown). HGF- and KGF-stimulated HCE cells showed p-p38 staining mainly in the nuclear area with some perinuclear staining (Fig. 3, W and X). p-ERK1/2 staining was exclusively confined to the nuclei (Fig. 3, I and J). However, in control and growth factor-stimulated HCE cells, all p38 and ERK2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with none in nuclei (Fig. 3, A–C and O–Q). Nonstimulated controls for p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 were counter-stained with DAPI for nuclear staining (Fig. 3, H and V). Cells pretreated with PD98059 then stimulated with HGF or KGF were completely devoid of nuclear staining for p-ERK1/2 (cells were counterstained with DAPI for nuclear staining) (Fig. 3, K and L). Similar treatments for p-p38 produced immunofluorescence mainly in nuclear regions (Fig. 3, Y and Z); all p38 and ERK2 appeared in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, D, E, R, and S). Cells pretreated with SB203580 followed by stimulation with HGF or KGF were completely devoid of any immunofluorescence staining for p-p38 (cells were counterstained with DAPI for nuclear staining) (Fig. 3, A1 and B1). With similar treatments, p-ERK1/2 staining was observed mainly in nuclei (Fig. 3, M and N), while all ERK2 and p38 staining was distributed in the cytoplasmic region (Fig. 3, F, G, T, and U). Inhibition of p38 Delays Corneal Epithelial Wound Closure as Compared with Inhibition of ERK1/2—We previously demonstrated in an organ culture model that both HGF and KGF stimulate corneal epithelial wound healing (11Chandrasekher G. Kakazu A.H. Bazan H.E.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the involvement of MAPK signaling activated by growth factors, corneas were incubated with or without growth factors and MAPK inhibitors as described above. In untreated corneas, the wounded area was significantly reduced to almost 50% at 24 h after injury (Fig. 4). Treatment with PD98059 produced a small but not significant inhibition of wound healing. However, when corneas were incubated with SB203580, there was greater inhibition of wound closure compared with untreated corneas at 24 h after injury or to corneas treated with PD98059 (Fig. 4B). As reported before, HGF reduced the wound area by almost 65–70% compared with the 0-h control, and by 40% (p < 0.05) compared with 24 h without growth factor (11Chandrasekher G. Kakazu A.H. Bazan H.E.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 2001; 73: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When corneas were treated with PD98059 then stimulated with HGF, there was a significant (p < 0.05) inhibition in wound healing leading to an increase in the uncovered wound area by almost 1.7-fold, compared with HGF-treated corneas. However, when corneas were preincubated with SB203580, and then stimulated for 24 h with HGF, the inhibition was significantly higher compared with corneas treated with PD98059 plus HGF or corneas treated with HGF alone (Fig. 4B), and the relative size of the uncovered wound area increased by 2-fold as compared with HGF-treated corneas at 24 h. When corneas were coincubated with both MAPK inhibitors and stimulated with HGF, inhibition of wound healing was further enhanced and the remaining uncovered wound area increased by almost 2.5-fold over HGF-stimulated corneas (Fig. 4). This inhibition was significantly higher than in corneas pretreated with PD98059 or SB203580 and stimulated with HGF, as well as with HGF alone. Differential Activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in Migrating and Proliferating Epithelium—Immunocytochemistry of corneal sections of migrating epithelium showed that immediately after injury there was no p-ERK1/2-positive staining, while p-p38 was detected in regions near the wound and gradually diminished in quantity with distance from the wound (Fig. 5A, b and d). ERK2 and p38 were present from the wound edge (Fig. 5A, a and c) to the limbal region (Fig. 5B, a and c). Twenty-four hours after injury, p-ERK1/2 fluorescence was slightly noticeable, while p-p38 fluorescence appeared as a bright, thin line near the wound edge: i.e. migrating epithelium (Fig. 5A, f and h). In corneas pretreated with PD98059 and stimulated with HGF there was inhibition of p-ERK1/2 immunofluorescence (Fig. 5A, n). SB203580 was equally inhibitory in presence of HGF for p-p38 fluorescence (Fig. 5A, t). In migrating epithelium the p-ERK1/2 immunofluorescence was not increased by SB203580 in the presence of HGF, as compared with 24-h HGF stimulation (Fig. 5A, r and j). In contrast, the p-p38 staining was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with PD98059 plus HGF (Fig. 5A, p and l). After corneal injury, the epithelial cells of the limbal region, distal from the wound, begin proliferating (25Hanna C. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1966; 51: 55-63Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We found increased p-ERK1/2 inmunostaining, but not increased p-p38 immunostaining, in cells of the limbal region of corneas 24 h after injury (Fig. 5B, f and h). Pretreatment with PD98059 and stimulation with HGF inhibited p-ERK1/2 in the limbus without affecting p-p38 (Fig. 5B, j, n and l, p). However, when p38 activity was blocked by SB203580 in the presence of HGF, (Fig. 5B, t) p-ERK1/2 staining was significantly increased, compared with HGF alone (Fig. 5B, r, j). The total ERK2 and p38 immunofluorescence remained essentially the same with all treatments in migrating and limbal epithelium. Inhibition of p38 Decreases Epithelial Migration but Does Not Affect Proliferation—In order to obtain more clear evidence"
https://openalex.org/W2155398486,"The peptidoglycan layers surrounding bacterial membranes are essential for bacterial cell survival and provide an important target for antibiotics. Many antibiotics have mechanisms of action that involve binding to Lipid II, the prenyl chain-linked donor of the peptidoglycan building blocks. One of these antibiotics, the pore-forming peptide nisin uses Lipid II as a receptor molecule to increase its antimicrobial efficacy dramatically. Nisin is the first example of a targeted membrane-permeabilizing peptide antibiotic. However, it was not known whether Lipid II functions only as a receptor to recruit nisin to bacterial membranes, thus increasing its specificity for bacterial cells, or whether it also plays a role in pore formation. We have developed a new method to produce large amounts of Lipid II and variants thereof so that we can address the role of the lipid-linked disaccharide in the activity of nisin. We show here that Lipid II is not only the receptor for nisin but an intrinsic component of the pore formed by nisin, and we present a new model for the pore complex that includes Lipid II.

The cell wall is an essential structure of a bacterium, providing its shape and protecting it from bursting because of the high osmotic pressures of the cytoplasm. This wall is a three-dimensional network built of identical subunits consisting of two amino sugars, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). A pentapeptide, often l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-diaminopimelyl (or l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine) is attached to the carboxyl group of MurNAc. These subunits are assembled in the cytosol of bacteria using UDP-activated precursors on a special lipid carrier, undecaprenyl phosphate (for a review see Ref. 1van Heijenoort J. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994: 39-72Google Scholar). The integral membrane protein MraY and the peripherally membrane-associated MurG that synthesize the precursors Lipid I and II, respectively, are the key enzymes in the last two cytoplasmic steps in the formation of the subunits (Fig. 1). Subsequently, Lipid II is transported across the plasma membrane via an as of yet unknown mechanism. Thereafter, the subunits are polymerized and inserted into the pre-existing cell wall by means of the penicillin-binding proteins (for review see Ref. 2van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous antibiotics target the cell wall synthesis, including a diverse group of antibiotics that bind to Lipid II. Perhaps the best known of these antibiotics is vancomycin, the antibiotic of last resort to treat MRSA infections (3Sheldrick G.M. Jones P.G. Kennard O. Williams D.H. Smith G.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, there are many others, including the polypeptide nisin, that kill cells by permeabilizing bacterial membranes. Efficient membrane permeabilization by nisin requires an interaction with Lipid II (4Brotz H. Josten M. Wiedemann I. Schneider U. Gotz F. Bierbaum G. Sahl H.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). This designates nisin as the first example of a targeted pore-forming peptide antibiotic.Two recent studies have shed light on the structural requirements within nisin for the interaction with Lipid II. A genetic approach indicated that the N terminus of nisin is involved in the interaction with Lipid II (6Wiedemann I. Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Bierbaum G. de Kruijff B. Sahl H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1772-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), and more recently we could map the binding interface toward specific residues in the N terminus using 15N-labeled nisin (7Hsu S.-T. Breukink E. de Kruijff B. Kaptein R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. van Nuland N.A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7670-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is not clear yet what events lead to pore formation after the initial interaction. Information on later stages in the mode of action of nisin arose from studies using site-specific tryptophan fluorescence experiments. Here it was shown that in the presence of Lipid II, nisin has a stable transmembrane orientation (8van Heusden H.E. de Kruijff B. Breukink E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12171-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). So far, understanding the mode of action of nisin has been focused on nisin itself and not on Lipid II, the receptor it docks on. The role of Lipid II in the mode of action of nisin is largely obscure but is intriguing because tryptophan fluorescence measurements indicated that Lipid II plays additional roles besides acting merely as a receptor for nisin: the presence of Lipid II switches the orientation of nisin from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the membrane surface. Research on Lipid II in general is hampered by the very limited availability of the molecule. To obtain insight into the role of Lipid II in the mode of action of nisin we developed a novel and versatile synthesis route to Lipid II and variants, making use of membrane preparations rich in MraY and MurG supplied with polyisoprenyl phosphates of different chemical composition and length. Using these variants we show that the length of the prenyl chain of Lipid II plays an important role in the activity of nisin, i.e. in maintaining pore stability, but a prenyl chain is not essential. Additionally, by using a Lipid II carrying a pyrene label it could be shown by fluorescence experiments that upon addition of nisin, Lipid II gets recruited into a stable pore structure. Hence, Lipid II is an integral part of the nisin pore.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNisin Z was produced by batch fermentation and purified as previously described (9Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S.

UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. Long chain polyprenols were isolated from the appropriate natural source (11Danilov L.L. Druzhinina T. Kalinchuk N.A. Maltsev S.S. Shibayev V.N. Chem. Phys.

Right-side-out membrane vesicles of Micrococcus flavus were prepared and isolated as described (12Konings W.N. Bisschop A. Veenhuis M. Vermeulen C.A. J.

Holtje J.-V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 78: 253-258Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was labeled at the lysine residue with the use of pyrenechloride (Molecular Probes); UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was dissolved in acetonitrile/100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.0 (7:3, v/v), followed by the addition of pyrenechloride (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide) up to a 2:1 molar excess. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, applied to a C18 HPLC column, and purified using a linear gradient from 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate to 100% methanol.Synthesis and Purification of Lipid IISynthesis and Purification of Lipid II-containing Polyprenyl Chains of 4–25 Isoprene Units—M. flavus vesicles (40–80 nmol lipid-Pi) were incubated together with 100 nmol UDP-GlcNAc, 100 nmol UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, 15 nmol polyprenyl phosphate, in 150 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by extraction of the lipids by 200 μl of butanol/6 m pyridine-acetate, pH 4.2. The butanol (top) phase was collected after brief centrifugation and washed with 150 μl of water. Reaction products were analyzed by TLC using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (88:48:10:1), and the spots were visualized by iodine vapor. This small scale Lipid II synthesis was shown to be up scalable by a factor of at least 2000.Purification of Lipid II was performed using a DEAE-cellulose column (acetate form) of 4 × 2.5 cm (height × diameter). Lipid II eluted at ∼180 mm ammonium bicarbonate if a linear gradient (1.2 liters) was used from chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1) to chloroform/methanol/300 mm ammonium bicarbonate (2:3:1).Synthesis and Purification of Lipid II-containing Polyprenyl Chains of 2 or 3 Isoprene Units—No detergent was needed for the synthesis of short chain Lipid II variants nor was the extraction with butanol/pyridine necessary. Typically for small scale synthesis, M. flavus vesicles (40–80 nmol lipid-Pi) were incubated together with 200 nmol UDP-GlcNAc, 100 nmol UDP-MurNAC-pentapeptide, and 150 nmol geranyl or farnesyl phosphate (2-P and 3-P, respectively) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2. The incubation lasted two hours at room temperature for 3-P, whereas for 2-P the incubation was prolonged overnight. The synthesis of 2- and 3-Lipid II can be followed using reversed phase TLC (Merck). Best results were obtained for 2-Lipid II with RP-18 developed in 60% methanol and for 3-Lipid II with RP-8 developed in 75% methanol.For purification the membranes were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and loaded on a C18 HPLC column. The short chain Lipid II variants were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate to 100% methanol in 30 min. Geranyl-Lipid II (2-Lipid II) eluted at ∼35%, whereas farnesyl-Lipid II (3-Lipid II) eluted at ∼60% methanol. The identities of the Lipid II species were confirmed by mass spectroscopy.C20-Lipid II SynthesisC20-alkyl Lipid I was made following the route outlined in Ref. 14Ye X.-Y. Lo M.-C. Brunner L. Walker D. Kahne D. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3155-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar. Conversion to C20-alkyl Lipid II was accomplished by combining 3.05 mg (2.53 μmol) of C20-alkyl Lipid I with 2.0 mg of purified Escherichia coli MurG (15Ha S. Walker D. Shi Y. Walker S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in 14.3 ml of HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2) and then adding 0.7 ml of a 10 mg/ml stock of UDP-GlcNAc (10.2 μmol) in two portions over a reaction time of 1 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into a flask containing 15 ml of cold methanol and concentrated to 1.5 ml. The resulting white suspension was loaded onto a C18 column (∼10 cm C18 in a 10-ml glass pipette), and the product was eluted with a step gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% ammonium bicarbonate (starting from 100% water and decreasing by 5% after each 10 ml). The product eluted in 75–80% water/acetonitrile.Mass SpectrometryElectrospray mass spectrometry spectra were recorded with a Micromass time-of-flight mass spectrometer fitted with a Z-spray nanoflow ion source (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). The short chain Lipid II fractions were diluted in 25 mm ammonium acetate (acidified to pH 5 with acetic acid) to a concentration of 20–25 μm, whereas 11-Lipid II was dissolved in ammonium acetate/methanol (30:70, v/v). The capillary and cone voltages were 1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively. The source block temperature was maintained at 80 °C. Spectra were acquired and processed with Micromass MassLynx version 3.4 software.Fluorescence ExperimentsFluorescence experiments were performed with a SLM-Aminco SPF-500 C fluorometer. All samples (1.2 ml) were continuously stirred in a 10 × 4-mm quartz cuvette and kept at 20 °C using a water bath with continuous circulation.Carboxyfluorescein-loaded DOPC vesicles containing 0.1 mol % of Lipid II with varying chain composition were obtained as described (6Wiedemann I.

The pore-forming activity of 100 nm nisin toward 25 μm carboxyfluorescein-loaded vesicles containing 0.1 mol % Lipid II with varying membrane anchors was determined as described (5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Pore stability was tested by preincubation of 125 nm nisin with 250 μm “empty” DOPC vesicles containing 0.1 mol % Lipid II with varying chains at room temperature in a total volume of 200 μl for 2 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of this mix was added to the cuvette containing carboxyfluorescein-vesicles carrying 0.1 mol % 11-Lipid II, such that the final concentrations were 10 nm nisin, 20 μm empty variant-Lipid II-containing vesicles and 10 μm 11-Lipid II-containing carboxyfluorescein-loaded vesicles.Pyrene excimer formation was followed with spectral recordings between 360 and 550 nm (λex 350 nm, bandwidth 5 nm) using DOPC vesicles containing 0.1–20.0 mol % pyrene-labeled Lipid II. The effect of nisin on pyrene-labeled Lipid II was measured using 50 μm DOPC vesicles containing 0.5 mol % pyrene-labeled Lipid II. To prevent influence of quenching effects of nisin on the monomer fluorescence of pyrene on the excimer/monomer ratios, these were calculated using the monomer fluorescence of the initial sample before nisin addition.RESULTSSynthesis of Lipid II and Variants—To study Lipid II interacting with nisin it is essential to have sufficient amounts of this molecule and variants thereof. So far, access to Lipid II and variants was limited to groups having considerable synthetic expertise (14Ye X.-Y. Lo M.-C. Brunner L. Walker D. Kahne D. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3155-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16VanNieuwenhze M.S. Mauldin S.C. Zia-Ebrahimi M. Winger B.E. Hornback W.J. Saha S.L. Aikins J.A. Blaszczak L.C. J. Am. Chem.

We reasoned that it should be possible to produce Lipid II if membrane preparations carrying sufficient MraY and MurG activity were provided with the appropriate UDP-activated amino sugars and undecaprenyl phosphate in the presence of a suitable detergent. Indeed, total conversion of undecaprenyl phosphate (11-P) to Lipid II could be observed in the presence of sufficient amounts of substrates and enzyme activity (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1–3). In the absence of UDP-GlcNAc, Lipid I production was evident from a product running slightly higher (lane 4), whereas addition of only UDP-GlcNAc to the reaction mixture did not result in a detectable conversion of 11-P (lane 5). Also, fluorescently labeled Lipid II variants were produced if labeled UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides were used (lanes 6–7). From these reaction mixtures Lipid I and II purification is relatively straightforward, and production of 50–100-mg quantities can be easily achieved with purities around 98% (not shown). This approach can be applied similarly to various polyisoprenyl phosphate substrates (Table I) with the exception of the short chain polyprenyls, geranyl and farnesyl phosphate (2-P and 3-P). These short chain Lipid II variants were water soluble and therefore required a different isolation/purification scheme. Synthesis and purification of all the Lipid II variants is outlined under “Methods.”Fig. 2Bypassing the bacterial membrane limits for 11-P. Lipid II synthesis was performed as described under “Methods” using bacterial membranes of M. flavus with no external addition of 11-P (lane 1) and with addition of 10 nmol 11-P (lane 2).

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Lipid II and variants by mass spectrometry showed very similar fragmentation patterns regardless of the length of the prenyl tail, allowing for easy identification. Fig. 3 shows two examples of mass spectra from wild-type 11-Lipid II (Fig. 3A) and a short chain variant 3-Lipid II (Fig. 3B). For 11-Lipid II and 3-Lipid II, the molecular ion is observed at m/z 1875 and m/z 1332 Da, respectively, in addition to peaks at slightly higher m/z values arising from sodium or ammonium adducts. For both Lipid II species the doubly charged molecular ion is more prominent at m/z values of 938.5 and 665.5 Da, respectively. The most prominent fragment that can be observed is in both cases the headgroup of Lipid II (both sugars, including the pentapeptide and the pyrophosphate). These fragment ions are typical for Lipid II and are the result of the fragmentation of the Lipid II molecule at the prenyl side of the pyrophosphate. Thus fragment 1127 (for both variants) is the complete disaccharide headgroup of Lipid II, including the pyrophosphate obtained from loss of the polyprenyl chain. At harsher settings of the spectrometer (e.g. higher cone voltages), Lipid II also fragmented at the sugar side of the pyrophosphate (not shown). In conclusion, the spectra presented above prove the identity of Lipid II and can be used as a reference for the identification of Lipid II variants. Similarly, Lipid I and variants could be identified (not shown).Fig. 3Mass spectra of Lipid II variants.A, mass spectrum of 11-LII.

Dolichol-type isoprenyl phosphates and phytyl phosphate, as well as water-soluble prenyl phosphates, were readily accepted by MraY. Hardly any difference could be observed in the efficiency of MraY to transfer UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides to prenyl chains longer than 7 isoprene units. With shorter prenyl chains a different picture emerged; whereas the conversion of 3-P was still relatively efficient, 77% was converted after two hours of incubation at room temperature but only 3% of 2-P was converted to 2-LII in the same time. With prolonged incubation for 20 hours, 24% of the 2-P was converted (not shown). Unfortunately, the specificity of MraY was not unlimited; an alkyl phosphate was not accepted as substrate (Table I). Nevertheless, the above described results makes MraY the most promiscuous of the integral membrane proteins that perform similar functions both in prokaryotic as well as in eukaryotic systems (18Schenk B.

As shown in Fig. 4, Lipid II with a wild-type undecaprenyl (11-LII) chain resulted in nisin activities that were close to optimal. Lipid II variants that contained a longer prenyl chain were tolerated and resulted in only a minor drop in nisin activity. With shorter prenyl chains a different picture was observed. First, a slight increase in leakage could be observed for the nisin activity in the presence of 7-Lipid II. Then, upon further shortening the prenyl chain to 4 isoprene units, a severe drop in the nisin activity could be observed. For 3-Lipid II-containing vesicles, the nisin activity dropped even further to the level obtained for the control vesicles containing no Lipid II. Evidently, short prenyl chains are tolerated much less by nisin.Fig. 4Activity of nisin toward vesicles containing Lipid II variants with different chain lengths and composition. Nisin (100 nm) was added to carboxyfluorescein-loaded DOPC vesicles (25 μm lipid-Pi) containing 0.1 mol % of n-Lipid II. The amount of leakage was determined 1 min after the addition of nisin. The bars represent the average of two experiments. The numbers denote the amount of prenyl units present in the prenyl chain. Dol-LII is a Lipid II variant with a dolichol chain of 18–20 prenyl units. C20-Lipid II is a Lipid II variant containing an alkyl chain 20 C atoms long. Control represents the amount of leakage that is obtained from DOPC vesicles in the absence of Lipid II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, nisin displayed similar activity against a Lipid II variant in which the α-prenyl unit is saturated (dolichol-type polyisoprenyl chain) as compared with a polyprenyl chain of similar length. Thus, nisin does not discriminate at the level of the α-prenyl unit. Interestingly, nisin activity could even be observed if a Lipid II variant was used carrying a C20-alkyl chain anchor, which has a length comparable with 5 isoprene units. The amount of leakage fell in between the values of 4- and 7-Lipid II. These results indicate that for optimal nisin activity, the Lipid II headgroup should be well anchored in the membrane by a hydrophobic tail of which the chemical composition is not of great importance.These lower activities of nisin with the chain length variants of Lipid II could be caused by an inhibition of the receptor function of Lipid II. However, this is highly unlikely for two reasons. First, the Lipid II headgroup is identical for all length variants; second, the results with the C20-alkyl-Lipid II suggest no specific interaction of nisin with the prenyl chain. Thus, it is more likely that later stages in the mode of action of nisin are affected, like the pore stability or structure. To test whether pore stability is affected, we preincubated nisin with DOPC vesicles containing 0.1 mol % of variant-Lipid II but lacking carboxyfluorescein. The stoichiometry of the nisin-Lipid II interaction was previously determined to be 1:1 (5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 6Wiedemann I. Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Bierbaum G. de Kruijff B. Sahl H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1772-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar); therefore, to ensure complete binding of nisin the nisin/Lipid II ratio was 1:2 during preincubation. Subsequently, the mixture was tested for (residual) nisin activity by adding it to DOPC vesicles containing both 11-Lipid II and carboxyfluorescein (Fig. 5). For control purposes, nisin was first preincubated with DOPC vesicles lacking Lipid II. In this case, a maximum amount of leakage (about 60%) is obtained as expected, considering the low affinity of nisin for DOPC membranes (22Breukink E. Ganz P. de Kruijff B. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10247-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hardly any activity of nisin was detected if nisin was preincubated with Lipid II variants with prenyl chains of 7 isoprene units or longer, indicating that pores formed by nisin with these variants are stable. In contrast, preincubation of nisin with Lipid II variants with shorter anchors did result in significant nisin activity, and the nisin activity showed inverse dependence on the anchor length. Thus, the interaction of nisin with short chain Lipid II variants leads to the formation of unstable pores. Further support for the formation of unstable pores by nisin in the presence of 4-Lipid II came from analysis of the leakage kinetics, which showed that an amount of nisin was continuously released from the complex, with 4-Lipid II resulting in leakage rates of the carboxyfluorescein from the 11-Lipid II-containing vesicles that were linear in time as opposed to leakage rates that leveled off when a fixed amount of nisin was added to the 11-Lipid II-containing vesicles (not shown). Our conclusion that the length rather than the nature of the hydrophobic chain determines pore stability is supported by the nisin activities obtained after preincubation with the long chain dolichol-type Lipid II and the short chain C20-alkyl Lipid II-containing vesicles (compare Figs. 5 and 4).Fig. 5Assay for the stability of the nisin-Lipid II complex. Nisin was preincubated in the presence of empty DOPC vesicles containing a 2-fold excess of n-Lipid II and subsequently added to carboxyfluorescein-loaded DOPC vesicles containing 0.1 mol % 11-Lipid II. Final concentrations were 10 nm nisin, 10 μm carboxyfluorescein-vesicles containing 0.1 mol % 11-Lipid II, and 20 μm empty vesicles containing 0.1 mol % n-Lipid II. The numbers denote the amount of prenyl units present in the prenyl chain. Dol-LII is a Lipid II variant with a dolichol chain of 18–20 prenyl units. C20-Lipid II is a Lipid II variant containing an alkyl chain 20 C atoms long. The control represents the amount of leakage that is obtained from 10 nm nisin after preincubation with DOPC vesicles in the absence of Lipid II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of prenyl chain length on pore stability strongly suggests that Lipid II plays additional roles in the mode of action of nisin besides its receptor function.

Here we show how a factor of three uncertainty in climate sensitivity introduces even greater uncertainty in allowable increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and allowable CO 2 emissions.

To determine which of these stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, we are using L6 myotubes. Using this model we have found that raising cytosolic Ca2+ induces an increase in mitochondria. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that raising cytosolic Ca2+ in L6 myotubes induces increased expression of PGC-1, NRF-1, NRF-2, and mtTFA, factors that have been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis and in the adaptation of muscle to exercise. Raising cytosolic Ca2+ by exposing L6 myotubes to caffeine for 5 h induced significant increases in PGC-1 and mtTFA protein expression and in NRF-1 and NRF-2 binding to DNA. These adaptations were prevented by dantrolene, which blocks Ca2+ release from the SR. Exposure of L6 myotubes to caffeine for 5 h per day for 5 days induced significant increases in mitochondrial marker enzyme proteins. Our results show that the adaptive response of L6 myotubes to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ mimics the stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by exercise. They support the hypothesis that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is one of the signals that mediate increased mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle."

To address this issue, we have been using cultured cells to analyze the localization, biosynthesis, and metabolism of PrP molecules carrying mutations associated with familial prion diseases. We report here that mutant PrP molecules are delayed in their maturation to an endoglycosidase H-resistant form after biosynthetic labeling, suggesting that they are impaired in their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, we find that proteasome inhibitors have no effect on the maturation or turnover of either mutant or wild-type PrP molecules. Thus, in contrast to recent studies from other laboratories, our work indicates that PrP is not subject to retrotranslocation from the ER into the cytoplasm prior to degradation by the proteasome. We find that in transfected cells, but not in cultured neurons, proteasome inhibitors cause accumulation of an unglycosylated, signal peptide-bearing form of PrP on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. Thus, under conditions of elevated expression, a small fraction of PrP chains is not translocated into the ER lumen during synthesis, and is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm by the proteasome. Finally, we report a previously unappreciated artifact caused by treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors: an increase in PrP mRNA level and synthetic rate when the protein is expressed from a vector containing a viral promoter. We suggest that this phenomenon may explain some of the dramatic effects of proteasome inhibitors observed in other studies.

Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that have attracted enormous scientific attention because they exemplify a novel mechanism of biological information transfer based on the transmission of protein conformation rather than on the inheritance of nucleic acid (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar).

This conversion can be catalyzed by exogenous PrPSc during infectious transmission, or can occur spontaneously in familial cases as a result of dominantly inherited, germline mutations in the gene encoding PrP (3Young K.

Point mutations in the C-terminal half of the PrP molecule are associated with Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, or familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Insertional mutations, which produce a variable phenotype that can include features of both Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, consist of 1–9 additional copies of a peptide repeat that is normally present in 5 copies in the N-terminal half of the protein. To understand how mutant PrP molecules cause neurological dysfunction in familial prion diseases, we have been analyzing the biochemical properties, metabolism, and cellular localization of these proteins in cultured cells. We and others have found that mutant PrPs expressed in several different cell types acquire biochemical properties that are reminiscent of PrPSc (4Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

These properties include partial resistance to protease digestion, insolubility in non-denaturing detergents, and resistance of the C-terminal glycolipid anchor to cleavage by phospholipase. Although the protease resistance of the mutant PrPs synthesized in cultured cells is quantitatively less than that of many strains of PrPSc from infected brain, it is likely that the cultured cells are reproducing key steps in the metabolism of mutant proteins that are relevant to the pathogenesis of familial prion diseases. Indeed, transgenic mice expressing a similar, weakly protease-resistant form of mutant PrP in their brains develop a fatal neurological illness with many similarities to human familial prion disorders (11Chiesa R.

Several key results from our laboratory have identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a critical cellular compartment in the metabolism of mutant PrP molecules. First, pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that PrP molecules carrying pathogenic mutations first become phospholipase-resistant early in the secretory pathway, probably as a result of misfolding of the polypeptide chains during their synthesis in the ER (13Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Narwa R. Harris D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8770-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, subcellular localization studies indicate that these same mutant PrP molecules accumulate in the ER and are expressed at reduced levels on the cell surface (15Ivanova L. Barmada S. Kummer T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42409-42421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Third, a mutant form of PrP, L9R/3AV, that is synthesized exclusively with a transmembrane topology is retained completely in the ER of cultured cells and is not detectably transported to the cell surface (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interest in the role of the ER in PrP metabolism has been heightened recently by reports that both wild-type and mutant PrP molecules are recognized by the ER quality control machinery (17Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Ma J. Lindquist S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is well known that some membrane and secretory proteins, including several that are mutated in inherited human diseases, are recognized as abnormal soon after their synthesis as a result of misfolding of the polypeptide chain in the ER (20Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 21Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

These proteins are then transported backwards (retrotranslocated) through the translocon channel of the ER membrane into the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome, often following conjugation to ubiquitin. The primary evidence for involvement of this pathway in the metabolism of PrP is the observation that treatment of cultured cells with proteasome inhibitors causes accumulation of an aggregated, unglycosylated form of PrP in the cytoplasm (17Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Ma J. Lindquist S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the cytosolic PrP found in inhibitor-treated cells displays properties of PrPSc, including protease resistance and the ability to sustain conversion of newly synthesized PrPC to a PrPSc form (18Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Finally, artificial expression of PrP in the cytoplasm using a PrP construct lacking the N-terminal signal sequence was found to be toxic to cultured cells, and resulted in a neurodegenerative phenotype in transgenic mice (23Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, the hypothesis has been advanced that mislocalization of PrP in the cytoplasm may be a general mechanism underlying the spontaneous formation of infectious PrPSc, as well as the pathogenesis of prion diseases (23Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been cautioned that the therapeutic use of proteasome inhibitors in clinical settings may increase the risk for development of prion disease (23Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the metabolism of wild-type and mutant PrP molecules in cultured cells, and the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the turnover of these proteins. We find that mutant PrP molecules are delayed in their biosynthetic maturation, and exit the ER more slowly than wild-type molecules. In contrast to recent reports, however, we find that neither wild-type nor mutant PrP proteins are major substrates for retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. We observe that a small percentage of PrP chains is inefficiently translocated when the protein is expressed at high levels in transfected cells, and these chains are degraded by the proteasome without entering the ER lumen. We also suggest that some of the dramatic effects of proteasome inhibitors observed in previous studies are due to artifactual increases in PrP mRNA levels and protein synthetic rate, rather than to reduction in the catalytic activity of the proteasome. The work presented here clarifies an important current issue in the cell biology of PrP, and suggests reasonable hypotheses for the molecular pathology of prion diseases. Cells—All expression constructs used in this paper carried a CMV promoter to drive synthesis of PrP in transfected cells.

Cells were maintained in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and KCl (25 mm). Cultures were used 4–7 days after plating. To reduce the number of non-neuronal cells in those cultures maintained for longer than 5 days, aphidicolin (3.3 mg/ml) was added to the medium 36 h after plating.

MG132 was obtained from Sigma, and was prepared as a stock solution in Me2SO at 10 mm. Control cell cultures were exposed to the vehicle only. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies 3F4 (26Kascsak R.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) against PrP have been described previously. 3F4 was used to recognize transfected murine PrP in all immunoprecipitations and Western blots, except those involving stably transfected CHO cells expressing D177N PrP, in which P45-66 was used because the construct was not epitope-tagged. 8H4 was used for one of the Western blots shown in Fig. 5A to recognize both transfected murine PrP and endogenous rat PrP in PC12 cells. An antibody (anti-SP) that selectively recognizes forms of murine PrP containing an uncleaved signal peptide was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (TMWTDVGLCKKRPK; amino acids 14–27) that spans the signal peptide cleavage site at residues 22/23. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This antibody shows no reactivity toward PrP molecules lacking the signal peptide, and its reactivity is completely blocked by incubation with the peptide immunogen. Detailed characterization of this antibody will be presented elsewhere. 2R. S. Stewart and D. A. Harris, manuscript in preparation. For immunofluorescence staining, the antibody was affinity-purified using immobilized peptide immunogen. A monoclonal antibody to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was obtained from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia). Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody MAB1510 was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Pulse-Chase Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free medium prior to pulse labeling in the same medium containing 250–750 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences). After washing, cells were chased in regular medium containing unlabeled methionine and cysteine for the indicated times. In some experiments, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was included in the chase medium to block completion of polypeptide chains that had been initiated but not completed during the pulse period (28Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). At the end of the chase period, cells were lysed in 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm; EDTA, 2 mm). The lysates were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then diluted 5-fold with 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. PrP was then immunoprecipitated using the appropriate anti-PrP antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some cases, immunoprecipitated PrP was eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads at 95 °C using 0.2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and subjected to treatment with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for1hat37 °C. The radioactivity in PrP bands on gels was quantitated using a PhosphorImager SI or Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Background values measured in a region of the image that did not lie within the protein lanes were subtracted from each determination. Western Blots, Northern Blots, and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Western blots were performed as described previously (29Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Films exposed using ECL were quantitated with SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Total RNA was prepared using the RNAWiz kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Northern blot analysis was performed using the Gene Images CDP-Star chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). A 485-bp KpnI segment from the 3′ end of the mouse PrP coding region was used as a probe. Under the hybridization conditions used in Fig. 5C, this probe cross-reacts with rat PrP mRNA. RT-PCR was performed using the TITANIUM one-step RT-PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). PrP primers (specific for mouse PrP mRNA) were as follows: sense, 5′-GGACCGCTACTACCGTGAAAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGCCTGTAGTACACTTGGTTAGG-3′. Mouse β-actin primers were supplied by the manufacturer and were included in the same reaction to serve as an internal standard. Control reactions in which the RT was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min showed no amplified bands. Aliquots were removed from the amplification reaction after 12, 16, and 20 cycles, and were analyzed by electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide/TBE gels followed by staining with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes). Quantification of band intensities was performed on a Storm 860. Topology and Detergent Insolubility Assays—For determining the membrane topology of PrP, cells were lysed in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) by 10 passages through 27-gauge needles connected to 0.3-mm silastic tubing. After centrifugation at 2,300 × g for 2 min, the postnuclear supernatant was aliquoted into three tubes. One sample was left untreated; the second was digested with 250 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 22 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); and the third was digested with proteinase K in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 to solubilize membranes. Samples were precipitated with methanol and PrP was analyzed by Western blotting. To assay detergent insolubility, cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged in a TLA 55 rotor at 186,000 × g for 40 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with methanol, and PrP in the supernatant and pellet fractions was analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Staining—CHO cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose, and were then permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were subsequently incubated at room temperature as follows: 30 min in PBS containing 2% goat serum (blocking buffer), 60 min with primary antibodies (anti-SP and anti-PDI) in blocking buffer, 15 min in blocking buffer, 60 min with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS, and cells were visualized by laser-scanning confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM-510 microscope. Maturation of Mutant PrP Molecules Is Delayed—We used pulse-chase labeling to analyze the maturation of newly synthesized PrP molecules in stably transfected CHO cells. We observed that WT PrP migrated as a major 33-kDa species immediately after pulse labeling (Fig. 1A, left panel). A 38-kDa form, which was barely visible at the end of the pulse period, increased in amount during the first 10 min of chase, and became the predominant species by 20 min. The 38-kDa form subsequently decayed with a half-life of ∼3 h (see Fig. 3A). The 33-kDa species was shifted to a 25-kDa unglycosylated form after digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H) (Fig. 1A, right panel). This shift indicates that the 33-kDa band represents immature, core-glycosylated molecules that had not yet transited beyond the mid-Golgi. In contrast, the 38-kDa form was resistant to endo H digestion, and thus represents mature, complex-glycosylated chains that have moved beyond the mid-Golgi to later compartments in the secretory pathway. In addition to the 38-kDa form, which is presumably glycosylated on both asparagine consensus sites, trace amounts of mature, singly glycosylated PrP (∼32 kDa) can also be seen throughout the chase period. Quantitation of the bands revealed that a maximum of ∼50–60% of radioactivity initially incorporated into the 33-kDa precursor during the pulse was eventually recovered in the mature, 38-kDa form. Thus, maturation of WT PrP molecules in CHO cells is rapid and efficient.Fig. 3Proteasome inhibition does not alter the half-lives of WT or mutant PrPs. Stably transfected CHO cells expressing WT PrP (A), PG14 PrP (B), or D177N PrP (C) were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min, and then chased in medium containing unlabeled methionine for the indicated times (in min). In one set of cultures (gels on the right), PSI-1 (20 μm) was present during a 30-min preincubation, as well as during the pulse and chase periods. In the other set of cultures (gels on the left), an equivalent amount of ethanol vehicle was present. At the end of the chase period, cells were lysed, and PrP was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The black and white arrows indicate the positions, respectively, of mature (endo H-resistant) and immature (endo H-sensitive) PrP. The graphs show semi-logarithmic plots of the percentage of initial label present in both PrP bands (mature + immature) at each chase time. Each circle represents an independent experiment. The lines were fitted by least-squares analysis to obtain the half-life ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The maturation of PrP molecules carrying either of two pathogenic mutations was noticeably slower. PG14 is our designation for a nine-octapeptide insertion that is associated with a mixed phenotype in human beings having characteristics of both Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (12Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PG14 PrP is initially synthesized as a 36-kDa form that matures into a 50-kDa species during the chase period (Fig. 1B, left panel). The 36-kDa form is shifted by digestion with endo H, confirming that it represents a core-glycosylated precursor, whereas the 50-kDa form is endo H-resistant (Fig. 1B, right panel). Whereas the endo H-sensitive precursor of WT PrP has largely disappeared by 20 min of chase, the endo H-sensitive precursor of PG14 PrP is still present at 40 min of chase. Delayed maturation was also observed for PrP molecules carrying a second mutation, D177N/Met128, which is linked to fatal familial insomnia (30Goldfarb L.G. Petersen R.B. Tabaton M. Brown P. LeBlanc A.C. Montagna P. Cortelli P. Julien J. Vital C. Pendelbury W.W. Haltia M. Wills P.R. Hauw J.J. McKeever P.E. Monari L. Schrank B. Swergold G.D. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Science. 1992; 258: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In this case, the endo H-sensitive precursor (33 kDa) was still present after 20–30 min of chase. The slower maturation of the two mutant PrPs in comparison with WT PrP is clear from Fig. 1D, which plots the percentage of endo H-resistant PrP at different chase times. Of note, there was no appreciable difference between WT and mutant PrPs in the maximum amount of initial label that was chased into the endo H-resistant form (∼50–60%), and in the half-life of this form (3–5 h; see Fig. 3, A–C). Thus, mutant PrP molecules mature more slowly than WT PrP molecules in CHO cells, but the overall efficiency of maturation and the stability of the final product are similar for both types of PrP. We have seen a similar phenomenon when WT and PG14 PrPs are expressed in transiently transfected BHK cells (not shown). To confirm that these observations held true for PrP molecules synthesized in neurons, we carried out pulse-chase labeling experiments on cerebellar granule cells cultured from transgenic mice expressing WT and PG14 PrP (12Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We observed that WT PrP was fully endo H-resistant by 10–20 min of chase, whereas PG14 PrP required 40 min to become completely endo H-resistant (Fig. 2, A and B). The delayed maturation of PG14 PrP is apparent when the percentage of endo H-resistant protein is quantitated (Fig. 2C). Despite this difference in the kinetics of"

Here a transgenic mouse with myeloid-selective expression of human lipoxin A4 receptor (hALX) was prepared and used to evaluate in vivo the effect of hALX expression. hALX-transfected HEK293 cells transmitted LXA4 signals that inhibit TNFalpha-induced NFkappaB activation. Transgenic FvB mice were generated by DNA injections of a 3.8 kb transgene consisting of the full-length hALX cDNA driven by a fragment of the hCD11b promoter. When topically challenged via dermal ear skin, hALX transgenic mice gave attenuated neutrophil infiltration (approximately 80% reduction) in response to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) plus prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as well as approximately 50% reduction in PMN infiltrates (P<0.02) to receptor-bypass inflammation evoked by phorbol ester. The hALX transgenic mice gave markedly decreased PMN infiltrates to the peritoneum with zymosan and altered the dynamics of this response. Transgenic hALX mice displayed increased sensitivity with >50% reduction in PMN infiltrates to suboptimal doses (10 ng/mouse) of the ligand lipoxin A4 stable analog compared with <10% reduction of PMN in nontransgenic littermates. Soluble mediators generated within the local inflammatory milieu of hALX mice showed diminished ability to activate the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB. Analyses of the lipid-derived mediators from exudates using LC-MS tandem mass spectroscopy indicated an altered profile in hALX transgenic mice that included lower levels of LTB4 and increased amounts of lipoxin A4 compared with nontransgenic littermates. Together these results demonstrate a gain-of-function with hALX transgenic mouse and indicate that ALX is a key receptor and sensor in formation of acute exudates and their resolution."

The transcription potential of ATF2 is enhanced markedly by NH2-terminal phosphorylation by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and mediates stress responses including DNA-damaging events. We have observed that four DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin, actinomycin D, MMS, and etoposide), but not the cisplatin isomer, transplatin, which does not readily damage DNA, strongly activate JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and strongly increase phosphorylation and ATF2-dependent transcriptional activity. Selective inhibition studies with PD98059, SB202190, SP600125, and the dominant negative JNK indicate that activation of JNK but not p38 kinase or ERK kinase is required for the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of ATF2. Stable expression of ATF2 in human breast carcinoma BT474 cells increases transcriptional activity and confers resistance to the four DNA-damaging agents, but not to transplatin. Conversely, stable expression of a dominant negative ATF2 (dnATF2) quantitatively blocks phosphorylation of endogenous ATF2 leading to a marked decrease in transcriptional activity by endogenous ATF2 and a markedly increased sensitivity to the four agents as judged by decreased cell viability. Similarly, application of SB202190 at 50 μm or SP600125 inhibited JNK activity, blocked transactivation, and sensitized parental cells to the four DNA-damaging drugs. Moreover, the wild type ATF2-expressing clones exhibited rapid DNA repair after treatment with the four DNA-damaging agents but not transplatin. Conversely, expression of dnATF2 quantitatively blocks DNA repair.

Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging anticancer drug that is used widely in the treatment of tumors such as ovarian, testicular, head and neck, bladder, and lung cancer. Although treatment with cisplatin for breast cancer had not been frequently used, interest in platinum compounds was reawakened because preclinical and clinical studies of breast cancer patients that over-express HER2/neu have demonstrated synergistic responses after combined treatment of platinum salts with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (13Baselga J.

A major limitation to the use of platinum salts is the occurrence of inherent cisplatin resistance or the acquisition of resistance to cisplatin by initially responsive tumors. Recent studies have revealed a number of resistance mechanisms such as enhanced drug efflux in a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun-dependent mechanism (16Cripe L.D. Gelfanov V.M. Smith E.A.

Thus, cells modified to express a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative inhibitor of c-Jun stably fail to repair cisplatin-DNA adducts. These cells are sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin at concentrations that have little or no effect on parental and control cell lines. ATF2 can form homodimers and more commonly heterodimers with c-Jun which bind to AP-1-like target sites characterized by an 8-bp response element with a consensus sequence of 5′-TGACGTCA-3′.

We examined the role of ATF2 on chemosensitization and DNA repair in the breast cancer cell line BT474. These cells overexpress the Her2/ErbB2 receptor (34Lewis G.D. Figari I. Fendly B. Wong W.L. Carter P. Gorman C. Shepard H.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 37: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), a molecule up-regulated in almost 40% of human breast cancers (35Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G.

Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2919-2932PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing a means of examining the DNA damage response pathway without the complicating effects of p53-induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Here, we provide evidence that DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, MMS, etoposide, but not the cisplatin isomer, transplatin, which does not readily damage DNA, lead to the phosphorylation and enhanced transactivation potential of ATF2 in a JNK-dependent manner. Further, cells modified to express even low levels of wild type ATF2 exhibit accelerated DNA repair as judged by quantitative PCR and are resistant to the DNA-damaging agents. Conversely, cells modified to express stably a similar level of a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative inhibitor of ATF2 (dnATF2) or cells treated with a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor, SB202190, or an anthrapyraxolone, SP600125, exhibit complete inhibition of phosphorylation of endogenous ATF2, blocked DNA repair, and a markedly decreased cell viability after treatment with the four different DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that ATF2 plays an important role in the modulation of DNA repair and in determination of the drug-resistant phenotype. Cell Cultures and Transfections—The human breast cancer BT474 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. BT474 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 2 μg by adding the empty vector plasmid DNA to the transfection mixtures. The experiments were repeated at least three times. DNA Constructs—Wild type ATF2 (wtATF2), pLHCATF2, and a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative ATF2 (dnATF2) pLHCdn-ATF2(T69A,T71A) were constructed by insertion of the cDNA for wtATF2 and dnATF2 into the retroviral plasmid pLHCX, where L is the retroviral long terminal repeat, H is the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene for resistance to hygromycin B, C is an abbreviated human cytomeglia virus promoter, and X is a polylinker thereby creating pLHCwtATF2 and pLHCdnATF2, respectively. The vector pLHCX itself was constructed as described previously (22Potapova O. Basu S. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Clone selection was performed by adding hygromycin B to the medium to a 400 μg/ml final concentration 2 days after the transfection. After 3 weeks several clones were isolated using cloning rings. Selected clones were then maintained in medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B, and only low passage cells (p < 10) were used for the experiments described here. Western Analysis—Cells were lysed in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Equal amounts of lysates (50 μg) were size fractionated in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) after incubation of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with specific antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assay—JNK assay to c-Jun and p38 MAPK kinase assays to ATF2 were performed with assay kits for the respective kinases (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) following the company's instructions. Briefly, treated cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm α-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates (250 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with immobilized c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) or antiphospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) for JNK and p38 MAPK, respectively. In preliminary experiments, it was confirmed that anti-phospho-p38 reliably and uniformly precipitated p38, and this was confirmed for all conditions (lanes) of Fig. 1C. The immunoprecipitated products were washed twice with the cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2. The pellets were suspended in the kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP for the JNK assay, 200 μm ATP, and 2 μg of ATF2 for the p38 MAPK assay. Each reaction was then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Western blotting was performed with the phospho-c-Jun and phospho-ATF2 antibodies, respectively. JNK assay for the phosphorylation of ATF2 was performed using an ATF2 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) as a substrate. Briefly, The cell lysates (250 μg) were incubated with JNK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated products were washed twice with the cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. In preliminary studies, it was confirmed that anti-JNK reliably precipitated JNK, and this was confirmed for all conditions (lanes) examined here (i.e.Fig. 1C). The pellets were suspended in the kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF2. Each reaction was then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Western blotting was performed with the phospho-ATF2 antibodies. In some of the experiments, BT474 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged wild type SAPK/JNK expression plasmid (1 μg of pcDL-SRα-wt-SAPK) or hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative SAPK/JNK expression plasmid (1 μg of pcDL-SRα-SAPK-VPF) using LipofectAMINE Plus. At 72 h after transfection, treated cells were lysed, and 250 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the JNK activity was measured as described above. Cytotoxicity—To assess viability, cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates, and on the following day, they were treated in the same medium with various cytotoxic agents for 1 h. After all treatments, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with fresh complete medium. In some of the experiments, the cells were treated with SB202190, SP600125, or Me2SO (mock) for 30 min before the addition of cytotoxic agents. The measurements of viable cell mass were performed 5 days later using a colorimetric based reaction after the addition of the dye MTS in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Promega), which is reduced in proportion to the amount of intact mitochondria, i.e. viable cell mass. All determinations were carried out with eight samples for each condition. Cell viability was expressed as viable cell mass after a given treatment by normalizing the averaged value to that of parallel cultures of untreated cells × 100 (viability, %) (21Hayakawa J.

At 24 h after transfection, the serum-deprived cells were incubated with various cytotoxic agents or in buffer alone (phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h. In some of the experiments, the cells were treated with 10 or 50 μm SB202190 or 30 μm SP600125 for 30 min before the addition of 100 μm cisplatin. After 16 h, the cells were lysed by exposure to three sequential freeze-thaw cycles in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The frozen/thawed cells were vortexed vigorously to enhance cell lysis. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (microfuge) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The aliquots of the supernatants were used in the subsequent luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay mixture contained 20 mm NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.7 mm MgSO4, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μm ATP, and 470 μm luciferin. A 100-μl portion of the luciferase assay mixture was added to a 20-μl aliquot of cell extract just before recording the intensity of phosfluorescent light emission, which was measured in duplicate during the first 20 s of the reaction at 25 °C in a luminometer (EG & G Berthhold, LB96V luminometer, Bundoora, Australia). β-Galactosidase was assayed using the β-galactosidase buffer containing 60 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.80 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A standard curve for reactions containing 100–2 microunits of β-galactosidase was made with each assay. A 30-μl aliquot of cell extract prepared as described above was incubated with assay buffer until color developed (30–120 min), and the reaction was then stopped by adding 150 μl of 1 m sodium bicarbonate. The absorbance at 420 nm was determined using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, SPECTRA Max Plus 384). Luciferase-catalyzed light emission measured in arbitrary units was normalized to the activity of β-galactosidase observed for control samples. The resulting normalized values were averaged and expressed as average -fold stimulation relative to the control values ± S.E. Analysis of DNA Damage and Repair—Cisplatin adduct formation and repair were analyzed by a PCR-based DNA damage assay (PCR stop assay) as described previously (19Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F.

https://openalex.org/W2164583542,"The oceans play a major role in defining atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and although the geographical distribution of CO2 uptake and release in the modern ocean is understood, little is known about past distributions. Boron isotope studies of planktonic foraminifera from the western equatorial Pacific show that this area was a strong source of CO2 to the atmosphere between approximately 13,800 and 15,600 years ago. This observation is most compatible with increased frequency of La Niña conditions during this interval. Hence, increased upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific may have played an important role in the rise in atmospheric CO2 during the last deglaciation."
https://openalex.org/W2092770418,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a genetic human disease with clinical symptoms that include neurodegeneration and premature aging. The disease is caused by the disruption of CSA, CSB, or some types of xeroderma pigmentosum genes. It is known that the CSB protein coded by the CS group B gene plays a role in the repair of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua) in transcription-coupled and non-strand discriminating modes. Recently we reported a defect of CSB mutant cells in the repair of another oxidatively modified lesion 8-hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade). We show here that primary fibroblasts from CS patients lack the ability to efficiently repair these particular types of oxidatively induced DNA damages. Primary fibroblasts of 11 CS patients and 6 control individuals were exposed to 2 Gy of ionizing radiation to induce oxidative DNA damage and allowed to repair the damage. DNA from cells was analyzed using liquid chromatography/isotope dilution mass spectrometry to measure the biologically important lesions 8-OH-Gua and 8-OH-Ade. After irradiation, no significant change in background levels of 8-OH-Gua and 8-OH-Ade was observed in control human cells, indicating their complete cellular repair. In contrast, cells from CS patients accumulated significant amounts of these lesions, providing evidence for a lack of DNA repair. This was supported by the observation that incision of 8-OH-Gua- or 8-OH-Ade-containing oligodeoxynucleotides by whole cell extracts of fibroblasts from CS patients was deficient compared to control individuals. This study suggests that the cells from CS patients accumulate oxidatively induced specific DNA base lesions, especially after oxidative stress. A deficiency in cellular repair of oxidative DNA damage might contribute to developmental defects in CS patients."

https://openalex.org/W2017339165,"Leptin, the Ob gene product, has emerged recently as a key regulator of bone mass. However, the mechanism mediating leptin effect remains controversial. Because the action of leptin is dependent on its receptors, we analyzed their expression in osteoblast-lineage primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Both the short and long forms of leptin receptors were detected in hBMSC. Leptin significantly decreased the viability of hBMSC. This cytotoxic effect was prevented by Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, a pan-caspase inhibitor, implicating that leptin-induced hBMSC death was caspase-dependent. Further investigation demonstrated that leptin activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not caspase-8, and increased the cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase and cytochrome c release into cytosol. Leptin activated ERK, but not p38 and JNK, and up-regulated cPLA2 activity; the latter was abolished by pre-treatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor (PD98059 or U0126) or cPLA2 inhibitor (AACOCF3). PD98059, U0126, and AACOCF3 also diminished the leptin-induced cytochrome c release into cytosol, cell death, and caspase-3 activation. These data indicated that leptin induced hBMSC apoptosis via ERK/cPLA2/cytochrome c pathway with activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Leptin, the protein product encoded by obese gene, is a circulating hormone produced primarily by the adipose tissue and is a multifunctional hormone that plays important roles in body weight homeostasis, neuroendocrine function, fertility, immune function, and angiogenesis (1Zhang Y.

The biological actions of leptin on target tissues are carried out through interaction with its specific receptor, Ob-R (4Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J.

The long Ob-Rb subtype (Ob-RL) appears as the functional, signal-transducing isoform, responsible for the action of leptin. The roles of the shorter Ob-R isoforms (Ob-RS) remain to be characterized. Although leptin's precise sites of action are not known, its effect is thought largely mediated via hypothalamus. However, the wide expression of Ob-RL throughout the body suggests that leptin may also operate directly in peripheral tissues (5Lin J. Barb C.R. Matteri R.L. Kraeling R.R. Chen X. Meinersmann R.J. Rampacek G.B. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 2000; 19: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There is now a significant amount of evidence implicating that leptin is active in the periphery (6Caprio M. Fabbrini E. Isidori A.M. Aversa A. Fabbri A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recently, leptin has emerged as a key element in the regulation of bone mass. However, the mechanism by which leptin acts upon the bone remains unclear. Thomas et al. (7Thomas T. Gori F. Khosla S. Jensen M.D. Burguera B. Riggs B.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that leptin enhanced the differentiation of hBMSC, 1The abbreviation used are: hBMSC, human bone marrow stromal cells; hOB, human osteoblast; α-MEM, α-minimum essential medium; Z-VAD-fmk, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PI, propidium iodide; BEL, bromoenol lactone; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. and Steppan et al. (8Steppan C.M. Crawford D.T. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Ke H. Swick A.G. Regul. Pept. 2000; 92: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) reported that the femurs of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were shorter than those in the normal mice, and intraperitoneal injection of leptin significantly increased bone area. In addition, a recent study (9Holloway W.R. Collier F.M. Aitken C.J. Myers D.E. Hodge J.M. Malakellis M. Gough T.J. Collier G.R. Nicholson G.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) suggested that leptin inhibited osteoclast generation in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine spleen cells. These data suggest that leptin has a favoring effect on bone formation. However, using ob/ob and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, Ducy et al. (10Ducy P. Amling M. Takeda S. Priemel M. Schilling A.F. Beil F.T. Shen J. Vinson C. Rueger J.M. Karsenty G. Cell. 2000; 100: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) demonstrated that leptin could function as a strong inhibitor of bone formation. Both ob/ob and db/db mice have increased trabecular bone mass. Because neither a direct effect of leptin nor leptin receptor was detected in osteoblasts, and intracerebroventricular injections of leptin resulted in a decreased bone mass, the inhibition of bone formation by leptin was thought to be most likely mediated via a hypothalamic relay (10Ducy P. Amling M. Takeda S. Priemel M. Schilling A.F. Beil F.T. Shen J. Vinson C. Rueger J.M. Karsenty G. Cell. 2000; 100: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Recent reports, however, suggest that leptin may have a direct effect on osteoblasts (7Thomas T. Gori F. Khosla S. Jensen M.D. Burguera B. Riggs B.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Steppan C.M. Crawford D.T. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Ke H. Swick A.G. Regul.

Res. 2001; 16: 1426-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, the aims of this study were to document the following: 1) whether leptin directly acts on cells of osteoblast lineage, and 2) which signal pathways mediate this effect. In this report, we demonstrated that both Ob-RS and Ob-RL were expressed in hBMSC, and leptin induced apoptosis of these cells via ERK/cPLA2/cytochrome c pathway and caspase activation. Antibodies and Reagents—Recombinant human leptin was purchased from either Calbiochem or Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The purity of leptin from both sources was 95% or greater, and endotoxin level was less than 0.1 ng/μg of leptin. Because the same results were obtained using leptin from either source, only representative data were presented. PD98059, U0126, and pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) were purchased from Calbiochem. AACOCF3, AG490, and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were purchased from Biomol. Antibodies against ERK (ERK1 and ERK2), phospho-ERK, cytochrome c, JAK, and Ob-R (corresponding to amino acids 541–840 of Ob-R; sc-8325) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p38, phospho-p38, JNK, phospho-JNK, STAT1, phospho-STAT1, STAT3, phospho-STAT3, and phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Hoechst 33342 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (150–230 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [α-32P]dCTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade or better. hBMSC Culture—hBMSC were isolated from ribs that were discarded at the time of open thoracotomy in patients without metabolic bone disease as described previously (12Cheng S.L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ribs were excised aseptically, cleaned of soft tissue, and opened longitudinally. The exposed bone marrow was flushed out using several washes of serum free α-MEM (Sigma) and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium, and the hBMSC fraction was obtained by Ficoll/Hypaque (specific gravity 1.077; Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) gradient centrifugation. The cells were seeded into a 75-cm2 plastic culture flask at a density of 3 × 107 cells/75-cm2 and cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and penicillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively; Sigma). The medium was changed twice weekly from the second week onward, and when the cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, they were subcultured using 0.01% trypsin and 0.05% EDTA. The second-passage cells were used in the experiments. To reduce background growth factor response, cells were incubated with α-MEM containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h before leptin treatment. To study the effect of inhibitors, cells were pretreated with each inhibitor 2 h prior to leptin treatment. Previous studies (12Cheng S.L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 13Kim C.H. Cheng S.L. Kim G.S. Endocr. Res. 1997; 23: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Kim C.H. Kim S.W. Kim G.S. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 17-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have shown that when cells were cultured to confluence in the presence of serum, these cells possess many of the phenotypic characteristics of differentiated osteoblasts, including production of type 1 procollagen and formation of bone nodules. We also confirmed that these cells deposited calcium into the extracellular matrix and expressed mRNAs characteristic of osteoblastic cells such as alkaline phosphatase, α1(I)collagen, and osteopontin. The absence of monocytic cells was confirmed by staining cultures for nonspecific esterase. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was isolated from hBMSC using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using oligo(dT)18 primer and a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as a control for RNA loading and variations in cDNA synthesis efficiency. Primer sequences for the common region of all the OB-R isoforms and the variant region of Ob-RL have been reported previously (7Thomas T. Gori F. Khosla S. Jensen M.D. Burguera B. Riggs B.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these are as follows: sense, 5′-TGTTGTGAATGTCTTGTGCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TACTCCAGTCACTCCAGATTCC-3′, which encodes a 394-bp fragment in a region common to all Ob-R variants; and sense, 5′-ATAGTTCAGTCACCAAGTGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTCCTGGAGAACTCTGATGTCC-3′, which encodes a 338-bp fragment specific for OB-RL. Oil Red O Staining—Oil Red O staining for lipid droplets was performed as described previously (15Suryawan A. Hu C.Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 105: 485-492Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, hBMSC were fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min followed by rinsing with distilled water. After soaking in 100% propylene glycol for 2 min, cells were stained with 0.3% Oil Red O (Sigma) for 10 min. Subsequently, they were left in 60% propylene glycol for 1 min, rinsed with distilled water, and counter-stained with Harris hematoxylin. Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes (ATCC) were induced into mature adipocytes by incubation of the cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-l-methylxanthine as described previously (16Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and were used as the positive control in Oil Red O staining. Northern Blot Analysis for PPARγ mRNA—Northern blot analysis for PPARγ mRNA was performed as described previously (17Park K.S. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Nikoulina S.E. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA was isolated from hBMSC using a RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Human fat tissues discarded at the time of abdominal plastic surgery were used as the positive control. Of total RNA, 20 μg was electrophoresed through a denaturing formaldehyde 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes was carried out at 65 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. To remove nonspecific binding, membranes were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer and then once with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer, followed by washing at 65 °C with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS buffer. Cell Viability Assay—A colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-[3-[4-iodophenyl]-2-[4-nitrophenyl]-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzenedisulfonate) by mitochondrial dehydrogenase of viable cells to a formazan dye was used following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, hBMSC (5 × 103 cells/well) in 100 μl of α-MEM containing 10% FBS were plated in a 96-well plate for 2 days. hBMSCs were then incubated in 100 μl α-MEM containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h followed by treatment with various concentration of leptin for the indicated period of time. After the incubation period, 10 μl of cell proliferation reagent (WST-1) were added to each well, and incubation was continued for 2 h in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microtiter plate (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) reader (SPECTRAmax 340 PC; Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA) with a reference wavelength at 650 nm. The effect of leptin on cell viability was expressed as percent of cells survived in comparison with the untreated control. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity and Osteocalcin Assay—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well and cultured for 2 days in α-MEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were then incubated without or with various concentrations (10–9, 10–8, 10–7, and 10–6m) of leptin in α-MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 nmol/liter 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days. The conditioned medium was harvested and stored at –80 °C until osteocalcin measurement. The cell layer was washed with PBS, and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using the p-nitrophenyl phosphatate hydrolysis method (18Puzas J.E. Brand J.S. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For osteocalcin assay, the conditioned medium was centrifuged free of cellular debris, and the concentration of osteocalcin in the supernatant was measured by immunoassay using a Novocalcin commercial kit (Metra Biosystems, Mountain View, CA). Both alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin concentration were normalized with total cellular protein content, which was determined by the Lowry method. FACS Analysis—Cells were stained using an Annexin V-FITC kit (R & D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (2 × 105/well) were cultured in a 6-well plate for 2 days. After overnight incubation in α-MEM containing 0.1% FBS, cells were treated without or with various concentrations (10–8, 10–7, and 10–6m) of leptin for 24 h. Both floating and adherent (released by trypsin) cells were collected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing 0.25 μg/ml Annexin V-FITC and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, 400 μl of binding buffer was added, and samples were processed by flow cytometry. Leptin-untreated cells were used as control. Data acquisition and analysis were performed in a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Annexin V is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine is normally present in the inner lipid bilayer but becomes exposed on the cell surface within the first few hours of the onset of apoptosis (19Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). PI is a red DNA-binding dye that can only enter cells whose membranes are disrupted such as in cells undergoing necrosis. Apoptotic cells are stained positive with annexin V-FITC but are resistant to PI staining. Hoechst 33342 Staining—Cells (3 × 104/well) grown on a 4-well chambered slide (Lab-Tek 177437) were incubated with or without 10–6m leptin for 48 h. Control (not treated with leptin) and leptin-treated cells were fixed in 100% cold methanol for 20 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and then stained for 15 min with 3 μm Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescent nuclei were visualized in fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Under these conditions, nuclei from living, apoptotic, and necrotic cells could be clearly distinguished. Cells with highly fluorescent, condensed nuclei that showed patches of compact chromatin were considered apoptotic. Caspase Activity Assay—After treatment of cells with or without leptin, the activity of specific caspases (caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9) was measured using an ApoAlert caspase florescence assay kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in caspase lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 50 μm DEVD-AFC (caspase-3 substrate), IETD-AFC (caspase-8 substrate), or LEHD-AMC (caspase-9/6 substrate) for 1 h. Caspase activity was determined by fluorometric detection of the hydrolyzed products using a microplate spectrofluorometer (SPECTRAmax GEM-INI-XS; Molecular Devices). A 400-nm excitation and a 505-nm emission were used for caspase-3 and caspase-8 analyses whereas a 380-nm excitation and a 460-nm emission were used for caspase-9 analysis. Preparation of Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (total protein) were retained. For subcellular fractionation, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis Buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture tablets, and 0.25 m sucrose) and passed through a 30-gauge syringed needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to yield soluble cytosolic fraction (supernatants) and membrane fraction (pellets). The pellets were resuspended with lysis Buffer A and centrifuged. The supernatant was then harvested as the membrane protein fraction. Protein concentration in the extracts and subcellular fractions was determined using Coomassie reagent (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (50 μl of 50% slurry per 0.3 ml of protein extract; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The precleared lysates were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr-100) for 12 h to overnight at 4 °C on a rotating rocker, followed by an additional incubation with the protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h (20 μl of 50% slurry per 0.3 ml of protein extract). The immune complex or cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk powder/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody. Specific antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol was measured by immunoblotting as described previously (20Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with or without leptin, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed, and soluble cytosolic fractions were obtained as described above. Aliquots of the cytosolic fractions containing equal amount of proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and cytochrome c release was measured by immunoblotting. Arachidonic Acid Release Assay—The assay of arachidonic acid release from cells into medium was used to determine the activity of cPLA2 as described previously (21Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 104) cultured in 24-well plates were labeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (150–230 Ci/mmol) for 12 h. The unincorporated [3H]arachidonic acid was removed by incubating the labeled cells in serum-free medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by three washes with serum-free medium. Labeled cells were pretreated with or without (control) the indicated inhibitor for 2 h, followed by incubation with leptin for a specified period of time. The amount of free [3H]arachidonic acid released into the medium was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of the released [3H]arachidonic acid over the total labeled lipids was calculated, which was then normalized with the control value (defined as 100%) obtained before the addition of leptin. Statistics—All experiments were repeated at least six times of triplicate measurements using hBMSC preparations from nine different patients, and the representative or combined data were shown in the figures. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the differences was assessed by Mann-Whitney U test between two groups and by analysis of variance with post hoc analysis by Duncan's multiple range test among three or more groups. Dose- and time-dependent relationships were examined by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. The p values less than 0.05 were considered significant, and an SPSS 10.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical procedures. Leptin Receptors (Ob-R) Were Expressed in hBMSC—Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we clearly demonstrated that hBMSC expressed leptin receptor mRNA and protein. By RT-PCR, we confirmed a 394-bp fragment common to all Ob-R variants (Ob-RS + Ob-RL) and a 338-bp fragment specific to the long form variant of the Ob-R (Ob-RL) in hBMSC (Fig. 1A). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Immunoblot analysis also revealed that both the short form (∼100 kDa) and the long form (∼130 kDa) of Ob-R were expressed in hBMSC (Fig. 1B). Total protein extract of mouse hypothalamus was used as the positive control. The relatively more mature primary human osteoblasts (hOB) isolated from trabecular bones (22Robey P.G. Termine J.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) were also found to express both short and long forms of leptin receptors (data not shown). It has been well documented that bone marrow stromal cells can differentiate into both adipocytes and osteoblasts (23Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar). Moreover, leptin receptors have been shown to be expressed by preadipocytes (24Machinal-Quelin F. Dieudonne M.N. Leneveu M.C. Pecquery R. Giudicelli Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C853-C863Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To ensure that the presence of leptin receptors in our hBMSC preparations was not derived from contaminating adipocytes, the hBMSC cells were tested with Oil Red O staining for lipid droplets in the cytoplasm and analyzed for PPARγ mRNA expression. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor essential in adipocyte cell fate determination from stem cells (25Gimble J.M. Robinson C.E. Clarke S.L. Hill M.R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 141-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). No Oil Red O-stained cells could be detected in our hBMSC cultures (Fig. 1C), and these cells did not express PPARγ mRNA (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that our hBMSC preparations are not contaminated with adipocytes and exclude adipocytes as the source of leptin receptors in these cells. Leptin Decreased the Cell Viability, Alkaline Phosphatase Activity, and Osteocalcin Secretion of hBMSC—To examine the direct effect of leptin on hBMSC, we measured the cell viability using WST-1 assay. Leptin decreased hBMSC viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, p < 0.01). Incubation of hBMSC with 10–9, 10–8, 10–7, and 10–6m leptin for 24 h reduced cell viability to 95.3 ± 2.6, 84.3 ± 3.1, 75.0 ± 3.3, and 67.0 ± 4.1%, respectively, of the control level. To confirm that the toxic effect on hBMSC was leptin-specific, but not because of contaminants in the products, hBMSC were cultured in α-MEM containing 0.1 μg/ml of rabbit anti-Ob-R antibody (sc-8325) with or without 10–7m leptin for 24 h. For controls, hBMSC were treated with α-MEM containing the same concentration of normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with or without the same concentration of leptin. In the presence of anti-Ob-R antibody, leptin failed to induce any cytotoxic effect on hBMSC, because the cell survival rate was the same as those treated with anti-Ob-R or normal IgG alone (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the cytotoxic effect induced by the commercially available leptin preparations is leptin-specific and that this leptin-induced cytotoxic effect on hBMSC is solely mediated via Ob-R Furthermore, hBMSC viability was decreased by leptin in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, p < 0.01). Treatment of hBMSC with 10–6m leptin for 4–8 h did not affect cell viability (Fig. 2C). However, leptin significantly reduced cell viability after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h to 83.1 ± 2.4, 62.5 ± 2.0, 51.2 ± 1.1, and 41.8 ± 2.2% of the control level, respectively (Fig. 2C, white bars). The detrimental effect of leptin on osteoblastic cells was not limited to bone marrow stromal cells derived from ribs; the cell viability of hBMSC isolated from femurs and that of hOB isolated from ribs was also decreased by leptin in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (data not shown). Because caspases are known to be important enzymes in cell death, we analyzed the role of caspases in leptin-induced hBMSC death. Incubation of hBMSC with 50 μ"
https://openalex.org/W2024589812,"Serum response factor (SRF) plays a pivotal role in cardiac myocyte development, muscle gene transcription, and hypertrophy. Previously, elevation of intracellular levels of Ca2+ was shown to activate SRF function without involving the Ets family of tertiary complex factors through an unknown regulatory mechanism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the chromatin remodeling enzymes of class II histone deacetylases (HDAC4) regulate SRF activity in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. Expression of HDAC4 profoundly repressed SRF-mediated transcription in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. Protein interaction studies demonstrated physical association of HDAC4 with SRF in living cells. The SRF/HDAC4 co-association was disrupted by treatment of cells with hypertrophic agonists such as angiotensin-II and a Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Furthermore, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-IV prevented SRF/HDAC4 interaction and derepressed SRF-dependent transcription activity. The SRF·HDAC4 complex was localized to the cell nucleus, and the activated CaMK-IV disrupted HDAC4/SRF association, leading to export of HDAC4 from the nucleus and stimulation of SRF transcription activity. Thus, these results identify SRF as a functional interacting target of HDAC4 and define a novel tertiary complex factor-independent mechanism for SRF activation by Ca2+/CaMK-mediated signaling.

Thus, these results identify SRF as a functional interacting target of HDAC4 and define a novel tertiary complex factor-independent mechanism for SRF activation by Ca2+/CaMK-mediated signaling.

SRF was first identified by its ability to confer the serum-activated expression of the c-fos gene in replicating cells (1Greenberg M.E. Siegfried Z. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, SRF was also found to regulate expression of several muscle genes, which are expressed specifically in postmitotic myocytes (2Boxer L.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SRF acts through binding as a homodimer to the DNA consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG, the serum response element (SRE), also referred as the CArG box, which is found essential for tissue-specific expression of numerous striated as well as smooth muscle-specific genes (2Boxer L.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). SRF plays a central role in the induction and maintenance of cardiac myogenic program, as exemplified by disruption of the SRF gene, which prevented mesoderm differentiation and cardiac development (4Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). SRF is differentially expressed in embryonic and adult cardiac myocytes, being at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than those detected in cells of endodermal origin (5Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SRF has the ability to physically interact and synergistically cooperate with many other known cardiac-myogenic factors, such as GATA-4, Nkx2.5, TEF-1, myocardin, and CRP1/2 (6Belaguli N.S.

Functionally relevant CArG boxes in the promoter regions of several cardiac-restricted, contractile, Ca2+-transporting, and metabolic protein genes have been identified, indicating a direct role of SRF in their transcriptional regulation (6Belaguli N.S.

A large body of evidence also indicates that SRF-containing complexes are the end point targets in pathways associated with conversion of hypertrophic stimuli to cardiac cellular response (e.g. induction of “fetal gene program”) where re-expression of genes abundant in the embryonic heart occur (including activation of ANF, skeletal α-actin, and β-MHC genes, and repression of SRCa2+ATPase and α-MHC genes) (13Paradis P.

However, the underlying mechanism that enables SRF to transduce intracellular signals to the hypertrophic response of cardiac myocytes is not yet known. Several mechanisms have been shown to regulate the SRF transcription activity, including physical interaction of SRF with a number of positive and negative cofactors (6Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L.

Recently, we have shown that an alternative spliced isoform of SRF is highly expressed in the failing hearts of both humans and animals, which act as a dominant negative isoform to repress SRF-dependent cardiac muscle gene expression (22Davis F.J. Gupta M. Pogwizd S.M. Bacha E. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 282: H1521-H1533Google Scholar). While studying the mechanism of SRF in the hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes, several recent reports have evoked our interest to examine the role of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and deacetylases (HDAC), in SRF-mediated cardiac muscle gene activation. By changing the acetylation state of histones, histone acetylases/ deacetylases modify the chromatin structure that alters the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. These enzymes are often recruited as cofactor complexes on the promoter of different genes, where they associate with transcription factors involved in expression of the target gene (23Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Opin. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (531) Google Scholar). During differentiation of P19 cells to smooth muscle cells, SRF was shown to be recruited to target genes along with hyperacetylation of histones at smooth muscle-specific regulatory regions of chromatin (24Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similarly, SRF and the HAT-containing co-activator, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, was shown recruited to the CArG box of the SM22 promoter during gene activation (25Qiu P. Li L. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). SRF also physically interacts with the HAT-containing activators, CREB-binding protein/p300, during CArG box-mediated activation of the c-fos gene expression (26Ramirez S. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rho-A signaling mediated activation of SRF function on the c-fos promoter was observed only when local chromatin was hyperacetylated, indicating that histone modulation is required for the conversion of intracellular signals to cellular response via a CArG box-dependent mechanism (27Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, several myogenic factors, including MyoD, twist and another MADS-containing factor, MEF2, have been shown to associate directly with cofactors having HAT (CREB-binding protein, p300, p300/CBP-associated factor) or HDAC (HDAC4/5) activities, leading to a change in their muscle gene activation potential (28Hamamori Y.

A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Based on these reports, a pertinent question may be raised of whether SRF-mediated cardiac muscle gene transcription could also be regulated by histone acetylases/deactetylases and whether this regulation is altered by hypertrophic signals that up-regulate cardiac muscle gene expression? We were particularly interested in class II HDACs, because, as opposed to class I HDACs, the members of class II, which include HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9, have been shown to exhibit tissue-specific expression. HDAC4 and HDAC5 are expressed at high levels in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, where they have been suggested to be involved in cell differentiation and development (31Miska E.A. Langley E. Wolf D. Karlsson C. Pines J. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 33Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that SRF directly associates with HDAC4 in cardiac myocytes via its MADS domain, resulting in repression of SRF gene activation potential. Both proteins, upon interaction, co-localize to the nucleus of cardiac myocytes. We also show that the SRF/HDAC4 association is a target for upstream signaling events that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels and activate CaMK signaling during hypertrophic growth of myocytes. The increased activity of Ca2+/CaMK signaling results in dissociation of SRF from HDAC4, leading to export of HDAC4 from the nucleus and restoration of the SRF transcriptional activity. These results demonstrate that under basal conditions the transcription activity of SRF is negatively controlled by HDAC4 and that this is reversed upon activation of Ca2+/CaMK signaling. The unmasking of SRF transcription activity in this manner through dissociation from HDACs could be a key regulatory mechanism involved in transducing multiple and diverse intracellular signals that activate SRF-dependent cardiac muscle gene transcription. Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from 2-day-old neonatal rats as previously described (34Nemoto, S., Sheng, Z., and Lin, A. Mol. Cell. Biol., 18, 3518–3526Google Scholar). After differential plating to eliminate fibroblasts, myocytes were further purified using a Percoll density gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and plated at a density of 4 × 106 in 100-mm plates, precoated with 2% gelatin. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. COS and C2C12 cells were typically plated in Falcon six-well tissue culture dishes at a density of ∼3–5 × 105 cells/well and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin combination. Cells were transfected 48 h after plating, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pCMV-β gal was used as a reference plasmid in all transfections. After 48 h, transfected cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI), β-galactosidase activities, and protein content (Bio-Rad protein reagent). pcDNA3Gal4-HDAC4 (designated as Gal-HDAC4), pcDNA3Gal4-HDAC4-D840N (designated as Gal-HDACD840N), pcDNA3Myc-HDAC4 (having a Myc tag at the COOH terminus of HDAC4), and pcDNA3Myc-HDAC4-D840N were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kouzarides (Wellcome/CRC Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) and have been described (35Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter constructs for skeletal α-actin and expression vectors pCGN and pCGNSRF-FL have been previously described (7Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pBS-SRF constructs having deletions of different regions of SRF were kindly provided by Dr. R. Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). The reporter construct with five SREs was purchased from Stratagene. pcDNA-SRF-M (lacking exon 5) was obtained from Dr. P. Kemp (Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK) (20Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 445-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA-SRF-S (lacking exons 4 and 5) has been described elsewhere (22Davis F.J. Gupta M. Pogwizd S.M. Bacha E. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 282: H1521-H1533Google Scholar). pcDNA3-CaMK-IVdCT (active) and pcDNA3-CaMK-IVdCTK75E (kinase-dead) plasmids were provided by Dr. D. L. Black (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) (36Jiuyong X. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The plasmids SR-α-CaMK-II active (α-CAMK-T286D) and SR-α-CaMK-II inactive (α-CaMK-K42M) were provided by Dr. M. R. Rosner (The Ben May Institute, University of Chicago) (37Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCMV-p300 was obtained from Dr. D. M. Livingston (Dana-Faber Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA) (38Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, all common salts and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Whole cell lysates from frozen tissues or from cultured cells were prepared according to the method described before (22Davis F.J. Gupta M. Pogwizd S.M. Bacha E. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 282: H1521-H1533Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, whole cell lysate (∼500–700 μg of protein) was first incubated with 0.5 μg of normal rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The precleared lysate was obtained by separation of beads by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and incubated with 20 μg of anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 60 min. The absence of primary antibody in parallel reaction mixes served as negative control. Protein A/G-agarose (20 μl) was then added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotating device. Pellets were obtained by centrifugation, washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, and 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) and reconstituted in 50 μl of PBS. The SRF immunoprecipitate (25 μl) or the negative control was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a tank transfer system with a buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.192 m glycine, 20% methanol), at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBST (PBS, Tween 20, 0.5%). Anti-HDAC4 (H-92) or anti-Gal4 (RK5C1) polyclonal antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the primary antibody. The immunoblot analysis was carried out with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the signal detection. The blots were routinely stripped and reprobed with the SRF antibody to ensure expression of the SRF protein. GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (9Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of GST or GST-SRF-FL bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with [35S]Myc-HDAC4 in a protein interaction buffer of the following composition: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. (Note that to assay the role of Ca2+ on the binding of SRF and HDAC4, the basal protein interaction buffer was altered by the addition of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (0–4 mm) or EGTA (10 mm).) The binding reaction was conducted for2hat room temperature on a rocking platform. The beads were then pelleted at 7500 rpm for 3 min, washed three times with 1× protein interaction buffer, and suspended in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), and proteins bound to beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Co-immunoprecipitation (Myc Pull-down Assay)—Equal amounts (10-μl aliquots) of [35S]SRF-FL and [35S]Myc-HDAC4 were incubated in a co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at room temperature. A negative control included a binding reaction with [35S]Myc-HDAC4 and either unprogrammed TNT lysate or 35S-labeled luciferase. One microgram of c-Myc antibody (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each binding reaction, and the reaction was further allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Protein-agarose beads (10 μl) were then added, and reactions were continued at room temperature with continuous rocking for an additional 1 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with 1× co-immunoprecipitation buffer by repeated centrifugation at 7,500 rpm for 3 min. Beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, denatured by boiling for 3 min, and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Full-length protein synthesis was confirmed on a separate SDS-PAGE gel. For mapping the domain of SRF required for its interaction with HDAC4, reactions with the various 35S-labeled fragments of SRF and [35S]Myc-HDAC4 were subjected to Myc pull-down assays as described above and visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro CaMK Phosphorylation of GST-SRF or Myc-HDAC4 —GST-SRF, Myc-HDAC4, or GST alone (1 μg) was incubated in a kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 5 mm CaCl2, 30 μg/ml calmodulin, and 0.6 ng/μl CaMK-II) in a 50-μl reaction volume. [γ-32P]ATP was added to specified reaction tubes at 0.1 μCi/reaction. Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h. A 10-μl aliquot of the kinase reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE to ensure phosphorylation of the proteins. A positive control included a known peptide substrate, autocamtide-2 (Biomol, Plymoth Meeting, PA). Subsequent GST pull-down assays were conducted with stated combinations of phosphorylated/unphosphorylated GST-SRF and phosphorylated/unphosphorylated Myc-HDAC4 as described above. Beads were pelleted, washed thoroughly, and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer. Protein bound to beads were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. The binding reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing ∼10,000 cpm (0.1–0.5 ng) of the labeled DNA, 2–5 μg of the specified nuclear extract, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction mixtures were loaded on 5% native polyacrylamide gels (44:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide), and electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V in a 0.5× TBE buffer in a cold room. For competition and antibody experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA or the antibody was preincubated with nuclear extracts at room temperature for 15–20 min in the reaction buffers prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probe. Probe was human α-cardiac actin CArG (sense): 5′-AAG GGG ACC AAA TAA GGC AAG GTG G-3′. Myocytes grown on 2% gelatin-coated coverslips and COS cells grown on two-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) were transfected with specified DNA and subjected to the following treatments. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min, rehydrated with 5% Triton-X, and permeabilized with 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Cells, shielded from light, were blocked with a 0.3% bovine serum albumin solution and incubated with specified primary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. For localization of overexpressed Myc-HDAC4, we utilized the fluorescein-conjugated c-Myc (9E10) FITC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For localization of overexpressed full-length HA-SRF, we utilized the rhodamine-conjugated HA (F-7) antibody (HA (F-7) TRITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After three rapid washes, cells were mounted using the Slow-Fade Antifade kit with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were observed using a ×63 Planapo objective and photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a PXL cooled charged coupled device camera (Roper, Tucson, AZ). Cellular detail in each field was obtained by Nomarski (differential interference contrast) imaging. For color florescence in each field, nuclear DAPI staining was visualized using 330–380-nm excitation and 460–470-nm emission filters; FITC staining was visualized by 493–509-nm excitation and 510–550-nm emission filters; and rhodamine staining was visualized using a 556–580-nm excitation filter and 600–660-nm emission filters. Single images were processed by no neighbor deconvolution, using Openlab 3 (Improvision, Coventry, UK) with digital confocal processing. All imaging was carried out in the Cancer Center Digital Light Microscopy Laboratory at the University of Chicago. HDAC4 Repressed the Transcription Activity of SRF—To test the hypothesis that a functional relationship exists between SRF and HDAC4, cells were co-transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids encoding either full-length SRF or HDAC4 and the skeletal-α-actin reporter plasmid, containing –394/+24 bp promoter fragment linked to the luciferase gene. The promoter region of skeletal α-actin gene used here contained two CArG boxes and several other adjacent cis-regulatory elements (Fig. 1). Overexpression of HDAC4 reduced (>80%) the basal activity of the skeletal α-actin gene in COS cells as well as in differentiated C2C12 cells, whereas SRF overexpression activated (4-fold) expression of the reporter gene in both cell types. When SRF was co-expressed with HDAC4, the trans-activation effect of SRF was markedly suppressed (>75%) (Fig. 1). We then used an artificial promoter/reporter construct, which has five repeated and adjacent sequences of the CArG box motifs to determine whether this HDAC4-dependent repression was mediated through SRF binding to the CArG box sequence. The basal activity of this construct was also repressed (>80%) by overexpression of HDAC4 (Fig. 1), whereas HDAC4 abrogated SRF-mediated activation of the reporter gene activity. However, HDAC4 did not inhibit reporter activity of the plasmid in which CArG sequences were either mutated or deleted (not shown), thus indicating that HDAC4 repressed SRF-dependent transcription mediated through intact CArG box sequences. All members of the histone deacetylase superfamily contain a conserved Asp840 residue. Mutation of this residue (D840N) and of the analogous residue in members of class I HDACs (e.g. Asp176 in HDAC1) has been shown to eliminate the catalytic activity of the enzyme (35Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 39Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E.

To determine whether the deacetylase activity of HDAC4 was responsible for the repression of SRF function, we examined the effect of a catalytic defective mutant of HDAC4 (D840N) on SRF-induced gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, HDAC4 with mutation of the Asp840 residue (D840N) also reduced (50%) SRF-mediated gene transcription, albeit to an extent lesser than what resulted from the wild-type HDAC4.

Genetic disruption of the type 5 adenylyl cyclase isoform led to a major loss of adenylyl cyclase activity in a striatum-specific manner with a small increase in the expression of a few other adenylyl cyclase isoforms. D1 dopaminergic agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was attenuated, and this was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the D1 dopaminergic receptor and Gsα.

Limbird L.E. Gilman A.G. Goodman ' Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 10th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 447-483Google Scholar). This dopamine-sensitive AC activity is highest in the striatum as well as in associated limbic structures of the brain where their levels of activity exceed, by orders of magnitude, those in other areas of the brain. Such differences in striatal enzymatic activity may be attributed to the amount and/or combination of the enzyme isoforms that are expressed differentially in each brain region (2Chern Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The brain expresses all nine AC isoforms (AC1–AC9) that have distinct biochemical properties,i.e. regulation by Gi, Gऔγ, calcium, or various kinases (4Taussig R. Zimmermann G. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprot. Res. 1998; 32: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, isoforms are enriched in specific brain regions (2Chern Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Cooper D.M. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) rather than diffusely distributed throughout the brain. AC5, for example, is the dominant isoform in the striatum as well as in the heart (6Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Mons N. Decorte L. Jaffard R. Cooper D.M. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Ishikawa Y.

However, the coupling of each enzyme isoform to a specific neuronal function or functions and a receptor signal remains unknown as does whether the function of an AC isoform, unlike that of the receptors, can be substituted by another isoform. The striatum is considered to be the center of sensorimotor integration within the basal ganglia (9Smith Y. Kieval J.Z. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: S28-S33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and receives widespread excitatory input from all regions of the cortex that converge with extensive dopaminergic signals, both D1 and D2, afferent from the midbrain. Concerted and balanced activity of these two dopaminergic signals is believed to play a key role in regulating striatal motor functions. In this study, we examined the role of their potential target enzyme isoform, AC5, by the use of knockout mice in which the AC5 gene was disrupted. We disrupted the AC5 gene by the homologous recombination technique at the exon with the first translation initiation site (Fig. 1A). The type 5 AC gene has another translation initiation site with a reasonable Kozak consensus sequence within the same exon (8Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was excised in the final targeting vector. The integration of the knockout transgene was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis (Fig. 1B). All mice were 129/SvJ-C57BL/6 mixed background littermates from F1 heterozygote crosses. All experiments were performed in 8–12-week-old homozygous (AC5−/−) and wild-type (WT) littermates. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Yokohama City University School of Medicine and New Jersey Medical School. Partial fragments of mouse AC cDNA clones for each isoform (types 1–9) and neuropeptides,i.e. enkephalin, substance P, and dynorphin, were obtained by PCR. A human 28 S ribosomal RNA probe was used as an internal control. RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Striatal tissues were dissected from mice, and membrane preparations were prepared for AC assays as described previously (10Hess E.J. Battaglia G. Norman A.B. Creese I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 50-57PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ishikawa Y. Sorota S. Kiuchi K. Shannon R.P. Komamura K. Katsushika S. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2224-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptor binding assays were performed using [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]spiperone, respectively, as described previously (12Hess E.J. Battaglia G. Norman A.B. Iorio L.C. Creese I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 121: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,13Baik J.H. Picetti R. Saiardi A. Thiriet G. Dierich A. Depaulis A. Le Meur M. Borrelli E. Nature. 1995; 377: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that theKd and Bmax values for D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors were similar to those reported previously (12Hess E.J. Battaglia G. Norman A.B. Iorio L.C. Creese I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 121: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Baik J.H. Picetti R. Saiardi A. Thiriet G. Dierich A. Depaulis A. Le Meur M. Borrelli E.

Methods. 1997; 73: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and tail suspension test (17Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Given that AC is the major effector enzyme of dopaminergic signals in the striatum, we conducted various motor function tests to evaluate striatal function in an animal model in which the AC5 gene was disrupted (AC5−/−). The most dramatic change was found in coordinated movement, which was evaluated by Rotarod performance. In this test, we measured the time that mice could stay on an accelerating Rotarod without falling. In general, there was a major impairment in AC5−/− and to a lesser degree in the heterozygous mice relative to WT (Fig.2A). AC5−/−could spend significantly less time on the Rotarod, and heterozygous mice could spend slightly less time than WT. When tests were repeated, their performance improved significantly after a few trials. However, AC5−/− performed very poorly even after several trials. When the test was repeated on the following day, the results were similar, disputing the possibility that AC5−/− required a longer period to learn the performance (data not shown). Spontaneous activity was determined both horizontally (locomotion) and vertically (rearings). Mice were placed in a cage, and their movements were videotaped for analysis. WT and heterozygous mice revealed a similar performance in open field locomotor activity, while AC5−/− showed a small but significant degree of reduction (Fig. 2, B and C). To evaluate bradykinesia, pole test was performed. The time until they turned downward (Tturn) and the time until they descended to the floor were measured (TLA). We found that AC5−/− had marked deficits in this test; they showed an over 3-fold prolongation of both recording time indexes (Fig.2D). It was also possible that striatal dysfunction led to choleric or dystonic movements. Such abnormal movements may be demonstrated most readily in mice as a clasping of the limbs that is triggered by tail suspension test (17Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). However, we found no such abnormal movements in both AC5−/− and WT (data not shown). These results indicated impairments of striatal functions in AC5−/− presumably induced by the loss of AC5. While AC5 may be striatum-specific with regard to its distribution (18Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it remained unknown whether it was dominant for cAMP production in the striatum. AC5 mRNA was expressed at least 10–20-fold more abundantly in the striatum than in the other brain regions, such as the cortex and the cerebellum, in WT (Fig.3A); this was in agreement with previous findings (18Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In AC5−/−, AC5 mRNA expression was negated, but histological examinations revealed no changes such as neuronal loss and/or reactive gliosis at 8–12 weeks old (data not shown). We found, however, that AC activity was greatly decreased in striatal membrane preparations in AC5−/−(Fig. 3B). In contrast, AC activity was significantly, but only to a small degree, decreased in the cortex where AC5 could be detected in WT and showed no difference in the cerebellum where AC5 was scarcely detected in WT. For comparison, AC activity in the heart, another tissue in which AC5 is dominantly expressed (8Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was decreased by only 307 (data not shown), indicating that the contribution of AC5 to cAMP production is greater in the striatum than in the heart. We also examined receptor agonist-stimulated AC activity (Fig.3C). In general, in many tissues including the heart, marked stimulation of AC is readily attainable with Gs-coupled receptor agonists, although the inhibition of AC with Gi-coupled receptor agonists may not always be easy. In the striatum, however, SKF38393, a D1 dopaminergic receptor agonist, modestly stimulated AC activity in WT (40.7 ± 2.67 increase over that with 10 ॖm GTP). Quinpirole, a D2 agonist, inhibited SKF38393-stimulated AC activity; the inhibition was significant but small (13.5 ± 1.17 decrease). In AC5−/−, the responses to D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptor agonists were markedly diminished; the D1 dopaminergic agonist-mediated stimulation was very small, and the D2 dopaminergic agonist-mediated inhibition in AC5−/− was hardly detectable. It is tentative to speculate that the loss of D2 agonist-mediated inhibition was due to the loss of AC5, which is Gi-inhibitable, as proposed recently in a similar model (19Lee K.W. Hong J.H. Choi I.Y. Che Y. Lee J.K. Yang S.D. Song C.W. Kang H.S. Lee J.H. Noh J.S. Shin H.S. Han P.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while it is also possible that the AC catalytic activity was too low to demonstrate inhibition by AC assays with membrane preparations. Thus, in vitro AC assays may not be sufficient in terms of sensitivity to study changes in selective dopaminergic signal in AC5−/−. We did not understand, however, why the response to D1 agonist stimulation as shown by percent increase was also attenuated in AC5−/− because other remnant AC isoforms must be able to respond to Gs, if not Gi, stimulation. We also examined cAMP accumulation in intact striatal neuronal cells from the fetus; however, the difference in cAMP production was not as great as in the above AC assays using membrane preparations from adults (data not shown). The disruption of the major striatal AC isoform may change the expression of other molecules involved in dopaminergic signaling. D1 dopaminergic receptor binding sites were modestly decreased in AC5−/−, while D2 receptor binding sites were similar to those in WT (Fig.4A). The short, but not the long, form of Gs protein expression was decreased in AC5−/− (Fig. 4B) presumably due to the loss of positive feed forward regulatory loop. Western blotting for various molecules, using either the membrane preparation or whole tissue homogenates, revealed that the protein expression of Golf, Gi, Gq, Gऔ, and PKA (the α catalytic subunit) were not changed (data not shown). Changes in neurotransmitters, such as dynorphin, substance P, and enkephalin, were examined by RNase protection assays that may be linked to the activity of D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors. The expression of dynorphin, which acts on presynaptic κ-receptors to inhibit AC (20Xie G.X. Meng F. Mansour A. Thompson R.C. Hoversten M.T. Goldstein A. Watson S.J. Akil H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3779-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was modestly increased (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the expressions of enkephalin and substance P were unchanged (Fig. 4C). The expressions of glutamic acid decarboxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, which are involved in the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid and dopamine, respectively, were also unchanged as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). The above findings suggested that the expression of some molecules, i.e. D1 dopaminergic receptors, Gs, and dynorphin, was changed in such a way to suppress the D1 dopaminergic pathway despite the disruption of the major AC isoform. We then examined whether there was any increase in the expression of other AC isoforms in AC5−/−. Since AC isoform antibodies that can convincingly determine the level of protein expression are not available, we quantitated the mRNA expression of the AC isoforms by RNase protection assays (Fig. 4D). All AC isoforms except AC4 and AC8 were detected. Among these isoforms, we found a modest increase of AC6, the most relevant isoform to AC5, as well as AC2, AC7, and AC9 but not AC1 and AC3 in AC5−/−. We thought, however, that such small increases in the expression of AC isoforms were not sufficient to explain decreases in the expression of Gs and D1 dopaminergic receptors, which occurred as if to inhibit the D1 dopaminergic pathway. If either or both D1 and D2 dopaminergic signals were attenuated in AC5−/− leading to motor dysfunction in vivo, then stimulation of dopaminergic receptors, D1 and/or D2, with specific agonists may restore the function. Administration of SKF38393 (25 or 50 mg/kg), a D1 dopaminergic agonist, increased locomotor activity in both WT and AC5−/−. In particular, locomotor activity response appeared pronounced, and might be supersensitive, in AC5−/− relative to WT (Fig.5A). This finding was reminiscent of the supersensitive response of the direct pathway neurons observed in dopamine depletion of Parkinson's disease in which the D1 dopaminergic function becomes supersensitive but is accompanied by an actual reduction of D1 dopamine receptor levels (21Marshall J.F. Navarrete R. Joyce J.N. Brain Res. 1989; 493: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Gerfen C.R. Engber T.M. Mahan L.C. Susel Z. Chase T.N. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Science. 1990; 250: 1429-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar) (Fig.4A). SKF38393 did not improve Rotarod performance in both WT and AC5−/− (Fig. 5B). We then examined the effect of cabergoline (0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg), a D2 dopaminergic agonist that has been used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Cabergoline had no significant effect on locomotor activity in both WT and AC5−/−, although both showed a tendency of small increases (Fig. 5D). In contrast, cabergoline improved Rotarod performance selectively in AC5−/−; their performance reached an equivalent level to that of WT (Fig.5E), while cabergoline essentially had no effect on WT, suggesting that coordination in AC5−/− was restored by D2 dopaminergic stimulation. We also examined the effect of these agonists on pole test performance (Fig. 5, C and F). Both SKF38393 and cabergoline improved pole test performance in AC5−/−, the latter of which induced a dramatic improvement even with a lower dose (0.2 mg/kg). We have demonstrated that the disruption of the AC5 gene led to a major deficit in AC activity in a striatal specific manner and an abnormal coordination represented by impaired Rotarod performance as well as other motor disorders that mimicked Parkinson's disease. Selective stimulation of D2 dopaminergic receptors by cabergoline restored coordination, suggesting that the attenuation of D2 dopaminergic signal underlied abnormal coordination in AC5−/− and that D2 dopaminergic signal targets AC5 as a major effector isoform. Locomotor activity was also attenuated and restored by selective D1 dopaminergic stimulation, suggesting that this dopaminergic signal also targets AC5. In contrast, both dopaminergic signals may be able to couple to other AC isoforms as well because D1 or D2 dopaminergic stimulation could restore specific motor function, i.e. coordination or locomotion, respectively. Nevertheless such selective dopaminergic agonist stimulation could not restore all of the motor disorders, indicating that AC5 is essential in balancing and maintaining both coordination and locomotion and may provide the site of convergence of both D1 and D2 dopaminergic signals. D1 and D2 are the most abundant dopaminergic receptors expressed in the brain, and both are involved in the two major striatal output pathways,i.e. the “direct” and the “indirect” pathways, which are dominantly mediated by D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. Although it is still unknown whether these receptor subtypes are expressed in the distinct populations of striatal neurons (23Hersch S.M. Ciliax B.J. Gutekunst C.A. Rees H.D. Heilman C.J. Yung K.K. Bolam J.P. Ince E. Yi H. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5222-5237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or within the same populations (24Surmeier D.J. Yan Z. Song W.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it has been believed that the parallel and balanced activation of these two pathways and their synergistic action control striatal motor functions. Our findings indicate that the parallel and balanced activation is maintained by the presence of AC5 that is coupled to both dopaminergic pathways. In the absence of AC5, AC6 and AC1 are still present but cannot fully compensate for the function of AC5. The supersensitive response to D1 dopaminergic stimulation (Fig.5A) mimicked the supersensitivity in Parkinson's disease. As in Parkinson's disease, AC5−/− also had decreased D1 dopaminergic receptor expression (21Marshall J.F. Navarrete R. Joyce J.N. Brain Res. 1989; 493: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Gerfen C.R. Engber T.M. Mahan L.C. Susel Z. Chase T.N. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Science. 1990; 250: 1429-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). Because there was no up-regulation of G protein or PKA expression, changes responsible for this supersensitization must be located downstream of PKA, although we do not deny that compensation in the AC pathway could include increased translation and/or post-translational activation of remaining AC isoforms or other pathway components. The exact molecular mechanisms for this paradoxical phenomenon have also remained unexplained in Parkinson's disease, but a very recent study suggested that a switch in the regulation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signal may be involved (25Gerfen C.R. Miyachi S. Paletzki R. Brown P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5042-5054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease and the lack of its major effector enzyme isoform may be similar in many aspects, and thus AC5−/− may be useful to explore the molecular mechanisms for supersensitization in future studies. The robust nature of our finding, however, suggests that the neurotransmitter signal at the level of an effector isoform,i.e. the integration of multiple receptor subtype signals on one effector isoform, may be as equally important as the neurotransmitter signal at the level of their respective receptor subtypes in regulating neuronal functions that has been more widely recognized. Our findings also implicate that targeting an AC isoform(s), such as AC5, in future pharmacotherapy may be an effective way to treat motor dysfunction in human diseases (26Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M. Kuramochi H. Saito S. Yamazaki H. Toya Y. Sakai I. Homcy C.J. Nishikawa K. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol.

Here, we report that inhibition of p53 decreases apoptotic and necrotic tissue injury as well as inflammatory cell response. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with 2.2 mg/kg pifithrin-alpha (PFT), a p53-inactivating agent, or the vehicle DMSO 30 min before intravenous exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vehicle-pretreated animals, LPS induced significant apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes, which was associated with intrahepatic leukocyte recruitment, microvascular dysfunction, and enzyme release. Inhibition of p53 effectively attenuated (P<0.05) hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis, but also reduced leukocyte recruitment and microvascular dysfunction. Western blot analysis revealed that PFT lowered the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic p53 ratio and reduced both activation of NF-kappaB and cleavage of procaspase 3 (P<0.05). In parallel, immunohistochemistry of PFT-pretreated, but not vehicle-pretreated, endotoxic animals exhibited nuclear p53 exclusion and reduced NF-kappaB p65 staining. This indicates that p53 mediates, at least in part, LPS-associated apoptosis and contributes to inflammatory endotoxic tissue injury through leukocyte activation and intraorgan sequestration."

Although several transcription factors including Beta-2, Ribe3b1, and Pdx-1 have been shown to play a role in glucose stimulation of insulin gene expression, the exact molecular mechanism(s) by which this regulation occurs is unknown. Previous data demonstrate that the transcription factors Beta-2/NeuroD1 and Pdx-1, which are involved in glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression, interact with the histone acetylase p300, suggesting a role for histone acetylation in glucose regulation of the insulin gene expression. We report that exposure of mouse insulinoma 6 cells to high concentrations of glucose results in hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter, which correlates with the increased level of insulin gene transcription. In addition, we demonstrate that hyperacetylation of histone H4 in response to high concentrations of glucose also occurs at the glucose transporter-2 gene promoter. Using histone deacetylase inhibitors, we show that increases in histone H4 acetylation cause stimulation of insulin gene transcription even in the absence of high concentrations of glucose. Furthermore, we show that fibroblasts, which lack insulin gene expression, also lack histone acetylation at the insulin gene promoter.

Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, London, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo2000Google Scholar). The pancreatic β cells respond to high blood glucose levels first by secreting insulin from the secretory granules followed by up-regulation of insulin gene transcription and translation as a more long term response (1LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, London, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo2000Google Scholar). A number of other proteins have also been shown to be required for the glucose responsiveness of pancreatic β cells, including glucokinase and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2) 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT-2, glucose transporter-2; Ac, acetyl; TSA, trichostatin A; MIN6, mouse insulinoma 6; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin IP; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcriptase; NHF1α, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha.

Transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes is a very complex process that requires the cooperation of a number of transcription factors, as well as various co-activator and co-repressor proteins, which modulate histone structure (28Berger S.L.

In the case of histone acetylation, it has been demonstrated that a cooperation between histone acetylases and deacetylases leads to activation of gene expression only in response to specific stimuli (35Brownell J.E.

Previous data indicate that two of the insulin gene transcription factors required for glucose-regulated expression, Beta-2/NeuroD1 and Pdx-1, interact with the histone acetylase p300 (17Sharma A. Moore M. Marcora E. Lee J.E. Qiu Y. Samaras S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

This prompted us to investigate whether changes in histone acetylation levels play a role in regulation of insulin gene expression by glucose. We report that high concentrations of glucose stimulate insulin gene transcription by mediating hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter in the insulinoma cell line MIN6. Cell Culture—MIN6 cells of passage 20 to 24 were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (41Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out with MIN6 cells of passage less than 30. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For glucose regulation experiments, cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and grown overnight, unless otherwise indicated, in DMEM without fetal bovine serum containing the indicated glucose concentration(s). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—poly(A) RNA from total RNA was isolated using the GenElute Direct mRNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with DNaseI (Sigma), the poly(A) RNA was reverse-transcribed using enhanced avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma). The resulting cDNAs were used as template for PCR with oligonucleotides to amplify the insulin and β-actin genes (42Roderigo-Milne H. Hauge-Evans A.C. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used are listed in Table I. The primers for the β-actin gene were designed to cross an intron so that contamination with genomic DNA can be detected, which would result in a PCR product of 330 bp versus 243 bp from the cDNA (43Rout U.K. Armant D.R. Reprod. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PCR reactions (20-μl volume) contained 20 ng of cDNA, 300 μm dNTPs, 2.5 pmol of appropriate oligonucleotide primers, and 1.5 units of JumpStart AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase (Sigma). PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were separated on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma). The bands were visualized using a ChemiDoc System BioRad Imager (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One imaging software (Bio-Rad) as a function of both band size and band intensity (intensity/mm2).Table IList of sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in this studyGeneAmplified regionaWhere indicated the numbers represent the position of the amplified fragment relative to the known transcriptional start site for the gene.ReferencesOligonucleotids sequenceMouse insulin I gene42Roderigo-Milne H.

Approximately 3 × 107 MIN6 or NIH-3T3 cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde (1% final concentration). After lysis of the cells, the nuclear extracts were sonicated with glass beads (0.1 g) for five 10-s pulses at 60% power using a Tekmar Sonic Disruptor. One-third of the sample was used for immunoprecipitation with acetyl-histone H3 (K9, K14) or acetyl-histone H4 (K5, K8, K12, K16) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The samples were pre-cleared with 20 μl of blocked Pansorbin Staph A cells (Calbiochem). After 4-fold dilution of the samples in IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and incubation with 2 μg of specific antibodies or rabbit IgG (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with blocked Staph A cells. After washing twice in dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.2% Sarkosyl) and four times with IP wash buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, and 1% deoxycholic acid), the immunocomplexes were eluted twice from the Staph A cells (with 150 μl of 1% SDS in 50 mm NaHCO3). The cross-links were reversed by adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and 1 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A and by incubating at 65 °C for 8 h. After treating with 1.5 μl of proteinase K (10 μg/μl) the samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and subsequently ethanol-precipitated using 20 μg of glycogen as a carrier. PCR Analysis of Immunoprecipitated DNA—All PCR reactions were performed on a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2 μl of primers (2.5 pmol/μl). The linear range for each primer pair was determined empirically, using different amounts of MIN6 and NIH-3T3 genomic DNA. The PCR reactions and the quantification of the obtained bands were carried out as described above. The PCR products obtained with the immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to the products obtained with the total input DNA. The primers used for PCR are listed in Table I. A detailed PCR protocol is available upon request. All of the PCR products obtained had the expected size. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. Statistical Analysis—Comparison of the histone acetylation or insulin mRNA levels from MIN6 cells grown on 3 or 30 mm glucose were performed using the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Glucose Mediates Hyperacetylation of Histone H4 at the Insulin Gene Promoter—To test whether high concentrations of glucose mediate changes in histone acetylation at the insulin gene promoter in the insulinoma cell line MIN6, we utilized the ChIP assay with acetyl histone H3 or acetyl histone H4 antibodies. To quantify the amount of insulin gene promoter associated with acetylated histone H3 or histone H4, the total input and the immunoprecipitated DNA were used as template for PCR with primers against the mouse insulin I gene promoter (covers the promoter region from –10 to –281). The results shown in Fig. 1A indicate that exposure of MIN6 cells to high concentrations of glucose (30 mm) causes an increase in histone H4 acetylation at the insulin gene promoter. However, there is no significant change in acetyl histone H3 levels in response to high levels of glucose. MIN6 cells incubated with 30 mm glucose displayed an ∼4- to 5-fold increase in acetylated histone H4 levels compared with cells incubated with 3 mm glucose in five independent experiments (Fig. 1B). Although in this experiment the MIN6 cells were incubated overnight with low and high glucose media, we observed the increase in histone H4 acetylation even after a 2-h incubation period with 30 mm glucose (data not shown). To verify that the observed increase in histone H4 acetylation levels in response to high glucose concentrations correlated with increases in insulin gene transcription, we quantified the insulin mRNA levels in MIN6 cells grown on low or high glucose media. RT-PCR analysis performed using cDNA from low or high glucose-incubated MIN6 cells indicate a 2.5-fold increase in insulin mRNA levels in response to high glucose (30 mm) compared with the β-actin levels used as control (Fig. 1, C and D). As a control for contamination of the cDNA with genomic DNA, we employed actin primers that give an additional larger PCR product when the sample is contaminated with genomic DNA (Fig. 1, C and D). The acetyl histone H3 and histone H4 antibodies used in this study specifically recognize acetylated histones in Western blots with MIN6 cell extracts (Fig. 1E). Hyperacetylation of Histone H4 at the GLUT-2 Promoter in Response to Glucose—To test whether glucose causes increases in histone acetylation at other β cell-specific promoters, we used the same immunoprecipitated and total DNA samples as template in PCR analysis with primers against the GLUT-2 promoter (Fig. 2). In the presence of low concentrations of glucose (3 mm), the level of acetylated histone H4 associated with the GLUT-2 promoter was minimal; however, at high concentrations of glucose (30 mm) the acetylated histone H4 levels at the GLUT-2 promoter increased drastically (Fig. 2). The level of acetylated histone H3 at the GLUT-2 promoter remained the same on low and high glucose (Fig. 2). This indicates that high levels of glucose (30 mm) cause hyperacetylation of histone H4 at both insulin and GLUT-2 gene promoters in MIN6 cells. Histone H4 Acetylation at the Insulin Gene Promoter Is Not Increased at High Concentrations ofl-Glucose—Activation of insulin gene transcription is regulated by cellular stress, as well as glucose (48Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.F. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To test that the observed increase in histone H4 acetylation is not because of secondary effects such osmotic stress caused by the high concentrations of glucose (30 mm) used in this experiment, we repeated the ChIP assay with acetyl histone H3 or histone H4 antibodies using l-glucose. Because l-glucose is not taken up by glucose transporters and thus is not metabolized, it should mimic the osmotic stress caused by high concentrations of extracellular d-glucose. The analysis of acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 levels associated with the insulin gene promoter in MIN6 cells grown on low (3 mm) or high (30 mm) l-glucose in the presence of 3 mm d-glucose indicates that there is no increase in histone H4 acetylation levels in response to high concentrations of l-glucose (Fig. 3). In summary, these data indicate that glucose causes hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter and that this effect is specific and is not caused by osmotic stress. Histone H4 Hyperacetylation at the Insulin and GLUT-2 Gene Promoters Increases in a Glucose Concentration-dependent Manner—It has been shown previously (1LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, London, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo2000Google Scholar, 49Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R.M. Cosgrove K.E. James R.F. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that insulin mRNA levels increase in a dose-dependent fashion in response to increasing glucose concentrations. To analyze the effects of increasing concentrations of glucose on the level of histone H4 acetylation at the insulin gene promoter, MIN6 cells were incubated in media containing 3, 5, 10, or 20 mm glucose for 3 h. Analysis of histone H3 and histone H4 acetylation levels using the ChIP assay demonstrated that histone H3 acetylation did not change significantly at the insulin and GLUT-2 gene promoters by increasing the glucose concentration (Fig. 4). However, the acetylation level of histone H4 at both promoters increased in parallel with increasing the glucose concentration (Fig. 4). As a control for this experiment we amplified the cad (carbamoyl phosphate synthase/aspartate transcarbamoylase/dihydroorotase) gene promoter using the same DNA immunoprecipitated with acetyl histone H3 or histone H4 antibodies and total DNA as template. We found that the levels of histone H3 acetylation at the cad promoter, whose expression is not glucose-regulated, did not change in response to increases in glucose concentration (Fig. 4, third panel). This experiment again confirms that the observed hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin and GLUT-2 promoters is glucose-specific. The Decrease in Histone H4 Acetylation on Low Glucose Is Mediated by the Recruitment of Histone Deacetylases to the Insulin Gene Promoter—Histone deacetylases such as HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been shown to repress gene expression by decreasing the acetylation status of histones at specific promoters (28Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that the decrease in histone H4 acetylation on low levels of glucose (3 mm) was because of the recruitment of histone deacetylases to the insulin gene promoter. To address this question, we carried out the ChIP assay using acetyl histone H3 or histone H4 antibodies in MIN6 cells grown on media containing low or high glucose, in the presence or absence of the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) or sodium butyrate. The inhibition of histone deacetylases in MIN6 cells resulted in equal levels of both histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the insulin gene promoter on low and high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 5A). We obtained similar results with both inhibitors; however, the acetylation levels of both histone H3 and histone H4 were consistently lower with sodium butyrate-treated samples in three independent experiments, which is likely due to additional effects that sodium butyrate has on cultured cells (50Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The level of histone H4 acetylation at the insulin gene promoter on low levels of glucose was very similar to that of high concentrations of glucose. These data suggest that the reduced level of histone H4 acetylation on low concentrations of glucose is likely because of the active recruitment of deacetylases to the insulin gene promoter. To test whether the increase in histone H4 acetylation on low concentrations of glucose as observed with TSA treatment causes increased insulin gene transcription, we quantified the expression level of the insulin gene in MIN6 cells grown on media containing low or high concentrations of glucose treated with TSA by RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, the levels of insulin mRNA in MIN6 cells grown on low glucose-containing media was equal to that of high glucose-grown cells following TSA treatment. The obtained data are consistent with the idea that the decrease in histone H4 acetylation levels at the insulin gene promoter on low levels of glucose is because of the action of deacetylases and that increases in histone H4 acetylation levels correlate with increased insulin gene expression. Lack of Insulin Gene Expression in Fibroblasts Is Associated with a Lack of Histone Acetylation at the Insulin Gene Promoter—It has been shown that acetylated histones are normally associated with promoters of actively transcribed genes (28Berger S.L.

Our findings indicate that excessive cardiac NO formation can cause heart failure; however, under normal circumstances myoglobin constitutes the important barrier that efficiently protects the heart from nitrosative stress. The development of human heart failure is a complex process involving activation of neuro-humoral mechanisms, down-regulation of the β-adrenergic signal transduction cascade (1Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1634-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), induction of proinflammatory cytokines (2Levine B. Kalman J. Mayer L. Fillit H.M. Packer M. N.

Invest. 1990; 86: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and others. As a consequence, cardiac function is severely depressed and, in later stages, includes ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, and dilatation. Among the multiple alterations associated with heart failure, the induction of myocardial expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, NO synthase; iNOS, inducible NOS; LVDP, left ventricular developed pressure; WT, wild type; dP/dtmax, maximal speed of contraction.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, NO synthase; iNOS, inducible NOS; LVDP, left ventricular developed pressure; WT, wild type; dP/dtmax, maximal speed of contraction. synthase (iNOS; EC 1.14.13.39) has gained particular attention (5Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) because this “high output” isoform of NO synthases releases high levels of NO, which in cardiac myocytes is known to induce apoptosis (6Taimor G. Rakow A. Piper H.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2518-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), inhibit the respiratory chain (7Kelm M. Schafer S. Dahmann R. Dolu B. Perings S. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Strauer B.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 36: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and induce a negative inotropic effect even under basal conditions (8Kojda G. Kottenberg K. Nix P. Schlüter K.D. Piper H.M. Noack E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In view of this detrimental potential, the concept was developed that cardiac iNOS induction might be an important factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure (9De Belder A.J. Radomski M.W. Why H.J. Richardson P.J. Martin J.F. Br. Heart J. 1995; 74: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, there are recent experimental and clinical studies that failed to prove a causal relationship between iNOS induction and heart failure (10Paulus W.J. Frantz S. Kelly R.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2260-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For instance, there was no improvement of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after NOS inhibition (11Cotton J.M. Kearney M.T. MacCarthy P.A. Grocott-Mason R.M. McClean D.R. Heymes C. Richardson P.J. Shah A.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was even postulated that iNOS, by enhancing diastolic distensibility of the ventricles, might increase preload reserve and thereby support cardiac function under conditions of heart failure (12Heymes C. Vanderheyden M. Bronzwaer J.G. Shah A.M. Paulus W.J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3009-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice with high levels of cardiac specific overexpression of iNOS or endothelial NOS did not develop heart failure (13Heger J. Gödecke A. Flögel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kühn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Brunner F. Andrew P. Wolkart G. Zechner R. Mayer B. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3097-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the mammalian heart can tolerate long term exposure to high levels of NO. Thus, to date the role of iNOS in heart failure development is not clear, and the factors that govern cardiac NO toxicity are only poorly understood. Myoglobin, a cytosolic oxygen-binding heme protein, is highly expressed in the mammalian heart. Whereas its role in myocardial oxygen supply has been recognized for decades (15Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), only recently, with the generation of myoglobin knockout mice, have the additional functions of myoglobin been amenable to examination in vivo (16Garry D.J. Ordway G.A. Lorenz J.N. Radford N.B. Chin E.R. Grange R.W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Gödecke A. Flögel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10495-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has been shown that myoglobin, similarly to its relative, hemoglobin, is able to efficiently metabolizes nitric oxide in vivo, leading to an attenuation of the cardiac effects of NO (18Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Given the high expression level of myoglobin in the heart (200 μm), the question arises as to which extent NO synthesized in the cytosol by iNOS is able to escape from breakdown by myoglobin and induce a pathological phenotype. To explore the protective role of myoglobin under conditions of iNOS-induced nitrosative stress, we generated double transgenic mice deficient in myoglobin with a concomitant high level cardiac specific iNOS expression by crossing myoglobin-deficient mice (myo–/–) (17Gödecke A. Flögel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10495-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with tg-iNOS+ mice (13Heger J. Gödecke A. Flögel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kühn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By this genetic approach, we found myoglobin to be the critical barrier that normally prevents iNOS-induced nitrosative stress from causing heart failure. Mice—Mice were bred at the Tierversuchsanlage of the Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany. They were fed with a standard chow diet and received tap water ad libitum. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the national guidelines on animal care and approved by the Bezirksregierung Düsseldorf. tg-iNOS+ mice (FVB strain) (13Heger J. Gödecke A. Flögel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kühn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and myo–/– mice (NMRI strain) (17Gödecke A. Flögel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10495-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were crossed to obtain heterozygous tg-iNOS+/myo+/– mice. Double heterozygous males and females were intercrossed, and the F2 offspring was used for analysis. This approach allowed us to analyze the phenotype of both mutations independently of the different genetic backgrounds of both parent strains. The genotypes of mice were established by PCR according to published procedures (13Heger J. Gödecke A. Flögel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kühn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Gödecke A. Flögel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10495-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Histological and Expression Analysis—Mice were killed rapidly, and the ascending aorta was cannulated with a 23-gauge injection needle connected to a buffer reservoir. Hearts were briefly perfused free of blood with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed by perfusion with 4% buffered formalin at a perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg. Hearts were excised and postfixed in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin according to standard procedures. For isolation of RNA, hearts were rapidly excised, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized and extracted by the guanidinium-acidic phenol method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). 10–20 μg of total RNA were separated on 1.2% formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). A random prime-labeled 390-bp fragment corresponding to murine atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA (541–1035 bps, GenBank™ accession number K02781) and a 490-bp probe hybridizing to murine skeletal muscle actin (611–1090 bps, GenBank™ accession number BC014877) were used to detect gene expression on Northern blots, which were standardized by hybridization with a 444-bp fragment detecting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression (731–1184 bps, GenBank™ accession number M32599). Saline-perfused Hearts—Mice were injected intraperitoneal with 250 units of heparin and anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g × kg–1; intraperitoneal). Hearts were rapidly excised and transferred for preparation of the aortic trunk to cold, oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The aorta was cannulated, and hearts were perfused in a non-recirculating Langendorff mode at constant pressure (100 mm Hg, i.e. 140 cm H2O) with a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.1 mm MgSO4, 24.9 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm l-arginine equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Coronary flow was measured with a transit time ultrasound flowmeter located above the aortic cannula (Transonics, Ithaca, NY). After equilibration, perfusion was switched to constant volume at a perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg. LVDP was recorded by insertion of a buffer-filled balloon (prepared from thin polyethylene foil) into the left ventricle, which was connected to a Statham P23XL pressure transducer. The volume of the balloon was adjusted to induce an end-diastolic pressure of 5 mm Hg. Data were recorded using a MacLab data acquisition system. 31P-NMR analysis was performed essentially as described (17Gödecke A. Flögel U. Zanger K. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10495-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cardiac Function in Vivo—Mice were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g × kg–1, intraperitoneal) and placed on a warming table to keep the body temperature at 37 °C throughout the experiment. The left common carotid artery was carefully prepared, and a Millar 1.4 French pressure-volume catheter was advanced through an incision in the carotid artery into the left ventricle. The catheter was connected via the Aria™ AD converter system to a personal computer. Data processing was performed with the dedicated IOX™ software (EMKA Technologies, Paris, France). Calibration of conductance catheters was performed by the high salt injection method according to published procedures. Acute systemic NOS inhibition was performed by bolus intraperitoneal injection of the NOS inhibitor ethylisothiourea (20 μmol × kg–1) after recording of the basal parameters. The effective NOS inhibition was recognized by the instantaneous rise in blood pressure. Data for the “NOS inhibition series” were recorded 10 min after an ethylisothiourea injection. Magnetic Resonance Imaging—High resolution magnetic resonance images of the beating mice hearts were acquired using a Bruker DRX 9.4 Tesla vertical bore NMR spectrometer. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%), an electrocardiogram was administered, and a respiration-triggered fast gradient echo (FLASH) cine sequence was applied for imaging during the whole cardiac cycle. The following parameters were used: flip angle, 45°; echo time, 1.8 ms; repetition time, 5 ms (20 frames per R-R interval); in-plane resolution, 117 × 117 μm2; field of view, 30 × 30 mm2; and matrix, 256 × 256. Statistical Analysis—Data derived from repeated measures were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad) Otherwise, data were compared with Student's unpaired t test. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Because the iNOS transgene was transmitted independently of the myoglobin locus, the breeding of double transgenic heterozygous mice (myo+/– tg-iNOS+/– × myo+/– tg-iNOS+/–) resulted in the generation of all possible combinations of genotypes. Myoglobin expression in heterozygous mutant animals (myo+/–) as determined by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels reaches approximately half of the wild type (WT) level (WT: 0.77 ± 0.2 arbitrary units; myo–/–, 0.34 ± 0.07 arbitrary units; n = 5–6; p < 0.05). This allowed us to study dose-dependent effects of myoglobin on structural and functional consequences induced by iNOS overexpression. In the present study we analyzed five different groups of genotypes, i.e. iNOS+/myo+/– (50% myoglobin) and iNOS+/myo–/– (no myoglobin) mice, while WT, myo–/–, and tg-iNOS+ animals served as controls. Inspection of cardiac morphology at the age of 5 months revealed substantially enlarged hearts (Fig. 1a) and an increase of the cardiac weight index in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice by 33% (Fig. 1b). As can be seen, hearts of animals with all other combinations of genotypes did not deviate from the WT value. When compared with WT, myo–/–, and tg-iNOS+ hearts (Fig. 2, a and b), the hypertrophic tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts developed ventricular dilatation (Fig. 2, d and e), which was revealed by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging as well as histological techniques. Ventricular dilatation was accompanied by interstitial cardiac fibrosis occurring only in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts (Fig. 2f) but not in WT hearts or any other combination of genotypes, including tg-iNOS+ hearts (Fig. 2c). We also analyzed whether the morphological changes were associated with reactivation of the fetal cardiac gene expression profile, which typically occurs during the development of hypertrophy and heart failure. Only tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts showed markedly elevated ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal muscle actin expressions, which are markers for cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 2, g and h).Fig. 2Cardiac alterations on the structural and gene expression level.a and d, transversal magnetic resonance imaging sections of tg-iNOS+ (a) and tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts (d) (ages 74 and 78 days, respectively). b and e, hematoxylineosin staining of cross sections of paraffin embedded hearts reveals ventricular dilatation in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts (e) but not in tg-iNOS+ hearts (b). Magnified view of hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections reveals that tg-iNOS+ hearts (c) are devoid of interstitial fibrosis, which is found in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts (f). g and h, activation of ventricular expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)(g) and skeletal muscle actin (h) is specific to tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We assessed cardiac function in vivo by means of a Millar 1.4 French pressure-volume catheter (Table I). Under basal conditions, the cardiac function of WT and myo–/– and tg-iNOS+ mice was not different with respect to heart rate, LVDP, cardiac output, or end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes. tg-iNOS+ mice displayed only a reduced dP/dtmin (1100 mm Hg × s–1) when compared with WT. However, when myoglobin was absent in addition to iNOS overexpression, several other parameters were also changed; for example, contractility (dP/dtmax) decreased by ∼30% in comparison to control strains (WT, myo, and tg-iNOS+ mice). In addition, the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were significantly higher than in mice of all other genotypes. Therefore, the pressure volume loops of tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts derived from these in vivo measurements were shifted to the right, indicating ventricular dilatation (Fig. 3). Ejection fraction decreased from 61% (WT) to 31% in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice, and the stroke volume was attenuated by 20% leading to a lower cardiac output.Table IAssessment of cardiac in vivo by means of a Millar tip pressure-volume catheterBasal conditionsWT (12)myo-/- (13)tg-iNOS+ (12)tg-iNOS+/myo-/- (12)HR (beats/min)579 ± 67583 ± 73559 ± 42559 ± 61LVDP (mm Hg)88 ± 7.484 ± 883 ± 877 ± 11ap < 0.05 versus WT.Ves (μl)11.0 ± 5.312 ± 413 ± 526 ± 6ap < 0.05 versus WT.Ved (μl)25.1 ± 7.827 ± 728 ± 636 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus WT.SV (μl)14.4 ± 4.015 ± 415 ± 511 ± 5EF (%)61 ± 1456 ± 1354 ± 1231 ± 11ap < 0.05 versus WT.CO (μl/min)8324 ± 22388840 ± 23968319 ± 28486034 ± 2262dP/dtmax (mm Hg/s)10838 ± 151910110 ± 15389943 ± 16487254 ± 2205ap < 0.05 versus WT.dP/dtmin (mm Hg/s)-6942 ± 979-6362 ± 1545-5783 ± 1169ap < 0.05 versus WT.-5385 ± 1116ap < 0.05 versus WT.NOS inhibitionWT (6)myo-/- (6)tg-iNOS+ (6)tg-iNOS+/myo-/- (6)HR (beats/min)546 ± 97532 ± 59504 ± 52564 ± 52LVDP (mm Hg)104 ± 21bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.110 ± 20bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.99 ± 18bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.102 ± 27bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.Ves (μl)17 ± 7bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.17 ± 3bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.18 ± 5bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.28 ± 4ap < 0.05 versus WT.Ved (μl)29 ± 1127 ± 431 ± 635 ± 4SV (μl)12 ± 710 ± 2bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.14 ± 66 ± 2bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.EF (%)40 ± 14bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.37 ± 5bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.43 ± 13bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.18 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus WT.,bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.CO (μl/min)6120 ± 27735399 ± 1097bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.6867 ± 29793489 ± 1111bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.dP/dtmax (mm Hg/s)11433 ± 305911396 ± 149710691 ± 20398465 ± 3446bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.dP/dtmin (mm Hg/s)-8783 ± 1655bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.-8272 ± 2144bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.-7702 ± 2055bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.-7483 ± 2796bp < 0.05 versus basal conditions.a p < 0.05 versus WT.b p < 0.05 versus basal conditions. Open table in a new tab We further analyzed whether the observed changes were reversible after acute NOS inhibition. Systemic application of the NOS inhibitor ethylisothiourea 10 min prior to the measurements increased LVDP by 15–20 mm Hg in all groups analyzed, which is due to an increase in total peripheral resistance. Hearts of double-transgenic tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice reached the same levels of LVDP as the control groups (Table I). This increase, however, was accompanied by a small elevation of contractility (dP/dtmax, +5%) in control strains (WT, myo–/–, and tg-iNOS+ mice). Note that under NOS inhibition, tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice showed a proportionally higher increase in dP/dtmax (+17%) than all the other genotypes, leading to a significant augmentation of contractility but without reaching the WT level. The increase in total peripheral resistance increased end-systolic volume in all groups, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and ejection fraction. To study the effects of iNOS-derived NO on cardiac energetics, we performed additional functional analyses combined with 31P-NMR spectroscopy under defined experimental conditions in a functionally and metabolically stable, isolated heart preparation. Consistent with earlier findings (13Heger J. Gödecke A. Flögel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kühn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), coronary perfusion pressure of tg-iNOS+ hearts was considerably lower than in WT and myo–/– hearts (–35%), reflecting the high level of iNOS activity (Fig. 4). A similar degree of vasodilation was found for tg-iNOS+/myo+/– and tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts. Whereas iNOS overexpression affected coronary tone independently of myoglobin, contractile parameters were altered only in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts. The LVDP of tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts decreased by 33%, and the dP/dtmax by 38% (Fig. 4). Assessment of energetic parameters revealed that oxygen consumption (VO2) in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts was decreased by 25%. This reduction was accompanied by a decrease of phosphocreatine (PCr) levels (25%) and a doubling of inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Fig. 4). Free ADP levels, as calculated from the creatine phosphokinase equilibrium constant, increased by 37% (data not shown). To directly assess the role of myoglobin in NO breakdown, we analyzed cardiac NO metabolites NO2− and NOx(NO2−+NO3−) in coronary venous effluates of isolated hearts. As shown in Fig. 5, the predominant NO metabolite released from tg-iNOS+ hearts was NO3−, because NOx by far exceeded NO2− release. The same result was obtained for tg-iNOS+/myo+/– hearts. However, when myoglobin was completely lacking (tg-iNOS+/myo–/–), NO was preferentially converted to nitrite, reaching 50% of cardiac NOx formation. Using a double transgenic model, we present conclusive evidence that nitrosative stress induced by massive cardiac overexpression of iNOS is efficiently attenuated by myoglobin. This clearly demonstrates the cardioprotective potential of this heme protein, which is highly expressed in the heart. Our findings have important implications for the concept that cardiac iNOS expression, frequently associated with heart failure, might be causally involved in the development of this disease. Using a genetic approach, we generated transgenic mice with a high level of cardiac specific overexpression of iNOS and different levels of myoglobin ranging from 100% (myo+/+) to 50% (myo+/–) to 0% (myo–/–). Only mice with a complete lack of myoglobin developed signs of heart failure characterized by the following: 1) increased cardiac weight index; 2) ventricular dilatation; and 3) reduced ejection fraction. These alterations were associated with ventricular fibrosis and a reactivation of the fetal gene expression program typically observed in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Because hearts from tg-iNOS+/myo+/– mice expressing only 50% of WT myoglobin levels do not show the detrimental consequences of iNOS overexpression, myoglobin, even at reduced levels, acts as an efficient scavenger of NO and protects the heart. Thus, tg-iNOS+/ myo–/– mice can be viewed as the first model that allows us to study the consequences of chronic iNOS-derived NO formation on cardiac function and morphology without confounding influences of cardiac NO metabolism. Analysis of cardiac function both under in vivo and in vitro conditions revealed substantial functional depression in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– double transgenic hearts as characterized by a reduction of LVDP and dP/dtmax, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. In addition, we observed a shift of the pressure-volume loops toward higher volumes reflecting ventricular dilatation, which was confirmed by histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses. It is important to note that even reduced myoglobin levels in tg-iNOS+/myo+/– hearts were sufficient to completely abolish all of these alterations. The cardiac phenotype of tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice is the result of long term NO-induced structural changes with cardiac fibrosis together with the immediate cardiodepressive action of the continuously formed NO. In fact, when NO synthases were inhibited acutely by ethylisothiourea, a partial recovery of contractility was observed. However, because of myocardial remodeling, WT levels of cardiac function were not restored. The observed cardiodepression in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– mice may be the result of cGMP-dependent mechanisms (5Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) or the consequence of cGMP-independent actions such as inhibition of the respiratory chain (20Zhao G. Bernstein R.D. Hintze T.H. Coron. Artery Dis. 1999; 10: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 31P-NMR spectroscopy revealed a reduction of cardiac creatine phosphate levels associated with an increase in [PI] and calculated [ADP]. This change in cardiac energetics was accompanied by a reduction of oxygen consumption. Thus, when myoglobin is lacking, iNOS-derived NO is likely to critically interfere with the respiratory chain, leading to attenuation of the phosphorylation potential. Inhibition of complex IV of the respiratory chain by NO is a well studied mechanism that occurs at nanomolar concentrations of NO at isolated mitochondria (21Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Modulation of cardiac oxygen consumption by NO was also reported for the dog heart in situ (22Bernstein R.D. Ochoa F.Y. Xu X. Forfia P. Shen W. Thompson C.I. Hintze T.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), isolated guinea pig heart (23Decking U.K. Flesche C.W. Gödecke A. Schrader J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2460-H2465PubMed Google Scholar), and myocardial tissue pieces (24Xie Y.W. Shen W. Zhao G. Xu X. Wolin M.S. Hintze T.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Loke K.E. Laycock S.K. Mital S. Wolin M.S. Bernstein R. Oz M. Addonizio L. Kaley G. Hintze T.H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that myoglobin efficiently protects mitochondria from NO even when synthesized at substantially elevated rates. Thus, myoglobin is likely to keep cardiac NO levels below the critical concentration required to alter mitochondrial function. It is also conceivable that the long term depression of cardiac function and energetics in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts may have triggered the induction of hypertrophy in order to compensate for the reduced cardiac efficacy. Further support for the NO protective action of myoglobin comes from direct measurements of NO metabolites released by the heart. Whereas NO3− was the predominant cardiac NO metabolite in tg-iNOS+ and tg-iNOS+/myo+/– hearts, approximately equal levels of NO2− and NO3− were released by tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts. NO3− is the major NO metabolite formed in reaction with oxygenated heme proteins such as myoglobin. The shift toward nitrite supports the view that a substantially higher proportion of NO was released from tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts, which, according to the well known reaction shown in Reaction 1,4NO+O2+2H2O→4NO2−+4H+Reaction 1 might have reacted with oxygen dissolved in huge amounts in the perfusion buffer to form nitrite (26Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that NO in reaction with cytochrome c oxidase may be converted to nitrite (27Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because we have shown that the respiratory chain function is affected by NO in the absence of myoglobin, it is conceivable that this reaction may gain impact in tg-iNOS+/myo–/– hearts and that it contributes to the elevated cardiac NO2− formation. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the unexpectedly benign phenotype of mice with the cardiac specific iNOS overexpression recently reported by us (13Heger J. Gödecke A.

https://openalex.org/W1963887562,Collective excitations have been observed in liquid aluminum oxide at high temperatures by combining a containerless sample environment with inelastic x-ray scattering. The excitation spectra show a well-defined triplet peak structure at lower wave vectors Q (1 to 6 nanometers-1) and a single quasi-elastic peak at higher Q. The high-Q spectra are well described by kinetic theory. The low-Q spectra require a frequency-dependent viscosity and provide previously unknown experimental constraints on the behavior of liquids at the interface between atomistic and continuum theory.
https://openalex.org/W1993227701,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in several human tumors both in vitro and in vivo, however, some tumors remain resistant for poorly understood reasons. Using a quantitative DNA fragmentation assay for apoptosis, we have shown that human prostate cancer cells are resistant to a wide range of TRAIL doses up to 500 ng/ml. However, translation inhibitors, such as anisomycin, cycloheximide, emetine, harringtonine, and puromycin, unlike several transcription inhibitors, significantly sensitized PC3-neomycin (PC3-neo) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These effects were inhibited in PC3 cells engineered to express bcl2 (PC3-bcl2). Translation inhibitors led to activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which plays a role in this sensitization process because inhibition of JNK activation resulted in protection against TRAIL plus translation inhibitor-induced apoptosis. JNK activation may be required for this process, but it is not sufficient because activation of JNK using an MEKK2 expression vector did not mimic the sensitizing effect of translation inhibitors. Other stress-activated protein kinases, such as ERK and p38, play an insignificant role in determining the apoptotic sensitivity. We conclude that activation of JNK is required for sensitization of PC3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by translation inhibitors in cells that are otherwise TRAIL-resistant. However, in addition to JNK activation, other aspects of translation inhibition such as the suppressed activity of apoptosis-inhibitory proteins or activation of other signal transduction pathways must also be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1977913578,"This study was aimed to determine whether β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulated by isoproterenol (ISO) activates signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in mouse heart and, if so, to examine the underlying mechanism. We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60–120 min), which was fully abolished by β-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in β-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, β-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that β-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.

It is widely accepted that when the heart is subject to neurohumoral factors or mechanical pressure overload, cardiomyocytes exhibit hypertrophic response, which is a leading predictor of heart failure (1Molkentin J.D. Wdorn G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is initiated by endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine factors that activate a variety of intracellular signaling pathways and ultimately modulate transcription factors and gene expression (2Sadoshima J.

Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that stimulation of myocardium β-ARs results in cardiac remodeling characterized by increased cell size, reexpression of the “fetal gene” program (atrial natriuretic factor and skeletal α-actin), and organization of actin cytoskeleton (6Dzimiri N. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 465-501PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying β-AR-mediated cardiac remodeling in vivo, however, remains largely unclear. Recently, it has been reported that Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT), a newly discovered intracellular signal transduction pathway, may play an important role in the process of cardiac remodeling. In vivo studies have demonstrated that Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 kinases as well as STATs are activated in the rat heart during acute pressure overloading (8Pan J. Fukuda K. Kodama H. Makino S. Takahashi T. Sano M. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Jak/STAT also responds to many cytokines and growth factors (9Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The binding of ligands to receptor leads to the activation of the Jak tyrosine kinase family, and subsequently, the activated receptor-kinase complexes recruit and activate members of the STAT family by phosphorylation. As a result, the phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to response elements in the promoters of target genes, thereby regulating gene expression. Up to date, seven mammalian STAT proteins have been identified. Among these proteins, STAT3 is highlighted as a critical mediator of cardiac remodeling and survival of cardiomyocytes (11Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Negoro S. Kunisada K. Tone E. Funamoto M. Oh H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Cardiovasc.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29717-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has suggested that IL-6 family of cytokines plays an important role in the activation of STAT3 (11Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) interacts with membrane-bound receptors, which consist of a common signaltransducing subunit, gp130, and various ligand-binding sub-units. Propagation of these cytokine signals requires gp130, which activates STAT3 by binding to its SH2 domain via phosphotyrosine residues in the gp130 cytoplasmic domain. We hypothesized that Jak/STAT pathway could be activated by β-AR stimulation and then involved in β-AR-induced cardiac remodeling. To test this hypothesis, the effect of isoproterenol, a β-AR agonist, on activation of STAT3 in mouse heart was studied. Materials and Animals—Materials were obtained from the following sources. Isoproterenol (ISO), propranolol, atenolol, amrinone, and goat IgG were from (Sigma). Anti-phospho-STAT3 was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-STAT3 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Murine IL-6 ELISA kit was from Diaclone (Besancon, France). Recombinant murine IL-6 was from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, United Kingdom). Goat anti-murine IL-6 polyclonal antibody was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Male 8-week-old BALB/c mice (weighing 18–20 g) and 1-day-old Balb/c mice were obtained from the Medical Experimental Animal Center of Peking University. Experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethical Aspects of Research Involving Animals of the Peking University Health Science Center. Western Blot Analysis—Mice were treated with ISO (15 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection. The left ventricular myocardium was excised at various time points and homogenized by using a Polytron homogenizer with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 0.1 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using the manufacturer's instructions, and the extracts were stored at -70 °C before use. For Western blot analysis, samples (30 μg each) were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies to phospho-STAT3, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. The peroxidase reaction products were visualized by LumiGLO® chemiluminescent substrate (New England Biolabs). The same membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT3 antibody to determine the total protein abundance using a similar procedure. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin sections (6 μm) were deparaffinized, hydrated, and pretreated by boiling in 0.01 mol/liter phosphatebuffered saline (pH 6.0) for 10 min. After treatment for 30 min with 5% normal rabbit serum, samples were treated with polyclonal STAT3 antibody overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200 dilution) and the peroxidase activity was visualized by using diamine benzidine, resulting in a brown precipitate. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and mouse hearts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The samples were treated with DNase I and then subjected to first-strand synthesis using oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Superscript II). Mouse IL-6, LIF, CNTF, CT-1, and β-actin mRNA were amplified by PCR using the following primers (14Ito Y. Yamamoto M. Li M. Doyu M. Tanaka F. Mutch T. Mitsuma T. Sobue G.

The PCR mixture was incubated on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Stratagene) using various cycles. The reaction conditions involved denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 20 s with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min, 30 s. After amplification, products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Cell Culture—Primary ventricular myocytes were prepared as described previously (16Gray M.O. Long C.S. Kalinyak J.E. Li H.T. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Ventricles from 1-day-old BALB/c mice were minced, and cells were isolated by multiple rounds of 8-min-long tissue dissociation with 0.01% trypsin. After each incubation with trypsin, the supernatant was added to an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and all of the supernatants were combined. The cardiomyocytes were collected by differential adhesiveness. Cardiomyocyte-enriched suspensions were removed from the culture dishes and plated at a density of 150–200 cells/mm2 after overnight incubation. Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine to prevent fibroblast proliferation. Cardiac fibroblasts obtained during the preplating step of the myocytes isolation procedure were maintained in complete culture medium, allowed to proliferate, and then trypsinized and passaged once at 1:3 dilution. Cardiac fibroblasts in the third passages were used. By immunostaining and by examination of the morphology of the cells, it has been indicated that the cultured cells were pure cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IL-6 levels in serum, myocardium homogenates, or cell culture medium were measured by ELISA using commercially available kit (Diaclone) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As reported by the manufacturer, this kit is a solidphase sandwich ELISA. A specific anti-IL-6 antibody was coated onto the wells of the microtiter strips. Standards of known IL-6 content, control specimens, and unknown samples were placed into the wells by pipette followed by the addition of biotinylated secondary antibody. After a first incubation and the removal of excess secondary antibody, streptavidin peroxidase was added, which bound to the biotinylated antibody to complete the 4-member sandwich. After a second incubation and washing to remove all of the unbound enzyme, a substrate (tetra-methyl benzidine) solution was then added to produce color. The intensity of this colored product is directly proportional to the concentration of IL-6 present in the sample. Absorbance was read with a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm. In Vivo Antibodies Treatment—Goat anti-murine IL-6 polyclonal antibody was obtained from R&D Systems (<10 ng of endotoxin/mg of polyclonal antibody). Goat IgG was used as an isotype control antibody. Four male 8-week-old BALB/c mice were given 200 μg of anti-murine IL-6-neutralizing antibody intraperitoneally 30 min before ISO treatment (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal). Control mice received intraperitoneal injection of goat IgG (200 μg each, n = 4). At the conclusion of the study, all of the mice were sacrificed and the blood and tissue samples were collected for further analysis. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between the means of the groups was determined by one-way ANOVA or unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. ISO Activates Jak/STAT Pathway in Mouse Myocardium— Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of mice with ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) for 1 or 2 h markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium without altering the protein abundance of STAT3 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the phosphorylation status of STAT1, STAT5, and STAT6 was unaffected by β-AR stimulation (data not shown). Using immunohistochemical staining, we examined whether the increase in STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation after ISO treatment was correlated with its changes in subcellular localization. Mouse myocardium treated with ISO for 2 h was processed for immunohistochemical staining with specific rabbit antibody to STAT3 (upper panel). As shown in Fig. 1B, although nontreated myocardium showed little nuclear staining for STAT3, clear nuclear staining was observed in mouse myocardium treated with ISO for 2 h. To further explore whether the increased accumulation of STAT3 in the nucleus was tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, we also performed the immunohistochemical staining with rabbit anti-pSTAT3 antibody (lower panel) and the results showed a similar staining pattern. These findings indicate that ISO causes delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and mediates its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. cAMP-mediate β-AR-induced STAT3 Activation—Fig. 2A shows that phosphorylation of STAT3 was completely inhibited by pretreatment with a nonselective β-AR antagonist, propranolol (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), but only partially inhibited by atenolol, a selective β1-AR antagonist, indicating that ISO-induced STAT3 activation was probably mediated by both β1-AR and β2-AR. Because β-AR stimulation increases intracellular cAMP formation, cAMP signaling in mammalian cells is terminated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which could catalyze the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides to 5′-nucleotide monophosphates so that inhibition of the breakdown of cAMP by PDE inhibitors would produce a sustained increase in the intracellular level of cAMP (6Dzimiri N. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 465-501PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next evaluated the possible role of this important second messenger in ISO-induced STAT3 activation by using amrinone, a widely used PDE3 inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 2B, ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by pretreatment with amrinone in a dose-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that ISO-induced STAT3 activation is mainly mediated by β-AR-cAMP signaling cascade. β-AR Stimulation Up-regulates Gene Expression of IL-6 Family Cytokines and IL-6 Secretion—In contrast to the present in vivo study, our preliminary in vitro studies have shown that ISO could not increase the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in either cultured cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts (data not shown). This discrepancy suggests that there are some key factors missing in cultured myocytes or fibroblasts. Because IL-6 family of cytokines has been implicated in the regulation of STAT3 activation, we examined the potential effect of ISO on IL-6 family of cytokines gene expression in mouse myocardium. Indeed, the expression of IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-6, LIF, and CNTF mRNA was increased after ISO injection and peaked at 60–120 min (Fig. 3), which was temporally correlated with the delayed phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, although substantial CT-1 mRNA expression was observed in mouse myocardium, the expression was significantly increased at 15 min after ISO injection and had declined to its basal level by 60 min. To further investigate alterations in protein levels of IL-6, we examined their levels in serum and myocardium homogenates after ISO stimulation. The mean IL-6 serum level determined before ISO injection was 120.3 ± 33.7 pg/ml, which increased at 1 h (195.4 ± 28.4 pg/ml), and was further elevated significantly at 2 h (448.0 ± 46.1 pg/ml, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). We also observed that in myocardium homogenate samples, the mean IL-6 level was 632.1 ± 38.7 pg/mg in control group and then reached the plateau at 1 h after ISO injection (824.2 ± 38.9 pg/mg, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). These data strongly suggest that autocrine/paracrine-secreted IL-6 family of cytokines may be involved in ISO-induced STAT3 activation. Cardiac Fibroblast Is the Main Source of IL-6 Secretion in Myocardium—To clarify the source of increased IL-6 in mouse myocardium, cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were prepared from 1-day-old BALB/c mice. Cells were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to ISO (10-6 mol/liter), and the supernatants were collected at different time points for the measurement of IL-6 by ELISA. In unstimulated cardiac fibroblasts, low levels of IL-6 were detected in culture medium (67.4 ± 1.3 pg/ml). IL-6 level was enhanced significantly at 2 h after ISO stimulation (502.1 ± 146.7 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and then peaked at 12 h (773.7 ± 161.9 pg/ml, p < 0.01). Interestingly, despite similar IL-6 levels between unstimulated cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, the response of IL-6 measured in the supernatants from cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant (Fig. 5A). Our data indicate that cardiac fibroblast but not cardiomyocytes is probably a predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium. Effect of IL-6 on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT3 in Cardiomyocytes—To demonstrate that IL-6 could activate STAT3 in cultured cardiomyocytes, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 by Western blot analysis. After 24 h of serum depletion, primary cultured cardiomyocytes were stimulated with recombinant murine IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed at 5 min after ISO stimulation and then peaked at 30 min, and it was still sustained at 60 min. These findings suggest that in cultured cardiomyocytes, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner. Effect of Anti-IL-6-neutralizing Antibody on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT3 in Vivo—Mice were treated with either anti-murine IL-6-neutralizing antibody or goat IgG (200 μg, intraperitoneal) for 30 min and then received intraperitoneal injection of ISO (15 mg/kg body weight). Blood and myocardium samples were taken at 2 h after ISO injection. In ISO-treated mice, serum IL-6 levels were elevated 4-fold above sham group (p < 0.01). Treatment with an anti-murine IL-6 polyclonal antibody completely inhibited the elevated IL-6 levels (94.4 ± 14.9% versus control, n = 4, p > 0.05). (Fig. 6A) Based on the potential of anti-IL-6 antibody treatment to neutralize endogenous IL-6 in our model, further studies examined the effects of blocking IL-6 on ISO-induced myocardium STAT3 activation in vivo. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment with anti-murine IL-6-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited ISO-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, which was consistent with the complete inhibition of IL-6 level. These data clearly indicate that IL-6 plays a pivotal role in ISO-induced STAT3 activation in mouse myocardium. The manifestation of cardiac remodeling is almost always associated with hypertension and left ventricular pressure/volume overload disease. In addition to heart muscle diseases, chronic pressure overload and the associated cardiac remodeling are considered to be not only very common causes but also predictors for the development of chronic heart failure. Previous studies have been focused on the functional roles of β-AR stimulation in left ventricular hypertrophy (6Dzimiri N. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 465-501PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the Jak/STAT pathway, which is activated by a multitude of cytokines and tyrosine kinase receptors (9Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), has been also implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. However, there is no information available linking these two cardiac hypertrophy pathways. The major finding of this study is that β-AR stimulation leads to delayed phosphorylation of STAT3 via an IL-6-dependent mechanism in addition to the well established cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, the present study provides direct evidence that cardiac fibroblast but not cardiomyocytes is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium. The coexistence of β1-AR and β2-AR has been demonstrated with the radioligand binding assay in the hearts of rat, mouse, cat, guinea pig, dog, and rabbit (17Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-243PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of these β-ARs activates the classic guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), adenylate cyclases, and cAMP-protein kinase A cascade, which regulates multiple effects. In this study, we have demonstrated that ISO injection could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium, simultaneously mediating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, our findings indicate that ISO-induced STAT3 activation is mediated by both β1-AR and β2-AR via increasing intracellular cAMP. Interestingly, we have found that ISO robustly increases mouse myocardium STAT3 phosphorylation in vivo but has no such effect in cultured cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts. This discrepancy reminds us that some key factors might be missing in cultured cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that autocrine/paracrine-secreted IL-6 family of cytokines plays a critical role in STAT activation in response to mechanical stretch and angiotensin II (18Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 19Pan J. Fukuda K. Sato T. Matsuzaki J. Kodama H. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Moreover, the levels of angiotensin II, plasma renin activity, and norepinephrine are proportionally correlated with the level of IL-6, suggesting a link between neurohormones and cytokine activation (20Orus J. Roig E. Perez-Villa F. Pare C. Azqueta M. Filella X. Heras M. Sanz G. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 2000; 19: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we have observed that the gene expression of IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-6, LIF, and CNTF are increased in response to β-AR stimulation by ISO and the time course is comparable with STAT3 activation. The ELISA was used to determine whether the increases in the expression level of IL-6 mRNA was associated with increases in the extracellular secretion of IL-6. Our results indicate that ISO significantly increased IL-6 levels in serum and myocardium homogenates in a pattern similar to that of IL-6 mRNA expression in mouse myocardium. Thus, we have for the first time demonstrated that autocrine/paracrine-secreted IL-6 family of cytokines may be critically involved in β-AR-induced STAT3 activation. It should be noted that the elevation of IL-6 level in mouse myocardium is slightly premature than those in serum. The myocardium is believed to be a major source of IL-6 in patients with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure (21Kucharz E.J. Wilk T. Eur. J. Intern. Med. 2000; 11: 253-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that the heart is composed of multiple cell types including cardiomyocytes and nonmyocytes (mostly cardiac fibroblasts). Accumulating evidence has established that cardiac fibroblasts similar to cardiomyocytes synthesize and secrete a local peptide hormone and cytokines that may modulate myocardial structure and function (16Gray M.O. Long C.S. Kalinyak J.E. Li H.T. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Wan S. DeSmet J.M. Barvais L. Goldstein M. Vincent J.L. LeClerc J.L. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1996; 112: 806-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this study, our findings indicate that cardiac fibroblasts but not cardiomyocytes is served as the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium. These results are consistent with those of a previous study (24Burger A. Benicke M. Deten A. Zimmer H.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H14-H21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which reported that a catecholamine, norepinephrine, significantly increased IL-6 mRNA expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Clinical investigation has demonstrated that the plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 were elevated in patients with congestive heart failure (25Kubota T. Miyagishima M. Alvarez R.J. Kormos R. Rosenblum W.D. Demetris A.J. Semigran M.J. Dec G.M. Holubkov R. McTiernan C.F. Mann D.L. Feldman A.M. McNamara D.M. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 2000; 19: 819-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that increased cAMP can stabilize the mRNA for several inflammatory mediators during chronic β-AR stimulation (26Baumgarten G. Knuefermann P. Mann D.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 10: 216-223Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Gustafsson A.B. Brunton L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Murray D.R. Prabhu S.D. Chandrasekar B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2338-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-adrenergic blockade has been shown to attenuate proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in experimental infarct models (29Prabhu S.D. Chandrasekar B. Murray D.R. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In patients with congestive heart failure, increased serum IL-6 has been identified as a powerful independent predictor of the combined end point: death, new heart failure episodes, and the need for heart transplantation (30Sano M. Fukuda K. Sato T. Kawaguchi H. Suematsu M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Plenz G. Song Z.F. Tjan T.D.T. Koenig C. Baba H.A. Erren M. Flesch M. Wichter T. Scheld H.H. Deng M.C. Eur. J.

Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1627-1635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although it is perhaps premature to speculate whether modulating cytokine levels will translate into clinical improvements in morbidity and mortality for patients with heart failure, a growing body of evidence suggests that modulating cytokine levels may represent a new therapeutic paradigm for treating patients with heart failure (26Baumgarten G. Knuefermann P. Mann D.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 10: 216-223Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In fact, passive immunization of experimental animals with neutralizing antibodies to various cytokines or with blocking antibodies to cytokine receptors has proven to be a powerful approach to evaluate the contribution of specific cytokines to host defense (32Havell E.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 756-761PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gershenwald J.E. Fong Y.M. Fahey T.J. Calvano S.E. Chizzonite R. Kilian P.L. Lowry S.F. Moldawer L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Present studies were performed with polyclonal anti-IL-6 antibody as other investigators have suggested that anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies paradoxically increase serum IL-6 levels, which may be the result of monoclonal antibodies acting as a “chaperone” shielding IL-6 from renal clearance (23May L.T. Neta R. Moldawer L.L. Kenney J.S. Patel K. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar, 34Van Andel R.A. Franklin C.L. Besch-Williford C.L. Hook R.R. Riley L.K. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 49: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In agreement with those of previous reports (34Van Andel R.A. Franklin C.L. Besch-Williford C.L. Hook R.R. Riley L.K. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 49: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), our results here indicate that polyclonal antibody is capable of depleting serum IL-6. Most importantly, the inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in mouse myocardium. Thus, these direct evidences confirm the critical role of IL-6 in STAT3 activation after ISO injection. Moreover, based on the present finding, (I) expression of other IL-6 families of cytokines including LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 mRNA were also increased after ISO treatment and (II) anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody at a high dose (200 μg each) failed to completely inhibit STAT3 activation. Despite its great capability in depleting endogenous IL-6, we supposed that other IL-6-related cytokines (LIF, CNTF, and CT-1) might be also partially involved in this activation, although their contribution should be weaker than that of IL-6. In summary, β-AR stimulation induces the Jak/STAT pathway activation in mouse heart and autocrine/paracrine-secreted IL-6 family of cytokines plays a pivotal role in ISO-induced delayed STAT3 activation. Moreover, the present findings suggest that cardiac fibroblasts but not cardiomyocytes is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.

Cytokine-initiated caspase activation is slower and comparatively less with LY294002 than with cycloheximide.

Effects on the endothelium that contribute to the inflammatory response are largely dependent on gene transcription resulting in the expression of proteins controlling vasoregulation, leukocyte adhesion, leukocyte activation, and coagulation. In some cases TNF and IL-1 may also result in endothelial injury, a common feature in the pathogenesis of vascular leak, sepsis, and transplant rejection. The ability of TNF or IL-1 to cause endothelial injury may occur indirectly through the activation and recruitment of leukocytes or generation of thrombosis or may occur directly from the pro-apoptotic actions of these cytokines on EC. The direct pro-apoptotic action of TNF on various cell types generally results from the ligand-dependent assembly of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), so called for the ability of this complex to initiate caspase activation. For TNF, the formation of a DISC is dependent on ligand-binding to TNF receptor type I (TNFR-1, also designated CD120a), which leads to the recruitment of the cytosolic adapter protein TNFR-1 associated death domain protein (TRADD) (1Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The association between TNFR1 and TRADD involves the “death domains” (DD) of these proteins. DDs are homologous regions of ∼80 amino acids that mediate protein-protein interaction and are also found in other receptors such as Fas (CD95) (2Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). TRADD may subsequently recruit Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) through DD interactions (3Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). FADD contains both a DD and a death effector domain, the latter of which can interact with either pro-caspase-8 (also known as FLICE) or with cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) (4Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 5Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). FADD-associated pro-caspase-8 undergoes autocatalytic activation by proteolysis, liberating the active enzyme from the pro-form (6Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). c-FLIP may inhibit this process. Activated caspase-8 dissociates from the DISC and acts on various cytosolic substrates. For example, caspase-8 may proteolytically activate the effector caspase-3. Activated caspase-3, in turn, cleaves a variety of substrates, resulting in apoptotic cell death (7Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Alternatively, caspase-8 may proteolytically activate a cytosolic protein called Bid (8Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Bid is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member containing a single Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain designated BH3. Proteolytically activated forms of “BH3-only” family members, such as Bid and Bad, bind to mitochondrial-associated “BH1–3” or “multidomain” proteins, such as Bax and Bak, causing supramolecular openings of the outer mitochondrial membrane (9Ottilie S. Diaz J.L. Horne W. Chang J. Wang Y. Wilson G. Chang S. Weeks S. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). These openings allow the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (13Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Within the cytosol, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1, and this complex further recruits pro-caspase-9 forming an assembly sometimes called an apoptosome. The apoptosome mediates ATP-dependent autocatalytic processing of caspase-9 and activated caspase-9, like caspase-8, can catalyze the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 resulting in apoptotic cell death (14Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid activates an amplification pathway for mitochondrial-dependent activation of caspase-3. Mitochondrial openings may also release other proteins, such as apoptosis-inducing factor that can initiate caspase-independent cell death (15Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K.

Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The requirement for the Bid/cytochrome c/Apaf1 amplification pathway differs among various cell types and correlates with the extent to which active caspase-8 is generated by the DISC (8Scaffidi C.

DISC activity may be positively regulated by the expression levels of FADD and pro-caspase-8 (17Li J.H. Kluger M.S. Madge L.A. Zheng L. Bothwell A.L. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1485-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or negatively regulated by the levels of c-FLIP (5Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

IL-1, like TNF, initiates the activation of signal transduction cascades by the recruitment of adapter proteins to its receptor. In EC, IL-1 may also initiate apoptotic cell death. To date, the precise components of the IL-1 receptor-associated DISC have not been defined. A number of adapter proteins involved in IL-1 signal transduction, namely MyD88 and IRAK (18Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), contain DDs and are possible mediators of caspase recruitment and activation. Most untransformed cell types are not sensitive to the pro-apoptotic actions of TNF or IL-1, unless mRNA translation or protein synthesis is blocked. This observation has been explained by the capacity of TNF to stimulate the activation of NFκB, resulting in the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene products such as c-FLIP, XIAP, c-IAP 1, and c-IAP 2 (19Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 20Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell.

The expression levels of several anti-apoptotic genes, such as c-FLIP and IAP 1 are also regulated by the proteasome (22Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J.

Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). In the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), levels of c-FLIP are rapidly diminished, favoring DISC-dependent activation of caspase-8 (19Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 22Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

Reduction of c-FLIP by antisense oligonucleotides mimics the effect of CHX and similarly sensitizes cells to death (22Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J.

Although apoptosis is generally associated with caspase activation, either through a DISC or through an apoptosome, caspase-independent cell death has been observed with the generation of apoptotic-like features in a variety of cell types (24Deas O.

Adam-Klages S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24670-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In many instances, these variant forms of apoptosis are mediated by non-caspase proteases such as the cysteine protease cathepsin family, calpains, serine proteases, or the proteasome complex. Of particular interest, the activation of cathepsin B has been shown to play a central role in the generation on TNF-mediated cell death in fibrosarcoma cells (25Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNF-mediated apoptosis has been shown to be strongly reduced in hepatocytes from cathepsin B-deficient mice (27Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This pathway has not been described in a normal (untransformed) human cell type. While most TNF activities on EC result in inflammation and/or apoptosis, we have shown in EC that TNF and IL-1 also activate the anti-apoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (28Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). PI3K converts plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, catalyzing the recruitment of several enzymes, such as PI3K-dependent protein kinase and Akt to the plasma membrane. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that exerts an anti-apoptotic action by the phosphorylation of a number of substrates containing the phosphorylation consensus RXRXX(S/T). Akt-mediated phosphorylation inactivates the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue Bad (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

In some cells Akt may regulate the activity of NFκB either through direct phosphorylation and activation of IKKα (32Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar) or through regulation of the transactivation capacity of Rel A (33Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that activation of PI3K in EC does not contribute to the activation of NFκB or have any significant effect on NFκB-dependent inflammatory responses (28Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similarly, Akt is reported not to have any effect of NFκB activation in HeLa cells (34Delhase M. Li N. Karin M. Nature. 2000; 406: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the role of PI3K and Akt activation in the regulation of apoptosis induced by TNF and IL-1. To do so, we either inhibited PI3K with LY294002 or inhibited Akt by retroviral transduction with an inactive (K179M), dominant-negative form of Akt. We report that inhibition of PI3K but not of Akt sensitizes EC to the apoptotic actions of TNF and IL-1 and that the cell death caused by this pathway could not be blocked by caspase inhibition with zVADfmk but instead appears to be mediated through cathepsin B. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein EC were isolated from discarded tissue in accordance with an approved protocol by Yale University Human Investigations Committee and serially cultured on gelatin (J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ)-coated tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) in Medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 200 μm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 50 μg/ml EC growth factor (ECGF) (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml porcine heparin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). All experiments were performed using EC at passage 2 or 3. Such sub-cultured EC uniformly display CD31 and von Willebrand factor and are free of CD45+-contaminating leukocytes. For replating assays floating EC were harvested, washed with Hanks' balance salt solution, and re-seeded onto gelatin-coated plates. EC that remained substrate-attached were similarly re-plated following harvesting with trypsin (Invitrogen). Materials—Recombinant human TNF was purchased from R&D, and IL-1 was purchased from Peprotech Inc (Rocky Hill, NJ). LY294002, CHX, and Z-Arg-Arg-amidomethylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg-AMC) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Propidium iodide, Hoescht reagent, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl (DAPI), JC-1, calcein-AM, and LysoTracker red were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). RNase A and digitonin were purchased from Sigma. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074-Me was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets and Pefabloc were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Mouse anti-FLIP antibody was a gift from Dr. Peter Krammer (DFKZ, Heidelberg, Germany). Rabbit anti-Bid antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Mouse anti-cathepsin B was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). CaspaTag fluorescein broad range (VAD), caspase-3 (DEVD), caspase-8 (LETD), and caspase-9 (LEHD) activity assay kits were purchased from Serologicals (Norcross, GA). Mouse anti-Bax antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Rabbit anti-FKHR and phospho-FKHR antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Westgrove, PA). Immunoblotting—For immunoblots, each well of a six-well plate containing a confluent HUVEC monolayer was washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with Pefabloc (1 mm) and complete protease inhibitor mixture. For the measurement of phospho-proteins, NaF (10 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm) were also included in the lysis buffer to reduce phosphatase activity. After 20 min on ice, lysates were harvested by scraping. Where indicated, detached EC were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and pooled with the lysate of the attached EC from the same sample. For each sample, an equal amount of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) then transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) and immunoblotted with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection of the bound antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Cell Cycle and Hypodiploid DNA Analysis—EC grown to confluence on 12-well plates were treated as described in the text. At the indicated time after treatment, floating EC were collected and pooled with residual attached EC suspended by trypsin treatment. The pooled EC were washed once in PBS and fixed by resuspension in 70% ethanol for 15 min. After fixation, EC were washed once more in PBS before incubation in PBS containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 0.25–2 h. The DNA content of EC was then determined by FACS analysis using Cell Quest software (FACSort, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). DAPI Staining of EC—EC were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 12-well plates and treated as described in the text. After treatment, attached EC were harvested with trypsin and combined with floating EC harvested from the same sample. Cells were washed in PBS, and ∼1 × 105 cells were adhered to a glass coverslip by spinning in a cyto-centrifuge (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Slides were air-dried and dipped in a chamber containing MeOH and DAPI (1 μg/ml). After rinsing in PBS, a drop of Gel Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and a coverslip was placed over the cells. Specimens were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using a Nikon diaphot microscope with a 360-nm filter. Quantitation of EC Adherence and Replating—To quantify the number of cells that remained adherent, EC plated on gelatin-coated 96-well plates were treated as indicated in the text. After experimental manipulation the medium was removed and cells were washed twice in PBS. The residual attached cells were fixed and stained by the addition of 70% ethanol containing 100 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed twice with PBS, and the residual fluorescence was recorded (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader (Perspective Biosystems Inc, Framingham, MA). To assess the viability of detached versus adherent cells, EC were grown to confluency in 12-well plates and treated as indicated in the text. Detached EC were harvested, washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and re-seeded onto gelatin-coated plates. EC that remained substrate-attached were similarly re-plated following harvest with trypsin. Viability was assessed as replating efficiency 18 h later quantified by Hoescht staining as above. Caspase Activity Assays—For experimental manipulation EC were plated on 12-well plates and treated at confluency as indicated in the text. After described treatment the CaspaTag peptide (FAM-VAD-fmk for broad range caspase activity, FAM-LETD-fmk for caspase-8, FAM-LEHD-fmk for caspase-9, or FAM-DEVD-fmk for caspase-3) was added to each well and incubated a further 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent to incubation with the peptide, floating EC were harvested and combined with attached EC from the same well harvested with trypsin. Caspase activity was demonstrated by the generation of a second peak or shoulder on FL-1 that results from peptide binding to active caspase by FACS. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ) Analysis—After experimental manipulation of EC seeded on 12-well plates, floating EC were harvested by centrifugation and combined with remaining substrate-attached EC harvested with trypsin. The pooled EC were washed 1× in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin before resuspension in 200 μl of PBS/bovine serum albumin containing JC-1 (10 μg/ml). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, EC were washed, re-suspended in PBS, and analyzed by FACS. Retroviral Transduction—HA-tagged murine K179M Akt (a gift from Dr. W. Sessa, Yale University) was Topo®-cloned using EcoRI and NotI into the retroviral LZRS expression vector (a gift from Dr. A. L. M. Bothwell, Yale University), and the construct was verified by sequencing. The caspase-resistant Bcl-2 retroviral construct (a gift from A. L. M. Bothwell) has been described previously (36Zheng L. Dengler T.J. Kluger M.S. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Maher S.E. Pober J.S. Bothwell A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The amphotropic Phoenix packaging cell line was transfected with either the empty vector LZRS, LZRS-K179M Akt, or LZRS-Bcl2 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and selected for gene expression 24 h after transfection using puromycin (1 μg/ml). Puromycin-resistant cells were used to derive conditioned medium to provide a retroviral stock for HUVEC transduction. For transduction of primary HUVECs, M199 containing ECGF was removed, and cells were washed and incubated 5–8 h with retroviral conditioned media containing Polybrene (8 μg/ml, Sigma). After incubation, retrovirus was removed and replaced with normal growth medium overnight. The transduction process was repeated a further three times with intermittent cell passage as required. Using this protocol the percentage of HUVECs expressing the transgene is routinely >95%. Preparation of Cytosolic Extracts for the Analysis of Cathepsin B—Measurement of cytosolic cathepsin B was determined using methodology similar to Foghsgaard et al. (25Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were pretreated with LY294002 (50 μm) for 3 h in complete M199 prior to the addition of cytokine for a further 3 h. After treatment media were removed and cells were washed twice in PBS prior to the addition of extraction buffer (50 μg/ml digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, pH 7.5) and incubation on ice for 20 min. (The conditions that allow for the selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane by digitonin without perturbation of lysosomes were determined in preliminary experiments using EC pre-loaded both with calcein-AM and LysoTracker red.) After incubation, the cytosolic extract was collected. Samples were analyzed for cathepsin B either by Western blotting or with a cathepsin B activity assay. Measurement of Cathepsin B Activity—A 50-μl volume of cytosolic extract was added to an equal volume of cathepsin reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 4 mm EDTA, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Pefabloc, pH 6.0). Cathepsin B activity was measured by the addition of 20 μmZ-Arg-Arg-AMC (Calbiochem). Liberated AMC was measured (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader immediately following the addition of the peptide substrate (T0) and following a 60 min incubation at 37 °C (T60). Activity was determined by subtracting the background activity at T0 from activity at T60 and correcting for the amount of protein in each sample. TNF and IL-1 Mediate Nuclear Condensation and EC Death under Conditions Where Either Protein Synthesis Is Inhibited or PI3K Activation Is Blocked—Many cell types are not sensitive to the pro-apoptotic actions of TNF or IL-1 unless RNA or protein synthesis is blocked.

https://openalex.org/W1996867517,"Periodontitis are diseases of the supportive tissues of the teeth provoked by bacteria and characterized by gingival inflammation and bone destruction. We have developed a new strategy to repair tissues by administrating agents (RGTA) that mimic heparan sulfates by protecting selectively some of the growth factors naturally present within the injured tissue and interfering with inflammation. After periodontitis induction in hamsters, the animals were left untreated or received weekly i.m. injections of RGTA1507 at a dose of 100 microg/kg, 400 microg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, or 15 mg/kg for 4 wk. RGTA treatment significantly reduced gingival tissue inflammation, thickened the pocket epithelium by increasing cell proliferation, and enhanced collagen accumulation in the gingiva. A marked reduction in bone loss was observed, resulting from depression of osteoclasia and robust stimulation of bone formation at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg. RGTA treatment for 8 wk at this dose reversed macroscopic bone loss, sharply contrasting with the extensive bone destruction in the untreated animals. RGTA treatment decreased gelatinase A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) pro-forms in gingival tissues. Our data indicate that a 4 wk treatment dose-dependently attenuated gingival and bone manifestations of the disease, whereas a longer treatment restored alveolar bone close to controls. By modulating and coordinating host responses, RGTA has unique therapeutic properties and is a promising candidate for the treatment of human periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2024057452,"Activins, like other members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, initiate signaling by assembling a complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinases classified as type II (ActRII or ActRIIB) and type I (ALK4). A kinase-deleted version of ALK4 can form an inactive complex with activin and ActRII/IIB and thereby acts in a dominant negative manner to block activin signaling. Using the complex structure of bone morphogenetic protein-2 bound to its type I receptor (ALK3) as a guide, we introduced extracellular domain mutations in the context of the truncated ALK4 (ALK4-trunc) construct and assessed the ability of the mutants to inhibit activin function. We have identified five hydrophobic amino acid residues on the ALK4 extracellular domain (Leu40, Ile70, Val73, Leu75, and Pro77) that, when mutated to alanine, have substantial effects on ALK4-trunc dominant negative activity. In addition, eleven mutants partially affected activin binding to ALK4. Together, these residues likely constitute the binding surface for activin on ALK4. Cross-linking studies measuring binding of 125I-activin-A to the ALK4-trunc mutants in the presence of ActRII implicated the same residues. Our results indicate that there is only a partial overlap of the binding sites on ALK4 and ALK3 for activin-A and bone morphogenetic protein-2, respectively. In addition three of the residues required for activin binding to ALK4 are conserved on the type I TGF-β receptor ALK5, suggesting the corresponding region on ALK5 may be important for TGF-β binding.

Nature. 1990; 344: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Activins also play key roles in numerous pathophysiologic processes including carcinogenesis (15Chen Y.G. Lui H.M. Lin S.L. Lee J.M. Ying S.Y. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227 (Maywood): 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Activins (∼26 kDa) are disulfide-linked dimers of related polypeptides consisting of two β chains (activin-A (βA-βA), activin-AB (βA-βB), and activin-B (βB-βB)) (16Vale W. Hsueh A. Rivier C. Yu J. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95/II. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 211-248Google Scholar). The structure of these factors is determined by several conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds in the tightly folded cystine-knot motif that is shared by TGF-β superfamily members (17Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).The signaling events initiated by activin require binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinases classified as type II (ActRII or ActRIIB) and type I (ALK4). Both receptors are transmembrane proteins with ligand binding activity in the extracellular domain and serine/threonine kinase activity in the intracellular domain (15Chen Y.G. Lui H.M. Lin S.L. Lee J.M. Ying S.Y. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227 (Maywood): 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activin type II receptors are the primary ligand-binding proteins and can bind ligand with high affinity in the absence of type I receptors (18Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The type I receptor, however, is unable to bind ligand in the absence of the type II receptors (19Attisano L.

Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the receptor complex, the constitutively active type II receptor kinase phosphorylates ALK4 in the regulatory GS domain, a glycine- and serine-rich segment on the membrane-proximal side of the kinase domain, and this phosphorylation leads to activation of ALK4 (21Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Once activated, ALK4 binds and then phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad proteins, which form part of the post-receptor signal transduction system (22Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar).Recently obtained crystal structure data have greatly advanced our understanding of how members of the TGF-β superfamily interact with their receptors. The complex structure of BMP-7 dimer bound to the ActRII-ECD shows that the ActRII-ECD makes contact with only one of the dimer subunits (23Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P.C. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W.

The structure of BMP-2 in complex with BMP receptor IA (ALK3, BR1A) was also solved recently (28Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), revealing a type I receptor ECD fold similar to that of the ActRII-ECD. In the structure of the complex, ALK3 binds to the finger-helix groove of the BMP-2 dimer in such a way that each ALK3-ECD molecule is in contact with both BMP-2 monomers. The ligand binding interface on ALK3 for BMP-2 is characterized by a groove on the concave surface of the ECD and by residues in the short α helix.Based on the crystal structure of the BMP2·ALK3-ECD complex and homology modeling, we have subjected the ALK4-ECD to alanine scanning mutagenesis with the goal of identifying the amino acid residues required for activin binding. We predicted that by individually mutating ALK4-ECD residues to alanine we would be able to identify amino acids that are important for activin binding while minimizing the structural changes caused by mutation. Using this approach, we have identified five hydrophobic amino acid residues (Leu40, Ile70, Val73, Leu75, and Pro77) that, when individually mutated to alanine, had substantial effects on activin binding to ALK4. In addition, eleven other mutants moderately or weakly disrupted activin binding. Homology modeling suggests that these residues interact with each other to form a contiguous surface on the concave face of ALK4 that is a likely activin binding interface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—NuPAGE gels and molecular weight markers were obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant human activin-A was generated using a stable activin-expressing cell line generously provided by Dr. J.

Primers were constructed to incorporate a 5′-HindIII site and a 3′-EcoRI site, and PCR products were gel-purified and digested with both enzymes and then subcloned into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3 vector to yield mutant receptor constructs. For each construct, the mutated amino-terminal ECD region was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Transfection and Detection of Cell Surface Expression of ALK4 in Intact HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were grown in 5% CO2 to 40–60% confluence on poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine). Cells were transfected with wild-type ALK4, ALK4-trunc, or ALK4-trunc ECD mutants using Perfectin (Gene Therapy Systems). For co-transfection of ActRII and ALK4, a 2:1 ratio of their respective cDNAs was used. For Western blotting, cells were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose were carried out using NuPAGE gels and a NOVEX X-cell II apparatus as described previously (24Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S.

To detect FLAG-tagged ALK4 constructs expressed at the cell surface, intact cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, incubated with anti-FLAG antibody, washed, and treated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig.

Cells were washed, resuspended in 1 ml of Hepes buffer (HDB; 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl), brought to 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate, and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Luciferase Assays in HEK293T and Mink Lung Epithelial (Mv1Lu) Cells—The activin/TGFβ-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid A3-Lux (30Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and the FAST2 transcription factor (30Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) were used as described (31Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y. E C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates at a density of ∼150,000 cells per well. Approximately 24 h later each well was transfected with ALK4-trunc constructs (200 ng) and/or empty vector (200 or 400 ng; pcDNA3), FAST-2 (50 ng), A3-lux (25 ng), and cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase (25 ng). Transfections were performed under optimized conditions using Perfectin transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). The cells were treated 6–8 h post-transfection with activin-A (1 nm) or activin-B (1 nm) for ∼16 h and harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized relative to β-galactosidase activities. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed in essentially the same manner for Mv1Lu cells as described above for HEK293T cells, but 3TP-lux was used instead of A3-Lux, and FAST2 was not used.Computer Modeling of ALK4-ECD—Computer modeling and molecular mechanics employed Discover/Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) using the cff91 force field hosted on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station running IRIX64, version 6.5. Construction of an interactive computer graphical model of ALK4 employed homology modeling based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of ALK3 reported by Kirsch et al. (28Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) in their structure of the BMP-2·ALK3 complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1ES7). Based on the primary sequence alignment of ALK3 and ALK4, 55 residues were identified for single-residue substitution; eight deletions of one residue or more and a single insertion of five residues were similarly identified. Single residue substitutions were performed with retention of side chain orientation where possible; in the event of severe overlap, manual rotation was conducted to minimize steric hindrance. Local perturbations caused by deletion were allowed to anneal by restrained minimization wherein the backbone atoms of the nascent ALK4 model were tethered in place with the exception that the residues on either side of a deletion were allowed to move. A simple β turn structure was imposed on the five-residue insertion spanning ALK4 residues Lys72-Val76. This insertion attempted to maximize the solvent-accessible area of Lys72 and Glu74 and to exploit a naturally arising salt bridge involving Asp56 and Lys72. Final overlap of the experimentally observed ALK3 and theoretically derived ALK4 structures was 1.25 Å root mean square over the common backbone.RESULTSSelection of Amino Acid Residues on ALK4 for Mutagenesis—A truncated version of ALK4 in which the cytoplasmic kinase domain is deleted forms an inactive complex with activin and ActRII and therefore acts in a dominant negative manner to block activin-A signaling (32Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E.M. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We showed that ALK4-trunc blocks activin-A signaling when transfected into HEK293T cells (see Fig. 4), and we proceeded to introduce mutations within the ECD of the ALK4-trunc construct with the goal of identifying residues that block activin binding and therefore inhibit its dominant negative function. Kirsch et al. (28Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) identified a groove on ALK3 that constitutes the BMP-2 binding interface (Fig. 1), and we have individually mutated each of the residues on ALK4 corresponding to these groove-forming residues. In addition, we have mutated ALK4-ECD residues in the broader region implicated by the BMP-2·ALK3 complex structure (Fig. 1). We predicted that by individually mutating ALK4-trunc residues to alanine we would be able to identify amino acids that are important for activin binding while minimizing the structural changes caused by mutation.Fig. 1Sequence alignment of ALK3, ALK4, and ALK5 extracellular domains. The alignment is limited to the structurally defined part of the ALK3 sequence. Cysteines are boxed, and ALK3 residues implicated in BMP-2 binding are boxed and shaded gray. ALK4 residues selected for alanine scanning mutagenesis are shaded black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of ALK4-trunc in HEK293T Cells—To facilitate detection of ALK4-trunc expressed in HEK293T cells, we used PCR to introduce a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) at the extreme amino terminus immediately following the putative signal peptide (after Gly28). To demonstrate that the FLAG-tagged ALK4-trunc constructs were expressed in 293T cells, we initially performed Western blot experiments. Fig. 2A shows that wild-type and selected mutant ALK4-trunc proteins are expressed at comparable levels in 293T cells. An antibody directed against the FLAG epitope tag recognizes an ∼26-kDa protein (expected size 22.6 kDa) expressed in cells transfected with ALK4-trunc constructs but not vector alone (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that the FLAG-tagged ALK4-trunc constructs were expressed at the cell surface we used an intact cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (24Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Together, these results demonstrate that the FLAG epitope is present on the ALK4-trunc constructs, that the wild-type and mutant receptors are expressed in this system at similar levels, and that the receptors are expressed at the cell surface.Fig. 2ALK4 mutants transfected into HEK293T cells are expressed at the cell surface.A, solubilized extracts prepared from cells transfected with empty vector, ALK4-trunc, or ALK4-trunc with selected ECD mutations were normalized with respect to protein levels and then subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG anti-body as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, bar graph illustrating the cell surface expression of wild-type (black bar) and mutant (gray bars) FLAG-tagged ALK4-trunc constructs as detected by anti-FLAG antibody in intact HEK293T cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression was determined relative to vector-transfected cells (white bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Covalent Cross-linking of Activin to ActRII and Wild-type or Mutant ALK4-trunc Constructs—To identify ALK4-trunc mutants with altered activin binding, we co-expressed the mutants in HEK293T cells together with ActRII, and performed affinity labeling experiments. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked complexes with anti-FLAG antibodies directed against ALK4-FLAG led to the identification of a number of ALK4 residues important for activin-A binding (Fig. 3). In cells transfected with ActRII-Myc and wild-type ALK4-trunc, the predominant species of ∼40 kDa represented ALK4-trunc cross-linked to a single activin subunit (the ∼55-kDa species presumably represented ALK4-trunc cross-linked to the activin dimer). The ActRII·activin cross-linked complex (∼80 kDa) was ineffectively immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies consistent with previous studies (23Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P.C. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that have shown the activin·ActRII·ALK4-trunc complex to be unstable following solubilization. Of the 26 ALK4-trunc mutants tested, five had significant effects on activin binding whereas several others had intermediate effects. Mutants L40A and V73A formed cross-linked complexes with 125I-activin-A more efficiently than wild-type ALK4-trunc (Fig. 3). In contrast, mutants I70A, L75A, and P77A cross-linked poorly to 125I-activin-A (Fig. 3). Mutants P71A, K72A, V76A, G79A, F82A, R91A, and T93A showed some decrease in binding to 125I-activin-A compared with wild-type ALK4-trunc (Fig. 3). These results were supported by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against ActRII-Myc (data not shown). The Myc antibody effectively immunoprecipitated activin·ActRII complexes but was less efficient in isolating activin bound to ALK4-trunc. Nevertheless, the same pattern of 125I-activin-A cross-linking to the ALK4-trunc mutants was evident.Fig. 3Covalent cross-linking of 125I-activin-A to ActRII and wild-type or mutant ALK4-trunc constructs. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3), ActRII-myc, ActRII-myc + ALK4-FLAG, ActRII-myc + ALK4-trunc, or ActRII-myc + ALK4-trunc mutants and cross-linked to 125I-activin-A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cross-linked complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation of Amino Acids Required for Activin Binding Affects the Dominant Negative Activity of ALK4-trunc in HEK293T Cells—We tested the relative abilities of wild-type and mutant ALK4-trunc constructs to block the activin-A induction of the TGF-β/activin responsive luciferase reporter construct A3-Lux in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4, activin-A induced A3-Lux reporter activity when this plasmid was co-transfected with FAST2 (31Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y. E C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) into HEK293T cells. Activin-induced A3-Lux activation was decreased ∼65% when wild-type ALK4-trunc was co-transfected (Fig. 4). However, consistent with the cross-linking data, receptors with alanine substitutions at any one of the three residues identified to be essential for activin binding (Ile70, Leu75, or Pro77) were not able to exhibit dominant negative activity (Fig. 4). In addition, the ALK4-trunc mutants with increased activin-A binding (L40A and V73A; see Fig. 3) were more effective dominant negative inhibitors than wild-type ALK4-trunc (Fig. 4), despite equal expression at the cell surface (Fig. 2B). Mutant L40A decreased activin-induced A3-Lux activation by ∼80% relative to vector-transfected cells whereas mutant V73A decreased activation by ∼90% relative to vector. The behavior of most of the other ALK4-trunc mutants in the functional assay (Fig. 4) corresponded to their ability to cross-link activin (Fig. 3). Mutants P71A, V76A, G79A, F82A, R91A, and T93A, which showed decreased binding to 125I-activin-A compared with wild-type ALK4-trunc (Fig. 3), also displayed impaired dominant negative activity (suppressing the activin-induced luciferase response by 35–50%; see Fig. 4). Mutants S55A, A78G, and S87A, although displaying activin binding comparable with wild-type ALK4-trunc (Fig. 3), were less effective dominant negative inhibitors (Fig. 4). All other mutants suppressed activin-induced luciferase activity to the same extent as wild-type ALK4-trunc. Together, these results provide further evidence in intact cells demonstrating the importance of the Leu40-Ile70-Val73-Leu75-Pro77 hydrophobic residues in mediating activin/ALK4 binding and activin signaling.ALK4 Binding Determinants Are Conserved for Activin-A and Activin-B—We tested whether wild-type and selected mutant ALK4-trunc constructs could also block activin-B induced luciferase activity. Fig. 5B shows that activin-B-induced A3-Lux activity was suppressed ∼55% upon overexpression of wild-type ALK4-trunc (compared with ∼75% suppression of activin-A induced A3-Lux activity; see Fig. 5A). ALK4-trunc constructs with alanine substitutions at Ile70, Leu75, or Pro77 were poor dominant negative inhibitors of both activin-A- and activin-B-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, the V73A mutant was a more effective dominant negative inhibitor than wild-type ALK4 for both activin-A and activin-B. Mutations at residues Ser38 and Phe82 had little effect on ALK4 dominant negative activity for either activin isoform (Fig. 5). Overall, these results indicate that activin-A and activin-B interact with the same residues on ALK4.Fig. 5Activin-A- and activin-B-induced luciferase activity requires the same ALK4-ECD residues. HEK293T cells were transfected in triplicate with A3-Lux, cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, FAST2, and empty vector (white bar), wild-type ALK4-trunc (black bar), or the indicated ALK4-trunc mutants (gray bars).

K5.Bcl-xL-/- mice were viable, devoid of alteration in the development of skin or appendages. However, they harbored spontaneous apoptotic keratinocytes in the epidermis. Bcl-xL-deficient keratinocytes cultured in vitro readily underwent apoptosis in the absence of growth factors, but the addition of HGF or EGF resulted in restoration of cell survival, which was reversed by treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Topical treatment of K5.Bcl-xL-/- mice with wortmannin sensitized the skin for apoptosis induced by UV (UV) B, although wild-type epidermis was only marginally affected by this treatment, suggesting that the resistance to UVB largely depended on PI3K-Akt signaling in Bcl-xL-deficient mice but not in wild-type mice. Furthermore, UVB irradiation resulted in redistribution of phosphorylated Akt from the basal layer to the suprabasal layer, indicating that Akt could spatially cooperate with Bcl-xL upon UVB exposure in the upper epidermis where Bcl-xL is normally localized. These results suggest that Bcl-xL and the PI3K-Akt pathway form a cooperative, intercompensatory axis for the protection of epidermal keratinocytes from apoptosis in vivo."

Progression of arthrosclerosis in the donor organ after organ transplantation is a major problem. We hypothesized that ischemia-reperfusion induces LOX-1. After 1 h ischemia of bilateral kidneys plus 3, 6, or 12 h reperfusion, we first revealed that LOX-1 mRNA expression was increased in renal cortex and medulla at 6 h after reperfusion, which was decreased by L-arginine supplement. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) end-product nitrite plus nitrate and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression were increased after reperfusion of 6 h. However, NOS substrate L-arginine did not augment but markedly decreased plasma NO end product, because L-arginine supplement suppressed inducible NOS expression in kidney. We hypothesized that available L-arginine is depleted by ischemia-reperfusion, leading to inducible NOS induction. Ischemia decreased L-arginine levels in kidney and L-arginine supplement increased NO end products in renal cortex in the earliest phase of reperfusion. These results disclosed for the first time that a deficiency in L-arginine by ischemia reperfusion causes uncoupling of constitutive NOS, which induces inducible NOS and LOX-1, implying why L-arginine is effective for stroke or transplantation in preventing atherosclerotic progress."

Studies on cells in three-dimensional collagen matrices have shown that fibroblasts switch between proliferative and quiescence phenotypes, depending upon whether matrices are attached or floating during matrix remodeling. Previous work showed that cell signaling through the ERK pathway was decreased in fibroblasts in floating matrices. In the current research, we extend the previous findings to show that serum stimulation of fibroblasts in floating matrices does not result in ERK translocation to the nucleus. In addition, there was decreased serum activation of upstream members of the ERK signaling pathway, MEK and Raf, even though Ras became GTP loaded. The findings suggest that quiescence of fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices may result from a defect in Ras coupling to its downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2066550809,"The use of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is one of the unorthodox mechanisms exploited by viruses to initiate the translation of internal genes. Herein, we report a plant virus exploiting an IRES and its 3′-untranslated region (UTR) to express its internal genes, notably the 3′-proximal viral coat protein gene. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a positive-strand non-polyadenylated RNA virus, was demonstrated to harbor a unique 100-nucleotide (nt) IRES, located 124 nt upstream of the coat protein gene, that could function in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. In comparison with other known IRESs of picornaviruses and eukaryotic mRNAs, this 100-nt IRES is distinctively short and simple. The IRES activity was tested in homologous and heterologous bicistronic constructs, and the expression of the 3′-proximal gene was enhanced when the 3′-UTR was present. When the IRES element was bisected, each half still possessed IRES activity and could initiate internal translation on its own. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses revealed that the primary sequence within the 5′ half was crucial for IRES activity, whereas the primary sequence of the second half and a GNRA motif were non-essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a mechanism whereby an IRES, located in the 3′ portion of the virus genome, co-operates with the 3′-UTR to enhance gene expression differentially.

Viruses, being obligate parasites, depend heavily on their host for replication. To compete successfully with cellular mRNAs for translation and to fully utilize their compact genomes, viruses have evolved various mechanisms either to redirect the translational machinery to favor viral transcripts or to regulate the expression of internal genes. Genome partitioning and the use of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) 1The abbreviations used are: sgRNA, subgenomic RNA; gRNA, genomic RNA; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; HCRSV, hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus; nt, nucleotide(s); ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; CP, coat protein; PTB, pyrimidine tract-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region. are common mechanisms used by many plant viruses to make their internal genes accessible for ribosomes (1Agranovsky A. Morozov S. Molecular Biology of Plant Viruses. Kluwer Academic Press, Norwell, MA1999: 99-119Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, several non-orthodox strategies, such as the use of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) have been exploited by viruses to express multiple genes from a single RNA species. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a member of the genus Carmovirus, is an isometric monopartite plant virus. HCRSV possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that is non-polyadenylated at the 3′ terminus and may not contain a 5′ cap. The genomic RNA (gRNA) is 3911 nt long with the potential to encode seven open reading frames (ORFs), including two novel ORFs, ORF(p23) and ORF(p25) (2Huang M. Koh D.C.Y. Weng L.J. Chang M.L. Zhang L. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two 3′-coterminated sgRNA species have been identified. The 3′-UTR of HCRSV was previously reported to differentially enhance the translation of various ORFs on the gRNA and sgRNA, such as ORF(p25) and ORF(p38) (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a 100-nt IRES that could co-operate with the 3′-UTR of HCRSV to differentially enhance the translation of ORFs on gRNA and sgRNA and a heterologous gene in a bicistronic construct. Located in the 3′ portion of the gRNA and 124 nt upstream of the coat protein gene, this IRES element could function in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. Based on RNA secondary structure predictions, the HCRSV IRES is distinct in comparison with IRESs of picornaviruses and other eukaryotic mRNAs, because it is relatively short and simple. Deletion analyses showed that, when it was bisected, each half of the 100-nt IRES is able to exert the full IRES function independently. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses revealed a six-nucleotide sequence within a predicted stem structure located in the first half of the IRES element to be crucial for the IRES activity. However, the primary sequence of the second half and a GNRA motif were not essential for the IRES activity. When the IRES element was inserted into homologous and heterologous bicistronic constructs, expression of the second cistron was evident, demonstrating its ability to function as an IRES element. Addition of the 3′-UTR to the heterologous bicistronic construct resulted in the enhancement of the second cistron expression, verifying the co-operation between the IRES element and the 3′-UTR. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a unique IRES element found in the 3′ portion of a virus genome could synergistically co-operate with the 3′-UTR to enhance translation differentially. PCR and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Appropriate primers and template DNA were used in amplification reactions with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under standard buffer conditions. The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 50–55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1–3 min. The annealing temperature and extension time were subjected to adjustments accordingly to the melting temperature of the primers used and the length of the PCR fragments synthesized. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with two rounds of PCR and two pairs of primers as previously described (4Liu D.X. Xu H.Y. Brown T.D.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated products was performed with SDS-(15–17.5%) polyacrylamide gels. The labeled polypeptides were detected by autoradiography of dried gels. Coupled in Vitro Transcription and Translation—Plasmid DNAs were expressed in either wheat germ extracts or rabbit reticulocyte lysates by using a transcription-coupled translation (TnT) system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, 1 μg of uncut plasmid DNA was added to a 50-μl reaction mixture that was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min in the presence of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine. Equal amounts of templates were used. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Sucrose Gradient Analysis and Polysome Profiling—The integrity of mRNA derived from pHCRSV223invΔ5′-UTR was analyzed by sucrose gradient analysis as described by Pelletier and Sonenberg (5Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). In brief, the DNA template was linearized and used for in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. The in vitro synthesized RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and then incubated in a 50-μl translation reaction containing 35 μl of wheat germ extract at 30 °C for 10 min. The translation mixture was cooled on ice and layered onto a 10–30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient (2 ml) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (6Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The gradient was then subjected to centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C for 60 min. Fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top of the gradient and measured at absorbance 260 nm to obtain the polysome profile. Based on the polysome profile, fractions were pooled and RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The transcripts were then resolved on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Densitometry and RNA Secondary Structure Prediction—The intensities of the protein bands were measured by a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Molecular Analyst computer software (Bio-Rad). The protein band of interest was normalized accordingly to the intensities of the corresponding p28 band or a background band. The computer program MFOLD (made available from the Bioinformatics Centre, National University of Singapore) was used to predict the RNA secondary structure. Transient Expression of Constructs in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Constructs containing plasmid DNA under the control of a T7 promoter were expressed transiently in eukaryotic cells as described previously (7Liu D.X. Brierley I. Tibbles K.W. Brown T.D.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5772-5780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, semiconfluent monolayers of COS-7 cells were infected with 10 plaque forming units/cell of recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3), which expresses the T7 RNA polymerase gene, for 2 h at 37 °C prior to transfection. The plasmid DNA was transfected into the vTF7–3-infected cells using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium propane methylsulfate transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Western Blotting—Total protein from transfected COS-7 cells was lysed with 2× SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Stratagene) by using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad, Trans-Blot SD), and blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (5% skim milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20)). The membrane was incubated for2hat room temperature in a dilution (1:1000) of a specific antiserum in blocking buffer. After washing three times for 15 min each with TBST, the membrane was blocked for 20 min before it was incubated with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase (Dako) diluted 1:2500 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the membrane was treated using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pHCRSV223, which contains the full-length cDNA clone of HCRSV, was previously described (2Huang M. Koh D.C.Y. Weng L.J. Chang M.L. Zhang L. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmid pIBVE was described previously by Lim and Liu (8Lim K.P. Liu D.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17515-17523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmid p223GFP was made by replacing the region containing HCRSV sequence from nt 1–2194 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene obtained from pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) as follows. Plasmid EGFP-C2 (Clontech) was digested with NheI, end-repaired with DNA polymerase I, and re-digested with SmaI. This fragment was then cloned into an EcoRV-digested pHCRSV223. Plasmid pGFP-E was constructed as follows. A 700-bp fragment covering the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) sequence that encodes for the IBV E protein was obtained by digesting pIBT4 (9Liu D.X. Cavanagh D. Green P. Inglis S.C. Virology. 1991; 184: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with PvuII and BamHI. The fragment was then cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), which was digested first with HindIII, and end-repaired and re-digested with BamHI to give rise to pGFP-C1-E. The fragment covering the EGFP and IBV E protein genes was excised from pGFP-C1-E using NheI, end-repaired and re-digested with BamHI, and cloned into EcoRV- and BamHI-digested pKT-0 (7Liu D.X. Brierley I. Tibbles K.W. Brown T.D.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5772-5780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), giving rise to pGFP-E. A 172-bp fragment covering the HCRSV sequence from nt 2394 to 2566 was obtained by digestion of pHCRSV223 with BstEII, end-repair with DNA polymerase 1, and re-digestion with HpaI. This fragment was cloned into the XhoI-digested and end-repaired pGFP-E, giving rise to pGFP-IRES-E. Plasmids pGFP-IRES-E-3′UTR and pGFP-IRES-E-rev3′UTR were constructed by cloning HCRSV sequence from nt 3627 to 3911 into SmaI-linearized pGFP-IRES-E. Plasmid pGFP-IRES-E-2x3′UTR was generated by cloning two copies of the insert head-to-head into the SmaI-linearized pGFP-IRES-E. The orientation of the inserted fragment was verified by sequencing. Plasmid pGFP-IRES-E-3′UTR(M1) was constructed by cloning HCRSV sequence from nt 3582 to 3911, which contains mutations of the 6-nt segment (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), into SmaI-linearized pGFP-IRES-E. All deletion and mutation constructs were made by ligation of PCR fragments containing appropriate deletions and mutations to their parental constructs and confirmed by automated sequencing. Evidence for the Synergistic Effect between the 3′-UTR and an Internal Region on Translational Enhancement—The 3′-UTR of HCRSV was previously reported to differentially enhance the translation of gRNA and sgRNAs, increasing the expression of the 3′-located ORFs, such as ORF(p25) and ORF(p38) (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms that control this differential enhancement effect, we first tested if the translation initiation of the 3′-proximal ORFs was dependent on the 5′ end. Expression of construct pHCRSV223Δ5′UTR, where the 5′-UTR was deleted from the full-length cDNA clone (Fig. 1a), resulted in the production of four major polypeptides of 23, 28, 38, and 25 kDa, similar to the wild type construct pHCRSV223 (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 and 2). These four products were encoded by ORF(p23), ORF(p28), ORF(p38), and ORF(p25), respectively (Fig. 1a). However, the expression of the 5′-proximal ORFs, ORF(p23) and ORF(p28), was significantly reduced, whereas the expression of the 3′-proximal ORF(p25) and ORF(p38) was enhanced (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 and 2). This result indicated that the expression of p23 and p28 was dependent on the 5′ end, whereas the expression of p25 and p38 was initiated by an alternative mechanism that was independent of the 5′ end. The removal of the 5′-UTR might have partially contributed to the enhanced expression of p25 and p38, because it could have reduced the competition between the internal initiation site and the 5′ end. Deletion of the 3′-UTR in construct pHCRSV223Δ3′UTR reduced the expression of the p25 and p38 polypeptides (Fig. 1b, lane 3), indicating that the enhanced expression of p25 and p38 observed in pHCRSV223Δ5′UTR may be attributed mainly to the presence of the 3′-UTR. When both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs were deleted in construct pHCRSV223Δ5′UTRΔ3′UTR, the expression of all the four polypeptides were significantly reduced (Fig. 1b, lane 4). The presence of an internal region that may co-operate with the 3′-UTR to enhance the expression of p25 and p38 was further analyzed by expression of the construct pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR, which was generated by deleting the 5′-UTR and inverting the region containing nt 28–1036 (Fig. 1a). This deletion and inversion abolished the expression of p23 and p28 (Fig. 1b, lane 5). On the contrary, the expression of p25 and p38 was increased (Fig. 1b, lane 5). In addition, two polypeptides p24 and p22.5 were produced (Fig. 1b, lane 5). These two products were observed when pHCRSV80, which contains cDNA clone of sgRNA2, was expressed (2Huang M. Koh D.C.Y. Weng L.J. Chang M.L. Zhang L. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and may be initiated from the leaky start codon for p25. To rule out the possibility that the observed expression profile might be due to cleavage of the in vitro transcripts by endonucleases during in vitro translation, the integrity of pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR mRNA associated with polysomes was examined by incubation of the α-32P-labeled pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR mRNA in a translation reaction containing wheat germ extract at 30 °C for 10 min and sucrose density gradient analysis. Based on the polysome profiles, fractions were pooled and RNA was extracted and resolved on a formaldehyde agarose gel. Trace amounts of RNA were detected from the top of the gradient (Fig. 1c, region I and Fig. 1d, lane 2), and small amounts of mRNA could be extracted from fractions containing the 80 S monosomes (Fig. 1c, region II and Fig. 1d, lane 3). As expected, the pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR mRNA was found predominantly in the actively translating polysomes (Fig. 1c, region III and Fig. 1d, lane 4). The major RNA species detected in these fractions corresponds to the full-length pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR mRNA (Fig. 1d, lanes 1 and 4). Furthermore, a very similar profile between RNA detected in the polysome fraction and the initial α-32P-labeled RNA preparation was observed (Fig. 1d, lanes 1 and 4). These results rule out the possibility that synthesis of polypeptides p38 and p25 from pHCRSV223invΔ5′UTR mRNA resulted from an endonucleolytic event that occurred between the inverted region at the 5′ end and the 3′ portion of the messenger. It is likely that an internal initiation event may be responsible for the synthesis of these two products. Identification of the IRES Element—Deletion analysis of the full-length construct pHCRSV223 was carried out to delineate the region responsible for internal initiation (Fig. 2a). The expression of p28, being 5′-end dependent, was used as an internal control for the internal initiation event and the stability of RNA templates during translation. Deletion of the region from nt 1208–2394 in construct pHCRSV223Δ1 stimulated the expression of p38 and p25 (Fig. 2b, lane 2). The expression of p38 was increased by at least 5-fold compared with the control pHCRSV223 (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2). When a further 172-nt region was deleted in construct pHCRSV223Δ2, the expression of p38 was reduced by at least 5-fold that of the control (Fig. 2b, lane 3), indicating that the IRES element was to be located within the boundaries of nt 2394 and nt 2566. When this 172-nt region was specifically deleted in construct pHCRSV223Δ3, a 5-fold reduction in p38 expression was observed (Fig. 2b, lane4), confirming that the IRES element is located within this region. The region containing the IRES element (nt 2394–2566) was then inserted into a bicistronic construct containing the GFP gene as the 5′ cistron and the envelope (E) protein gene of coronavirus IBV as the 3′ cistron, giving rise to construct pGFP-IRES-E (Fig. 2a). Construct pGFP-E, containing the GFP gene and the E protein gene in different reading frames, was used as a control (Fig. 2a). Expression of pGFP-E resulted in the detection of GFP (Fig 2c, lane 1). With the insertion of nt 2394–2566 between the 5′ and 3′ cistrons, the GFP encoded by the 5′ cistron and the E protein encoded by the 3′ cistron, were expressed (Fig. 2c, lane 2). These results demonstrated that translation of the E protein was initiated by the inserted sequence. Co-operation of IRES with the 3′-UTR to Enhance the Expression of the 3′ Cistron in the Bicistronic Construct—To test if the identified IRES was involved in the differential enhancement effect by the 3′-UTR, the 3′-UTR of HCRSV was added into the bicistronic construct pGFP-IRES-E to generate construct pGFP-IRES-E-3′UTR (Fig. 3a). It was observed that addition of the 3′-UTR significantly enhanced the expression of E protein by 4-fold (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting the synergistic effect between the 3′-UTR and the IRES element. It was also interesting to note that, although IBV E protein expression was increased, the expression of GFP became significantly reduced by 1.5-fold. The presence of the 3′-UTR and the synergy between the 3′-UTR and IRES could create a competition for translational apparatus, such that the 5′-end-dependent expression of GFP was limited. The expression of both proteins was normalized to that of a background band when quantitative data were presented. In a parallel experiment, the 3′-UTR was introduced in an antisense orientation to generate pGFP-IRES-E-rev3′UTR (Fig. 3a). The IBV E protein expression was comparable to pGFP-IRES-E (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 3). When two copies of the 3′-UTR were tandemly inserted in a head-to-head fashion in construct pGFP-IRES-E-2x3′UTR (Fig. 3a), the translational enhancement effect of the 3′-UTR was not observed (Fig. 3b, lane 4). The expression profiles of both the IBV E and GFP proteins were similar to pGFP-IRES-E (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 4). It is possible that the tandemly arranged 3′-UTR segments may form stable double-strand RNA structures by base pairing, thus eliminating essential domains on the 3′-UTR responsible for the synergistic effect. Previously, we reported that a 6-nt segment within the 3′-UTR was responsible for the translational enhancement effect of the 3′-UTR (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test if this 6-nt segment was involved in this synergistic effect, the 6-nt mutation (3659GGGCAG3664 to 3659GCCAGC3664) was introduced, giving rise to the mutant construct pGFP-IRES-E-3′UTR(M1) (Fig. 3a). Expression of this construct showed that the 3′-located IBV E protein was comparable to pGFP-IRES-E (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 5). Deletion Analysis of the IRES Activity between nt 2466 and 2566 —Detailed dissection of the region from nt 2394 to 2566 was performed by deletion analysis to map the sequence responsible for the IRES effect (Fig. 4a). In construct pH-CRSV223Δ4, which had a deletion of the first half of the region consisting nt 2394–2466, expression of p38 was enhanced by at least 2-fold as compared with pHCRSV223 (Fig. 4b, lanes 1 and 3). Construct pHCRSV223Δ5 contains a deletion of the second half of the region (nt 2466–2566) (Fig. 4a), resulting in a 2-fold reduction in p38 expression when compared with pHCRSV223 (Fig. 4b, lanes 1 and 5). These results indicated that the active IRES element was located in the region from nt 2466 to 2566. This 100-nt region was further bisected in constructs pH-CRSV223Δ6 and pHCRSV223Δ7 with deletions of 50 and 45 nt, respectively (Fig. 4a). Expression of the two constructs showed similar levels of the p38 expression to that of pHCRSV223 (Fig. 4b, lanes 1, 4, and 6). This observation implies that the smaller segments, both 50 nt and 45 nt, of the IRES were able to exert full IRES activity independently. Constructs pHCRSV223Δ8 and pHCRSV223Δ9 containing only regions from nt 2466 to 2515 and from nt 2516 to 2566, respectively, were constructed to test the IRES activity of each segment (Fig. 4a). Expression of pHCRSV223Δ8 showed the enhanced expression of p38 by 2.5-fold compared with pHCRSV223 (Fig. 4b, lanes 7 and 9). Expression of pHCRSV223Δ9 showed that the p38 expression was enhanced by 1.2-fold compared with pHCRSV223 (Fig. 4b, lanes 8 and 9). It suggests that the region containing nt 2466–2515 possesses stronger IRES activity than the region nt 2516–2566. Mutational Analysis of the First Half of IRES (nt 2466–2515)—Secondary structure prediction of region from nt 2466 to 2515 revealed the presence of a stable stem loop structure located within nt 2494 to 2512 (Fig. 5a). Mutation of this putative stem loop structure was carried out by mutating a stretch of 6 nt, 2494CTGATT2499 to 2494GGTACC2499, giving rise to construct pHCRSV223Δ8M1 (Fig. 5a). Expression of the construct resulted in a reduction of 5-fold in p38 expression compared with the wild type construct pHCRSV223Δ8 (Fig. 5b, lanes 1 and 2). When mutation of 3 nt from 2496GAT2498 to 2496CTA2498 was made in construct pHCRSV223Δ8M2 (Fig. 5a), a similar level of p38 expression was observed (Fig. 5b, lanes 1 and 3). Compensatory mutation of 2508ATC2510 to 2508TAG2510 was made based on pHCRSV223Δ8M2 to restore the putative stem loop structure, yielding the construct pHCRSV223Δ8M3 (Fig. 5a). Expression of this construct resulted in a 5-fold reduction in p38 expression compared with pHCRSV223Δ8 (Fig. 5b, lanes 1 and 4). These results demonstrated that the putative secondary structure of RNA was not responsible for the IRES effect, but rather the sequence located in the region nt 2494–2512 seems to play an important role. Mutation of the 3 nt from 2496GAT2498 to 2496CTA2498 was introduced into the biologically active cDNA clone of HCRSV, pHCRSV223, yielding the construct pHCRSV223M2496. In vitro transcribed transcripts derived from this mutant were inoculated on kenaf plants, and the plants were regularly observed up to 60 days post-inoculation for the development of viral symptoms. Plants inoculated with the RNA from pHCRSV223 showed severe chlorotic ringspots and vein banding at 14–17 days. Reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing results detected viral replication in the infected leaves. However, plants inoculated with transcripts derived from pHCRSV223M2496 remained uninfected during the whole observation period, and viral transcripts were not detected in reverse transcription-PCR. This result suggests that this mutation affects the infectivity of HCRSV. Mutational Analysis of the Second Half of IRES (nt 2516–2566) and a Putative GNRA Motif—Systematic site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify significant motif that may contribute to the IRES activity between nt 2516 and 2566. Nine mutants were constructed based on pHCRSV223Δ9 (Fig. 6a). Expression of these constructs showed that the nucleotide substitutions did not significantly affect the p38 expression (Fig. 6b). Mutations in constructs pHCRSV223Δ9M6, pHCRSV223Δ9M8, and pHCRSV223Δ9M9, where 26–56% nucleotides were substituted resulted in a 1.5-fold reduction in p38 expression compared with the wild type construct pH-CRSV223Δ9 (Fig. 6b). Analysis of the sequence downstream of the IRES element between nt 2566 and the start codon of p38 at nt 2603 revealed the presence of a GAAA motif between nt 2573 and 2576 located in the loop region of a predicted downstream stem loop structure. The GNRA tetraloops, found in all picornavirus IRES secondary structures, are directly involved in IRES activity (10Lopez deq Uinto S. Martinez-Salas E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of 2573GAAA2576 to 2573CTGC2576 was made in pHCRSV223Δ9M10 (Fig. 6a). Expression of the construct showed that the mutation did not disrupt the level of p38 expression (Fig. 6b, lanes 11 and 12). These results demonstrated that the identified GNRA motif and the primary sequence within the region nt 2516–2566 were not essential for the IRES activity. Functionality of the HCRSV IRES Element in Mammalian Cells—To test if this plant virus IRES element is functional in mammalian cells, the GFP gene was cloned upstream of the IRES region in construct pHCRSV223GFP (Fig. 7a). In a transient expression system (11Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), COS-7 cells were infected with vaccinia virus, which possesses a T7 polymerase gene, and transfected with T7-promoter driven pHCRSV223GFP plasmid DNA. The expression of GFP was detected in transfected cells when viewed under UV (data not shown). The cells were harvested, and Western blot detection was performed using the expression of β-tubulin gene as a control to normalize the densitometry readings. As shown in Fig. 7b, the expression of both GFP and p38 was detected from pHCRSV223GFP, which indicates that the IRES element from HCRSV was active in mammalian cells. The HCRSV IRES activity in COS-7 cells was further analyzed by expression of four deletion constructs (pHCRSV223Δ1, pHCRSV223Δ2, pHCRSV223Δ3, and pHCRSV223Δ4). The results obtained substantiated the observations made in the in vitro studies. As shown in Fig 7c, when the IRES element was deleted in pHCRSV223Δ2 and pHCRSV223Δ3, the expression of p38 was abolished (Fig. 7c, lanes 3 and 4). Much enhanced expression of p38 was observed in constructs pHCRSV223Δ1 and pHCRSV223Δ4 compared with pHCRSV223 (Fig. 7c, lanes 1, 2, and 5). RNA viruses, particularly plant RNA viruses, usually contain compact genomes with limited coding capacity. To fully utilize their genetic storage, viruses have evolved strategies to regulate the expression of different ORFs. Previously, we reported that the 3′-UTR of HCRSV could differentially enhance the translation of ORFs located at the 3′ portion of gRNA and sgRNA (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the synergy between the 3′-UTR and an IRES element, located 124 nt upstream of the coat protein (CP) gene, was responsible for the differential translation enhancement effect. The synergistic effect between the 3′-UTR and the IRES could be likened to that of the interaction between the 5′ and 3′ termini of viral and cellular mRNAs that results in the formation of a circularized mRNA. Evidence has shown that the poly(A) tail binding protein and the 3′-poly(A) tail interact synergistically with the 5′ cap to promote translation initiation and increase translation efficiency by forming a “closed-loop” initiation complex (12Jacobson A. Translational Control. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 451-480Google Scholar, 13Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Circularization of mRNA is thought to enhance translation by facilitating the recycling of the initiation factors (12Jacobson A. Translational Control. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 451-480Google Scholar, 13Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and allowing new rounds of initiation to occur rapidly (1 4). This activity is crucial when there is competition between virus and host for translation machinery (15Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or when the availability of ribosomes or initiation factors becomes limited (16Proweller A. Butler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6004-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Synergy between the poly(A) tail/3′ UTR and IRES elements has also been documented for several viral systems. Bergamini et al. (17Bergamini G. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) demonstrated that translation driven by the picornavirus IRESs, such as encephalomyocarditis virus, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus, has been synergistically enhanced by a poly(A) tail. Non-polyadenylated hepatitis C virus with the involvement of the pyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) has also adopted this relationship between its 3′-UTR and IRES to enhance translation by 3- to 5-fold (18Ito T. Tahara S.M. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8789-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PTB protein can also bind to IRES regions of several other RNA viruses to regulate their translation (19Kolupaeva V.G. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1199-1212PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pilipenko E.V. Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Khitrina E.V. Poperechnaya A.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2028-2045PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this study suggest that the differentially enhanced expression of the HCRSV CP was mediated by the co-operation between the 3′-UTR and IRES. Is this enhancement effect exerted by circularization of the genomic RNA? Mutagenesis studies have shown that an 8-nt region within the first half of the HCRSV IRES may play an important role in IRES activity and determine viral infectivity. One possibility could be that this region might contain sequences complementary to the 18 S rRNA. Computer analysis revealed that the region within the IRES from nt 2493 to 2500 (5′-CCTGATTA-3′) has 75% complementarity to the 3′ region of the 18 S rRNA of Nicotiana tabacum from nt 1667 to 1674 (5′-TGATCCGG-3′). The 6-nt segment within the 3′-UTR, which was shown to be responsible for translational enhancement by its predicted base pairing with the 3′ end of the 18 S rRNA of N. tabacum (3Koh D.C.Y. Liu D.X. Wong S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was also demonstrated to significantly influence the synergistic effect between the IRES and the 3′-UTR. The regions in which the IRES and 3′-UTR were predicted to base pair the 18 S rRNA are found in the same vicinity, and there is a possibility that their base pairing with the 18 S rRNA might circularize the RNA to enhance the translation of the 3′-located ORFs. It has been reported that some mRNA sequences that bind ribosomes through base pairing not only affect translation efficiency but are also able to function as IRESs (21Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and mRNA fragments complementary to the 18 S rRNA increase their chances of being translated by attaching to the 18 S rRNA (22Matveeva O.P. Shabalina S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is interesting that so far all the IRESs reported to have synergy with either the poly(A) tail or the 3′-UTR are found in the 5′-UTR, suggesting that the HCRSV IRES being found in the 3′ portion of the genome, is unique and distinct. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an IRES element, located at the 3′ portion of the viral genome, which could differentially enhance the expression of downstream ORFs by co-operation with the 3′-UTR. In comparison to all known viral IRESs that are highly structured, the 100-nt HCRSV IRES is distinctively short and simple. It is interesting to note that the 100-nt IRES can be equally divided into two halves, each containing an IRES activity that could initiate translation internally on its own. Secondary structural analysis revealed a potential stem-loop structure in the 5′ segment. Compensatory mutations showed that this structure was not responsible for the IRES activity, but mutations to 3 nt of the stem structure reduced the p38 expression by 2-fold. This indicated that the primary sequence was a contributing element for the IRES function. Substitutions of single nucleotides in other IRES elements have been shown to severely reduce IRES activity (23Trono D. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2291-2299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the second half of IRES with a similar region in turnip crinkle virus revealed 66% sequence similarity particularly in CA-rich regions, which have been reported to enhance the CP expression from sgRNA (24Qu F. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The presence of CA-rich motifs in the 5′-UTR in the proximity of the initiation codons is a common occurrence in many plant viral RNAs, including turnip crinkle virus (24Qu F. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and tobacco mosaic virus (25Gallie D.R. Walbot V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4631-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The CA-rich region within the HCRSV IRES may contribute to the additional length and reduced secondary structure (26Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and, therefore, provides a suitable landing pad for ribosomes to initiate at the downstream initiation codon. Dorokhov et al. (27Dorokhov Y.L. Skulachev M.X. Ivanov P.A. Zvereva S.D. Tjulkina L.G. Merits A. Gleba Y.Y. Hohn T. Atabekov J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Besides functioning in the wheat germ expression system, the HCRSV IRES was able to function in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and mammalian cells. IRES elements identified in crucifer infecting tobamovirus have been reported to be active in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (28Ivanov P.A. Karpova O.V. Skulachev M.V. Tomashevskaya O.L. Rodionova N.P. Dorokhov Y.L. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1997; 232: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and have recently been demonstrated to function in yeast and HeLa cells (27Dorokhov Y.L. Skulachev M.X. Ivanov P.A. Zvereva S.D. Tjulkina L.G. Merits A. Gleba Y.Y. Hohn T. Atabekov J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although it may be possible for plant viral IRES to function in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate expression system and the mammalian cell system, RNAs of poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus do not function efficiently in wheat germ extract (29Dorner A.J. Semler B.L. Jackson R.J. Hanecok R. Duprey E. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 507-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jang S.K. Krausslic H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of sequences upstream of the HCRSV IRES resulted in a much more obvious stimulatory effect on p38 expression in mammalian cells, compared with that observed in the wheat germ system. This could be due to the removal of a certain upstream negative regulatory element that mediates the IRES function more effectively in mammalian cells. Translation of hepatitis C virus RNA was attenuated when a PTB protein binds to an internal pyrimidine-rich tract, which was relieved in the presence of an X region in the 3′-UTR (31Ito T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1999; 254: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The PTB protein, known to bind an IRES site in the 5′-UTR and the X region in the 3′-UTR to enhance translation (18Ito T. Tahara S.M. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8789-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is proposed to mediate translation regulation by another mechanism through its interaction with the internally located PTB protein-binding site. It may be possible that such sites that contain negative regulatory elements are located in the immediate upstream region of the HCRSV IRES, such that the removal of these elements resulted in a stimulatory effect of IRES on its 3′ proximal gene expression. Alternatively, the presence of secondary structures located upstream of IRES that could determine ribosome accessibility, may also affect IRES activity. Stimulatory effects of IRES on the removal of upstream sequences have been reported in human parechovirus (32Nateri A.S. Hughes P.J. Stanway G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6269-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidently, the possibility that the HCRSV CP could be internally translated does not exclude the conventional mechanism controlling the expression of CP via sgRNA. These two mechanisms may operate in concert at different times of the viral life cycle such that internal initiation could direct small amounts of CP to be expressed from gRNA in the early stages of infection for production of virus to effect sufficient systemic infection."

TRAP expression in osteoclasts is regulated by receptor activator of NF-κB (RANKL), a potent activator of osteoclast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the RANKL-induced TRAP expression remains unknown. Here we show that two regions in the mouse TRAP promoter (one at –1858 to –1239 and the other at –1239 to –1039, relative to the translation start site) are implicated in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells. A detailed characterization of the region at –1239 to –1039 identifies a 12-bp sequence, AGCCACGTGGTG, that specifically binds nuclear proteins from RAW264.7 cells and primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Moreover, the binding is significantly enhanced in EMSA with nuclear extracts from RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells and BMMs, suggesting that the 12-bp sequence may be involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. Various assays reveal that nuclear proteins binding to the 12-bp sequence are upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 and 2. Importantly, mutation of the USF-binding site partially blocks RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells, confirming that USF1 and USF2 are functionally involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. In summary, our data show that USF1 and USF2 play a functional role in RANKL-dependent TRAP expression during osteoclast differentiation.

Importantly, a 1.8-kb mouse promoter region is capable of driving the osteoclast-specific expression of Src gene fused downstream of the TRAP promoter, in transgenic mice (27Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), indicating that this 1.8-kb promoter contains important regulatory elements required for transcriptional activation in osteoclasts. In our present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the RANKL-dependent TRAP expression during osteoclast differentiation by using a luciferase reporter construct containing the 1.8-kb TRAP promoter. We identified a 12-bp sequence in the TRAP promoter that is involved in TRAP transcriptional activation in response to RANKL. Interestingly, we also showed that this 12-bp sequence regulates the RANKL-induced TRAP gene transcription by using upstream stimulating factors (USF) 1 and 2, instead of NF-κB and AP-1 that are known transcription factors activated by RANKL. These data not only establish a functional role of USF1 and USF2 in TRAP expression in osteoclasts but also define a new transcriptional mechanism by which RANKL regulates gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Antibodies used for supershift assays, including c-Fos (sc-52X), c-Jun (sc-44X), p65 (sc-372X), p50 (sc-1190X), c-Myc (sc-674X), Max (sc-197X), USF-1 (sc-229X), and USF-2 (sc-862X), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The PCR was performed using genomic DNA from C3H mice from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN) as a template and high fidelity Pfx polymerase from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, MI) between BglII and HindIII. Cohesive ends resulting from BamHI and BglII digestion are compatible. The amplified TRAP promoter was confirmed by sequencing, and the resulting reporter plasmid was named TP(–1858).9 deletion mutants of TP(–1858), TP(–1239), TP(–1199), TP(–1159), TP(–1119), TP(–1079), TP(–1039), TP(–839), TP(–639), and TP(–439), were prepared using forward primers derived from different 5′ positions (the numbers in parentheses) of the TRAP promoter and the same reverse primer as used above for amplifying the longest construct TP(–1858). All of these forward primers contain a BamHI site at their 5′-ends. PCR was performed using TP(–1858) as a template and high fidelity Pfx polymerase from Invitrogen. The amplified TRAP promoter fragments were subcloned into pGL3-basic (Promega) and their sequence was confirmed by sequencing.Cell Cultures and Transient Transfections—RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in tissue culture plates and passed by lifting the cells by scraping. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagents from Invitrogen. For transfections, cells were plated in six-well cell culture plates at the concentration of 8 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfections. For each well, 2 μg of reporter plasmid plus 0.05 μg of internal-control plasmid phRL-SV40 (Promega) were used. Transfected cells were treated with or without 200 ng/ml GST-RANKL for various times after transfection and lysed for luciferase assays using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega.Nuclear Extract Preparation—Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from long bones of 4- to 8-week-old C3H mice from Harlan Industries as described previously (28Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin.

RAW 164.7 cells were cultured as described above in tissue culture dishes. Cells were treated with or without RANKL treatment for the indicated times. Upon confluence (about 1 × 107 cells), cells were washed with cold PBS three times. Cell were then scraped off the dishes, spun down, resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold PBS, and transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 30 s, media were removed, and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added freshly). Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice, at which time 32 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension, followed by vortexing the tube for 15 s and incubating on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were spun down and resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin; DTT, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, BAESF, pepstatin, and leupeptin were added freshly to the buffer). The nuclei were incubated with the extraction buffer on ice for 20 min and spun down in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was aliquoted, quickly frozen in dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were end-labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). 2–5 × 104 cpm probe was incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20-μl volume of binding reaction (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 ng/ml poly(dI·dC) on ice for 20 min). In competition experiments, a 50× and/or 100× excess amount of unlabeled competitors was premixed with labeled probe before being added to the binding mixture. The binding reaction was then allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice. In supershift experiments, probe was incubated with 3 μg/ml nuclear extracts in a 20-μl volume of binding reaction for 20 min on ice, at which time 4 μg of control IgG or 4 μg of specific antibodies were added, followed by incubation on ice for an additional 30 min. All binding mixtures were separated, using 0.5× TBE buffer as the running buffer, at 4 °C and 100 V for 3.5 h by 4–20% gradient TBE gels (Invitrogen) in a Novex Xcell II minicell electrophoresis system. The gels were transferred to 3M blotting paper and dried, and exposures were made to film.In Vitro Translations—In vitro translated USF1 and USF2 were prepared by using a PROTEINscriptTM II-linked transcription/translation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and expression plasmids for USF1 (psvUSF1) and USF2 (psvUSF2) described in a previous study (29Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These expression plasmids were constructed using vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains the T7 promoter suitable for in vitro translations. Thus, PROTEINscriptTM II T7 was used for in vitro translation assays with these expression vectors. Briefly, 0.5 μg of each plasmid (pSG5, psvUSF1, or psvUSF2) was used to set up transcription reactions (10 μl of reaction volume for each experiment) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Subsequently, 2 μlof the transcription reaction was used for the translation reaction following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (50 μl of reaction volume for each experiment). 5 μl from each translation reaction was then used to perform EMSA as described above.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced in the context of the longest TRAP promoter construct TP(–1858) using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides used to mutate the USF-binding site were 5′-GCTACAGCCAGCCACGgaGTGTGTGCCTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGAAGGCACACACtcCGTGGCTGGCTGTAGC-3. These oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PCRs were performed in a 50-μl volume with Pfu polymerase, 10 ng of DNA template TP(–1858), and 125 ng of each oligonucleotide using the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, 1 cycle; 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min, 18 cycles; and 4 °C park. The PCR products were treated with DpnI (10 units) for 60 min at 37 °C. XL1-blue supercompetent cells were transformed with the DpnI-treated PCR mixture as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual and plated on ampicillin plates. Plasmids were prepared from individual colonies and sequenced to confirm the correctness of introduced mutations.Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was performed using the Genetic Computer Group (Madison, WI) sequence analysis software.RESULTSA 1858-bp Mouse TRAP Promoter Confers Responsiveness to RANKL—Osteoclasts were previously prepared in vitro by coculturing BMMs (osteoclast precursors) with osteoblasts or stromal cells in the presence of osteotropic factors such as 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and dexamethasone (30Suda T.

Osteoclasts can now be generated simply by treating BMMs with M-CSF and RANKL (13Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H.

More importantly, the previous studies showed that RANKL significantly increases TRAP mRNA levels both in primary BMMs (13Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R.

Res. 2002; 17: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that RANKL may up-regulate TRAP expression by activating the transcription of TRAP gene. To investigate this possibility, we amplified a 1858-bp mouse TRAP promoter (–1858 to –1, relative to the translation start site ATG) by PCR based on published sequence (24Reddy S.V. Hundley J.E.

Res. 1993; 8: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of our clone is compared with those published, and differences exist among these three clones (Fig. 1A). To confirm that our sequence is not altered by possible mutations associated with PCR-based amplifications, we sequenced and compared two clones from two independent PCR amplifications. Thus, the differences between our clone and two published ones likely result from variations in mouse strains and/or individual animals.The amplified TRAP promoter was subcloned into pGL3-basic in sense orientation to the luciferase gene to generate a reporter construct TP(–1858). Because primary BMMs are extremely difficult to transfect, we used RAW264.7 cells for our transfection assays. TP(–1858) was transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells, and the transfection result shows that RANKL activated the TRAP promoter in a time-dependent manner with a maximal induction at day 4 (about 2.5-fold) (Fig. 1B), thus indicating that the 1858-bp TRAP promoter contains one or more sequences mediating RANKL-induced activation of TRAP gene transcription. In addition, because the data show that a 4-day RANKL treatment gave rise to the highest TRAP promoter activation, all of our following transfection studies will be performed with a 4-day RANKL treatment.Localization of a 40-bp TRAP Promoter Region (–1239 to –1199) That Binds RANKL-induced Nuclear Proteins—To characterize the sequence(s) involved in the RANKL-induced TRAP transcription, we generated five deletion mutants of the TRAP promoter: TP(–1239), TP(–1039), TP(–839), TP(–639), and TP(–439) (Fig. 2A). These mutants contain RANKL promoter regions starting from different 5′ positions (the numbers in parentheses) and ending at the same 3′ site (–1). We then used these deletion mutants to perform transfection studies (Fig. 2B). Although our longest construct TP(–1858) gave rise to an increase of about 2.5-fold in TRAP promoter activity in response to RANKL, deletion of a 619-bp region (–1858 to –1239) only resulted in an induction of about 1.6-fold (Fig. 2B), indicating that this 619-bp region plays a role in RANKL-dependent TRAP gene transcription. Moreover, deletion of another 200-bp region (–1239 to –1039) totally abolished RANKL responsiveness (Fig. 2B), revealing that this 200-bp region is also critical for RANKL-dependent TRAP gene transcription. Taken together, these data show that two TRAP promoter regions are involved in RANKL-dependent TRAP transcription.Fig. 2Localization of a 40-bp TRAP promoter region (–1239 to –1199) that binds RANKL-induced nuclear proteins.A, construction of five deletion mutants of TRAP promoter: TP(–1239), TP(–1039), TP(–839), TP(–639), and TP(–439). These mutants were constructed by PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, transfection assays. RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected with the deletion mutants shown in A and internal-control plasmid phRL-SV40. Transfected cells were treated with RANKL (200 ng/ml) or PBS as control for 4 days. Firefly luciferase activities of these mutants were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity of internal control phRL-SV40.

To this end, we first determined whether the 200-bp region binds any nuclear proteins in response to RANKL. We synthesized five overlapping oligonucleotides spanning the entire 200-bp TRAP promoter region (Fig. 2C). We labeled these oligonucleotides and used them as probes to perform EMSA with nuclear extracts from untreated and RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2D). Oligonucleotide I gave rise to a major band (band A) in EMSA with untreated RAW264.7 cells (lane 2). This band was significantly enhanced when RANKL-treated RAW264.7 nuclear extracts were used (lane 3), suggesting that nuclear proteins corresponding to band A may be implicated in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. In addition to band A, a minor b"
https://openalex.org/W2089816176,"Exposure of growing neurons to thrombin or semaphorin 3A stimulates a receptor-mediated signaling cascade that results in collapse of their growth cones. This collapse response necessitates eicosanoid production, as we have shown earlier. The present report investigates whether and which protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms may be activated by such eicosanoids. To examine these questions, we isolated growth cones from fetal rat brain and tested whether thrombin or the eicosanoid, 12(<i>S</i>)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(<i>S</i>)-HETE), could activate endogenous growth cone PKC. We show that both thrombin and 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE stimulate the phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate, an 87-kDa adhesion site protein. Furthermore, we show both with immunoprecipitated and with recombinant PKC that 12(<i>S</i>)-HETE activation is selective for the ϵ isoform and does not require accessory proteins. Last, we demonstrate that PKC activation is necessary for thrombin-induced growth cone collapse. These data indicate that eicosanoid-mediated repellent effects result from the direct and selective activation of PKCϵ and suggest the involvement of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate phosphorylation in growth cone collapse."
https://openalex.org/W1993803828,"The immunoregulatory neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was cleaved by purified IgG from Fas-defective C3H/gld mice, lupus patients, and autoimmune thyroiditis patients. No VIPase activity was detected in IgG from control mice and humans. Kinetic analyses of VIPase IgG preparations suggested low-affinity recognition of VIP. Yet the VIPase activity was VIP selective, judged by lack of correlation with other protease activities expressed by the IgG and by noninterference of unrelated peptides in the activity. Recombinant Fv constructs selected from a human lupus phage show library displayed VIPase activity, confirming that the active site is located in the V domains. Inhibition of the VIPase activity by di-isopropylfluorophosphate suggested a serine protease-like mechanism of catalysis. Irreversible binding of a biotinyated phosphonate diester by the IgG and Fv preparations was observed, consistent with the presence of activated nucleophiles similar to those in enzymes capable of covalent catalysis. These observations show that VIP is a target for specific catalytic autoantibodies in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2081880634,"NF-κB-IκB complex formation regulates the level and specificity of NF-κB activity. Quantitative analyses showed that RelA-NF-κB-induced IκBα binding is regulated through inhibitor retention and phosphorylation. RelA caused an increase in IκBα phosphorylation and in degradation, which was enhanced monotonically with inhibitor concentration. In vivo analysis demonstrated the RelA-induced IκBα/RelA interactions to be specific, saturable, and phosphorylation-dependent. In addition, it showed that phosphorylation regulates both the level and affinity of the complexes and demonstrated an increased average affinity to coincide with reduction in the level of complexes during cytokine-induced pathway activation. The data show that RelA regulation of NF-κB-IκBα complex formation is IκBα phosphorylation-dependent and that IκBα/NF-κB binding is dynamic and determined by concentration of the subunits. In addition, they suggest that regulation of both complex levels and affinities through phosphorylation, with effects on the system steady state, participate in selective activation of the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2016512598,"We reported previously that bone marrow granulocytes respond to small amounts of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via a CD14-independent and TLR4-mediated mechanism by de novo expression of an inducible receptor (CD14) and by down-modulation of a constitutive receptor (L-selectin). In this report we address another effect of LPS: the down-regulation of receptors for tumor necrosis factor-α. In mouse bone marrow cells (BMC), this down-regulation is detectable soon (20 min) after exposure of the cells to low levels (0.5 ng/ml) of LPS. This temperature-dependent effect is rather selective for LPS and requires the presence of a conventional lipid A structure in the LPS molecule and a functional TLR4 molecule in the cells. The down-modulation, due to a shedding of the receptors, is blocked by p38 MAPK inhibitors, by a furin inhibitor, and by three metalloproteinase inhibitors (BB-3103, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3). In contrast, inhibitors of MEK, protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and kinases of the Src family do not block the shedding. Analysis of BMC from mice lacking tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (CD120a–/–) or tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 (CD120b–/–) indicates that the LPS-induced shedding is specific for CD120b. Thus, exposure of BMC to LPS triggers a rapid shedding of CD120b via a protein kinase C- and Src-independent pathway mediated by p38 MAPK, furin, and metalloproteinase. The additive effects of furin and metalloproteinase inhibitors suggest that these enzymes are involved in parallel shedding pathways.

Two major cell types, the neutrophilic granulocyte and the monocyte/macrophage, are associated with susceptibility to infections (1Bodey G.P. Buckley M. Sathe Y.S. Freireich E.J. Ann. Intern.

We have shown in a previous study (2Pedron T. Girard R. Turco S.J. Chaby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2426-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that granulocytes from the bone marrow of LPS-responsive mice express an inducible LPS-binding site on their cell surface after exposure in vivo or in vitro to nanomolar concentrations of LPS. This cell surface molecule was identified later as CD14 (3Pedron T. Girard R. Inoue K. Charon D. Chaby R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Pedron T. Girard R. Chaby R. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 28: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this expression of a receptor, many surface markers are actually down-modulated after exposure of cells to LPS. This has been observed in macrophages with mannose receptors (5Shepherd V.L. Abdolrasulnia R. Garrett M. Cowan H.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar), scavenger receptors (6van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar), interleukin 6 receptors (7Bauer J.

Lin H.S. Hsu S. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2256-2260PubMed Google Scholar), and TNF-α receptors (TNF-R) (9Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Concerning BMC, we found in a previous study (10Chaby R. Pedron T. Stutz P.L. Girard R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4476-4485PubMed Google Scholar) that LPS induced in these cells a marked down-regulation of TNF-R, in the absence of any direct binding of LPS to TNF-R. Because TNF-α and its receptors play a prominent role in inflammation and in LPS-induced septic shock (11Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 12Waage A. Halstensen A. Espevik T. Lancet. 1987; 1: 355-357Abstract PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), we considered that the mechanism by which LPS induces the down-regulation of TNF-R in BMC would deserve closer scrutiny. The two known TNF-α receptors CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) have gained wide interest because of their outstanding pattern of activities. On the level of individual cells, CD120a is involved in various aspects of innate immunity, for example by inducing death of pathogen-afflicted cells. At the multicellular level, CD120a contributes to lymphoid organ development and controls defense by coordinating the inflammatory process. At the level of the whole organism, it induces changes such as fever and elevation of acute-phase serum proteins. The extracellular domain of the TNF receptors contains membrane-proximal regions that render these molecules susceptible to shedding. The membrane form of the TNF-α cytokine has, like TNF receptors, an extracellular domain sensitive to the TNF-α convertase (TACE/ADAM-17), a transmembrane disintegrin metalloproteinase of the ADAM family of proteases (adamalysin). It has been shown that TACE can cleave a number of cell surface molecules, such as CD120b (the p75 TNF-R2), TGF-α, CD62-L (L-selectin) (13Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L.

Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus participates in inflammatory and pathological reactions. However, other mechanisms of TNF-R down-regulation, which are not mediated by metalloproteinases, have been suggested, including shedding by serine proteases (16Hwang C. Gatanaga M. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5631-5638PubMed Google Scholar) or even internalization of the receptors (17Ding A.H. Sanchez E. Srimal S. Nathan C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3924-3929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the nature and the specificity of the mechanism by which LPS down-regulates TNF-R in BMC have not been explored but are of uttermost interest because regulation of TNF-Rs can take part in the hematopoietic and differentiation events that occur in the bone marrow after infection with microorganisms containing LPS, and may be of critical importance for efficient host defense.

Stock solutions of leupeptin, TC, TLCK, Bt2cAMP, and CPT-cAMP were prepared in apyrogenic water. TPCK was dissolved in ethanol, the furin inhibitor in methanol, and TIMP-2 in 50% glycerol in PBS. All other reagents were dissolved in Me2SO. Stock solutions were stored at–20 °C, and further dilutions were made into CM just prior to use. Radiolabeled TNF-α—For radiolabeling of TNF-α, we used a modification of the method of Tejedor and Ballesta (22Tejedor F. Ballesta J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Na125I (1 mCi) was added, in a conical polypropylene centrifuge tube, to a solution of rTNF-α devoid of stabilizing protein (1 μg, 10 μl) in 40 μl of phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.3). A solution of chloramine-T (66 μg/ml in the phosphate buffer) was prepared at the moment of use. Three aliquots (2 μl) of this solution were added at 2-min intervals. The reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 5-min period and stopped by adding 20 μl of Na2S2O5 (2 mg/ml in phosphate buffer). The whole process was carried out at room temperature. Solutions of KI (50 μl; 10 mg/ml in water) and BSA (200 μl; 5 mg/ml in phosphate buffer) were then added. The solution was applied to a column of Sephadex G-10 (10 ml) equilibrated with a solution of BSA (5 mg/ml) in phosphate buffer. The filtration was carried out with the same solution. The first peak of radioactivity (elution volume: 3.5 to 4 ml), corresponding to 125I-TNF-α (1,5 × 108 cpm/μg), was stored at 4 °C until use. Binding of Radiolabeled TNF-α to BMC—BMC were washed (by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g) in CM, maintained for 30 min at 4 °C, and then incubated in triplicate for 15 h at 4 °C (5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of CM supplemented with 10% FCS) with 125I-TNF-α (0.5–10 ng in 100 μl). Similar results were obtained when incubations were carried out for only 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed in 0.2 ml of PBS, 5% FCS and rewashed in 0.4 ml of PBS, 50% FCS, and the radioactivity of the cell pellets was measured in a gamma counter (Kontron MR 480 C). SDS-PAGE Analysis of Shedded TNF-R and Derived Fragments— Cell supernatants of 2 × 107 BMC were cultured for 1 h at 37 °C with or without LPS-Sc (25 ng in 50 μl CM). Protease inhibitors were added, and the cell suspension was centrifuged first at 700 × g (10 min, 4 °C) to remove residual cells and further at 145,000 × g (60 min, 4 °C) to remove cell-released membrane vesicles (blebs). After dialysis (30 min) against distilled water, the supernatants (20 μl) were submitted, under reducing conditions, to electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide slab gel in Tris glycine in the presence of SDS. Molecular mass (rainbow) markers were run in parallel. The gel was fixed in transfer buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol), and proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a semi-dry blotting system at 40 mA for 75 min. The membrane was blocked (18 h at 20 °C) with 5% defatted milk in PBS and washed five times (1 h) with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Bands were detected either with radiolabeled TNF-α or with an anti-TNF-R2 antiserum. In the first technique, the membrane was incubated (18 h, 20 °C) with 10 ml of 125I-TNF-α (1.7 × 107 cpm), washed extensively with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. In the second technique (Western blotting), the membrane was blocked (18 h at 20 °C) with 1% BSA in PBS, washed, and incubated (2 h, 20 °C) with the anti-TNF-R2 antibody (1:100 in PBS containing 1% BSA). The blots were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated for1hat20 °C with normal rabbit serum (1:100 in PBS containing 1% BSA). The blots were then rewashed and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG antiserum (1:20,000 in 1% BSA and 2% non-fat milk in PBS). After extensive washings, sites with peroxidase activity were detected with the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. Molecular weight standards (ProSeive color protein markers) were from BioWhittaker (Rockland, ME). All other electrophoresis reagents, including autoradiography Hyperfilm MP, were from Amersham Biosciences. Statistics—Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Rapid Down-regulation of TNF-Rs Induced by LPS in BMC—We have shown in previous reports (2Pedron T. Girard R. Turco S.J. Chaby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2426-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Girard R. Pedron T. Chaby R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4504-4513PubMed Google Scholar) that very small amounts of LPS can induce the expression of CD14 within a few hours in BMC, in the absence of serum. We also reported that LPS induces in the same cells a down-modulation of the binding of TNF-α (10Chaby R. Pedron T. Stutz P.L. Girard R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4476-4485PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate further the features of the latter effect and compare them to the former, we examined the influence of five parameters: LPS concentration, time, temperature, presence of serum, and presence of accessory adherent cells. In a first experiment, BMC were exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to relatively high concentrations of LPS (0.1–10 μg/ml), in the presence or absence of fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed, and the binding of 125I-TNF-α to the TNF receptors (TNF-R) was analyzed. We observed a similar down-modulation of TNF-R in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1A). The effect was already optimal at the lowest concentration of LPS used (0.1 μg/ml). In a second experiment performed with a 1000-fold lower range of LPS concentration (0.1–10 ng/ml), and in the absence of serum, we found that a significant down-modulation of the binding of 125I-TNF-α occurs with as little as 0.5 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 1B). These results confirmed our previous finding of LPS-induced down-modulation of the binding of TNF-α and indicated that this LPS-induced effect does not require serum. The kinetics of this LPS effect appeared markedly more rapid than that of the LPS-induced expression of CD14 mentioned above; several hours are required for LPS-induced CD14 expression (20Girard R. Pedron T. Chaby R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4504-4513PubMed Google Scholar), whereas only 20 min of exposure to LPS allows a significant reduction of the binding of 125I-TNF-α (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, when the cells were exposed to LPS at 4 °C, there was no detectable down-modulation of TNF-R (Fig. 1D), thus indicating that rapid temperature-dependent reactions are involved. In all experiments, the LPS-induced decrease of TNF-α binding was always partial (40–60% decrease induced by 50–100 ng/ml S. enterica LPS). When the cells were exposed to LPS for longer periods (more than 90 min), a second phenomenon occurred, with a progressive increase of TNF-R expression leading, after a few hours, to a marked up-regulation of the receptor (data not shown). Because the first steps of the LPS-induced signaling cascade are of highest interest, this study was restricted to the earliest down-modulation phase of the response to LPS. We also observed that the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R still occurs after removal of B lymphocytes from the BMC population with magnetic beads coated with an anti-B220 antibody, or after removal of adherent cells by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C in plastic dishes (data not shown). In the following sections of this paper, all experiments have been performed with total BMC, and the cells have been exposed to LPS, or to other agents, for 1 h at 37 °C, in the absence of serum. Specificity and TLR4 Dependence of the LPS-induced Down-modulation of TNF-R—Information on the specificity of the triggering agent for TNF-R down-modulation was obtained by comparison of the effects induced by the proper TNF-R ligand (TNF-α), and by several agents selected either because they represent major components exposed on the surface of different microorganisms (LPSs in Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria, and lipophosphoglycans in parasites) or because they can induce another response (CD14 expression) in BMC (cAMP derivatives and cholera toxin) (23Pedron T. Girard R. Chaby R. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1999; 6: 885-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMC were exposed to the agents and analyzed for their capacity to bind 125I-TNF-α as mentioned above. The results (Table I) show that TNF-α, the natural ligand of TNF-R, reduced the capacity of the cells to bind 125I-TNF-α. We will show further (end of the next paragraph) that this effect is not due to binding inhibition by the unlabeled ligand, but rather to an efficient down-regulation of the receptor. On the other hand, among various other agents tested, only LPSs or a lipid A fragment thereof exhibited a down-modulation effect. The polysaccharide fragments isolated from two Salmonella LPSs were inactive. It should be noted that cAMP derivatives and cholera toxin, which induce CD14 expression in BMC as efficiently as LPS (23Pedron T. Girard R. Chaby R. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1999; 6: 885-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were both unable to down-regulate TNF-R in these cells (Table I).Table IInduction of TNF-R down-modulation by different agentsAgent125I-TNF-α bindingClassNameConcentration%None100 ± 2Receptor ligandTNF-α1 ng/ml80 ± 120 ng/ml34 ± 1LPSs and their fragmentsLPS-Sc50 ng/ml55 ± 2LPS-Ss50 ng/ml73 ± 1LPS-Bp50 ng/ml64 ± 3LPS-Sm50 ng/ml85 ± 3LPS-Ec50 ng/ml53 ± 1PS-Sc50 ng/ml114 ± 2PS-Ss50 ng/ml111 ± 2LipA-Bp50 ng/ml78 ± 2Other agentsPGN50 ng/ml107 ± 2d-LPG50 ng/ml102 ± 3m-LPG50 ng/ml110 ± 4CPT-cAMP100 μM98 ± 1Bt2cAMP500 μM104 ± 3Cholera toxin100 ng/ml93 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is involved in several effects induced by LPSs of conventional structures (24Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, some LPS effects independent of TLR4 have been reported, such as induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, gelatinase) (25Jin F. Nathan C.F. Ding A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3596-3600PubMed Google Scholar), production of Mn-superoxide dismutase (26Gibbs L.S. Del Vecchio P.J. Shaffer J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and induction of bacterial clearance (27Haziot A. Hijiya N. Gangloff S.C. Silver J. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared important to determine whether the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R was mediated or not by TLR4. In addition to normal C3H/HeOU mice, we used two mouse strains that have mutations on the Tlr4 gene as follows: the C3H/HeJ strain, which expresses non-functional TLR4 molecules, and the C57BL/10 ScCr strain, in which TLR4 is completely missing (28Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar, 29Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 show that an LPS with a conventional lipid A structure (LPS-Sc) induced TNF-R down-regulation in BMC from C3H/HeOU mice but not in BMC from C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice. We also found that LPSs with atypical lipid A structures, such as those of Rhizobium species Sin-1, R. galegae, and R. leguminosarum biovar trifolii 24AR, reported previously (30Pedron T. Girard R. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Chaby R. Immunology. 2000; 101: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to induce CD14 expression in BMC by a TLR4-independent pathway, were unable to down-regulate TNF-R (data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R in BMC requires the presence of a conventional lipid A structure in the molecule and the presence of a functional TLR4 molecule in the cells. Absence of LPS-induced Internalization of TNF-R—Cell surface molecules can be down-modulated by internalization or by shedding. To determine whether LPS-induced TNF-R down-modulation could be due to internalization, we used an inhibitor of cytoskeleton-dependent internalization, cytochalasin B. In a preliminary experiment, internalization of Fc receptors (FcR) was use as a model to evaluate the efficiency of cytochalasin B as an inhibitor of internalization in BMC. The cellular density of FcR was estimated by determining the specific binding of 125I-labeled immunoglobulins at 4 °C (binding inhibitable with a large excess of unlabeled ligand). We found that in conditions where shedding is blocked (in the presence of 5 mm phenanthroline), incubation of the cells at 37 °C for 1 h induced an internalization of 93% of FcR, and 48.4% of that internalization was inhibited in the presence of 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Because this compound is not cytotoxic for BMC at the concentration used (as assessed by the absence of propidium iodide incorporation), it can be concluded that, as already observed in other cell types (31O'Shea J.J. Brown E.J. Gaither T.A. Takahashi T. Frank M.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1325-1330PubMed Google Scholar), cytochalasin B efficiently inhibits internalization processes in BMC. We then examined the influence of cytochalasin B on LPS-induced TNF-R down-modulation. We found that the down-modulation of TNF-R induced by 50 ng/ml of LPS was 54 ± 1% in the absence of cytochalasin B and 46 ± 1% in the presence of cytochalasin B. This moderate effect of the inhibitor indicates that the large majority (85%) of the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R is not attributable to internalization. Influence of Protease Inhibitors—To evaluate the second possible hypothesis consisting of a shedding of the receptors, we analyzed the effects of several protease inhibitors. The concentration at which each inhibitor was used was selected on the basis of its cellular effect reported in the literature or previously obtained with BMC in our laboratory. The protease inhibitors were not cytotoxic at the concentration used, as assessed by the absence of incorporation of propidium iodide, determined by FACS analysis. Among the four inhibitors tested, we found that two serine protease inhibitors (TLCK and TPCK) induced a marked reduction of the LPS effect (Table II). On the other hand, MG-132 and leupeptin (inhibitors of proteasome and serine/cysteine proteases, respectively) were ineffective.Table IIEffect of protease inhibitors on LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-RProtease inhibitorsInhibition of LPS effectNameSpecificityConcentrationμM%MG 132Proteasome1012 ± 10LeupeptinSerine/cysteine protease1000 ± 7TLCKSerine protease10070 ± 7TPCKSerine protease2090 ± 11 Open table in a new tab The marked effect of the serine protease inhibitors, particularly TPCK, indicated that a proteolytic step is involved in TNF-R down-modulation. We examined whether TPCK can block in the same cells the down-modulation of another marker, CD16. By FACS analysis with a specific fluorescent antibody, we established in a preliminary experiment that a 27% down-modulation of CD16 occurs in BMC exposed to 100 ng/ml PMA for 1 h at 37 °C. When we examined the effects of TPCK, we found that at a concentration of 20 μm, it inhibited 90% of the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R, and only 9% of the PMA-induced down-modulation of CD16. This suggests that in BMC the proteolytic step involved in LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R is not a common step involved in all down-modulation effects. Influence of Metalloproteinase Inhibitors—Because proteolysis can lead to receptor shedding, and because shedding is often due to metalloproteinases, we examined the influence of metalloproteinase inhibitors. We first observed that 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, a metalloproteinase inhibitor of relatively broad specificity, markedly reduced (74 ± 9%) the LPS-induced down-modulation of TNF-R. The involvement of a metalloproteinase was confirmed by the use of a second metalloproteinase inhibitor, BB-3103. This compound is more selective than phenanthroline and inhibits a more restricted group of metalloproteinases, including TACE. We found (Fig. 3A) that BB-3103 induced a clear inhibition (33%) of the LPS effect. Inhibition by BB-3103 was statistically significant at the three concentrations used (at 25 μm, p = 0.0009 in a Student's t test). Because TNF-α can also induce a down-modulation of TNF-R (Table I), we compared the effects of BB-3103 on TNF-α- and LPS-induced down-modulations. We found that BB-3103 did not inhibit the TNF-α-induced effect (Fig. 3A). The same absence of inhibition was observed in cells from C3H/HeJ mice (data not shown). Therefore, the metalloproteinase involved in the TLR4-dependent down-modulation induced by LPS (sensitive to BB-3103) is different from the metalloproteinase involved in the TLR4-independent d"

https://openalex.org/W2148630580,"We present evidence that in neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy of embryonal sympathetic origin, hypoxia, underlies a phenotypic switch from a primitive neuronal to a chromaffin cell type. This conclusion is based on morphological and molecular data on 116 clinical tumors and is supported by data on the phenotypic effects of hypoxia on neuroblastoma cell lines when studied in monolayer culture and as tumor xenografts. In the clinical material, extensive chromaffin features were seen in regions of chronic tumor hypoxia. This was the exclusive form of intra-tumoral maturation of stroma-poor tumors and was also seen in stroma-rich tumors, either exclusively or in combination with ganglion-like cells. In neuroblastoma cell lines, hypoxia induced changes in gene expression associated with the chromaffin features observed in vivo. We therefore propose tumor hypoxia as a major cue determining phenotype in sympathetic tumors of neuroblastic origin. Because it appears to be reversible upon reoxygenation in monolayer culture, we suggest the term metaplasia for the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2077899205,"The humoral immune response against an Entamoeba histolytica recombinant protein has been investigated. The 628 bp Bam HI-Eco RI DNA fragment (L1b) from the M11 cDNA clone, partially coding for a 220 kDa (L220) protein, was ligated in-frame into the pGEX-3X plasmid vector to produce the fusion protein GST-L1b. BALB/c mice were immunized with different doses of the GST-L1b fusion protein (10-500 microg). GST-L1b doses of 100/50/50, 300, or 500 microg induced an antibody response (IgG1>IgG3, IgG2a>IgG2b) specific for the amoebic part of the fusion protein (L1b). These antibodies were able to recognize the native protein in amoebic total extract. Anti-GST antibodies were not detected. On the other hand, doses of 10/10/10 or 200/100/100 microg induced antibodies able to recognize both GST (IgG2a>IgG1>IgG2b) and L1b (IgG1, IgG2a>IgG3>IgG2b). When mice were immunized with GST alone (100/50/50, 300 or 500 microg), antibodies against GST-L1b or GST were not detected. However, GST doses of 10/10/10 or 200/100/100 microg induced an antibody response able to recognize both GST-L1b and GST. We propose that an immunization protocol similar to the one used in this work may allow induction of high antibody titers specific against the parasite segment of a GST-fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2169966282,"Previous studies on the interaction of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) with endothelial cells have reported a large number of binding sites (106-107 sites/cell) with differing relative affinities (KD = 7–130 nm) and have implicated various receptors or receptor complexes. In this study, we examined the binding of HK to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with a novel assay system utilizing HUVEC immobilized on microcarrier beads, which eliminates the detection of the high affinity binding sites found nonspecifically in conventional microtiter well assays. We report that HK binds to 8.5 × 104 high affinity (KD = 21 nm) sites per HUVEC, i.e. 10–100-fold fewer than previously reported. Although HK binding is unaffected by the presence of a physiological concentration of prekallikrein, factor XI abrogates HK binding to HUVEC in a concentration-dependent manner. Disruption of the naturally occurring complex between factor XI and HK by the addition of a 31-amino acid peptide mimicking the factor XI-binding site on HK restored HK binding to HUVEC. Furthermore, HK inhibited thrombin-stimulated von Willebrand factor release by HUVEC but not thrombin receptor activation peptide (SFLLRN-amide)-stimulated von Willebrand factor release. Factor XI restored the ability of thrombin to stimulate von Willebrand factor release in the presence of low HK concentrations. These results suggest that free HK, or HK in complex with prekallikrein but not in complex with factor XI, interacts with the endothelium and can maintain endothelial cell quiescence by preventing endothelial stimulation by thrombin.

According to the current model, HK binding to FXI evokes a conformational change exposing the Apple 3 domain of FXI, which mediates binding to activated platelets (25Baglia F.A. Badellino K.O.

This specific, saturable, high-affinity interaction of FXI with platelets requires platelet activation and is essential for promoting a 5,000- to 10,000-fold acceleration of the rate of FXI-activation by thrombin (14Baglia F.A.

Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, HK has been reported to bind to Bernard-Soulier platelets, which lack this receptor complex (30Schmaier A.H. Rojkjaer R. Shariat-Madar Z. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography identified cytokeratin 1 and gC1qR as putative HK receptors, and it has been suggested that these proteins along with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor form a multiprotein receptor complex on the endothelial cell surface (30Schmaier A.H.

Furthermore, these proteins are not found on endothelium in sufficient quantities to accommodate the millions of endothelial cell-binding sites reported for HK (39Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J.

Alternatively, the heparan sulfate moieties found in vast quantities on the endothelium were identified as an HK receptor using confocal microscopy studies; however, binding was localized only to the cell-cell junctions (44Renne T. Dedio J. David G. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33688-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also, Mac-1 integrin (CD11b/18) was identified as the HK receptor on neutrophils because antibodies against Mac-1 blocked HK binding although the Mac-1 antibodies may have simultaneously down-regulated urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression (34Joseph K. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Reid K.B. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8552-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 45Wachtfogel Y.T. de la Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19307-19312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It had been proposed that FXI and FXIa interacted specifically with endothelial cells in an HK-dependent manner (39Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that FXI does not bind to endothelial cells, and although FXIa does bind to endothelial cells, physiological concentrations of HK block this interaction (47Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38462-38467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 48Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our studies differed from those performed previously in that we utilized endothelial cells grown on microcarrier beads, allowing us to eliminate the high-affinity, nonspecific interactions of HK with the artificial surfaces contained within microtiter wells. These nonspecific interactions will appear to augment the number of HK receptors and thus FXI- or FXIa-binding sites. In the following study we report that HK does bind to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and that the number of HK-binding sites on washed confluent HUVEC-coated microcarrier bead cultures is 10–100 times lower than reported in assays employing HUVEC monolayers in microtiter wells. Physiological concentrations of FXI inhibit low levels of HK from binding to HUVEC, whereas physiological concentrations of PK have no effect on HK binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—FXI was purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). HK, PK, and thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP) (SFLLRN-amide) and the HK-derived peptide comprising a portion of the FXI-binding site referred to as the 31-mer HK peptide (SDDDWIPMDIQTDPNGLSFNPISDFAPDTTSPK-amide) were synthesized at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania (Dr. John Lambris, Director).Radiolabeling with Iodine—HK was radiolabeled with 125I using the Iodogen method (49Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Generally >98% radioactivity was bound to the protein, and the specific radioactivity was 1.1 × 1018 CPM/mol. The radiolabeled HK had a specific biological activity of 12.75 units/mg, i.e. 102% of the coagulation activity of unlabeled HK.Cell Culture—HUVECs were purchased from Cascade Biologicals (Portland, OR) and cultured in EGM-2 complete media (2% fetal bovine serum, BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C as previously described (48Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HUVEC (1 × 106 cells/ml) was added to 5 ml (1.5 × 105 beads) of swelled Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads (Amersham Biosciences) that were washed in complete endothelial cell media. After 30 min at room temperature the beads and cells were transferred to a spinner flask (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) and incubated under constant stirring (60 RPM) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL1573) and were similarly grown to confluence on Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads. Microcarrier bead cultures (0.5 ml) were mixed with 0.5 ml trypan blue (Invitrogen) to determine the extent of confluence, because the microcarrier beads but not cell-coated beads retained trypan blue staining (48Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Measurement of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Release by HUVEC— The amount of von Willebrand factor released by HUVEC after stimulation, a marker of activation, was measured by sandwich ELISA using a goat anti-human vWF IgG primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human vWF IgG secondary antibody performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN). Because these experiments could not be performed in the absence of microtiter wells, HUVECs were grown to confluence in 12-well gelatin-coated microtiter plates and treated with agonists or incubation buffer alone (0.5% bovine serum albumin). Supernatants (100 μl) were removed and analyzed by ELISA. The optical density (OD490) was measured, and vWF concentrations were calculated by comparison to a standard curve determined in the presence of diluted normal pooled human plasma (George King Biomedical, Overland Park, KS) where 100% plasma contains 10 ng/ml vWF.Equilibrium Binding Experiments Using Cells in Suspension— HUVECs were placed into suspension on microcarrier beads, and binding was measured using a procedure similar to that previously described for platelets (50Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads were washed and resuspended in incubation buffer to a density of 106 cells/ml. Silicone oil (15 μl, DC500/DC200, 4:1) was centrifuged to the bottom of a 200 μl microcentrifuge tube with a narrow bore tip (Sarstedt, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The microcarrier bead suspension was added to the radiolabeled protein mixture (50 μl each) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking by hand every 15 min. To separate the bound from free protein, tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min in a vertical centrifuge (model B, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Cedar Grove, NJ). The tubes were placed in dry ice/ethanol slurry for 5 min, and the tips of the microtubes were amputated. Both the pellets and 10 μl of the supernatant were measured for γ-emission.RESULTSHK Binding to HUVEC on Microcarrier Beads—Saturable and specific HK binding to HUVEC has been demonstrated previously (39Berrettini M.

Blood. 1988; 71: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, all these experiments were performed in microtiter well assays. We observed a high level of nonspecific background binding of FXI when HK was utilized as a cofactor in empty microtiter wells (48Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). High levels of nonspecific binding of 125I-HK to empty microtiter wells were also observed (data not shown). Attempts to prevent this background binding using different blocking agents (i.e. gelatin, polyethylene glycol, Irish cream), different coating agents (i.e. gelatin, fibronectin, or silicone treatment), or different brands of microtiter plates, did not result in a lower number of binding sites in the absence of cells. Therefore, we carried out 125I-HK binding studies with HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads in suspension rather than with HUVEC monolayers in microtiter wells. Cell-coated beads were pelleted by centrifugation through silicone oil after incubation with the protein mixture. This method allows for the detection of specific cellular binding sites without the high background determined in microtiter wells because only radioactivity associated with the cellular pellets rather than associated with a washed microtiter well was measured. Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads on HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, demonstrated very low level, nonsaturable binding of HK (data not shown). In contrast, when HUVECs were grown to confluence, it was shown that HK binds saturably, specifically, and reversibly to 8.5 ± 0.3 × 104 sites per cell with a KD = 21 ± 2.6 nm (Fig. 1).HK circulates at a physiological concentration of ∼650 nm, 90% in a 1:1 complex with plasma PK (∼490 nm), and ∼10% in a 2:1 complex with dimeric FXI (∼30 nm) (17Mandle R.J. Colman R.W. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4179-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 51Scott C.F. Colman R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, very little if any unbound HK is found in plasma. Therefore, we also performed 125I-HK binding studies in the presence of either a physiological concentration of PK or FXI, or with both proteins present. Whereas PK had no effect on the binding of HK (Fig. 1), the presence of 30 nm FXI (i.e. 60 nm FXI monomer) inhibited concentrations of HK <100 nm from binding to HUVEC. As the concentration of HK increased, it was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of FXI. Under conditions when both PK and FXI were added together at physiological concentrations, HK binding to HUVEC was detected even at the lower HK concentrations.FXI and PK Titrations—Because FXI but not PK appears to inhibit HK binding to HUVEC (Fig. 1), HK binding was examined at various concentrations of FXI or PK or with both proteins present. The binding of 125I-HK (500 nM) to HUVEC-coated microtiter beads was unaffected by PK even at supraphysiological concentrations (1,400 nm) either in the absence or presence of 30 nm FXI (Fig. 2A). In contrast, FXI potently (IC50 ∼30 nm) and completely inhibited the binding of 125I-HK at a subphysiological concentration (100 nM; Fig. 2B, inset). At an HK concentration (500 nm) approximating that in plasma, FXI completely inhibited HK binding, and the presence of PK (500 nm) abrogated the inhibitory effect of FXI (Fig. 2), a result consistent with that observed in Fig. 1.Fig. 2The effect of FXI and prekallikrein on HK binding to HUVEC.A, an increasing concentration of PK was incubated with 500 nm125I-HK and HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads in the presence of zinc ions (25 μm) in the absence (▪) or in the presence (□) of FXI (30 nm) for 30 min before separation through silicone oil. B, 125I-HK (500 or 100 nm, inset) binding to HUVEC was titrated with increasing concentrations of FXI and incubated for 30 min in the presence of zinc ions (25 μm) in the absence (•) or in the presence (○) of PK (500 nm) before separation through silicone oil. Results represent the means (± S.E.) of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FXI·HK Complex Formation Is Required for Inhibition of HK Binding to HUVEC—FXI and PK bind to an overlapping region of domain 6 on HK (22Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, only FXI inhibits HK binding to HUVEC, whereas PK does not. To determine whether FXI binding to domain 6 is required for the inhibition by FXI of HK binding to HUVEC we incubated HK with the 31-amino acid peptide that mimics the FXI- and PK-binding site on HK (31-amino acid HK peptide) in the presence or absence of FXI prior to incubation with HUVEC. The 31-amino acid HK peptide utilized at a concentration that blocks FXI from binding to HK (10 μm) as determined by surface plasmon resonance (52Ho D.H. Badellino K. Baglia F.A. Sun M.F. Zhao M.M. Gailani D. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25139-25145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has no effect on the binding of HK to HUVEC (Fig. 3), suggesting that this portion of domain 6 does not mediate HK binding to HUVEC. However, also shown in Fig. 3, the 31-amino acid HK peptide reverses the ability of FXI to inhibit HK binding to HUVEC observed in Fig. 1 by preventing HK binding to FXI, suggesting that FXI·HK complex formation is required for the inhibition by FXI of HK binding to HUVEC.Fig. 3Complex formation between FXI and HK is required for inhibition. Increasing concentrations of 125I-HK were incubated with 31-amino acid HK peptide (10 μm) and zinc ions (25 μm) and HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads in the presence (○) or absence (•) of FXI (30 nm). Results represent the mean (± S.E.) of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of HUVEC—Activation of HUVEC by various agonists is characterized by vWF release. Release of vWF was measured by ELISA and quantitated using a standard curve derived using normal pooled plasma. Both thrombin (1 nm) and TRAP (25 μm) stimulated maximum vWF release within 30–60 min (data not shown), and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) induced maximal vWF release after 6 h. HK, FXI, or buffer alone was unable to stimulate significant amounts of vWF release after 6 h (data not shown).Thrombin (1 nm) was able to stimulate HUVEC monolayers to release 66 ng per 1 × 105 HUVEC (Fig. 4). HK and FXI were unable to stimulate vWF release. However, either physiological concentrations of HK (500 nm) or sub-physiological concentrations (100 nm) inhibited the ability of thrombin to stimulate HUVEC to release vWF. FXI (30 nm) blocked the ability of lower HK concentrations to inhibit thrombin-stimulation of HUVEC (Fig. 4, inset), but not when HK was added at the higher concentration (500 nm; Fig. 4). PK did not prevent the inhibitory effect of HK on thrombin-stimulated vWF release (Fig. 4, inset). However, the presence of PK reversed the capacity of FXI to prevent the inhibition by HK of thrombin-induced vWF release from HUVEC (Fig. 4, inset). HK did not inhibit TRAP-stimulated vWF release (data not shown). These results complement those obtained in the binding studies because although PK and FXI bind to a similar site on HK (22Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FXI, but not PK, prevents HK binding to HUVEC and thus the inhibition of thrombin-mediated vWF release from HUVEC by HK.Fig. 4HK inhibits thrombin stimulation of HUVEC. A confluent monolayer of HUVEC was incubated with a combination of 0.1 units/ml thrombin (TB), 500 nm HK (100 nm, inset), 30 nm FXI, and/or 500 nm PK for one hour. The amount of HUVEC stimulation was determined by vWF release measured using an ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results were compared with a buffer control and to cells that were incubated with a lysis buffer in the absence of agonist (total) for an additional 10 min. Note the ability of HK to inhibit thrombin-stimulated vWF release in the absence of FXI. However, in the presence of physiological concentrations of FXI inhibition by HK (at 100 nm) is negated (inset). Results represent the means (±S.E.) of three experiments each performed in quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAlthough we have confirmed the observation that HK binds to saturable, high-affinity sites on HUVEC, the number of binding sites determined in our present study (85,000 sites/HUVEC, KD = 21 nm) is 10–100-fold less than previously reported (1–10 × 106 sites/HUVEC, KD = 7–130 nm) (39Berrettini M.
