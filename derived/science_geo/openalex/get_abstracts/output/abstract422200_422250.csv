https://openalex.org/W2108001777,"Accurate prediction of global sea-level rise requires that we understand the cause of recent, widespread and intensifying glacier acceleration along Antarctic ice-sheet coastal margins. Atmospheric and oceanic forcing have the potential to reduce the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves, potentially limiting their ability to buttress the flow of grounded tributary glaciers. Indeed, recent ice-shelf collapse led to retreat and acceleration of several glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. But the extent and magnitude of ice-shelf thickness change, the underlying causes of such change, and its link to glacier flow rate are so poorly understood that its future impact on the ice sheets cannot yet be predicted. Here we use satellite laser altimetry and modelling of the surface firn layer to reveal the circum-Antarctic pattern of ice-shelf thinning through increased basal melt. We deduce that this increased melt is the primary control of Antarctic ice-sheet loss, through a reduction in buttressing of the adjacent ice sheet leading to accelerated glacier flow. The highest thinning rates occur where warm water at depth can access thick ice shelves via submarine troughs crossing the continental shelf. Wind forcing could explain the dominant patterns of both basal melting and the surface melting and collapse of Antarctic ice shelves, through ocean upwelling in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, and atmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. This implies that climate forcing through changing winds influences Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance, and hence global sea level, on annual to decadal timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2006051991,"The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity. However, many properties of exotic strongly correlated spin systems (e.g., spin liquids) have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N~30 particles. Feynman divined that a quantum simulator - a special-purpose ""analog"" processor built using quantum particles (qubits) - would be inherently adept at such problems. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. However, simulations of quantum magnetism allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on 2D and 3D lattices of more than a few 10's of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, owing in part to the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction J_ij on a naturally occurring 2D triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-1/2 particles (9Be+ ions stored in a Penning trap), a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than existing experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J_ij ~ 1/d_ij^a, where a is tunable over 0<a<3; d_ij is the distance between spin pairs. These power-laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a=0), Coulomb-like (a=1), monopole-dipole (a=2) and dipole-dipole (a=3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with theory for 0.05<a<1.4. This demonstration coupled with the high spin-count, excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap brings within reach simulation of interesting and otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism."
https://openalex.org/W2132691262,"Human Argonaute Revealed RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by Argonaute (Ago) proteins, which bind small regulatory RNAs that have sequence complementarity to target RNAs destined to be silenced. The structure of bacterial homologs of the Ago proteins, and fragments of eukaryotic Ago proteins, have provided initial insights into Ago function. Now, Schirle and MacRae (p. 1037 , published online 26 April; see the Perspective by Kaya and Doudna ) have determined the structure of the full-length human Ago protein bound to a single-stranded (ss) guide RNA. Within the bilobed structure, eight nucleotides of the ssRNA are visibly positioned in the RNA-guide, strand-binding site. The “seed” region of the ssRNA has its Watson-and-Crick base edges exposed to solvent, likely aiding target recognition. The location of two free tryptophans in the Piwi domain suggests a possible recruitment site for Ago-interacting proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2148536296,"Resolvins and protectins are anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators that are shown to resolve infections, and their administration lowers required doses of antibiotics and shortens infections. Bacterial infections can result in the generation of infection-resolving anti-inflammatory lipid derivatives. This paper reports the use of a murine Escherichia coli peritonitis model relevant to human infections to identify specialized host-produced pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) termed resolvin D5 and protectin D1, which may be directly involved in resolving infections. The administration of these two mediators improves infection-related signs, increases clearance of infection-causing bacteria and increases survival. When administered with antibiotics, resolvin D5 and protectin D1 acted together to further reduce the duration and severity of infection. The SPMs also enhanced antibiotic clearance of Staphylococcus aureus murine skin infections. The spread of antibiotic resistance is a major concern, so the prospect that therapeutic use of host-derived molecules might help to limit antibiotic dose rates is of potential clinical importance. Underlying mechanisms for how bacterial infections contribute to active resolution of acute inflammation are unknown1,2,3,4. Here, we performed exudate leukocyte trafficking and mediator-metabololipidomics of murine peritoneal Escherichia coli infections with temporal identification of pro-inflammatory (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). In self-resolving E. coli exudates (105 colony forming units, c.f.u.), the dominant SPMs identified were resolvin (Rv) D5 and protectin D1 (PD1), which at 12 h were at significantly greater levels than in exudates from higher titre E. coli (107 c.f.u.)-challenged mice. Germ-free mice had endogenous RvD1 and PD1 levels higher than in conventional mice. RvD1 and RvD5 (nanograms per mouse) each reduced bacterial titres in blood and exudates, E. coli-induced hypothermia and increased survival, demonstrating the first actions of RvD5. With human polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages, RvD1, RvD5 and PD1 each directly enhanced phagocytosis of E. coli, and RvD5 counter-regulated a panel of pro-inflammatory genes, including NF-κB and TNF-α. RvD5 activated the RvD1 receptor, GPR32, to enhance phagocytosis. With self-limited E. coli infections, RvD1 and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin accelerated resolution, each shortening resolution intervals (Ri). Host-directed RvD1 actions enhanced ciprofloxacin’s therapeutic actions. In 107 c.f.u. E. coli infections, SPMs (RvD1, RvD5, PD1) together with ciprofloxacin also heightened host antimicrobial responses. In skin infections, SPMs enhanced vancomycin clearance of Staphylococcus aureus. These results demonstrate that specific SPMs are temporally and differentially regulated during infections and that they are anti-phlogistic, enhance containment and lower antibiotic requirements for bacterial clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2010025771,"Managing Trade-Offs Most organisms experience selection on a host of traits to determine their likelihood to succeed evolutionarily. However, specific traits may experience trade-offs in determining an organism's optimal phenotype. Shoval et al. (p. 1157 ; see the Perspective by Noor and Milo ) relate physical traits to the task that they are optimizing using a Pareto curve, a power law probability distribution, to show that a single set of trait values optimizes performance at a given task and that performance decreases as an organism's phenotype moves away from this set of trait values. The results suggest how selection makes the best trade-offs for an arbitrary number of tasks and traits and may explain examples of evolutionary variation."
https://openalex.org/W2105954496,"A study of the stellar kinematics of a large sample of early-type galaxies provides evidence that the stellar initial mass function depends on the galaxy’s stellar mass-to-light ratio and thus is strongly dependent on the galaxy’s formation history. For decades, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation, had been assumed to be independent of the type of galaxy in which the stars formed. But in recent years, evidence in Nature ( http://go.nature.com/dh1vc5 ) and elsewhere has pointed to variation in IMF between galaxy types. Now, a survey of a mass-selected sample of 260 early galaxies reveals systematic variation in IMF. The authors suggest that models assuming a constant IMF need to be revised to explain how stars seem to sense what kind of galaxy they are creating. Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination1, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies2. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal3,4,5,6,7, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way8. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS3D sample9 of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy’s IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history."
https://openalex.org/W2094933391,"The mechanisms linking sensation and action during learning are poorly understood. Layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex might participate in sensorimotor integration and learning; they receive input from sensory cortex and excite deep layer neurons, which control movement. Here we imaged activity in the same set of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex over weeks, while mice learned to detect objects with their whiskers and report detection with licking. Spatially intermingled neurons represented sensory (touch) and motor behaviours (whisker movements and licking). With learning, the population-level representation of task-related licking strengthened. In trained mice, population-level representations were redundant and stable, despite dynamism of single-neuron representations. The activity of a subpopulation of neurons was consistent with touch driving licking behaviour. Our results suggest that ensembles of motor cortex neurons couple sensory input to multiple, related motor programs during learning."
https://openalex.org/W2159421887,"A review of allergic host defences argues that allergic immunity has an important role in host defence against noxious environmental substances. Have we got it wrong about allergy? Allergic reactions tend to be seen as the result of a misfire from an immune system that evolved to repel invasive parasites. In a Perspective this week, Noah Palm, Rachel Rosenstein and Ruslan Medzhitov see things differently. They discuss competing hypotheses about the origin and potentially beneficial aspects of TH2 cytokine-dependent allergic immune responses, with emphasis on the possibility that allergic reactions are excessive or exaggerated responses of a system that serves a necessary function, protecting the body from environmental toxins such as noxious substances, venoms and xenobiotics. The authors propose a model in which type 2 inflammatory responses are heterogeneous depending on the stimulus, and speculate that diverse evolutionary pressures may have selected for this class of immune responses. Allergies are generally thought to be a detrimental outcome of a mistargeted immune response that evolved to provide immunity to macroparasites. Here we present arguments to suggest that allergic immunity has an important role in host defence against noxious environmental substances, including venoms, haematophagous fluids, environmental xenobiotics and irritants. We argue that appropriately targeted allergic reactions are beneficial, although they can become detrimental when excessive. Furthermore, we suggest that allergic hypersensitivity evolved to elicit anticipatory responses and to promote avoidance of suboptimal environments."
https://openalex.org/W2038600043,"As vertebrate embryos develop to adulthood, their organs undergo marked changes in size and tissue architecture. The heart acquires muscle mass and matures structurally to fulfil increasing circulatory needs, a process that is incompletely understood. Here we used multicolour clonal analysis to define the contributions of individual cardiomyocytes as the zebrafish heart undergoes morphogenesis from a primitive embryonic structure into its complex adult form. We find that the single-cardiomyocyte-thick wall of the juvenile ventricle forms by lateral expansion of several dozen cardiomyocytes into muscle patches of variable sizes and shapes. As juvenile zebrafish mature into adults, this structure becomes fully enveloped by a new lineage of cortical muscle. Adult cortical muscle originates from a small number of cardiomyocytes--an average of approximately eight per animal--that display clonal dominance reminiscent of stem cell populations. Cortical cardiomyocytes initially emerge from internal myofibres that in rare events breach the juvenile ventricular wall, and then expand over the surface. Our results illuminate the dynamic proliferative behaviours that generate adult cardiac structure, revealing clonal dominance as a key mechanism that shapes a vertebrate organ."
https://openalex.org/W2046234674,"One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the extracellular space in the brain. Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of aggregated amyloid β peptide (Aβ), a proteolytic fragment of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). For APP to be proteolytically cleaved into Aβ, it must be internalized into the cell and trafficked to endosomes where specific protease complexes can cleave APP. Several recent genome-wide association studies have reported that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) gene were significantly associated with Alzheimer disease, suggesting a role in APP endocytosis and Aβ generation. Here, we show that PICALM co-localizes with APP in intracellular vesicles of N2a-APP cells after endocytosis is initiated. PICALM knockdown resulted in reduced APP internalization and Aβ generation. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased APP internalization and Aβ production. In vivo, PICALM was found to be expressed in neurons and co-localized with APP throughout the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. PICALM expression was altered using AAV8 gene transfer of PICALM shRNA or PICALM cDNA into the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. PICALM knockdown decreased soluble and insoluble Aβ levels and amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased Aβ levels and amyloid plaque load. These data indicate that PICALM, an adaptor protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, regulates APP internalization and subsequent Aβ generation. PICALM contributes to amyloid plaque load in brain likely via its effect on Aβ metabolism."

Magnetic receptors have been found in the eyes, ears, and bills of birds, but there has been no clear evidence of the neural mechanism by which magnetic signals are translated into direction. Recording from the brainstem within conscious pigeons, Wu and Dickman (p. 1054 , published online 26 April; see the Perspective by Winklhofer ) reveal the presence of neurons in the pigeon's brain that encode the inclination angle and intensity of the geomagnetic field. Thus, pigeons—and perhaps other species—can develop an internal model of geopositional latitude to facilitate spatial orientation and navigation based on magnetoreception."
https://openalex.org/W2005529950,"NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptors; NOD-like receptors) are a class of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that respond to host perturbation from either infectious agents or cellular stress. The function of most NLR family members has not been characterized and their role in instructing adaptive immune responses remains unclear. NLRP10 (also known as PYNOD, NALP10, PAN5 and NOD8) is the only NLR lacking the putative ligand-binding leucine-rich-repeat domain, and has been postulated to be a negative regulator of other NLR members, including NLRP3 (refs 4-6). We did not find evidence that NLRP10 functions through an inflammasome to regulate caspase-1 activity nor that it regulates other inflammasomes. Instead, Nlrp10(-/-) mice had a profound defect in helper T-cell-driven immune responses to a diverse array of adjuvants, including lipopolysaccharide, aluminium hydroxide and complete Freund's adjuvant. Adaptive immunity was impaired in the absence of NLRP10 because of a dendritic cell (DC) intrinsic defect in emigration from inflamed tissues, whereas upregulation of DC costimulatory molecules and chemotaxis to CCR7-dependent and -independent ligands remained intact. The loss of antigen transport to the draining lymph nodes by a subset of migratory DCs resulted in an almost absolute loss in naive CD4(+) T-cell priming, highlighting the critical link between diverse innate immune stimulation, NLRP10 activity and the immune function of mature DCs."

https://openalex.org/W2035062023,"Optimization of our previously described peptidomimetic furin inhibitors was performed and yielded several analogs with a significantly improved activity. The most potent compounds containing an N-terminal 4- or 3-(guanidinomethyl)phenylacetyl residue inhibit furin with K(i) values of 16 and 8 pM, respectively. These analogs inhibit other proprotein convertases, such as PC1/3, PC4, PACE4, and PC5/6, with similar potency, whereas PC2, PC7, and trypsin-like serine proteases are poorly affected. Incubation of selected compounds with Madin-Darby canine kidney cells over a period of 96 h revealed that they exhibit great stability, making them suitable candidates for further studies in cell culture. Two of the most potent derivatives were used to inhibit the hemagglutinin cleavage and viral propagation of a highly pathogenic avian H7N1 influenza virus strain. The treatment with inhibitor 24 (4-(guanidinomethyl)phenylacetyl-Arg-Val-Arg-4-amidinobenzylamide) resulted in significantly delayed virus propagation compared with an inhibitor-free control. The same analog was also effective in inhibiting Shiga toxin activation in HEp-2 cells. This antiviral effect, as well as the protective effect against a bacterial toxin, suggests that inhibitors of furin or furin-like proprotein convertases could represent promising lead structures for future drug development, in particular for the treatment of infectious diseases."

We now explore the possibility that CerS activity is regulated by dimer formation and demonstrate that CerS can form both homo- and heterodimers. Moreover, we have generated constitutive dimers and demonstrate that the activity of one member of a heterodimer depends upon and can be modulated by the activity of the other member. Together, our results suggest a rapid and reversible mechanism of regulating CerS activity involving dimer formation. d-Erythro-[4,5-3H]-sphinganine was synthesized as described (29Hirschberg K.

Twenty four hours after transfection, live cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cross-linking was terminated by addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Cells were collected and CerS dimer formation analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were co-transfected with CerS5-HA and FLAG-CerS1–6. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were collected, homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged (2,700 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). Pellets (containing the non-soluble material) were discarded, and the supernatant was incubated for 5 h with 2 μg of an anti-FLAG antibody in an orbital shaker at 4 °C. Following incubation, 30 μl of agarose beads conjugated to protein A (Bio-vision, Milpitas, CA) was added overnight.

Proteins were removed from the beads by boiling in sample buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.7 m glycerol, 35 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.14 mm bromphenol blue). Eluates were blotted with either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). A similar procedure was performed for endogenous CerS2 and CerS6 in HepG2 cells using anti-CerS2 and anti-CerS6 antibodies (both at a dilution of 1:1,000).

The proteins were incubated for 3 h with an anti-HA antibody followed by overnight incubation with agarose beads conjugated to protein A. The beads were washed three times with the solubilization buffer, and protein was eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5; 1 m Tris buffer, pH 11, was added immediately after elution. Eluted proteins were concentrated using centrifugal filter units (Millipore) and were reconstituted with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposomes.

These proteins, which form filamentous aggregates in disease, vary only by the presence or absence of three inserts encoded by alternatively spliced exons 2, 3, and 10 of the Tau gene (MAPT). To determine the contribution of alternatively spliced segments to Tau aggregation propensity, the aggregation kinetics of six unmodified, recombinant human Tau isoforms were examined in vitro using electron microscopy assay methods. Aggregation propensity was then compared at the level of elementary rate constants for nucleation and extension phases. We found that all three alternatively spliced segments modulated Tau aggregation but through differing kinetic mechanisms that could synergize or compete depending on sequence context. Overall, segments encoded by exons 2 and 10 promoted aggregation, whereas the segment encoded by exon 3 depressed it with its efficacy dependent on the presence or absence of a fourth microtubule binding repeat. In general, aggregation propensity correlated with genetic risk reported for multiple tauopathies, implicating aggregation as one candidate mechanism rationalizing the correlation between Tau expression patterns and disease.

In some disorders, disease risk and aggregate composition vary with expression of MAPT, the sole gene encoding human Tau protein. The human MAPT locus is part of two major chromosome 17 allele combinations (haplotypes) termed H1 and H2 (2Baker M. Litvan I. Houlden H. Adamson J. Dickson D. Perez-Tur J. Hardy J. Lynch T. Bigio E.

Exons 2 and 3 encode 29-residue acidic inserts in the N-terminal projection domain of Tau, whereas exon 10 encodes a 31-residue microtubule binding repeat in the C-terminal domain. The default splicing pattern for exons 2 and 10 is inclusion, whereas the pattern for exon 3 is exclusion. However, exon 3 is transcribed only in the presence of exon 2. As a result, isoforms encoded by 2−3−, 2+3−, and 2+3+ transcripts, termed 0N, 1N, and 2N Tau because of the number of N-terminal inserts expressed, appear in human brain with prevalence 1N > 0N > 2N (4Boutajangout A.

In normal brain, these are divided between exon 10+ and exon 10− encoding sequences (termed 4R and 3R, respectively, owing to the number of imperfect microtubule-binding repeats), yielding a total of six isoforms that vary in length from 352 to 441 amino acid residues (see Fig. 1A). Despite this canonical expression pattern, the six central nervous system Tau isoforms vary in relative amounts depending on both cis and trans gene regulatory mechanisms.

For example, 3R isoforms predominate in fetal brain and in certain adult cell populations, including granule cells of the dentate gyrus (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J.

Together, these data implicate Tau isoform composition in susceptibility to certain tauopathic neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer disease frontotemporal lobar degeneration progressive supranuclear palsy three repeat standard error of the estimate four repeat. Tau isoform composition can affect multiple aspects of Tau biology. For example, the N-terminal (projection) domain mediates interactions between Tau and the plasma membrane (14Brandt R. Léger J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and modulates spacing between microtubules (15Chen J. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N.

Because the 4R isoforms most strongly associated with familial FTLD affect the C-terminal domain, modulation of microtubule biology and aggregation propensity are leading rationales for association of these isoforms with disease. Nonetheless, current models cannot rationalize the potential role of N-terminal insertions, which do not affect microtubule binding affinity (18Goode B.L. Chau M. Denis P.E. Feinstein S.C.

In contrast, both N- and C-terminal inserts that arise from alternative splicing have been reported to modulate Tau aggregation propensity in the presence of heparin and anionic surfactant aggregation inducers (20Adams S.J.

As a result, the reported contribution of segments encoded by alternatively spliced exons to aggregation propensity has been inconsistent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which alternatively spliced sequences act to modulate aggregation propensity are unknown. Recently we showed that the small-molecule anionic inducer Thiazine red can substitute for macromolecular and surfactant inducers in driving aggregation of full-length 2N4R Tau into filaments with twisted ribbon morphology at submicromolar concentrations (26Chirita C.N.

The interaction approximates a homogeneous nucleation scheme characterized by initial formation of an unstable dimeric nucleus, followed by filament elongation through monomer addition (27Congdon E.E.

Under these conditions, the inherent aggregation propensity of full-length, un-modified Tau isoforms may be quantified and mechanistically localized under near physiological Tau protein concentrations, pH, ionic strength, and reducing conditions (28Chang E.

Here, we use this approach to characterize the aggregation propensity of all six unmodified human brain Tau isoforms. The results show that all three alternatively spliced segments modulate Tau aggregation propensity and that they can do so at both the nucleation and elongation steps of the pathway. Recombinant His-tagged human Tau isoforms were prepared as described previously (23King M.E. Gamblin T.C. Kuret J. Binder L.I.

Adsorbed filaments >10 nm in length were quantified from at least three fields captured for each condition using Optimas imaging software (version 6.5, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).

Kcrit values were estimated by linear regression analysis of the Tau concentration dependence of aggregation at interaction plateau (27Congdon E.E. Kim S. Bonchak J. Songrug T. Matzavinos A. Kuret J.

The abscissa intercept (x̂) determined by inverse prediction was taken as Kcrit. Higher order approximations of x̂ were obtained from the Taylor series expansion (32Rice J.A.

Aliquots were withdrawn as a function of time up to 5 h post-dilution and then assayed for filament length. The resultant disaggregation time series was fit to an exponential decay function to obtain kapp, the pseudo-first order rate constant describing the time-dependent decrease in filament length, and L0, the total filament length at time zero. The rate constant ke− was estimated from kapp, L0, and the number of filaments at time zero as described previously (33Kristofferson D. Karr T.L. Purich D.L.

Estimated kinetic parameters were assumed to resemble normally distributed random variables (Xi) with mean μi and known standard deviation si. As a global test of the null hypothesis H0 (i.e. that all compared μi values were the same), the statistic T based on the maximum likelihood ratio test principle (32Rice J.A. Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis. 3rd Ed. Thomson Higher Education, Belmont, CA2007: 165-166Google Scholar) was calculated, T=∑i=1kwi(Xi−μ^)2(Eq. 4) where k is the number of kinetic parameters being compared, T is the 1 − α point of the Chi-square distribution having k − 1 degrees of freedom, wi = 1/σi2, and μ̂, the common mean under the null hypothesis, is the weighted sum of Xi. μ^=∑i=1kwiXi∑i=1kwi(Eq. 5) If H0 was true, then the probability (p) of obtaining more extreme values of T than actually observed is α. For pairwise comparisons, the probability (p) of obtaining the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis, was assessed by z-test, Z=x1−x2(Sx1)2+(Sx2)2(Eq. 6) where x1 ± Sx1 and x2 ± Sx2 are the pair of estimates ± SEE being compared, z is the 1 − α point of the standard normal distribution, and p is 2α. All statistical analyses were carried out using JMP (version 9.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All six Tau isoforms aggregated in the presence of Thiazine red inducer, forming filaments with twisted ribbon morphology (supplemental Fig. 1). To quantify aggregation propensity of each isoform, the minimal concentration required to support filament formation in the presence of Thiazine red inducer was estimated using an electron microscopy assay for total filament length (31Necula M. Kuret J. Electron microscopy as a quantitative method for investigating Tau fibrillization.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In nucleation-dependent interactions, the minimal concentration is termed the critical concentration (Kcrit) and approximates the dissociation equilibrium constant for elongation (Ke) (27Congdon E.E. Kim S. Bonchak J. Songrug T. Matzavinos A. Kuret J. Nucleation-dependent Tau filament formation: The importance of dimerization and an estimation of elementary rate constants.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13806-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Results showed that Kcrit values for the six Tau isoforms varied over more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 1B; Table 1). When subjected to a global statistical test (Equations 4 and 5), the null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.0001. Furthermore, the Fieller 95% confidence intervals for any pair of isoforms did not overlap. These data indicate that naturally occurring human Tau isoforms differed in their ability to support fibrillization in the presence of Thiazine red and that our analytical methods were adequate to detect and quantify the differences.TABLE 1Summary of aggregation parametersIsoformKcritaOverall constant reflecting events at both filament ends.ke−ke+Lag timeμms−1m−1 s−1h0N3R1.82 ± 0.030.051 ± 0.00627,800 ± 3,3001.36 ± 0.431N3R0.92 ± 0.030.053 ± 0.00257,300 ± 2,0901.18 ± 0.132N3R1.47 ± 0.050.048 ± 0.01032,300 ± 7,1000.85 ± 0.200N4R0.37 ± 0.030.021 ± 0.00255,700 ± 7,6000.34 ± 0.061N4R0.16 ± 0.010.021 ± 0.001133,000 ± 8,8000.29 ± 0.082N4R0.21 ± 0.010.019 ± 0.00190,000 ± 5,9000.23 ± 0.02a Overall constant reflecting events at both filament ends. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the observed variation in aggregation propensity resulted from differential sensitivity to Thiazine red inducer, the concentration-effect relationship for Thiazine red-mediated fibrillization was quantified for each isoform at constant Tau supersaturation (i.e. the net difference between bulk concentration and Kcrit was held constant, so that the amount of aggregation at plateau was approximately the same for all six isoforms). Results showed that all isoforms resembled one another with respect to both the potency and efficacy of Thiazine red (supplemental Fig. 2). Together, these data indicate that Tau isoforms respond similarly to Thiazine red and that the observed variation in Kcrit reflects intrinsic differences in aggregation propensity among Tau isoforms. Visual inspection of Fig. 1B revealed that 4R-containing Tau isoforms aggregated with lower Kcrit than 3R isoforms. Moreover, the rank order of Kcrit within 3R and 4R isoforms consistently was 0N > 2N > 1N, suggesting that the differences resulted from the presence or absence of alternatively spliced segments. To test this prediction, the ratio of Kcrit values observed in the presence and absence of each alternatively spliced segment was calculated for isoform pairs. For example, pairwise comparison of 0N4R with 1N4R, and of 0N3R with 1N3R, gave two estimates of the contribution of the N-terminal segment encoded by exon 2 to Kcrit, whereas comparison of 1N4R with 2N4R and of 1N3R with 2N3R provided two estimates of the effects of the exon 3-encoded sequence. Similarly, comparison of 0N4R with 0N3R, 1N4R with 1N3R, and 2N4R and 2N3R provided three estimates of the contribution of the alternatively spliced microtubule binding repeat to Tau Kcrit. Replot of Kcrit ratios showed that the presence of the exon 2-encoded insert lowered Kcrit ∼ 2-fold in both 3R and 4R backgrounds (Fig. 1C). In contrast, exon 3-encoded sequence increased Kcrit, with stronger effects in 3R than in 4R background (Fig. 1C). The largest effects, however, associated with the exon 10-encoded microtubule repeat, which on average lowered Kcrit 6-fold (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that aggregation propensity is increased by exon 2- and exon 10-encoded segments but antagonized by the segment encoded by exon 3 in a manner that is sensitive to the number of microtubule binding repeats. Kcrit approximates the ratio of dissociation (ke−) and association (ke+) rate constants for filament elongation (Equation 2). Thus, modulation of Kcrit may result from changes in ke− (i.e. filament stability), in ke+ (i.e. the efficiency of monomer association with filament ends), or both. To distinguish these possibilities, ke− was estimated for each Tau isoform by diluting preassembled filaments below Kcrit and estimating the initial rate of filament shortening in the electron microscopy assay. Loss of filament length followed first order kinetics as predicted for endwise depolymerization from a Poisson-like length distribution (27Congdon E.E. Kim S. Bonchak J. Songrug T. Matzavinos A.

https://openalex.org/W2154942224,"A quantum critical point (QCP) arises at a continuous transition between competing phases at zero temperature. Collective excitations at magnetic QCPs give rise to metallic properties that strongly deviate from the expectations of Landau's Fermi liquid description, the standard theory of electron correlations in metals. Central to this theory is the notion of quasiparticles, electronic excitations which possess the quantum numbers of the bare electrons. Here we report measurements of thermal and electrical transport across the field-induced magnetic QCP in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. We show that the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities at the zero-temperature limit obeys the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law above the critical field, $B_c$. This is also expected at $B < B_c$, where weak antiferromagnetic order and a Fermi liquid phase form below 0.07 K ($B = 0$). However, at the critical field the low-temperature electrical conductivity suggests a non-Fermi-liquid ground state and exceeds the thermal conductivity by about 10%. This apparent violation of the WF law provides evidence for an unconventional type of QCP at which the fundamental concept of Landau quasiparticles breaks down. These results imply that Landau quasiparticles break up, and that the origin of this disintegration is inelastic scattering associated with electronic quantum critical fluctuations. Our finding brings new insights into understanding deviations from Fermi-liquid behaviour frequently observed in various classes of correlated materials."

Moreover, elevated expression of VCP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is correlated with increased incidence of recurrence. But the role of VCP in HCC progression in vitro and in vivo is unclear. And there are few reports about the regulation mechanism on the expression of VCP in HCC. In this study, it was identified that the level of VCP was frequently increased in human HCC tissues. In addition, down-regulation of VCP with siRNAs could dramatically suppress the genesis and progression of tumor in vivo. It was found that miR-129-5p directly inhibited the expression of VCP in several HCC cell lines. Meanwhile, the level of VCP in HCC tissues was negatively associated with the level of miR-129-5p. Our further investigation showed that the enhanced expression of miR-129-5p also suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, it was revealed that miR-129-5p could inhibit the degradation of IκBα and increase the apoptosis and reduce the migration of HCC cells by suppressing the expression of VCP. Our results revealed that the expression of VCP was directly regulated by miR-129-5p and this regulation played an important role in the progression of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1989363593,"Mutations in human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) cause autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis. Increased intrapancreatic autoactivation of trypsinogen mutants has been hypothesized to initiate the disease. Autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen is proteolytically regulated by chymotrypsin C (CTRC), which mitigates the development of trypsin activity by promoting degradation of both trypsinogen and trypsin. Paradoxically, CTRC also increases the rate of autoactivation by processing the trypsinogen activation peptide to a shorter form. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CTRC on the autoactivation of clinically relevant trypsinogen mutants. We found that in the presence of CTRC, trypsinogen mutants associated with classic hereditary pancreatitis (N29I, N29T, V39A, R122C, and R122H) autoactivated at increased rates and reached markedly higher active trypsin levels compared with wild-type cationic trypsinogen. The A16V mutant, known for its variable disease penetrance, exhibited a smaller increase in autoactivation. The mechanistic basis of increased activation was mutation-specific and involved resistance to degradation (N29I, N29T, V39A, R122C, and R122H) and/or increased N-terminal processing by CTRC (A16V and N29I). These observations indicate that hereditary pancreatitis is caused by CTRC-dependent dysregulation of cationic trypsinogen autoactivation, which results in elevated trypsin levels in the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1989556124,"Suicidal B cells In response to an infection, immunological B cells undergo a maturation process that results in the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) that is better able to bind and clear the invading pathogen. This occurs through somatic cell hypermutation and class switch recombination of the Ig gene and requires activation-induced deaminase (AID). Péron et al. (p. 931 , published online 26 April) observed that the 3' cis-regulatory region of the heavy-chain locus is transcribed and undergoes AID-mediated mutation and recombination. The resulting deletion of the Ig heavy gene cluster generates B cells that are no longer able to express Ig on the cell surface. Because cell-surface Ig expression is essential for B cell survival, this process is termed “locus suicide recombination” (LSR) and may be important in shaping the dynamics of B effector cell differentiation and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1968109963,"The brain-specific isoform carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) has been implicated in the hypothalamic regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, its molecular function is not completely understood, and its role in other brain areas is unknown. We demonstrate that CPT1C is expressed in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the neuron, even inside dendritic spines. We used molecular, cellular, and behavioral approaches to determine CPT1C function. First, we analyzed the implication of CPT1C in ceramide metabolism. CPT1C overexpression in primary hippocampal cultured neurons increased ceramide levels, whereas in CPT1C-deficient neurons, ceramide levels were diminished. Correspondingly, CPT1C knock-out (KO) mice showed reduced ceramide levels in the hippocampus. At the cellular level, CPT1C deficiency altered dendritic spine morphology by increasing immature filopodia and reducing mature mushroom and stubby spines. Total protrusion density and spine head area in mature spines were unaffected. Treatment of cultured neurons with exogenous ceramide reverted the KO phenotype, as did ectopic overexpression of CPT1C, indicating that CPT1C regulation of spine maturation is mediated by ceramide. To study the repercussions of the KO phenotype on cognition, we performed the hippocampus-dependent Morris water maze test on mice. Results show that CPT1C deficiency strongly impairs spatial learning. All of these results demonstrate that CPT1C regulates the levels of ceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum of hippocampal neurons, and this is a relevant mechanism for the correct maturation of dendritic spines and for proper spatial learning."
https://openalex.org/W2007192415,"Enterovirus 68 (EV68) was first isolated in 1962. Very few cases of EV68 infection were described over the ensuing 40 years. However, in the past few years, an increase in severe respiratory tract infections associated with EV68 has been reported. We identified two clusters of EV68 infection in South London, UK, one each in the autumn/winters of 2009 and 2010. Sequence comparison showed significant homology of the UK strains with those from other countries including the Netherlands, Japan and the Philippines, which reported EV68 outbreaks between 2008 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of all available VP1 sequences indicated the presence of two modern EV68 lineages. The 2010 UK strains belonged to lineage 2. Lineage 1 could be further divided into two sub-lineages: some Japanese and Dutch strains collected between 2004 and 2010 form a distinct sub-lineages (sub-lineage 1.1), whereas other strains from the UK, Japan, Netherlands and Philippines collected between 2008 and 2010 represent sub-lineage 1.2. The UK 2009 strains together with several Dutch and Japanese strains from 2009/2010 represents one variant (1.2.1), whereas those from the Philippines a second variant (1.2.2).

Molecular epidemiological analysis indicates rapid recent evolution of EV68 and this may explain the recent findings of a global resurgence of EV68. Continuous global monitoring of the clinical and molecular epidemiology of EV68 is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2019411659,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and intelligence (IQ) are both heritable phenotypes. Overlapping genetic effects have been suggested to influence both, with neuroimaging work suggesting similar overlap in terms of morphometric properties of the brain. Together, this evidence suggests that the brain changes characteristic of ADHD may vary as a function of IQ. This study investigated this hypothesis in a sample of 108 children with ADHD and 106 typically developing controls, who participated in a cross-sectional anatomical MRI study. A subgroup of 64 children also participated in a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Brain volumes, local cortical thickness and average cerebral white matter microstructure were analyzed in relation to diagnostic group and IQ. Dimensional analyses investigated possible group differences in the relationship between anatomical measures and IQ. Second, the groups were split into above and below median IQ subgroups to investigate possible differences in the trajectories of cortical development. Dimensionally, cerebral gray matter volume and cerebral white matter microstructure were positively associated with IQ for controls, but not for ADHD. In the analyses of the below and above median IQ subgroups, we found no differences from controls in cerebral gray matter volume in ADHD with below-median IQ, but a delay of cortical development in a number of regions, including prefrontal areas. Conversely, in ADHD with above-median IQ, there were significant reductions from controls in cerebral gray matter volume, but no local differences in the trajectories of cortical development.In conclusion, the basic relationship between IQ and neuroanatomy appears to be altered in ADHD. Our results suggest that there may be multiple brain phenotypes associated with ADHD, where ADHD combined with above median IQ is characterized by small, more global reductions in brain volume that are stable over development, whereas ADHD with below median IQ is associated more with a delay of cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2098714223,"Disease-specific biomarkers are an important tool for the timely and effective management of pathological conditions, including determination of susceptibility, diagnosis, and monitoring efficacy of preventive or therapeutic strategies. Aptamers, comprising single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA, can serve as biomarkers of disease or biological states. Aptamers can bind to specific epitopes on macromolecules by virtue of their three dimensional structures and, much like antibodies, aptamers can be used to target specific epitopes on the basis of their molecular shape. The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) is the approach used to select high affinity aptamers for specific macromolecular targets from among the >10(13) oligomers comprising typical random oligomer libraries. In the present study, we used live cell-based SELEX to identify DNA aptamers which recognize cell surface differences between HPV-transformed cervical carcinoma cancer cells and isogenic, nontumorigenic, revertant cell lines.Whole-cell SELEX methodology was adapted for use with adherent cell lines (which we termed Adherent Cell-SELEX (AC-SELEX)). Using this approach, we identified high affinity aptamers (nanomolar range K(d)) to epitopes specific to the cell surface of two nontumorigenic, nontumorigenic revertants derived from the human cervical cancer HeLa cell line, and demonstrated the loss of these epitopes in another human papillomavirus transformed cervical cancer cell line (SiHa). We also performed preliminary investigation of the aptamer epitopes and their binding characteristics.Using AC-SELEX we have generated several aptamers that have high affinity and specificity to the nontumorigenic, revertant of HPV-transformed cervical cancer cells. These aptamers can be used to identify new biomarkers that are related to carcinogenesis. Panels of aptamers, such as these may be useful in predicting the tumorigenic potential and properties of cancer biopsies and aid in the effective management of pathological conditions (diagnosis, predicted outcome, and treatment options)."
https://openalex.org/W2144471602,"The ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, Abcb1) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, Abcg2) regulate the CNS disposition of many drugs. The main psychoactive constituent of cannabis Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has affinity for P-gp and Bcrp, however it is unknown whether these transporters modulate the brain accumulation of THC and its functional effects on the CNS. Here we aim to show that mice devoid of Abcb1 and Abcg2 retain higher brain THC levels and are more sensitive to cannabinoid-induced hypothermia than wild-type (WT) mice. Abcb1a/b (−/−), Abcg2 (−/−) and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with THC before brain and blood were collected and THC concentrations determined. Another cohort of mice was examined for THC-induced hypothermia by measuring rectal body temperature. Brain THC concentrations were higher in both Abcb1a/b (−/−) and Abcg2 (−/−) mice than WT mice. ABC transporter knockout mice exhibited delayed elimination of THC from the brain with the effect being more prominent in Abcg2 (−/−) mice. ABC transporter knockout mice were more sensitive to THC-induced hypothermia compared to WT mice. These results show P-gp and Bcrp prolong the brain disposition and hypothermic effects of THC and offer a novel mechanism for both genetic vulnerability to the psychoactive effects of cannabis and drug interactions between CNS therapies and cannabis."

We hypothesized that rosuvastatin would decrease viral replication, attenuate lung injury, and improve mortality following influenza A infection in mice.C57Bl/6 mice were treated daily with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) supplemented in chow (or control chow) beginning three days prior to infection with either A//Udorn/72 [H3N2] or A/WSN/33 [H1N1] influenza A virus (1×10(5) pfu/mouse). Plaque assays were used to examine the effect of rosuvastatin on viral replication in vitro and in the lungs of infected mice. We measured cell count with differential, protein and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, histologic evidence of lung injury, and wet-to-dry ratio on Day 1, 2, 4, and 6. We also recorded daily weights and mortality.The administration of rosuvastatin had no effect on viral clearance of influenza A after infection. Weight loss, lung inflammation and lung injury severity were similar in the rosuvastatin and control treated mice. In the mice infected with influenza A (A/WSN/33), mortality was unaffected by treatment with rosuvastatin.Statins did not alter the replication of influenza A in vitro or enhance its clearance from the lung in vivo. Statins neither attenuated the severity of influenza A-induced lung injury nor had an effect on influenza A-related mortality. Our data suggest that the association between HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and improved outcomes in patients with sepsis and pneumonia are not attributable to their effects on influenza A infection."

In this study we identify previously unrecognized interaction partners of PKCα and a novel role for PKCα in the regulation of stress granule formation during cellular stress. Three RNA-binding proteins, cytoplasmic poly(A)+ binding protein (PABPC1), IGF-II mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), and RasGAP binding protein 2 (G3BP2) all co-precipitate with PKCα. RNase treatment abolished the association with IGF2BP3 and PABPC1 whereas the PKCα-G3BP2 interaction was largely resistant to this. Furthermore, interactions between recombinant PKCα and G3BP2 indicated that the interaction is direct and PKCα can phosphorylate G3BP2 in vitro. The binding is mediated via the regulatory domain of PKCα and the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of G3BP2. Both proteins relocate to and co-localize in stress granules, but not to P-bodies, when cells are subjected to stress. Heat shock-induced stress granule assembly and phosphorylation of eIF2α are suppressed following downregulation of PKCα by siRNA. In conclusion this study identifies novel interaction partners of PKCα and a novel role for PKCα in regulation of stress granules."
https://openalex.org/W1971806200,"Hypermethylation of the glutathione S-transferase π 1 (GSTP1) gene promoter region has been reported to be a potential biomarker to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from other liver diseases. However, reports regarding how specific a marker it is have ranged from 100% to 0%. We hypothesized that, to a large extent, the variation of specificity depends on the location of the CpG sites analyzed. To test this hypothesis, we compared the methylation status of the GSTP1 promoter region of the DNA isolated from HCC, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and normal liver tissues by bisulfite–PCR sequencing. We found that the 5′ region of the position −48 nt from the transcription start site of the GSTP1 gene is selectively methylated in HCC, whereas the 3′ region is methylated in all liver tissues examined, including normal liver and the HCC tissue. Interestingly, when DNA derived from fetal liver and 11 nonhepatic normal tissue was also examined by bisulfite-PCR sequencing, we found that methylation of the 3′ region of the promoter appeared to be liver-specific. A methylation-specific PCR assay targeting the 5′ region of the promoter was developed and used to quantify the methylated GSTP1 gene in various diseased liver tissues including HCC. When we used an assay targeting the 3′ region, we found that the methylation of the 5′-end of the GSTP1 promoter was significantly more specific than that of the 3′-end (97.1% vs. 60%, p<0.0001 by Fisher's exact test) for distinguishing HCC (n = 120) from hepatitis (n = 35) and cirrhosis (n = 35). Encouragingly, 33.8% of the AFP-negative HCC contained the methylated GSTP1 gene. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of the location of CpG site methylation for HCC specificity and how liver-specific DNA methylation should be considered when an epigenetic DNA marker is studied for detection of HCC."

https://openalex.org/W1997425944,"JC virus encephalopathy (JCVE) is a newly described gray matter disease of the brain caused by productive infection of cortical pyramidal neurons. We characterized the full length sequence of JCV isolated from the brain of a JCVE patient, analyzed its distribution in various compartments by PCR, and determined viral gene expression in the brain by immunohistochemistry(IHC). We identified a novel JCV variant, JCV(CPN1), with a unique 143 bp deletion in the Agno gene encoding a truncated 10 amino acid peptide, and harboring an archetype-like regulatory region. This variant lacked one of three nuclear protein binding regions in the Agno gene. It was predominant in the brain, where it coexisted with an Agno-intact wild-type strain. Double immunostaining with anti-Agno and anti- VP1 antibodies demonstrated that the truncated JCV(CPN1) Agno peptide was present in the majority of cortical cells productively infected with JCV. We then screened 68 DNA samples from 8 brain, 30 CSF and 30 PBMC samples of PML patients, HIV+ and HIV- control subjects. Another JCV(CPN) strain with a different pattern of Agno-deletion was found in the CSF of an HIV+/PML patient, where it also coexisted with wild-type, Agno-intact JCV. These findings suggest that the novel tropism for cortical pyramidal neurons of JCV(CPN1), may be associated with the Agno deletion. Productive and lytic infection of these cells, resulting in fulminant JCV encephalopathy and death may have been facilitated by the co-infection with a wild-type strain of JCV."

We have recently shown that human MAGE proteins can interact with NSE4/EID proteins through their characteristic conserved hydrophobic pocket.Using mutagenesis and protein-protein interaction analyses, we have identified a new Nse3/MAGE-binding domain (NMBD) of the Nse4/EID proteins. This short domain is located next to the Nse4 N-terminal kleisin motif and is conserved in all NSE4/EID proteins. The central amino acid residues of the human NSE4b/EID3 domain were essential for its binding to hNSE3/MAGEG1 in yeast two-hybrid assays suggesting they form the core of the binding domain. PEPSCAN ELISA measurements of the MAGEC2 binding affinity to EID2 mutant peptides showed that similar core residues contribute to the EID2-MAGEC2 interaction. In addition, the N-terminal extension of the EID2 binding domain took part in the EID2-MAGEC2 interaction. Finally, docking and molecular dynamic simulations enabled us to generate a structure model for EID2-MAGEC2. Combination of our experimental data and the structure modeling showed how the core helical region of the NSE4/EID domain binds into the conserved pocket characteristic of the MAGE protein family.We have identified a new Nse4/EID conserved domain and characterized its binding to Nse3/MAGE proteins.

The following combinations of gene-specific primers were used for RT-PCR profiling of the three cathepsin D mRNAs: IrCD1 forward 5′-GACAGAAGGCGGACAGTACC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGAAATTGTGAAGGTGACAT-3′; IrCD2 forward 5′-CCGAGATCCTGCACG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCACGATGTACTCTCC-3′; and IrCD3 forward 5′-CCTGACGTTTGTGGCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTTGAGGACGTAGTCGC-3′. Dual-labeled UPL probes and specific primers were designed on line (Roche Applied Science) and used for quantitative RT-PCR assays. IrCD1 forward 5′-GACAGAAGGCGGACAGTACC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGAAATTGTGAAGGTGACAT-3′ PCR primers were used in combination with probe 78 (Roche Applied Science). IrCD2 forward 5′-GAGCTGCAAGAGCATCGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCGAGCACGAAGTCCTTG-3′ PCR primers were used in combination with probe 44 (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was carried out in triplicate in Rotor-Gene RG3000 PCR cycler (Corbet Research) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Data were analyzed and quantified with the Rotor-Gene 6 analysis software. Relative values were standardized to the PCR amplification of the cDNA for elongation factor 1α (ELF1α) (13Nijhof A.M.

The Escherichia coli bacterial expression system ChampionTM pET directional expression kit (Invitrogen) was selected for expression of the IrCD1 zymogen. N-terminal His6-tagged fusion IrCD1 was prepared by PCR amplification of the IrCD1 cDNA without the signal peptide. PCR primers for directional pET cloning were as follows: forward 5′-CACCGCTTTCAGGATCCCGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCAGCGGACGAAGTCGGAA-3′. The product was inserted into the pET100/D-TOPO® expression vector. The sequence-verified construct was transformed into BL21 StarTM(DE3) E. coli (Invitrogen), and the expression of recombinant protein was performed according to the manual provided with the kit. Inclusion bodies were resolved in buffered 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (14Grunclová L. Horn M. Vancová M. Sojka D. Franta Z. Mares M. Kopácek P.

A linear gradient of 0.01–0.5 m imidazole was used for elution on an FPLC AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was refolded using the following protocol: l-arginine was added to the sample to 0.4 m final concentration. This solution was successively dialyzed at 4 °C against 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm mercaptoethanol containing the following: 1) 4 m urea, 0.4 m l-arginine for 3 h; 2) 2 m urea, 0.4 m l-arginine for 3 h; 3) 0.4 m l-arginine for 3 h; and 4) plain buffer overnight. The refolded rIrCD1 zymogen was purified by FPLC on a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, and eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The purified rIrCD1 zymogen was activated in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, for 3 h at 37 °C. Activated rIrCD1 was subsequently purified by FPLC on a Mono S column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium formate, pH 3.8, and eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The purification and activation processes were monitored by the FRET activity assay and SDS-PAGE (see below). To obtain IrCD1-specific polyclonal antibodies (Ra×rIrCD1), a rabbit was repeatedly immunized with purified rIrCD1 according to a previously described protocol (15Kopácek P. Zdychová J. Yoshiga T.

The isolated Ra×rIrCD1 Ig fraction was diluted in PBS and purified over this column, washed with PBS, eluted with 0.2 m l-glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.2, neutralized with 1 m Tris-base, and stored at −20 °C. Reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed using a previously described protocol (17Kopácek P. Weise C. Götz P. The prophenol oxidase from the wax moth Galleria mellonella.

Briefly, the gut tissue was fixed in a solution of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in ascending ethanol dilutions, infiltrated in LR White resin (London Resin Co.), and polymerized in gelatin capsules (Polysciences). Semi-thin sections (0.5 μm) were transferred onto glass slides, blocked with BSA and low fat dry milk, and incubated with Ra×rIrCD1 antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488 dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in PBS/Tween and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) counterstain were used for fluorescent labeling. Sections were mounted in 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) dissolved in glycerol and examined with the Olympus FW 1000 confocal microscope and consequently processed with the Fluoview (FV10-ASW, Version 1.7 software).

After 24 h of rest in a humid chamber, ticks (25 females and 25 males) were fed on guinea pigs. Partially engorged females were forcibly removed from the host and weighed, and the guts were dissected. The level of IrCD1 knockdown was checked on the following levels: 1) transcription (qRT-PCR); 2) protein abundance (immunoblotting using Ra×rIrCD1 antibodies); and 3) cathepsin D activity (assays of the gut tissue extract using FRET and labeled hemoglobin substrates; see below).

Cathepsin D activity was measured using the FRET peptide substrate Abz-Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Nph-Arg-Leu (single letter code Abz-KPAEFnFRL; Abz, 2-aminobenzoyl; nF, nitrophenylalanine) in 96-well microplates in a total volume of 100 μl. Recombinant IrCD1 (0.1–0.5 μg) or gut extract (150 μg of proteins) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 150 mm phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 4.0. Hydrolytic activity was continuously measured after addition of substrate (40 μm final concentration) in an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan) at excitation and emission wavelengths set to 330 and 410 nm, respectively. pH profile of activity was determined as stated above in 150 mm phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 2.5–7.0. Assays were performed in triplicate. The kinetic measurements were performed in the initial linear phase of reaction progress curves and in linear response region to enzyme concentration. For activity assay in the presence of peptidase inhibitors, an aliquot of rIrCD1 was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the CP buffer, pH 4.0, with inhibitors (Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W2084084237,"It is well known that some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can induce IL-12 which plays an important role in modulating immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which LAB induce IL-12 production remain unclear. Here, we examine the role of toll-like receptors (TLR's) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IL-12 production by LAB stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Our results indicate that a TLR is not necessary for IL-12 induction by LAB, whilst the universal adaptor protein, MyD88, is essential. Specific strains of LAB induced ROS that correlated with both the frequency of phagocytosis and IL-12 production. Reduction in IL-12 production by NADPH oxidase inhibitors or ROS scavengers demonstrates the crucial role of ROS in IL-12 induction. Interestingly, deficiency of TLR2, 4, 9 or MyD88 did not affect the phagocytosis of LAB strain KW3110, a potent IL-12 inducer, and ROS production was significantly reduced only in MyD88 deficient macrophages. These results suggest the existence of TLR-MyD88 independent LAB recognition and MyD88 related ROS induction mechanisms. We show here the importance of ROS for IL-12 induction and provide new insights into IL-12 induction by LAB."
https://openalex.org/W2048047549,"Background IbeA-induced NF-κB signaling through its primary receptor vimentin as well as its co-receptor PSF is required for meningitic E. coli K1 penetration and leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which are the hallmarks of bacterial meningitis. However, it is unknown how vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which are required for bacteria-mediated pathogenicities. Methodology/Principal Findings IbeA-induced E. coli K1 invasion, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) transmigration and IKK/NF-κB activation are blocked by Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an inhibitor of NF-κB. IKKα/β phosphorylation is blocked by ERK inhibitors. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that vimentin forms a complex with IκB, NF-κB and tubulins in the resting cells. A dissociation of this complex and a simultaneous association of PSF with NF-κB could be induced by IbeA in a time-dependent manner. The head domain of vimentin is required for the complex formation. Two cytoskeletal components, vimentin filaments and microtubules, contribute to the regulation of NF-κB. SiRNA-mediated knockdown studies demonstrate that IKKα/β phosphorylation is completely abolished in HBMECs lacking vimentin and PSF. Phosphorylation of ERK and nuclear translocation of NF-κB are entirely dependent on PSF. These findings suggest that vimentin and PSF cooperatively contribute to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB activation. PSF is essential for translocation of NF-κB and ERK to the nucleus. Conclusion/Significance These findings reveal previously unappreciated facets of the IbeA-binding proteins. Cooperative contributions of vimentin and PSF to IbeA-induced cytoplasmic activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB may represent a new paradigm in pathogen-induced signal transduction and lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W2062431978,"Background Water buffalo is an economically important livestock species and about half of its total world population exists in India. Development of stem cell technology in buffalo can find application in targeted genetic modification of this species. Testis has emerged as a source of pluripotent stem cells in mice and human; however, not much information is available in buffalo. Objectives and Methods Pou5f1 (Oct 3/4) is a transcription factor expressed by pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, in the present study, expression of POU5F1 transcript and protein was examined in testes of both young and adult buffaloes by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis. Further, using the testis transplantation assay, a functional assay for spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), stem cell potential of gonocytes/spermatogonia isolated from prepubertal buffalo testis was also determined. Results Expression of POU5F1transcript and protein was detected in prepubertal and adult buffalo testes. Western blot analysis revealed that the POU5F1 protein in the buffalo testis exists in two isoforms; large (∼47 kDa) and small (∼21 kDa). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that POU5F1 expression in prepubertal buffalo testis was present in gonocytes/spermatogonia and absent from somatic cells. In the adult testis, POU5F1 expression was present primarily in post-meiotic germ cells such as round spermatids, weakly in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and absent from elongated spermatids. POU5F1 protein expression was seen both in cytoplasm and nuclei of the stained germ cells. Stem cell potential of prepubertal buffalo gonocytes/spermatogonia was confirmed by the presence of colonized DBA-stained cells in the basal membrane of seminiferous tubules of xenotransplanted mice testis. Conclusion/Significance These findings strongly indicate that gonocytes/spermatogonia, isolated for prepubertal buffalo testis can be a potential target for establishing a germ stem cell line that would enable genetic modification of buffaloes."

A genetically engineered murine GBM model [Ink4a-Arf−/− PtenloxP/loxP/Ntv-a RCAS/PDGF(+)/Cre(+)] was treated with gemcitabine (GEM), temozolomide (TMZ) +/− ionizing radiation (IR). Therapeutic efficacy was quantified by contrast-enhanced MRI and DW-MRI for growth rate and tumor cellularity, respectively. Mice treated with GEM, TMZ and radiation showed a significant reduction in growth rates as early as three days post-treatment initiation. Both combination treatments (GEM/IR and TMZ/IR) resulted in improved survival over single therapies. Tumor diffusion values increased prior to detectable changes in tumor volume growth rates following administration of therapies. Concomitant GEM/IR and TMZ/IR was active and well tolerated in this GBM model and similarly prolonged median survival of tumor bearing mice. DW-MRI provided early changes to radiosensitization treatment warranting evaluation of this imaging biomarker in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2015514726,"Assessment of the biodiversity of communities of small organisms is most readily done using PCR-based analysis of environmental samples consisting of mixtures of individuals. Known as metagenetics, this approach has transformed understanding of microbial communities and is beginning to be applied to metazoans as well. Unlike microbial studies, where analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence is standard, the best gene for metazoan metagenetics is less clear. In this study we designed a set of PCR primers for the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal DNA sequence based on 64 complete mitochondrial genomes and then tested their efficacy.A total of the 64 complete mitochondrial genome sequences representing all metazoan classes available in GenBank were downloaded using the NCBI Taxonomy Browser. Alignment of sequences was performed for the excised mitochondrial 12S ribosomal DNA sequences, and conserved regions were identified for all 64 mitochondrial genomes. These regions were used to design a primer pair that flanks a more variable region in the gene. Then all of the complete metazoan mitochondrial genomes available in NCBI's Organelle Genome Resources database were used to determine the percentage of taxa that would likely be amplified using these primers. Results suggest that these primers will amplify target sequences for many metazoans.Newly designed 12S ribosomal DNA primers have considerable potential for metazoan metagenetic analysis because of their ability to amplify sequences from many metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2068615048,"MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression and have been shown to have altered expression in a variety of cancer types, including epithelial ovarian cancer. MiRNA function is most often achieved through binding to the 3′-untranslated region of the target protein coding gene. Mutation screening using massively-parallel sequencing of 712 miRNA genes in 86 ovarian cancer cases identified only 5 mutated miRNA genes, each in a different case. One mutation was located in the mature miRNA, and three mutations were predicted to alter the secondary structure of the miRNA transcript. Screening of the 3′-untranslated region of 18 candidate cancer genes identified one mutation in each of AKT2, EGFR, ERRB2 and CTNNB1. The functional effect of these mutations is unclear, as expression data available for AKT2 and EGFR showed no increase in gene transcript.

https://openalex.org/W2016932516,"In herbaceous ecosystems worldwide, biodiversity has been negatively impacted by changed grazing regimes and nutrient enrichment. Altered disturbance regimes are thought to favour invasive species that have a high phenotypic plasticity, although most studies measure plasticity under controlled conditions in the greenhouse and then assume plasticity is an advantage in the field. Here, we compare trait plasticity between three co-occurring, C(4) perennial grass species, an invader Eragrostis curvula, and natives Eragrostis sororia and Aristida personata to grazing and fertilizer in a three-year field trial. We measured abundances and several leaf traits known to correlate with strategies used by plants to fix carbon and acquire resources, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nutrient concentrations (N, C:N, P), assimilation rates (Amax) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). In the control treatment (grazed only), trait values for SLA, leaf C:N ratios, Amax and PNUE differed significantly between the three grass species. When trait values were compared across treatments, E. curvula showed higher trait plasticity than the native grasses, and this correlated with an increase in abundance across all but the grazed/fertilized treatment. The native grasses showed little trait plasticity in response to the treatments. Aristida personata decreased significantly in the treatments where E. curvula increased, and E. sororia abundance increased possibly due to increased rainfall and not in response to treatments or invader abundance. Overall, we found that plasticity did not favour an increase in abundance of E. curvula under the grazed/fertilized treatment likely because leaf nutrient contents increased and subsequently its' palatability to consumers. E. curvula also displayed a higher resource use efficiency than the native grasses. These findings suggest resource conditions and disturbance regimes can be manipulated to disadvantage the success of even plastic exotic species."

Nicotinamide (NAM) is a key NAD+ precursor that is also a byproduct and feedback inhibitor of the deacetylation reaction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nicotinamidase Pnc1 converts NAM to nicotinic acid (NA), which is then used as a substrate by the NAD+ salvage pathway enzyme NA phosphoribosyltransferase (Npt1). Isonicotinamide (INAM) is an isostere of NAM that stimulates yeast Sir2 deacetylase activity in vitro by alleviating the NAM inhibition. In this study, we determined that INAM stimulates Sir2 through an additional mechanism in vivo, which involves elevation of the intracellular NAD+ concentration. INAM enhanced normal silencing at the rDNA locus but only partially suppressed the silencing defects of an npt1Δ mutant. Yeast cells grown in media lacking NA had a short replicative life span, which was extended by INAM in a SIR2-dependent manner and correlated with increased NAD+. The INAM-induced increase in NAD+ was strongly dependent on Pnc1 and Npt1, suggesting that INAM increases flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway. Part of this effect was mediated by the NR salvage pathways, which generate NAM as a product and require Pnc1 to produce NAD+. We also provide evidence suggesting that INAM influences the expression of multiple NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage pathways to promote homeostasis during stationary phase.

https://openalex.org/W2058629700,"Generating diverse protein libraries that contain improved variants at a sufficiently high frequency is critical for improving the properties of proteins using directed evolution. Many studies have illustrated how random mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis, DNA shuffling and similar approaches are effective diversity generating methods for directed evolution. Very few studies have explored random circular permutation, the intramolecular relocation of the N- and C-termini of a protein, as a diversity-generating step for directed evolution. We subjected a library of random circular permutations of TEM-1 β-lactamase to selections on increasing concentrations of a variety of β-lactam antibiotics including cefotaxime. We identified two circularly permuted variants that conferred elevated resistance to cefotaxime but decreased resistance to other antibiotics. These variants were circularly permuted in the Ω-loop proximal to the active site. Remarkably, one variant was circularly permuted such that the key catalytic residue Glu166 was located at the N-terminus of the mature protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081550933,"O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase (SepSecS) is critical for the biosynthesis and transformation of selenocysteine (Sec) and plays an important role in the biological function of Se through the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis. Selenium (Se) and Selenoprotein play a pivotal role in brain function. However, how intake of the micronutrient Se affects gene expression and how genetic factors influence Se metabolism in the brain is unknown. To investigate the regulation of SepSecS transcription induced by Se in the chicken brain, we determined the Se content of brain tissue, SepSecS gene expression levels and mRNA stability in the chicken brain and primary cultured chicken embryos neurons receiving Se supplements. These results showed that Se content in the brain remains remarkably stable during Se supplementation. A significant increase in SepSecS mRNA levels was observed in all of the brain tissues of chickens fed diets containing 1-5 mg/kg sodium selenite. Most strikingly, significant changes in SepSecS mRNA levels were not observed in neurons treated with Se. However, Se altered the SepSecS mRNA half-life in cells. These data suggest that Se could regulate SepSecS mRNA stability in the avian brain and that SepSecS plays an important role in Se homeostasis regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2033272010,"Background Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. It is unclear how county-level primary care physician (PCP) availability and socioeconomic deprivation affect the spatial and temporal variation of breast cancer incidence and mortality. Methods We used the 1988–2008 public-use county-based data from nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programs to analyze the temporal and spatial disparity of PCP availability and socioeconomic deprivation on early-stage incidence, advanced-stage incidence and breast cancer mortality. The spatio-temporal analysis was implemented by a novel structural additive modeling approach. Results Greater PCP availability was significantly associated with higher early-stage incidence, advanced-stage incidence and mortality during the entire study period while socioeconomic deprivation was significantly negatively associated with early-stage incidence, advanced-stage incidence, and mortality up to 1992. However, the observed influence of PCP availability and socioeconomic deprivation varied by county. Conclusions We showed important associations of PCP availability and socioeconomic deprivation with the three breast cancer indicators. However, the effect of these associations varied over time and across counties. The association of PCP availability and socioeconomic deprivation was stronger in selected counties."
https://openalex.org/W1983602725,"During activation of B cells to undergo class switching, B cell metabolism is increased, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased. ROS can oxidize DNA bases resulting in substrates for the DNA glycosylases Ogg1 and Nth1. Ogg1 and Nth1 excise oxidized bases, and nick the resulting abasic sites, forming single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) as intermediates during the repair process. In this study, we asked whether splenic B cells from mice deficient in these two enzymes would show altered class switching and decreased DNA breaks in comparison with wild-type mice. As the c-myc gene frequently recombines with the IgH S region in B cells induced to undergo class switching, we also analyzed the effect of deletion of these two glycosylases on DSBs in the c-myc gene. We did not detect a reduction in S region or c-myc DSBs or in class switching in splenic B cells from Ogg1- or Nth1-deficient mice or from mice deficient in both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2138147656,"Evidence has suggested that insulin resistance (IR) or high levels of glucocorticoids (GCs) may be linked with the pathogenesis and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although studies have shown that a high level of GCs results in IR, little is known about the molecular details that link GCs and IR in the context of AD. Abnormal phosphorylation of tau and activation of μ-calpain are two key events in the pathology of AD. Importantly, these two events are also related with GCs and IR. We therefore speculate that tau phosphorylation and μ-calpain activation may mediate the GCs-induced IR. Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 (pAkt) is commonly used as a marker for assessing IR. We employed two cell lines, wild-type HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing the longest human tau isoform (tau-441; HEK293/tau441 cells). We examined whether DEX, a synthetic GCs, induces tau phosphorylation and μ-calpain activation. If so, we examined whether the DEX-induced tau phosphorylation and μ-calpain activation mediate the DEX-induced inhibition on the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The results showed that DEX increased tau phosphorylation and induced tau-mediated μ-calpain activation. Furthermore, pre-treatment with LiCl prevented the effects of DEX on tau phosphorylation and μ-calpain activation. Finally, both LiCl pre-treatment and calpain inhibition prevented the DEX-induced inhibition on the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study suggests that the tau phosphorylation and μ-calpain activation mediate the DEX-induced inhibition on the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation."
