https://openalex.org/W2733154631,"Inflammatory gene expression following genotoxic cancer therapy is well documented, yet the events underlying its induction remain poorly understood. Inflammatory cytokines modify the tumour microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and are critical for both local and systemic (abscopal) tumour responses to radiotherapy. A poorly understood feature of these responses is the delayed onset (days), in contrast to the acute DNA-damage responses that occur in minutes to hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate-limiting steps that are essential for DNA-damage-induced inflammation. Here we show that cell cycle progression through mitosis following double-stranded DNA breaks leads to the formation of micronuclei, which precede activation of inflammatory signalling and are a repository for the pattern-recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-cGAS impaired interferon signalling. Moreover, STING loss prevented the regression of abscopal tumours in the context of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. These findings implicate temporal modulation of the cell cycle as an important consideration in the context of therapeutic strategies that combine genotoxic agents with immune checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2949118732,"The brain is a large-scale complex network whose workings rely on the interaction between its various regions. In the past few years, the organization of the human brain network has been studied extensively using concepts from graph theory, where the brain is represented as a set of nodes connected by edges. This representation of the brain as a connectome can be used to assess important measures that reflect its topological architecture. We have developed a freeware MatLab-based software (BRAPH–BRain Analysis using graPH theory) for connectivity analysis of brain networks derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. BRAPH allows building connectivity matrices, calculating global and local network measures, performing non-parametric permutations for group comparisons, assessing the modules in the network, and comparing the results to random networks. By contrast to other toolboxes, it allows performing longitudinal comparisons of the same patients across different points in time. Furthermore, even though a user-friendly interface is provided, the architecture of the program is modular (object-oriented) so that it can be easily expanded and customized. To demonstrate the abilities of BRAPH, we performed structural and functional graph theory analyses in two separate studies. In the first study, using MRI data, we assessed the differences in global and nodal network topology in healthy controls, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In the second study, using resting-state fMRI data, we compared healthy controls and Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2740394908,"RORγt and RORα are transcription factors of the RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR) family. They are expressed in Th17 cells and have been suggested to play a role in Th17 differentiation. Although RORγt signature genes have been characterized in mouse Th17 cells, detailed information on its transcriptional control in human Th17 cells is limited and even less is known about RORα signature genes which have not been reported in either human or mouse T cells. In this study, global gene expression of human CD4 T cells activated under Th17 skewing conditions was profiled by RNA sequencing. RORγt and RORα signature genes were identified in these Th17 cells treated with specific siRNAs to knock down RORγt or RORα expression. We have generated selective small molecule RORγt modulators and they were also utilized as pharmacological tools in RORγt signature gene identification. Our results showed that RORγt controlled the expression of a very selective number of genes in Th17 cells and most of them were regulated by RORα as well albeit a weaker influence. Key Th17 genes including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23R, CCL20 and CCR6 were shown to be regulated by both RORγt and RORα. Our results demonstrated an overlapping role of RORγt and RORα in human Th17 cell differentiation through regulation of a defined common set of Th17 genes. RORγt as a drug target for treatment of Th17 mediated autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis has been demonstrated recently in clinical trials. Our results suggest that RORα could be involved in same disease mechanisms and gene signatures identified in this report could be valuable biomarkers for tracking the pharmacodynamic effects of compounds that modulate RORγt or RORα activities in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2740535648,"Bacterial copper (Cu+) homeostasis enables both precise metallation of diverse cuproproteins and control of variable metal levels. To this end, protein networks mobilize Cu+ to cellular targets with remarkable specificity. However, the understanding of these processes is rather fragmented. Here, we use genome-wide transcriptomic analysis by RNA-Seq to characterize the response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to external 0.5 mm CuSO4, a condition that did not generate pleiotropic effects. Pre-steady-state (5-min) and steady-state (2-h) Cu+ fluxes resulted in distinct transcriptome landscapes. Cells quickly responded to Cu2+ stress by slowing down metabolism. This was restored once steady state was reached. Specific Cu+ homeostasis genes were strongly regulated in both conditions. Our system-wide analysis revealed induction of three Cu+ efflux systems (a P1B-ATPase, a porin, and a resistance-nodulation-division (RND) system) and of a putative Cu+-binding periplasmic chaperone and the unusual presence of two cytoplasmic CopZ proteins. Both CopZ chaperones could bind Cu+ with high affinity. Importantly, novel transmembrane transporters probably mediating Cu+ influx were among those largely repressed upon Cu+ stress. Compartmental Cu+ levels appear independently controlled; the cytoplasmic Cu+ sensor CueR controls cytoplasmic chaperones and plasma membrane transporters, whereas CopR/S responds to periplasmic Cu+. Analysis of ΔcopR and ΔcueR mutant strains revealed a CopR regulon composed of genes involved in periplasmic Cu+ homeostasis and its putative DNA recognition sequence. In conclusion, our study establishes a system-wide model of a network of sensors/regulators, soluble chaperones, and influx/efflux transporters that control the Cu+ levels in P. aeruginosa compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2739749456,"Crystallization of colloidal nanocrystals into superlattices represents a practical bottom-up process with which to create ordered metamaterials with emergent functionalities. With precise control over the size, shape and composition of individual nanocrystals, various single- and multi-component nanocrystal superlattices have been produced, the lattice structures and chemical compositions of which can be accurately engineered. Nanocrystal superlattices are typically prepared by carefully controlling the assembly process through solvent evaporation or destabilization or through DNA-guided crystallization. Slow solvent evaporation or cooling of nanocrystal solutions (over hours or days) is the key element for successful crystallization processes. Here we report the rapid growth (seconds) of micrometre-sized, face-centred-cubic, three-dimensional nanocrystal superlattices during colloidal synthesis at high temperatures (more than 230 degrees Celsius). Using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, we observe continuous growth of individual nanocrystals within the lattices, which results in simultaneous lattice expansion and fine nanocrystal size control due to the superlattice templates. Thermodynamic models demonstrate that balanced attractive and repulsive interparticle interactions dictated by the ligand coverage on nanocrystal surfaces and nanocrystal core size are responsible for the crystallization process. The interparticle interactions can also be controlled to form different superlattice structures, such as hexagonal close-packed lattices. The rational assembly of various nanocrystal systems into novel materials is thus facilitated for both fundamental research and for practical applications in the fields of magnetics, electronics and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2740466606,"The intestinal tract contains many commensal bacteria that modulate various physiological host functions. Dysbiosis of commensal bacteria triggers dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to the induction or aggravation of intestinal inflammation. To elucidate whether microRNA plays a role in commensal microbiome-dependent intestinal epithelial barrier regulation, we compared transcripts in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from conventional and germ-free mice and found that commensal bacteria induced the expression of miR-21-5p in IECs. miR-21-5p increased intestinal epithelial permeability and up-regulated ADP ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4), a small GTPase, in the IEC line Caco-2. We also found that ARF4 expression was up-regulated upon suppression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which are known miR-21-5p targets, by RNAi. Furthermore, ARF4 expression in epithelial cells of the large intestine was higher in conventional mice than in germ-free mice. ARF4 suppression in the IEC line increased the expression of tight junction proteins and decreased intestinal epithelial permeability. These results indicate that commensal microbiome-dependent miR-21-5p expression in IECs regulates intestinal epithelial permeability via ARF4, which may therefore represent a target for preventing or managing dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

https://openalex.org/W2740874620,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most preferred mammalian host used for the bio-pharmaceutical production. A major challenge in metabolic engineering is to balance the flux of the tuned heterogonous metabolic pathway and achieve efficient metabolic response in a mammalian cellular system. Pyruvate carboxylase is an important network element for the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolic pathway and efficiently contributes in enhancing the energy metabolism. The lactate accumulation in cell culture can be reduced by re-wiring of the pyruvate flux in engineered cells. In the present work, we over-expressed the yeast cytosolic pyruvate carboxylase (PYC2) enzyme in CHO cells to augment pyruvate flux towards the TCA cycle. The dual selection strategy is adopted for the screening and isolation of CHO clones containing varying number of PYC2 gene load and studied their cellular kinetics. The enhanced PYC2 expression has led to enhanced pyruvate flux which, thus, allowed reduced lactate accumulation up to 4 folds and significant increase in the cell density and culture longevity. With this result, engineered cells have shown a significant enhanced antibody expression up to 70% with improved product quality (~3 fold) as compared to the parental cells. The PYC2 engineering allowed overall improved cell performance with various advantages over parent cells in terms of pyruvate, glucose, lactate and cellular energy metabolism. This study provides a potential expression platform for a bio-therapeutic protein production in a controlled culture environment."
https://openalex.org/W2739942166,"Recently we identified hypoxia-inducible protein 2 (HIG2)/hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet–associated (HILPDA) as lipid droplet (LD) protein. Because HILPDA is highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, we examined its regulation and function in murine macrophages, compared it to the LD adipose differentiation-related protein (Adrp)/perilipin 2 (Plin2), and investigated its effects on atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E–deficient (ApoE−/−) mice. Tie2-Cre-driven Hilpda conditional knockout (cKO) did not affect viability, proliferation, and ATP levels in macrophages. Hilpda proved to be a target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. In contrast, Adrp/Plin2 was not induced by Hif-1. Hilpda localized to the endoplasmic reticulum–LD interface, the site of LD formation. Hypoxic lipid accumulation and storage of oxidized LDL, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides were abolished in Hilpda cKO macrophages, independent of the glycolytic switch, fatty acid or lipoprotein uptake. Hilpda depletion reduced resistance against lipid overload and increased production of reactive oxygen species after reoxygenation. LPS-stimulated prostaglandin-E2 production was dysregulated in macrophages, demonstrating the substrate buffer and reservoir function of LDs for eicosanoid production. In ApoE−/− Hilpda cKO mice, total aortic plaque area, plaque macrophages and vascular Vegf expression were reduced. Thus, macrophage Hilpda is crucial to foam-cell formation and lipid deposition, and to controlled prostaglandin-E2 production. By these means Hilpda promotes lesion formation and progression of atherosclerosis.—Maier, A., Wu, H., Cordasic, N., Oefner, P., Dietel, B., Thiele, C., Weidemann, A., Eckardt, K.-U., Warnecke, C.

https://openalex.org/W2740412125,"The effort required to obtain a rewarding outcome is an important factor in decision-making. Describing the reward devaluation by increasing effort intensity is substantial to understanding human preferences, because every action and choice that we make is in itself effortful. To investigate how reward valuation is affected by physical and cognitive effort, we compared mathematical discounting functions derived from research on discounting. Seven discounting models were tested across three different reward magnitudes. To test the models, data were collected from a total of 114 participants recruited from the general population. For one-parameter models (hyperbolic, exponential, and parabolic), the data were explained best by the exponential model as given by a percentage of explained variance. However, after introducing an additional parameter, data obtained in the cognitive and physical effort conditions were best described by the power function model. Further analysis, using the second order Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, which account for model complexity, allowed us to identify the best model among all tested. We found that the power function best described the data, which corresponds to conventional analyses based on the R2 measure. This supports the conclusion that the function best describing reward devaluation by physical and cognitive effort is a concave one and is different from those that describe delay or probability discounting. In addition, consistent magnitude effects were observed that correspond to those in delay discounting research."
https://openalex.org/W2740390628,"Conversion of tropical rainforests into plantations fundamentally alters ecological niches of animal species. Generalist predators such as centipedes (Chilopoda) may be able to persist in converted ecosystems due to their ability to adapt and switch to alternative prey populations. We investigated variations in community composition and trophic niches of soil and litter living centipedes in a range of ecosystems including rainforests, jungle rubber agroforests, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in two landscapes in Sumatra, Indonesia. Including information on environmental factors in the soil and litter habitat, we explored drivers shaping ecological niches of soil living invertebrate predators in one of the world's hotspots of rainforest conversion. Conversion of rainforests into agroforests and plantations was associated with a marked change in the composition of centipede communities. However, irrespective of major differences in habitat characteristics, changes in total abundances were small and the overall diversity and biomass of centipedes was similar in each of the systems investigated, suggesting that the number of ecological niches for this group of predators remains unchanged. By using stable isotope analysis (15N and 13C), we investigated trophic niche shifts of the centipede community; lower δ13C values of centipedes in oil palm plantations as compared to other ecosystems suggests that centipedes switch from decomposer prey to other prey, presumably understory associated herbivores, due to reduced availability of litter associated prey species. The results suggest that the ability to utilize alternative prey is a key feature enabling invertebrate predators to persist in ecosystems undergoing major structural changes due to anthropogenic land use change."
https://openalex.org/W2134003629,"Co-morbid major depression is a significant problem among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or coronary heart disease and this negatively impacts quality of life. Subthreshold depression is the most important risk factor for the development of major depression. Given the highly significant association between depression and adverse health outcomes and the limited capacity for depression treatment in primary care, there is an urgent need for interventions that successfully prevent the transition from subthreshold depression into a major depressive disorder. Nurse led stepped-care is a promising way to accomplish this. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led indicated stepped-care program to prevent major depression among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or coronary heart disease in primary care who also have subthreshold depressive symptoms. An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside a cluster-randomized controlled trial in approximately thirty general practices in the Netherlands. Randomization takes place at the level of participating practice nurses. We aim to include 236 participants who will either receive a nurse-led indicated stepped-care program for depressive symptoms or care as usual. The stepped-care program consists of four sequential but flexible treatment steps: 1) watchful waiting, 2) guided self-help treatment, 3) problem solving treatment and 4) referral to the general practitioner. The primary clinical outcome measure is the cumulative incidence of major depressive disorder as measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Secondary outcomes include severity of depressive symptoms, quality of life, anxiety and physical outcomes. Costs will be measured from a societal perspective and include health care utilization, medication and lost productivity costs. Measurements will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The intervention being investigated is expected to prevent new cases of depression among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or coronary heart disease and subthreshold depression, with subsequent beneficial effects on quality of life, clinical outcomes and health care costs. When proven cost-effective, the program provides a viable treatment option in the Dutch primary care system. Dutch Trial Register NTR3715"
https://openalex.org/W2741801622,"Current research on valvular heart repair has focused on tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) because of its potential to grow similarly to native heart valves. Decellularized xenografts are a promising solution; however, host recellularization remains challenging. In this study, decellularized porcine aortic valves were implanted into the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) of sheep to investigate recellularization potential. Porcine aortic valves, decellularized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), were sterilized by supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) and implanted into the RVOT of five juvenile polypay sheep for 5 months (n = 5). During implantation, functionality of the valves was assessed by serial echocardiography, blood tests, and right heart pulmonary artery catheterization measurements. The explanted valves were characterized through gross examination, mechanical characterization, and immunohistochemical analysis including cell viability, phenotype, proliferation, and extracellular matrix generation. Gross examination of the valve cusps demonstrated the absence of thrombosis. Bacterial and fungal stains were negative for pathogenic microbes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of myofibroblast-like cell infiltration with formation of new collagen fibrils and the existence of an endothelial layer at the surface of the explant. Analysis of cell phenotype and morphology showed no lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. Tensile mechanical testing of valve cusps revealed an increase in stiffness while strength was maintained during implantation. The increased tensile stiffness confirms the recellularization of the cusps by collagen synthesizing cells. The current study demonstrated the feasibility of the trans-species implantation of a non-fixed decellularized porcine aortic valve into the RVOT of sheep. The implantation resulted in recellularization of the valve with sufficient hemodynamic function for the 5-month study. Thus, the study supports a potential role for use of a TEHV for the treatment of valve disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2740228197,"The increase in protein activity and upregulation of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a hallmark of cardiac stress and heart failure. Inhibition of GRK2 improved cardiac function and survival and diminished cardiac remodeling in various animal heart failure models. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of GRK2 on cardiac hypertrophy and dissect potential molecular mechanisms. In mice we observed increased GRK2 mRNA and protein levels following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Conditional GRK2 knockout mice showed attenuated hypertrophic response with preserved ventricular geometry 6 weeks after TAC operation compared to wild-type animals. In isolated neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes stimulation with angiotensin II and phenylephrine enhanced GRK2 expression leading to enhanced signaling via protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), consecutively inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), such promoting nuclear accumulation and activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by in vitro GRK2 overexpression increased the cytosolic interaction of GRK2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ). Moreover, inhibition of PI3Kγ as well as GRK2 knock down prevented Akt activation resulting in halted NFAT activity and reduced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Our data show that enhanced GRK2 expression triggers cardiac hypertrophy by GRK2-PI3Kγ mediated Akt phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of GSK3β, resulting in enhanced NFAT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2741415960,"The analysis of the backscattered statistics using the Nakagami parameter is an emerging ultrasound technique for assessing hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Previous studies indicated that the echo amplitude distribution of a normal liver follows the Rayleigh distribution (the Nakagami parameter m is close to 1). However, using different frequencies may change the backscattered statistics of normal livers. This study explored the frequency dependence of the backscattered statistics in human livers and then discussed the sources of ultrasound scattering in the liver. A total of 30 healthy participants were enrolled to undergo a standard care ultrasound examination on the liver, which is a natural model containing diffuse and coherent scatterers. The liver of each volunteer was scanned from the right intercostal view to obtain image raw data at different central frequencies ranging from 2 to 3.5 MHz. Phantoms with diffuse scatterers only were also made to perform ultrasound scanning using the same protocol for comparisons with clinical data. The Nakagami parameter-frequency correlation was evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. The median and interquartile range of the Nakagami parameter obtained from livers was 1.00 (0.98-1.05) for 2 MHz, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for 2.3 MHz, 0.87 (0.84-0.92) for 2.5 MHz, 0.82 (0.77-0.88) for 3.3 MHz, and 0.81 (0.76-0.88) for 3.5 MHz. The Nakagami parameter decreased with the increasing central frequency (r = -0.67, p < 0.0001). However, the effect of ultrasound frequency on the statistical distribution of the backscattered envelopes was not found in the phantom results (r = -0.147, p = 0.0727). The current results demonstrated that the backscattered statistics of normal livers is frequency-dependent. Moreover, the coherent scatterers may be the primary factor to dominate the frequency dependence of the backscattered statistics in a liver."
https://openalex.org/W2741812317,"Background We recently developed and characterized a standardized and clinical grade human Platelet Lysate (hPL) that constitutes an advantageous substitute for fetal bovine serum (FBS) for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) expansion required in cell therapy procedures, avoiding xenogenic risks (virological and immunological) and ethical issues. Because of the progressive use of pathogen-reduced (PR) labile blood components, and the requirement of ensuring the viral safety of raw materials for cell therapy products, we evaluated the impact of the novel procedure known as THERAFLEX UV-Platelets for pathogen reduction on hPL quality (growth factors content) and efficacy (as a medium supplement for hMSC expansion). This technology is based on short-wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) that induces non-reversible damages in DNA and RNA of pathogens while preserving protein structures and functions, and has the main advantage of not needing the addition of any photosensitizing additives (that might secondarily interfere with hMSCs). Methodology / Principal findings We applied the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets procedure on fresh platelet concentrates (PCs) suspended in platelet additive solution and prepared hPL from these treated PCs. We compared the quality and efficacy of PR-hPL with the corresponding non-PR ones. We found no impact on the content of five cytokines tested (EGF, bFGF, PDGF-AB, VEGF and IGF-1) but a significant decrease in TGF-ß1 (-21%, n = 11, p<0.01). We performed large-scale culture of hMSCs from bone marrow (BM) during three passages and showed that hPL or PR-hPL at 8% triggered comparable BM-hMSC proliferation as FBS at 10% plus bFGF. Moreover, after proliferation of hMSCs in an hPL- or PR-hPL-containing medium, their profile of membrane marker expression, their clonogenic potential and immunosuppressive properties were maintained, in comparison with BM-hMSCs cultured under FBS conditions. The potential to differentiate towards the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages of hMSCs cultured in parallel in the three conditions also remained identical. Conclusion / Significance We demonstrated the feasibility of using UV-C-treated platelets to subsequently obtain pathogen-reduced hPL, while preserving its optimal quality and efficacy for hMSC expansion in cell therapy applications."
https://openalex.org/W2739877111,"Background Malignant gliomas are highly invasive, difficult to treat, and account for 2% of cancer deaths worldwide. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) comprises the most common and aggressive intracranial tumor. The study hypothesis is to investigate the modification of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) efficacy by mild hypothermia leads to increased glioma cell kill while protecting normal neuronal structures. Methods Photosensitizer accumulation and PDT efficacy in vitro were quantified in various glioma cell lines, primary rat neurons, and astrocytes. In vivo studies were carried out in healthy brain and RG2 glioma of naïve Fischer rats. Hypothermia was induced at 1 hour pre- to 2 hours post-PDT, with ALA-PpIX accumulation and PDT treatments effects on tumor and normal brain PDT quantified using optical spectroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, MRI, and survival studies, respectively. Findings In vitro studies demonstrated significantly improved post-PDT survival in primary rat neuronal cells. Rat in vivo studies confirmed a neuroprotective effect to hypothermia following PpIX mediated PDT by T2 mapping at day 10, reflecting edema/inflammation volume reduction. Mild hypothermia increased PpIX fluorescence in tumors five-fold, and the median post-PDT rat survival time (8.5 days normothermia; 14 days hypothermia). Histology and immunohistochemistry show close to complete cellular protection in normal brain structures under hypothermia. Conclusions The benefits of hypothermia on both normal neuronal tissue as well as increased PpIX fluorescence and RG2 induced rat survival strongly suggest a role for hypothermia in photonics-based surgical techniques, and that a hypothermic intervention could lead to considerable patient outcome improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2739930313,"Gliomas are the most frequent type of primary brain tumours. Low grade gliomas (LGGs, WHO grade II gliomas) may grow very slowly for the long periods of time, however they inevitably cause death due to the phenomenon known as the malignant transformation. This refers to the transition of LGGs to more aggressive forms of high grade gliomas (HGGs, WHO grade III and IV gliomas). In this paper we propose a mathematical model describing the spatio-temporal transition of LGGs into HGGs. Our modelling approach is based on two cellular populations with transitions between them being driven by the tumour microenvironment transformation occurring when the tumour cell density grows beyond a critical level. We show that the proposed model describes real patient data well. We discuss the relationship between patient prognosis and model parameters. We approximate tumour radius and velocity before malignant transformation as well as estimate the onset of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2741698468,"The transition of intrinsically disordered, monomeric α-synuclein into β-sheet–rich oligomers and fibrils is associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Fibrillar aggregates possessing distinct structures that differ in toxicity have been observed in different pathological phenotypes. Understanding the mechanism of the formation of various fibril polymorphs with differing cytotoxic effects is essential for determining how the aggregation reaction could be modulated to favor nontoxic fibrils over toxic fibrils. In this study, two morphologically different α-synuclein fibrils, one helical and the other ribbon-like, are shown to form together. Surprisingly, a widely used small molecule for probing aggregation reactions, thioflavin T (ThT), was found to tune the structural heterogeneity found in the fibrils. The ribbon-like fibrils formed in the presence of ThT were found to have a longer structural core than the helical fibrils formed in the absence of ThT. The ribbon-like fibrils are also more toxic to cells. By facilitating the formation of ribbon-like fibrils over helical fibrils, ThT reduced the extent of fibril polymorphism. This study highlights the role of a small molecule such as ThT in selectively favoring the formation of a specific type of fibril by binding to aggregates formed early on one of multiple pathways, thereby altering the structural core and external morphology of the fibrils formed."
https://openalex.org/W2741856347,"The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) on anaerobic and aerobic capacity and swimming performance in well-trained swimmers. Sixteen male swimmers were randomly divided into a hypoxia (H) group (n = 8), which trained in a normobaric hypoxia environment, and a control (C) group (n = 8), which exercised under normoxic conditions. However, one participant left the study without explanation. During the experiment group H trained on land twice per week in simulated hypoxia (FiO2 = 15.5%, corresponding to 2,500 m a.s.l); however, they conducted swim training in normoxic conditions. Group C performed the same training program under normoxic conditions. The training program included four weekly microcyles, followed by three days of recovery. During practice sessions on land, the swimmers performed 30 second sprints on an arm-ergometer, alternating with two minute high intensity intervals on a lower limb cycle ergometer. The results showed that the training on land caused a significant (p<0.05) increase in absolute maximal workload (WRmax) by 7.4% in group H and by 3.2% in group C and relative values of VO2max by 6.9% in group H and 3.7% in group C. However, absolute values of VO2max were not significantly changed. Additionally, a significant (p<0.05) increase in mean power (Pmean) during the first (11.7%) and second (11.9%) Wingate tests was only observed in group H. The delta values of lactate concentration (ΔLA) after both Wingate tests were significantly (p<0.05) higher in comparison to baseline levels by 28.8% in group H. Opposite changes were observed in delta values of blood pH (ΔpH) after both Wingate tests in group H, with a significant decrease in values of ΔpH by 33.3%. The IHT caused a significant (p<0.05) improvement in 100m and 200m swimming performance, by 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively in group H. Training in normoxia (group C), resulted in a significant (p<0.05) improvement of swimming performance at 100m and 200m, by 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. In conclusion, the most important finding of this study includes a significant improvement in anaerobic capacity and swimming performance after high-intensity IHT. However, this training protocol had no effect on absolute values of VO2max and hematological variables."
https://openalex.org/W2739686877,"Gene coexpression networks are a useful tool for summarizing transcriptomic data and providing insight into patterns of gene regulation in a variety of species. Though there has been considerable interest in studying the evolution of network topology across species, less attention has been paid to the relationship between network position and patterns of molecular evolution. Here, we generated coexpression networks from publicly available expression data for seven flowering plant taxa (Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Populus spp., Solanum lycopersicum, Vitis spp., and Zea mays) to investigate the relationship between network position and rates of molecular evolution. We found a significant negative correlation between network connectivity and rates of molecular evolution, with more highly connected (i.e., “hub”) genes having significantly lower nonsynonymous substitution rates and dN/dS ratios compared to less highly connected (i.e., “peripheral”) genes across the taxa surveyed. These findings suggest that more centrally located hub genes are, on average, subject to higher levels of evolutionary constraint than are genes located on the periphery of gene coexpression networks. The consistency of this result across disparate taxa suggests that it holds for flowering plants in general, as opposed to being a species-specific phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2742141001,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is the tendency to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening and having negative consequences, resulting in feelings of distress and anxiety. IU has been linked to a number of anxiety disorders, and anxiety felt in the face of uncertainty may result in maladaptive behaviors such as impulsive decision making. Although there is strong evidence that anxiety and impulsivity are risk factors for addiction, there is a paucity of research examining the role of IU in this disorder. The rate of opioid addiction, in particular, has been rising steadily in recent years, which necessitates deeper understanding of risk factors in order to develop effective prevention and treatment methods. The current study tested for the first time whether opioid-dependent adults are less tolerant of uncertainty compared to a healthy comparison group. Opioid dependent patients undergoing methadone maintenance therapy (n = 114) and healthy comparisons (n = 69) completed the following scales: Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, the Barrett Impulsivity Scale, and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Analysis revealed that these measures were positively correlated with each other and that opioid-dependent patients had significantly higher IU scores. Regression analysis revealed that anxiety mediated the relationship between IU and impulsivity. Hierarchical moderation regression found an interaction between addiction status and impulsivity on IU scores in that the relationship between these variables was only observed in the patient group. Findings suggest that IU is a feature of addiction but does not necessarily play a unique role. Further research is needed to explore the complex relationship between traits and how they may contribute to the development and maintenance of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2739962352,"The present studies were undertaken to develop solvent-free solid dispersions (SDs) for poorly soluble anti-inflammatory drugs mefenamic acid (MA) and flufenamic acid (FFA) in order to enhance their in vitro dissolution rate and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects. The SDs of MA and FFA were prepared using microwaves irradiation (MW) technique. Different carriers such as Pluronic F127® (PL), Eudragit EPO® (EPO), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) and Gelucire 50/13 (GLU) were used for the preparation of SDs. Prepared MW irradiated SDs were characterized physicochemically using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The physicochemical characteristics and drug release profile of SDs were compared with pure drugs. The results of DSC, TGA, FT-IR, PXRD and SEM showed that SDs were successfully prepared. In vitro dissolution rate of MA and FFA was remarkably enhanced by SDs in comparison with pure MA and FFA. The SDs of MA and FFA prepared using PEG 400 showed higher drug release profile in comparison with those prepared using PL, EPO or GLU. The dissolution efficiency for MA-PEG SD and FFA-PEG SD was obtained as 61.40 and 59.18%, respectively. Optimized SDs were also evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory effects in male Wistar rats. The results showed significant % inhibition by MA-PEG (87.74% after 4 h) and FFA-PEG SDs (81.76% after 4 h) in comparison with pure MA (68.09% after 4 h) and pure FFA (55.27% after 4 h) (P<0.05). These results suggested that MW irradiated SDs of MA and FFA could be successfully used for the enhancement of in vitro dissolution rate and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of both drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2740035835,"Since the relative age effect (RAE) characterizes a problem in all age categories of alpine ski racing and soccer and the fact that, yet, to date the underlying factors have not been well investigated, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of the biological maturity status on the RAE among youth alpine ski racers (YSR) and soccer players (SP). In total, 183 male and female YSR selected for national final races and 423 male SP selected for Elite Youth Development Centres were investigated. Additionally, a comparison group of 413 non-athletes was evaluated. The birth months were split into four relative age quarters. The biological maturity status was assessed by the age at peak height velocity (APHV) method; according to the M±SD of the comparison group, the athletes were divided into normal, early and late maturing. Chi2-tests indicated a significant RAE among YSR (χ2(3,N = 183) = 18.0; p<0.001; ω = 0.31) and SP (χ2(3,N = 423) = 33.1; p<0.001; ω = 0.28). In total, only a small number of late maturing athletes were present (0.5–2.3%). Among relatively younger athletes, high percentages of early maturing athletes were found (43.1–43.3%). The findings indicate that relatively younger and less mature athletes are marginalized or totally excluded in alpine ski racing and soccer. Thus, selection criteria in both sports are effectively based on early biological development and relatively older age, both of which should be considered in future in the talent selection process. In this context, the easy feasible method of assessing the APHV can be used."
https://openalex.org/W2740278081,"Background The approval of Sativex for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity opened a new opportunity to many patients. In Italy, the healthcare payer can be fully reimbursed by the involved pharma company with the cost of treatment for patients not responding after a 4 week (28 days) trial period (Payment by Results, PbR), and 50% reimbursed with the cost of 6 weeks (42 days) treatment for other patients discontinuing (Cost Sharing, CS). The aim of our study was to describe the Sativex discontinuation profile from a large population of spasticity treated Italian MS patients. Methods We collected data of patients from 30 MS centres across the country starting Sativex between January 2014 and February 2015. Data were collected from the mandatory Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) web-registry. Predictors of treatment discontinuation were assessed using a multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis. Results During the observation period 631 out of 1597 (39.5%) patients discontinued Sativex. The Kaplan-Meier estimates curve showed that 333 patients (20.8%) discontinued treatment at 4 weeks while 422 patients (26.4%) discontinued at 6 weeks. We found after adjusted modeling that a higher NRS score at T1 (adjHR 2.23, 95% 2.07–2.41, p<0.001) and a lower baseline NRS score (adjHR 0.51 95% CI 0.46–0.56, p<0.001) were predictive of treatment discontinuation. Conclusion These data show that the first 6 weeks are useful in identifying those patients in which Sativex could be effective, thus avoiding the cost of longer term evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4248714393,"Purpose Given the public health significance of poorly treatable co-morbid major depressive disorders (MDD) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we need to investigate whether strategies to prevent the development of major depression could reduce its burden of disease. We therefore evaluated the effectiveness of a stepped-care program for subthreshold depression in comparison with usual care in patients with DM2 and/or CHD. Methods A cluster randomized controlled trial, with 27 primary care centers serving as clusters. A total of 236 DM2 and/or CHD patients with subthreshold depression (nine item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥ 6, no current MDD according to DSM-IV criteria) were allocated to the intervention group (N = 96) or usual care group (n = 140). The stepped-care program was delivered by trained practice nurses during one year and consisted of four sequential treatment steps: watchful waiting, guided self-help, problem solving treatment and referral to the general practitioner. The primary outcome was the 12-month cumulative incidence of MDD as measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Secondary outcomes included severity of depression (measured by PHQ-9) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Results Of 236 patients (mean age, 67,5 (SD 10) years; 54.7% men), 210 (89%) completed the MINI at 12 months. The cumulative incidence of MDD was 9 of 89 (10.1%) participants in the intervention group and 12 of 121 (9.9%) participants in the usual care group. We found no statistically significant overall effect of the intervention (OR = 1.21; 95% confidence interval (0.12 to 12.41)) and there were no statistically significant differences in the course or severity of depressive symptoms between the two groups. Conclusions This study suggest that Step-Dep was not more effective in preventing MDD than usual care in a primary care population with DM2 and/or CHD and subthreshold depression."
https://openalex.org/W2740332850,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae stores iron in the vacuole, which is a major resistance mechanism against iron toxicity. One key protein involved in vacuolar iron storage is the iron importer Ccc1, which facilitates iron entry into the vacuole. Transcription of the CCC1 gene is largely regulated by the binding of iron–sulfur clusters to the activator domain of the transcriptional activator Yap5. Additional evidence, however, suggests that Yap5-independent transcriptional activation of CCC1 also contributes to iron resistance. Here, we demonstrate that components of the signaling pathway involving the low-glucose sensor Snf1 regulate CCC1 transcription and iron resistance. We found that SNF1 deletion acts synergistically with YAP5 deletion to regulate CCC1 transcription and iron resistance. A kinase-dead mutation of Snf1 lowered iron resistance as did deletion of SNF4, which encodes a partner protein of Snf1. Deletion of all three alternative partners of Snf1 encoded by SIT1, SIT2, and GAL83 decreased both CCC1 transcription and iron resistance. The Snf1 complex is known to activate the general stress transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4. We show that Msn2 and Msn4 contribute to Snf1-mediated CCC1 transcription. Of note, SNF1 deletion in combination with MSN2 and MSN4 deletion resulted in additive effects on CCC1 transcription, suggesting that other activators contribute to the regulation of CCC1 transcription. In conclusion, we show that yeast have developed multiple transcriptional mechanisms to regulate Ccc1 expression and to protect against high cytosolic iron toxicity.

In conclusion, we show that yeast have developed multiple transcriptional mechanisms to regulate Ccc1 expression and to protect against high cytosolic iron toxicity. Regulation of cellular iron toxicity in eukaryotes is effected by regulation of iron acquisition and/or iron storage. Fungi and plants store iron in the vacuole, and vacuolar iron storage is critical for maintaining cytosolic iron levels. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iron export from the vacuole is mediated by iron transporters Fet5/Fth1 and Smf3. These genes are regulated by the low iron-sensing transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Outten C.E. Albetel A.N. Iron sensing and regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: ironing out the mechanistic details.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 2Martínez-Pastor M.T. Perea-García A. Puig S. Mechanisms of iron sensing and regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2017; 33: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression of these transporters, in concert with cell surface iron transporters, leads to iron influx into the cytosol. In contrast, when iron levels are replete, the low-iron transcription response is curtailed, and there is an induction of a high-iron transcriptional response. The number of genes responding to high iron is more limited than the number responding to low iron. Most notable is CCC1, which encodes the vacuolar iron importer (3Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. CCC1 is a transporter that mediates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Yeast with a functioning Ccc1 are highly resistant to iron toxicity, whereas loss of Ccc1 results in a dramatic increase in iron toxicity in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ccc1 is highly regulated both by transcriptional activation and by mRNA degradation. The activity of Ccc1 is affected by changes in oxidant levels in which oxidants, in a manner still yet to be defined, can increase Ccc1 transport activity (4Li L. Murdock G. Bagley D. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Genetic dissection of a mitochondria-vacuole signaling pathway in yeast reveals a link between chronic oxidative stress and vacuolar iron transport.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10232-10242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At the post-transcriptional level, the stability of CCC1 mRNA is reduced through the binding of Cth1 and Cth2 to elements in the CCC1 mRNA 3′-untranslated region. CTH1 and CTH2 are transcriptionally induced by activation of the low-iron transcriptional sensors Aft1 and Aft2 (5Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Coordinated remodeling of cellular metabolism during iron deficiency through targeted mRNA degradation.Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Thus, under low-iron conditions, import of iron from cytosol to vacuole is reduced, leading to an increase in cytosolic iron. This coordination of the low- and high-iron responses also extends to the transcriptional regulation of CCC1, which occurs through the transcriptional activator Yap5 (6Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Yap5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper stress response family of transcriptional activators (7Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Yap, a novel family of eight bZIP proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with distinct biological functions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although Yap5 is not related to Aft1/Aft2 by sequence, like Aft1/Aft2, transcription mediated by Yap5 is regulated by Fe–S clusters. In the presence of high levels of mitochondrially produced Fe–S clusters, promoter-bound Yap5 is activated, whereas Aft1 is evicted from the promoters of target genes and is exported to the cytosol (8Li L. Miao R. Bertram S. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. A role for iron-sulfur clusters in the regulation of transcription factor Yap5-dependent high iron transcriptional responses in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35709-35721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fe–S cluster synthesis, resulting in part from decreased iron availability, Aft1 is translocated to the nucleus and induces gene transcription, whereas Yap5-induced transcription is terminated. Thus, both the low- and high-iron transcriptional activators coordinate their response to the same small iron-dependent product. That is, Aft1/Aft2 is activated by the absence of Fe–S clusters (9Poor C.B. Wegner S.V. Li H. Dlouhy A.C. Schuermann J.P. Sanishvili R. Hinshaw J.R. Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Outten C.E. He C. Molecular mechanism and structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae iron regulator Aft2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas Yap5 is activated by the presence of Fe–S clusters (10Rietzschel N. Pierik A.J. Bill E. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. The basic leucine zipper stress response regulator Yap5 senses high-iron conditions by coordination of [2Fe-2S] clusters.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examination of both iron toxicity and CCC1 transcription indicates, however, that there are other transcriptional activators besides Yap5 that affect CCC1. Deletion of YAP5 decreases iron resistance of yeast but not to the same extent as deletion of CCC1 (6Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Rietzschel N.

The role of the Yap5 transcription factor in remodeling gene expression in response to Fe bioavailability.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e37434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, iron-dependent transcription of CCC1 occurs in the absence of Yap5, albeit to a decreased extent. Here we report that the low-glucose sensor Snf1 plays a role in the regulation of CCC1 transcription. Deletion of SNF1 renders cells sensitive to iron toxicity by affecting CCC1 transcription. Although some of that effect can be ascribed to the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, deletion of SNF1 has an additive effect with deletion of MSN2/MSN4 indicating the existence of further transcription factors involved in CCC1 transcription. The vacuolar iron importer Ccc1 is the principal component of high-iron resistance in yeast as deletion of CCC1 results in a dramatic decrease in cellular iron resistance. Yap5 is a major transcriptional activator of CCC1 (6Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Deletion of YAP5 results in a decrease in iron resistance but as shown here and by others (10Rietzschel N. Pierik A.J. Bill E. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. The basic leucine zipper stress response regulator Yap5 senses high-iron conditions by coordination of [2Fe-2S] clusters.Mol. Cell.

The role of the Yap5 transcription factor in remodeling gene expression in response to Fe bioavailability.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e37434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) not to the same extent as does deletion of CCC1. This result indicates that CCC1 can be regulated by other factors. To determine what other genes could affect CCC1 expression, we considered the fact that the low- and high-iron regulons are regulated coordinately, albeit inversely (8Li L. Miao R. Bertram S. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. A role for iron-sulfur clusters in the regulation of transcription factor Yap5-dependent high iron transcriptional responses in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35709-35721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Conditions that increase the low-iron regulon (iron availability and Fe–S cluster synthesis) decrease the high-iron regulon and vice versa. Haurie et al. (12Haurie V. Boucherie H. Sagliocco F. The Snf1 protein kinase controls the induction of genes of the iron uptake pathway at the diauxic shift in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45391-45396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that the Aft1-dependent transcription was affected by Snf1, a major component of the glucose-sensing apparatus in yeast. Based on this observation, we examined whether deletion of SNF1 affected iron toxicity. Deletion of SNF1 decreased iron resistance in two different yeast backgrounds (W303 and S288c) (Fig. 1A). Deletion of SNF1 in a Δyap5 strain had an additive effect and led to a further decrease in iron resistance, although we note that the decrease was not to the same extent as deletion of CCC1 (Fig. 1B). The effect of SNF1 on iron resistance, however, was dependent on expression of CCC1 as an SNF1 deletion in a Δccc1 strain did not show effects different from deletion of CCC1 (Fig. 1C). We then examined the effect of SNF1 on transcription of CCC1 using a β-galactosidase reporter construct containing the CCC1 promoter (CCC1-lacZ). As shown previously, deletion of YAP5 decreased the iron-dependent transcription of CCC1 compared with iron-treated wild-type cells (6Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Deletion of SNF1 in Δyap5 cells resulted in a lowering in iron-dependent expression of the CCC1-lacZ activity, which was restored by transformation with an SNF1-containing plasmid (Fig. 2A). We confirmed the effect of SNF1 on CCC1 transcription by RT-PCR. Deletion of both YAP5 and SNF1 resulted in a severe cutback in CCC1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Transformation of Δsnf1Δyap5 cells with an SNF1 plasmid resulted in increased CCC1 mRNA. Changes in CCC1 mRNA resulted in concomitant changes in Ccc1 protein levels. The levels of Ccc1 protein were greatly reduced in Δyap5 cells (Fig. 2C) and were near undetectable in Δyap5Δsnf1 cells, whereas in Δyap5Δsnf1 cells transformed with a SNF1 plasmid, Ccc1 levels were low but detectable (Fig. 2D). There are eight homologous YAP genes in which YAP1 is most noted for being an oxidant-response gene (7Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Yap, a novel family of eight bZIP proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with distinct biological functions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Overexpression of some of the YAP genes can induce CCC1 expression in Δyap5 cells (10Rietzschel N. Pierik A.J. Bill E. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. The basic leucine zipper stress response regulator Yap5 senses high-iron conditions by coordination of [2Fe-2S] clusters.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible that SNF1 is affecting the expression of the other YAP genes, which may bind to the Yap site in the CCC1 promoter and induce transcription. To test this possibility, we transformed cells with a plasmid containing a mutated CCC1 promoter that lacks the critical Yap-binding site, as deletion of the ATG-proximal site abrogated Yap5-induced transcription (6Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transformation of wild-type cells with a Yap-mutated CCC1-lacZ reporter construct resulted in a decrease in iron-dependent CCC1-lacZ activity (Fig. 3A). The level of activity was similar to that seen in Δyap5 cells expressing the same Yap-mutated CCC1-lacZ. In contrast, CCC1-lacZ activity was decreased in Yap-mutated CCC1-lacZ-containing Δsnf1 cells compared with Δyap5 cells, and there was only a slight decrease in activity in yap5Δsnf1 cells. These results suggest that Snf1-mediated transcription of CCC1 is independent of Yap5 or is independent of the Yap-binding sites. The finding that deletion of SNF1 and YAP5 dramatically restricted iron-dependent CCC1 expression suggests that the other Yap homologues expressed at endogenous levels have little effect on iron-dependent transcription of CCC1. Many of the YAP genes are involved in resistance to oxidant conditions. CCC1 is required for iron resistance under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (13Lin H. Li L. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Genetic and biochemical analysis of high iron toxicity in yeast: iron toxicity is due to the accumulation of cytosolic iron and occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3851-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and deletion of YAP5 affects both aerobic and anaerobic iron resistance. Based on this result, we examined whether Snf1-mediated CCC1 expression was necessary to protect cells from iron toxicity under anaerobic conditions. Similar to Yap5, SNF1 was required under anaerobic conditions to effect iron resistance (Fig. 3B). This observation rules out a role for oxygen-based signaling in the SNF1-mediated regulation of CCC1 transcription. The transcriptional activation of CCC1 by Yap5 requires that Yap5 bind Fe–S clusters (8Li L. Miao R. Bertram S. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. A role for iron-sulfur clusters in the regulation of transcription factor Yap5-dependent high iron transcriptional responses in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35709-35721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Rietzschel N. Pierik A.J. Bill E. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. The basic leucine zipper stress response regulator Yap5 senses high-iron conditions by coordination of [2Fe-2S] clusters.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutations that affect mitochondrial Fe–S cluster synthesis reduce the transcription of CCC1 and dramatically increase iron sensitivity. To determine whether loss of SNF1-dependent iron resistance is similarly affected by Fe–S cluster synthesis, we examined the effect of a deletion of ISU1. Isu1 is a component in the mitochondrial Fe–S cluster synthetic pathway. Isu1 is one of two Fe–S scaffold proteins, and deletion of ISU1 results in decreased Fe–S cluster synthesis, induction of the low-iron transcriptional response (14Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Evidence for a conserved system for iron metabolism in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and decreased CCC1 transcription due to reduced Yap5-mediated activation (8Li L. Miao R. Bertram S. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. A role for iron-sulfur clusters in the regulation of transcription factor Yap5-dependent high iron transcriptional responses in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35709-35721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Deletion of ISU1 resulted in decreased iron resistance (Fig. 4A). We note that the decrease in iron resistance due to loss of ISU1 was relatively severe. There are several reasons for this, including decreased Yap5-induced expression of CCC1 and of TYW1, which encodes a Fe–S cluster-containing protein that like other Fe–S cluster-containing proteins can act as an “iron sink” (15Li L. Jia X. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 protein-regulated transcription of the TYW1 gene protects yeast from high iron toxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38488-38497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, decreased Fe–S cluster synthesis induces the low-iron Aft1 transcriptional response that can affect iron toxicity through expression of Cth1 and Cth2, which destabilizes CCC1 mRNA (5Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Coordinated remodeling of cellular metabolism during iron deficiency through targeted mRNA degradation.Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of the low-iron regulon leads to increased expression of cell surface and vacuolar iron transporters, resulting in additional iron entering the cytosol. Deletion of SNF1 in Δisu1 cells resulted in a further decrease in iron resistance and decreased CCC1-lacZ activity (Fig. 4B). This additive effect of loss of ISU1 and SNF1 again supports that Yap5 and Snf1 effects on CCC1 are independent of each other. Further support for Yap5 and Snf1 exhibiting independent regulation of the high-iron regulon comes from their effects on transcription of TYW1. Under normal growth conditions, there was little change in the expression of the reporter construct TYW1-lacZ in the presence or absence of SNF1 or YAP5 (Fig. 4C). Under high iron conditions, TYW1-lacZ activity was increased in wild-type and Δsnf1 cells, whereas deletion of YAP5 resulted in a decrease in TYW1-lacZ reporter expression. Although the mechanism leading to the increased expression in Δsnf1 cells is unknown, the finding that expression of TYW1 responds differently to deletion of SNF1 and YAP5 again suggests that they are mechanistically different. The Snf1 complex is composed of three subunits: the catalytic Snf1 α subunit; the Snf4 γ subunit; and one of three β subunits, Sip1, Sip2, and Gal83 (16Hedbacker K. Carlson M. SNF1/AMPK pathways in yeast.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Deletion of the regulatory subunit SNF4 phenocopied deletion of SNF1 with respect to iron toxicity (Fig. 5A). Many of the effects of Snf1 are due to its activation as a protein kinase. To determine whether the kinase activity of Snf1 was responsible for the change in iron resistance, we transformed Δsnf1 cells with a missense mutant of SNF1 (K84R) that has lost kinase activity (17Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Snf1 protein kinase regulates phosphorylation of the Mig1 repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Snf1 mutant kinase poorly restored iron resistance and did not restore low-glucose tolerance (Fig. 5B). In contrast, transformation of Δsnf1 cells with a wild-type SNF1 restored both iron resistance and low-glucose growth. To determine whether SIP1, SIP2, and GAL83 are involved in iron toxicity, we deleted each of them separately or in combination. Deletion of each gene individually had little effect on iron toxicity (Fig. 5C). Deletion of all three genes showed a consistent decrease in iron resistance, although the effect on iron resistance was not as great as deletion of SNF1. Furthermore, deletion of all three genes in a Δyap5 strain showed decreased iron resistance (Fig. 6A), decreased CCC1-lacZ reporter expression (Fig. 6B), and decreased Ccc1 protein levels (Fig. 6C). These results confirm that SNF1 affects transcription of CCC1 and that the components of the Snf complex, Sip1, Sip2, and Gal83, participate in CCC1 transcription. The degree of sensitivity to iron toxicity or low glucose between Δsnf1 and Δgal83Δsip1Δsip2 was different (Fig. 6D), suggesting that other genes contribute to the SNF1 effect.Figure 6Deletion of SIP1, SIP2, and GAL83 affects CCC1 expression. A, serial dilutions of wild-type, Δyap5, and Δyap5Δgal83Δsip1Δsip2 cells were plated on different concentrations of iron and grown for 2 days. B, wild-type, Δyap5, and Δyap5Δgal83Δsip1Δsip2 cells transformed with a CCC1-lacZ construct were grown in iron-containing medium (5 mm) for 4 h, and then β-galactosidase activity and cell protein were determined. Error bars represent S.D. C, wild-type, Δyap5, Δgal83Δsip1Δsip2, or Δyap5Δgal83Δsip1Δsip2 cells were grown in iron-containing medium (5 mm) for 4 h, and then Ccc1 and Vma2 levels were determined by Western blot analysis.

Carlson M. SNF1/AMPK pathways in yeast.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation state of Snf1 may be important in iron sensing. Changing glucose levels from 2.0 to 0.05% resulted in a clear increase in Snf1 phosphorylation as reported previously, but incubation with iron did not alter the phosphorylation status of Snf1 (Fig. 7). The Snf complex is known to activate the general stress transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 (18Estruch F. Carlson M.

Furthermore, iron has been shown to induce the transcription of MSN4, and it has been shown that there are Msn4/Msn2-binding sites on the CCC1 promoter (20Du Y. Cheng W. Li W.F.

In CM 2The abbreviation used is: CMcomplete minimal. medium, vector-transformed yeast showed a low level of CCC1-lacZ activity, and MSN2-transformed cells showed an increase in CCC1-lacZ activity (Fig. 8A). Addition of iron resulted in increased CCC1-lacZ activity in both vector alone- and MSN2-transformed cells. As expected, deletion of YAP5 decreased iron-dependent expression of CCC1-lacZ; however, Δyap5 cells transformed with MSN2 showed an increase in iron-dependent CCC1-lacZ expression. Deletion of YAP5 and SNF1 severely decreased expression of CCC1-lacZ activity, which could be restored by expression of MSN2. complete minimal. Overexpression of MSN2 in wild-type cells resulted in a small but measureable increase in iron resistance (Fig. 8B). Similarly, overexpression of MSN2 in Δyap5 cells restored iron resistance, albeit not to wild-type levels. Deletion of both YAP5 and SNF1, as shown previously, compromised iron resistance. Overexpression of MSN2 in Δyap5Δsnf1 cells restored iron resistance although not to the level seen in wild-type cells. These results suggest that Msn2 can affect transcription of CCC1-lacZ independently of either Yap5 or Snf1. To confirm a role for Msn2/Msn4 in regulating iron toxicity, we generated single and double deletion strains and grew those cells on high-iron plates. Deletion of either MSN2 or MSN4 singly had no effect on iron sensitivity, whereas Δmsn2Δmsn4 cells showed a decrease in iron resistance (Fig. 9A). To determine whether Snf1 plays a role in the activation of Msn2/Msn4, we examined iron resistance in strains deleted for SNF1 and MSN2/MSN4. Deletion of SNF1 decreased iron toxicity relative to wild-type cells as did deletion of MSN2/MSN4 (Fig. 9B). There was little difference between the effects of deletion of SNF1 or MSN2/MSN4; however, Δsnf1Δmsn2/4 showed decreased resistance to iron toxicity. The decreased resistance to iron toxicity could be correlated with decreased transcription of CCC1. Deletion of YAP5 and SNF1 reduced the iron-dependent expression of CCC1-lacZ (Fig. 9C). The level of CCC1-lacZ expression was lowered even further when MSN2 and MSN4 were deleted in the Δyap5Δsnf1 strain. The level of CCC1-lacZ expression was higher in Δyap5Δmsn2/4 than in Δyap5Δsnf1Δmsn2/4 cells. These results suggest that Snf1 has effects on expression of CCC1 beyond that of activating Msn2/Msn4 and that other transcription factors and signal transduction systems must be involved in Ccc1-mediated iron resistance. Iron homeostasis in all eukaryotes is dominated by the fact that iron is both required and biologically rare; that is, iron is abundant but most often is present in a biologically unavailable condition. Once accumulated by organisms, there is no physiologically regulated excretion of iron. Thus, along with regulation of iron uptake, regulation of iron storage is a critical mechanism protecting eukaryotes from iron toxicity. Fungi (3Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J.

Therefore, new chemotherapeutic strategies against different malignancies are needed. Targeted cancer therapy is a new paradigm for cancer therapeutics which targets pathways or chemical entities specific to cancer cells than normal ones. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells contain elevated copper which plays an integral role in angiogenesis. Copper is an important metal ion associated with chromatin DNA, particularly with guanine. Thus, targeting copper via copper-specific chelators in cancer cells can serve as an effective anticancer strategy. New pharmacophore di(2-picolyl)amine (DPA)-3(bromoacetyl) coumarin (ligand-L) was synthesized and characterized by IR, ESI-MS, 1H- and 13C-NMR. Binding ability of ligand-L to DNA/Cu(II) was evaluated using a plethora of biophysical techniques which revealed ligand-L-DNA and ligand-L-Cu(II) interaction. Competitive displacement assay and docking confirmed non-intercalative binding mode of ligand-L with ctDNA. Cyclic voltammetry confirmed ligand-L causes quasi reversible Cu(II)/Cu(I) conversion. Further, acute toxicity studies revealed no toxic effects of ligand-L on mice. To evaluate the chemotherapeutic potential and anticancer mechanism of ligand-L, DNA damage via pBR322 cleavage assay and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were studied. Results demonstrate that ligand-L causes DNA cleavage involving ROS generation in the presence of Cu(II). In conclusion, ligand-L causes redox cycling of Cu(II) to generate ROS which leads to oxidative DNA damage and pro-oxidant cancer cell death. These findings will establish ligand-L as a lead molecule to synthesize new molecules with better copper chelating and pro-oxidant properties against different malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2740623655,"Intracellular O2 is a key regulator of NO signaling, yet most in vitro studies are conducted in atmospheric O2 levels, hyperoxic with respect to the physiologic milieu. We investigated NO signaling in endothelial cells cultured in physiologic (5%) O2 and stimulated with histamine or shear stress. Culture of cells in 5% O2 (>5 d) decreased histamine- but not shear stress-stimulated endothelial (e)NOS activity. Unlike cells adapted to a hypoxic environment (1% O2), those cultured in 5% O2 still mobilized sufficient Ca2+ to activate AMPK. Enhanced expression and membrane targeting of PP2A-C was observed in 5% O2, resulting in greater interaction with eNOS in response to histamine. Moreover, increased dephosphorylation of eNOS in 5% O2 was Ca2+-sensitive and reversed by okadaic acid or PP2A-C siRNA. The present findings establish that Ca2+ mobilization stimulates both NO synthesis and PP2A-mediated eNOS dephosphorylation, thus constituting a novel negative feedback mechanism regulating eNOS activity not present in response to shear stress. This, coupled with enhanced NO bioavailability, underpins differences in NO signaling induced by inflammatory and physiologic stimuli that are apparent only in physiologic O2 levels. Furthermore, an explicit delineation between physiologic normoxia and genuine hypoxia is defined here, with implications for our understanding of pathophysiological hypoxia.-Keeley, T. P., Siow, R.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of local cryotherapy on local and systemic inflammation in Adjuvant-induced arthritis, a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis.The effects of mild hypothermia (30°C for 2 hours) on cytokine protein levels (Multiplex/ELISA) were evaluated in vitro in cultured rat adjuvant-induced arthritis patellae. In vivo, local cryotherapy was applied twice a day for 14 days in arthritic rats (ice: n = 10, cold gas: n = 9, non-treated: n = 10). At day 24 after the induction of arthritis, cytokine expression levels were measured in grinded hind paws (Q-RT-PCR) and in the plasma (Multiplex/ELISA).In vitro, punctual mild hypothermia down-regulated IL-6 protein expression. In vivo, ice showed a better efficacy profile on the arthritis score and joint swelling and was better tolerated, while cold gas induced a biphasic response profile with initial, transient arthritis worsening. Local cryotherapy also exerted local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects, both at the gene and the protein levels: IL-6, IL-17A and IL-1β gene expression levels were significantly down-regulated in hind paws. Both techniques decreased plasma IL-17A while ice decreased plasma IL-6 protein levels. By contrast, we observed no effect on local/systemic TNF-α pathway.We demonstrated for the first time that sub-chronically applied local cryotherapy (ice and cold gas) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment in adjuvant-induced arthritis. Furthermore, we provided novel insights into the cytokine pathways involved in Local cryotherapy's local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects, which were mainly IL-6/IL-17A-driven and TNF-α independent in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2742106444,"Background Metabolic bone disorders frequently occur in patients with chronic liver disease; however, the association between liver fibrosis and bone mineral density in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear. Methods This is a cross-sectional analysis of 231 asymptomatic subjects (160 women, 61.6 years old) from a university hospital setting, between February 2012 and December 2014. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine, femur neck, and total hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Liver fibrosis and steatosis were assessed using transient elastography. Results Among a total of 231 individuals, 129 subjects (55.8%) had NAFLD. BMDs at lumbar spine, femur neck, and total hip were significantly lower in patients having NAFLD with significant fibrosis, compared with patients having NAFLD without significant fibrosis (Ps<0.005). In patients with NAFLD, significant liver fibrosis revealed marked negative correlations with BMD at the lumber spine (r = –0.19, P = 0.032), femur neck (r = –0.19, P = 0.034), and total hip (r = –0.21, P = 0.016). A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that significant liver fibrosis was independently correlated with low BMD at the femur neck (β = –0.18, P = 0.039) and total hip (β = –0.21, P = 0.005) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, alanine aminotransferase, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and liver steatosis among patients with NAFLD. Using multivariable logistic regression, significant liver fibrosis was independently associated with overall osteopenia and osteoporosis in subjects having NAFLD (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 1.02–16.45). Conclusion The presence of significant liver fibrosis assessed via TE was independently associated with low BMD in NAFLD subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2741183125,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small miRNAs ~22 nucleotides in length and play a vital role in muscle development by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Large White (LW, a lean type pig) and Meishan pigs (MS, a Chinese indigenous obese breed) have significant postnatal phenotype differences in growth rate, muscle mass and meat quality, and these differences are programmed during prenatal muscle development. Little research shed light directly on the miRNA transcriptome difference in prenatal muscles between these two distinct pig breeds. Myofiber phenotypes of LW and MS were measured at developmental stages of 35, 55 and 90 days post-conception (dpc), which revealed that the myogenesis process is more intense in MS than in LW at 35 dpc. To investigate the role of miRNAs involved in regulating muscle development at earlier stages of myogenesis and decipher the miRNAs transcriptome difference between LW and MS, here, the miRNAomes of longissimus dorsi muscle collected at 35 dpc from female LW and MS were analyzed by deep sequencing. Overall, 1147 unique miRNAs comprising 434 known miRNAs, 239 conserved miRNAs and 474 candidate miRNAs were identified. Expression analysis of the 10 most abundant miRNAs in every library indicated that functional miRNAome may be a small amount and tend to be greater expressed. These sets of miRNA may play house keeping roles that were involved in myogenesis. A total of 87 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between LW and MS (reads > 1000, P < 0.05). Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were associated mainly with muscle contraction, WNT, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways. Some myogenesis related miRNAs (miR-133, miR-1, miR-206 and miR-148a) are highly abundant in MS, while other miRNAs (let-7 family, miR-214, miR-181) highly expressed in LW. In addition, the expression patterns of miRNAs (miR-1, -133, -206) at three prenatal stages (35, 55 and 90 dpc) were determined using qRT-PCR. Notably, ssc-miR-133 was significantly more highly expressed in LW pigs skeletal muscle at all prenatal stages compared with its expression in LW pigs skeletal muscle. Taken together, the main functional miRNAs during muscle development are different between lean and obese pig breeds. The present study adds new information to existing data on porcine miRNAs and will be helpful to investigate the dominant (main functional) muscle-related miRNAs sets in different pig breeds."

The subjects were divided into the serum UA-high (UA ≥ 7.0 mg/dL) or the UA-low group (UA < 7.0 mg/dL). The control group comprised 3082 community-dwelling individuals that were pair-matched according to age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and serum UA using propensity score matching. We compared renal function between controls and patients with UA stone (analysis 1), and between patients with CaOx/CaP and with UA stone (analysis 2). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the hyperuricemia on the development of stage 3 and 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) (analysis 3).The renal function was significantly associated with serum UA levels in the controls and patients with CaOx/CaP and UA stones. In pair-matched subgroups, patients with UA stone had significantly lower renal function than the control subjects (analysis 1) and patients with CaOx/CaP stones (analysis 2) regardless of hyperuricemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with UA stone, CaOx/CaP, hyperuricemia, presence of cardiovascular disease, higher body mass index, older age and lower hemoglobin had significantly higher risk of stage 3 and 3B CKD (analysis 3).Patients with UA stones had significantly worse renal function than controls and CaOx/CaP patients regardless of hyperuricemia. Urolithiasis (CaOx/CaP and UA stone) and hyperuricemia had an association with impaired renal function. Our findings encourage clinicians to initiate intensive treatment and education approaches in patients with urolithiasis and/or hyperuricemia in order to prevent the progression of renal impairment."

Given the variability across the African region, a four-country study was undertaken to examine barriers and facilitators of child survival prior to 2015. Kenya was one of the countries selected for an in-depth case study due to its insufficient progress in reducing under-five mortality, with only a 28% reduction between 1990 and 2013. This paper presents indicators, national documents, and qualitative data describing the factors that have both facilitated and hindered Kenya’s efforts in reducing child mortality. Key barriers identified in the data were widespread socioeconomic and geographic inequities in access and utilization of maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) care. To reduce these inequities, Kenya implemented three major policies/strategies during the study period: removal of user fees, the Kenya Essential Package for Health, and the Community Health Strategy. This paper uses qualitative data and a policy review to explore the early impacts of these efforts. The removal of user fees has been unevenly implemented as patients still face hidden expenses. The Kenya Essential Package for Health has enabled construction and/or expansion of healthcare facilities in many areas, but facilities struggle to provide Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC), neonatal care, and many essential medicines and commodities. The Community Health Strategy appears to have had the most impact, improving referrals from the community and provision of immunizations, malaria prevention, and Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV. However, the Community Health Strategy is limited by resources and thus also unevenly implemented in many areas. Although insufficient progress was made pre-2015, with additional resources and further scale-up of new policies and strategies Kenya can make further progress in child survival."

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) represents severe atherosclerosis with a high mortality. In early stages of PAD a substantial prevalence of sleep apnoea has already been shown. Here, we sought to determine the frequency of undiagnosed sleep apnoea in a homogeneous group of advanced PAD patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization. Methods 59 consecutive patients (mean age: 71.1 ± 9.8 years, 67.8% males) with PAD in Fontaine stages IIb-IV that underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty at our department were enrolled for pre-procedural polygraphy. Results Patients appertained to Fontaine clinical stage IIb, III and IV in 54.2%, 23.8% and 22.% of cases, respectively, and were principally intervened for femoropopliteal occlusive disease (71.2% of total study population). Polygraphy revealed sleep apnoea in 48 out of 59 patients (81.4%), of whom 60.4% offered a primarily obstructive-driven genesis. Among those patients with polygraphically confirmed sleep apnoea, mean apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and mean oxygen desaturation index (ODI) averaged 28.2 ± 19.5/h and 26.7 ± 18.8/h, respectively. 18 patients even offered an AHI ≥30/h that is indicative of severe sleep apnoea. For obstructive-driven apnoeic events, AHI correlated significantly with PAD severity stages (p = 0.042). Conclusions In our PAD collective, sleep apnoea was frequent and obstructive sleep apnoea´s severity correlated with PAD severity stages. Long-term results regarding the vasoprotective impact of CPAP treatment on PAD course remains to be determined."

Changes in connexin (Cx) turnover modify gap junction-mediated intercellular communication. We have reported that cytokines and hormones influence Cx43 turnover and coupling in folliculostellate cells and in the folliculostellate cell line TtT/GF. In addition, the expression of different connexins alters intercellular communication and connexins may have functions besides cell coupling. Here we assessed the expression, turnover and subcellular localization of Cx46 and Cx50 in the anterior pituitary and TtT/GF cells. Then, we assessed the impact of various natural (lactation, annual reproductive cycle, bFGF) and pathological (autoimmune orchitis, diabetes/obesity) conditions associated with altered anterior pituitary hormone secretion on Cx46 and Cx50. Anterior pituitary Cx46 and Cx50 expression and subcellular distribution were cell-dependent. Cx46 was expressed by folliculostellate, TtT/GF and endocrine cells. In the cytoplasm, Cx46 was chiefly associated with lysosomes. Variously sized Cx46 molecules were recovered exclusively in the TtT/GF cell nuclear fraction. In the nucleus, Cx46 co-localized with Nopp-140, a nucleolar factor involved in rRNA processing. Neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear Cx46 and Cx43 co-localized. Cx50 localized to folliculostellate and TtT/GF cells, and to the walls of blood capillaries, not to endocrine cells. Cx50 was cytoplasmic and associated with the cell membrane, not nuclear. Cx50 did not co-localize with Cx46 but it co-localized in the cytoplasm and co-immunoprecipitated with Cx43. Cx46 and Cx50 responses to various physiological and pathological challenges were different, often opposite. Cx46 and Cx43 expression and phosphorylation profiles differed in the anterior pituitary, whereas Cx50 and Cx43 were similar. The data suggest that Cx46 participates to cellular growth and proliferation and that Cx50, together with Cx43, contributes to folliculostellate cell coupling."

We previously showed that AA3 exhibits cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, we demonstrated that AA3 modulates inflammatory responses by regulating prostaglandin E receptor 4 signaling. Because prostaglandin E receptor 4 is involved in the pathophysiology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of human multiple sclerosis (MS), we assessed the beneficial effect of AA3 in EAE mice. AA3 treatment significantly reduced clinical severity and inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord of EAE mice. In vitro studies revealed that AA3 inhibited the T cell response toward the encephalitogenic epitope of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). AA3 significantly downregulated the expressions of certain Th1 and Th17 cytokines in activated T cells re-stimulated by MOG. Moreover, AA3 inhibited the activation of STAT4 and STAT3, which are the transcription factors pivotal for Th1 and Th17 lineage differentiation, respectively, in activated T cells. Pharmacological analysis further suggested that AA3 reduced Th17 cell differentiation and expansion. In conclusion, AA3 exerts an immunomodulatory effect in EAE, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent for MS in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2741703736,"Cow milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common childhood food allergy, which can sometimes persist or can newly develop in adulthood with severe symptoms. CMPA's treatment is complete dietary avoidance of milk proteins. To achieve this task, patients have to be aware of milk proteins found as ""hidden allergens"" in food commodities. In regard to milk proteins, it has been reported that allergenicity of caseins remains unaffected upon heat treatment. For these reasons, we aimed to obtain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against native and denatured β-casein, one of the most abundant and antigenic caseins, in order to develop an indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) to detect and quantify traces of this milk allergen in raw and processed foodstuffs. We developed two specific hybridoma clones, 1H3 and 6A12, which recognized β-casein in its denatured and native conformations by indirect ELISA (iELISA). Cross-reaction analysis by Western blot and iELISA indicated that these mAbs specifically recognized β-casein from bovine and goat milk extracts, while they did not cross-react with proteins present in other food matrixes. These highly specific mAbs enabled the development of sensitive, reliable and reproducible icELISAs to detect and quantify this milk protein allergen in food commodities. The extraction of β-casein from foodstuff was efficiently carried out at 60°C for 15 minutes, using an extraction buffer containing 1% SDS. The present study establishes a valid 1H3 based-icELISA, which allows the detection and quantification -0.29 ppm and 0.80 ppm, respectively- of small amounts of β-casein in raw and processed foods. Furthermore, we were able to detect milk contamination in incurred food samples with the same sensitivity as a commercial sandwich ELISA thus showing that this icELISA constitutes a reliable analytical method for control strategies in food industry and allergy prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2740320035,"This study presents two novel theoretical models to elucidate frequency sensitive nuclear mechanisms in low-intensity ultrasound enhanced bioeffects. In contrast to the typical 1.5 MHz pulsed ultrasound regime, our group previously experimentally confirmed that ultrasound stimulation of anchored chondrocytes at resonant frequency maximized gene expression of load inducible genes which are regulatory markers for cellular response to external stimuli. However, ERK phosphorylation displayed no frequency dependency, suggesting that the biochemical mechanisms involved in enhanced gene expression is downstream of ERK phosphorylation. To elucidate such underlying mechanisms, this study presents a theoretical model of an anchored cell, representing an in vitro chondrocyte, in an ultrasound field. The model results showed that the mechanical energy storage is maximized at the chondrocyte’s resonant frequency and the energy density in the nucleus is almost twice as high as in the cytoplasm. Next, a mechanochemical model was developed to link the mechanical stimulation of ultrasound and the increased mechanical energy density in the nucleus to the downstream targets of the ERK pathway. This study showed for the first time that ultrasound stimulation induces frequency dependent gene expression as a result of altered rates of transcription factors binding to chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2740541362,"Many studies classifying Gracilaria species for the exploitation of agarophytes and the development of the agar industry were conducted before the prevalence of molecular tools, resulting in the description of many species based solely on their morphology. Gracilaria firma and G. changii are among the commercially important agarophytes from the western Pacific; both feature branches with basal constrictions that taper toward acute apices. In this study, we contrasted the morpho-anatomical circumscriptions of the two traditionally described species with molecular data from samples that included representatives of G. changii collected from its type locality. Concerted molecular analyses using the rbcL and cox1 gene sequences, coupled with morphological observations of the collections from the western Pacific, revealed no inherent differences to support the treatment of the two entities as distinct taxa. We propose merging G. changii (a later synonym) into G. firma and recognize G. firma based on thallus branches with abrupt basal constrictions that gradually taper toward acute (or sometimes broken) apices, cystocarps consisting of small gonimoblast cells and inconspicuous multinucleate tubular nutritive cells issuing from gonimoblasts extending into the inner pericarp at the cystocarp floor, as well as deep spermatangial conceptacles of the verrucosa-type. The validation of specimens under different names as a single genetic species is useful to allow communication and knowledge transfer among groups from different fields. This study also revealed considerably low number of haplotypes and nucleotide diversity with apparent phylogeographic patterns for G. firma in the region. Populations from the Philippines and Taiwan were divergent from each other as well as from the populations from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. Establishment of baseline data on the genetic diversity of this commercially important agarophyte is relevant in the context of cultivation, as limited genetic diversity may jeopardize the potential for its genetic improvement over time."
https://openalex.org/W2741058732,"The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel conducts rapid delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr) and contributes to phase III cardiac action potential repolarization. Drugs inhibit hERG channels by binding to aromatic residues in hERG helixes. Berberine (BBR) has multiple actions, and its hydrogenated derivative dihydroberberine (DHB) is a potential candidate for developing new drugs. Previous studies have demonstrated that BBR blocks hERG channels and prolongs action potential duration (APD). Our present study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of DHB on hERG channels. Protein expression and the hERG current were analyzed using western blotting and patch-clamp, respectively. DHB inhibited the hERG current concentration-dependently after instantaneous perfusion, accelerated channel inactivation by directly binding tyrosine (Tyr652) and phenylalanine (Phe656), and decreased mature (155-kDa) and simultaneously increased immature (135-kDa) hERG expression, respectively. This suggests disruption of forward trafficking of hERG channels. Besides, DHB remarkably reduced heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expression and its interaction with hERG, indicating that DHB disrupted hERG trafficking by impairing channel folding. Meanwhie, DHB enhanced the expression of cleaved activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), a biomarker of unfolded protein response (UPR). Expression of calnexin and calreticulin, chaperones activated by ATF-6 to facilitate channel folding, were also increased, which indicating UPR activation. Additionally, the degradation rate of mature 155-kDa hERG increased following DHB exposure. In conclusion, we demonstrated that DHB acutely blocked hERG channels by binding the aromatic Tyr652 and Phe656. DHB may decrease hERG plasma membrane expression through two pathways involving disruption of forward trafficking of immature hERG channels and enhanced degradation of mature hERG channels. Furthermore, forward trafficking was disrupted by impaired channel folding associated with altered interactions between hERG proteins and chaperones. Finally, trafficking inhibition activated UPR, and mature hERG channel degradation was increased by DHB."
https://openalex.org/W2739973778,"The pan lymphocyte marker CD45 exists in various isoforms arising from alternative splicing of the exons 4, 5 and 6. While naïve T cells express CD45RA translated from an mRNA containing exon 4, exons 4–6 are spliced out to encode the shorter CD45R0 in antigen-experienced effector/memory T cells. The SNP C77G (rs17612648) is located in exon 4 and blocks the exon’s differential splicing from the pre-mRNA, enforcing expression of CD45RA. Several studies have linked C77G to autoimmune diseases but lack of validation in other cohorts has left its role elusive. An incidental finding in an ovarian cancer patient cohort from West Norway (Bergen region, n = 312), suggested that the frequency of C77G was higher among ovarian cancer patients than in healthy Norwegians (n = 1,357) (3.0% vs. 1.8% allele frequency). However, this finding could not be validated in a larger patient cohort from South-East Norway (Oslo region, n = 1,198) with 1.2% allele frequency. Hence, C77G is not associated with ovarian cancer in the Norwegian population. However, its frequency was increased in patients with FIGO stage II, endometrioid histology or an age at diagnosis of 60 years or older indicating a possible association with a less aggressive cancer type."
https://openalex.org/W2740095927,"The incidence of obesity is rising at an alarming rate. Despite its recognition as an urgent healthcare concern, obesity remains largely an unsolved medical problem. A comprehensive screen for functional dietary phytochemicals identified proanthocyanidins as putative targets to ameliorate obesity. A full-scale purification of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) derived from grape seed extract yielded pure OPC dimer, trimer, tetramer, and their gallates (pOPCs). Forward chemical screening conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that pOPCs reduced the activity of lipase in vitro and triglyceride storage capacity in vivo. Proanthocyanidin trimer gallate in particular modified lipid desaturation in C. elegans, revealed by hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy. Exposure to trimer gallate resulted in the transcriptional down-regulation of nhr-49 (an ortholog of the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a), and a key regulator of fat metabolism, and 2 downstream genes: fat-5 and acs-2. A combination exposure of 2 or 3 pOPCs (dimer gallate, trimer and/or trimer gallate) suggested the absence of synergistic potential. By using the whole-organism C. elegans coupled with versatile biochemical, biophysical, and genetic tools, we provide an account of the composition and bioactivity of individual OPCs and more generally highlight the potential of traditional Chinese medicine–derived drug leads.—Nie, Y., Littleton, B., Kavanagh, T., Abbate, V., Bansal, S.

https://openalex.org/W2739744653,"Arsenic is a toxic and carcinogenic contaminant of potential concern. Ettringite [Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12·26H2O] has the ability to incorporate oxyanions as a solid solution with SO42-, which could lower the soluble oxyanion concentrations. Therefore, ettringite containing SO42- and AsO43- has been synthesized. Results indicated that AsO43- could substitute for SO42- inside the channels of ettringite in the form of HAsO42-, and a linear correlation existed between Xinitial solution and Xsolid. The thermodynamic characterization of the solid samples was investigated by means of Visual MINTEQ, a freeware chemical equilibrium model, and the solubility product logK of -48.4 ± 0.4 was calculated for HAsO4-ettringite at 25°C. The Lippmann phase diagram and XHAsO4-XHAsO4,aq plot showed that the solid solution series containing arsenate has HAsO4-poor aqueous solutions in equilibrium. These findings can be helpful to arsenate solidification and arsenate leaching modeling projects."
https://openalex.org/W2739959686,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is an inhibitor of megakaryopoiesis and platelet function. Recently, PACAP deficiency was observed in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS), associated with increased platelet count and aggregability and increased risk of thrombosis. To further study PACAP deficiency in NS, we used transgenic Tg(cd41:EGFP) zebrafish with GFP-labeled thrombocytes. We generated two models for congenital NS, a morpholino injected model targeting nphs1 (nephrin), which is mutated in the Finnish-type congenital NS. The second model was induced by exposure to the nephrotoxic compound adriamycin. Nephrin RNA expression was quantified and zebrafish embryos were live-screened for proteinuria and pericardial edema as evidence of renal impairment. Protein levels of PACAP and its binding-protein ceruloplasmin were measured and GFP-labeled thrombocytes were quantified. We also evaluated the effects of PACAP morpholino injection and the rescue effects of PACAP-38 peptide in both congenital NS models. Nephrin downregulation and pericardial edema were observed in both nephrin morpholino injected and adriamycin exposed congenital NS models. However, PACAP deficiency was demonstrated only in the adriamycin exposed condition. Ceruloplasmin levels and the number of GFP-labeled thrombocytes remained unchanged in both models. PACAP morpholino injections worsened survival rates and the edema phenotype in both congenital NS models while injection with human PACAP-38 could only rescue the adriamycin exposed model. We hereby report, for the first time, PACAP deficiency in a NS zebrafish model as a consequence of adriamycin exposure. However, distinct from the human congenital NS, both zebrafish models retained normal levels of ceruloplasmin and thrombocytes. We further extend the renoprotective effects of the PACAP-38 peptide against adriamycin toxicity in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2740732329,"Computational models of gas transport and aerosol deposition frequently utilize idealized models of bronchial tree structure, where airways are considered a network of bifurcating cylinders. However, changes in the shape of the lung during respiration affect the geometry of the airways, especially in disease conditions. In this study, the internal airway geometry was examined, concentrating on comparisons between mean lung volume (MLV) and total lung capacity (TLC). A set of High Resolution CT images were acquired during breath hold on a group of moderate persistent asthmatics at MLV and TLC after challenge with a broncho-constrictor (methacholine) and the airway trees were segmented and measured. The airway hydraulic diameter (Dh) was calculated through the use of average lumen area (Ai) and average internal perimeter (Pi) at both lung volumes and was found to be systematically higher at TLC by 13.5±9% on average, with the lower lobes displaying higher percent change in comparison to the lower lobes. The average internal diameter (Din) was evaluated to be 12.4±6.8% (MLV) and 10.8±6.3% (TLC) lower than the Dh, for all the examined bronchi, a result displaying statistical significance. Finally, the airway distensibility per bronchial segment and per generation was calculated to have an average value of 0.45±0.28, exhibiting high variability both between and within lung regions and generations. Mixed constriction/dilation patterns were recorded between the lung volumes, where a number of airways either failed to dilate or even constricted when observed at TLC. We conclude that the Dh is higher than Din, a fact that may have considerable effects on bronchial resistance or airway loss at proximal regions. Differences in caliber changes between lung regions are indicative of asthma-expression variability in the lung. However, airway distensibility at generation 3 seems to predict distensibility more distally."
https://openalex.org/W2739515619,"Objective Recent surveillance data suggests the United States (U.S.) Army HIV epidemic is concentrated among men who have sex with men. To identify potential targets for HIV prevention strategies, the relationship between demographic and clinical factors and membership within transmission clusters based on baseline pol sequences of HIV-infected Soldiers from 2001 through 2012 were analyzed. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of baseline partial pol sequences, demographic and clinical characteristics available for all Soldiers in active service and newly-diagnosed with HIV-1 infection from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2012. HIV-1 subtype designations and transmission clusters were identified from phylogenetic analysis of sequences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate and adjust for the association between characteristics and cluster membership. Results Among 518 of 995 HIV-infected Soldiers with available partial pol sequences, 29% were members of a transmission cluster. Assignment to a southern U.S. region at diagnosis and year of diagnosis were independently associated with cluster membership after adjustment for other significant characteristics (p<0.10) of age, race, year of diagnosis, region of duty assignment, sexually transmitted infections, last negative HIV test, antiretroviral therapy, and transmitted drug resistance. Subtyping of the pol fragment indicated HIV-1 subtype B infection predominated (94%) among HIV-infected Soldiers. Conclusion These findings identify areas to explore as HIV prevention targets in the U.S. Army. An increased frequency of current force testing may be justified, especially among Soldiers assigned to duty in installations with high local HIV prevalence such as southern U.S. states."
https://openalex.org/W2741771335,"An increase in intestinal gas production due to small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) is a contributing factor for flatus incontinence. The aims of our study were to assess the efficacy of metronidazole in a select population of patients with flatus incontinence associated with SIBO and to compare its efficacy with that of a combination of simethicone and activated charcoal (SC; Carbosylane) in randomized experimental arms.Adult patients suffering from flatus incontinence associated with SIBO diagnosed by a glucose breath test were enrolled in the study. They were given metronidazole or Carbosylane (SC) for 10 days. The reduction in the mean daily number of gas leakages reported in a 3-day diary before and at the end of the treatment was used as the primary endpoint.Of 52 consecutive subjects with flatus incontinence, 23 (44%) had SIBO, 16 (33%) of whom were included in and completed the study. The relative reduction in flatus incontinence episodes was significantly higher in the metronidazole than in the SC group (66.8±34.8% vs. 25±50%, P = 0.03), decreasing by more than 50% in 7 (87.5%) of the subjects in the metronidazole group compared with only 1 (12.5%) in the SC group (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 0.9-56.9, P = 0.06).Our results show a promising trend indicating that metronidazole might significantly improve flatus incontinence associated with SIBO and might be more successful in treating flatus incontinence than gas absorbents."
https://openalex.org/W2740315454,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a complex mixture drug comprising diverse immunoglobulins and non-IgG proteins purified from the plasma of thousands of healthy donors. Approved IVIg products on the market differ regarding source of plasma, isolation process, and formulation. These products are used widely, and often interchangeably, for the treatment of immunodeficiency and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but their mechanisms of action in different indications are not well understood. A primary limitation to understanding the therapeutic relevance of specific components within IVIg has been the limited resolution of analytics historically implemented to characterize its complex mixture. In this study, high-resolution analytics were applied to better understand the composition of IVIg and product variations. We characterized three approved IVIg products: Gammagard®, Privigen®, and Octagam®. Differences in the distribution of molecular weight species, IgG sequence variants, isoforms, glycoforms, and the repertoire of previously reported antibody specificities were identified. We also compared the effect of aging on these products to identify changes in size distribution and posttranslational modifications. This type of characterization may provide insights into the specific factors and components of IVIg that may influence its activity and ultimately lead to optimization of IVIg products for use in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2740607509,"In this study, we address the problem of noisy image super-resolution. Noisy low resolution (LR) image is always obtained in applications, while most of the existing algorithms assume that the LR image is noise-free. As to this situation, we present an algorithm for noisy image super-resolution which can achieve simultaneously image super-resolution and denoising. And in the training stage of our method, LR example images are noise-free. For different input LR images, even if the noise variance varies, the dictionary pair does not need to be retrained. For the input LR image patch, the corresponding high resolution (HR) image patch is reconstructed through weighted average of similar HR example patches. To reduce computational cost, we use the atoms of learned sparse dictionary as the examples instead of original example patches. We proposed a distance penalty model for calculating the weight, which can complete a second selection on similar atoms at the same time. Moreover, LR example patches removed mean pixel value are also used to learn dictionary rather than just their gradient features. Based on this, we can reconstruct initial estimated HR image and denoised LR image. Combined with iterative back projection, the two reconstructed images are applied to obtain final estimated HR image. We validate our algorithm on natural images and compared with the previously reported algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed method performs better noise robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2740949329,"The free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in India still relies on the clinico-immunological monitoring for diagnosis of treatment failure. As the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is shared in first- and second-line regimens, accumulation of drug resistant mutations (DRMs) can compromise the efficacy of NRTI. This study was undertaken to describe the pattern of HIV DRMs following immunological monitoring and investigate its impact on the cycling of NRTI between first- and second-line ART.This cross-sectional study was performed at a state-sponsored ART clinic of Pune city in western India between January and June 2016. Consecutive adults receiving first-line ART with immunological failure (IF) were recruited for plasma viral load (PVL) estimation. Randomly selected 80 participants with PVL >1000 copies/mL underwent HIV drug resistance genotyping. Of these, 75 plasma sample were successfully genotyped. The median CD4 count and duration of ART at the time of failure were 98 (IQR: 61.60-153.50) cells/μL and 4.62 (IQR: 3.17-6.15) years, respectively. The prevalence of NRTI, non-NRTI, and major protease inhibitor resistance mutations were 89.30%, 96%, and 1.33%, respectively. Following first-line failure, sequences from 56.67% of individuals indicated low- to high-level resistance to all available NRTI. The proportion of sequences with ≥2 thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) and ≥3 TAMs were 62.12% and 39.39%, respectively. An average of 1.98 TAMs per sequence were observed following IF as compared to 0.37 TAMs per sequence following targeted PVL monitoring at 12 months of ART from a prior study; this difference was significant (p<0.001).The option of cycling of NRTI analogues between first- and second-line regimens would no longer be effective if individuals are followed-up by immunological monitoring due to accumulation of mutations. Introduction of routine PVL monitoring is a priority for the long-term sustainability of free ART program in India."
