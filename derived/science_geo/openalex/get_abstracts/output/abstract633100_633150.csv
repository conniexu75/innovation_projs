https://openalex.org/W2949707636,"The ribosome small subunit is expressed in all living cells. It performs numerous essential functions during translation, including formation of the initiation complex and proofreading of base-pairs between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons. The core constituent of the small ribosomal subunit is a ~1.5 kb RNA strand in prokaryotes (16S rRNA) and a homologous ~1.8 kb RNA strand in eukaryotes (18S rRNA). Traditional sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) of rRNA genes or rRNA cDNA copies has achieved wide use as a ‘molecular chronometer’ for phylogenetic studies, and as a tool for identifying infectious organisms in the clinic. However, epigenetic modifications on rRNA are erased by SBS methods. Here we describe direct MinION nanopore sequencing of individual, full-length 16S rRNA absent reverse transcription or amplification. As little as 5 picograms (~10 attomole) of purified E. coli 16S rRNA was detected in 4.5 micrograms of total human RNA. Nanopore ionic current traces that deviated from canonical patterns revealed conserved E. coli 16S rRNA 7-methylguanosine and pseudouridine modifications, and a 7-methylguanosine modification that confers aminoglycoside resistance to some pathological E. coli strains."
https://openalex.org/W2950599017,"The cilium is an essential organelle at the surface of mammalian cells whose dysfunction causes a wide range of genetic diseases collectively called ciliopathies. The current rate at which new ciliopathy genes are identified suggests that many ciliary components remain undiscovered. We generated and rigorously analyzed genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and evolutionary data and systematically integrated these using Bayesian statistics into a predictive score for ciliary function. This resulted in 285 candidate ciliary genes. We generated independent experimental evidence of ciliary associations for 24 out of 36 analyzed candidate proteins using multiple cell and animal model systems (mouse, zebrafish and nematode) and techniques. For example, we show that OSCP1, which has previously been implicated in two distinct non-ciliary processes, causes ciliogenic and ciliopathy-associated tissue phenotypes when depleted in zebrafish. The candidate list forms the basis of CiliaCarta, a comprehensive ciliary compendium covering 956 genes. The resource can be used to objectively prioritize candidate genes in whole exome or genome sequencing of ciliopathy patients and can be accessed at http://bioinformatics.bio.uu.nl/john/syscilia/ciliacarta/."
https://openalex.org/W2944855225,We introduce a Mueller-matrix imaging polarization-based approach for the quantitative digital screening of the polycrystalline structure of fibrillary-based biological tissues in vitro. The morphometric evaluation of histological sections of myocardium was performed utilizing the high-order statistical moments calculated based on the spatial distribution of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism obtained experimentally. We demonstrate that spatial distributions of phase of light and optical anisotropy of scattering inherent to fibrillar networks of myocardium at different necrotic stages can be effectively used as a quantitative marker of stages of myosin fibril degradation. Processing the images of phase of light scattered in biological tissues with high order statistical analysis provides a functional tool for the quantitative characterization of necrotic conditions of the myocardium.

In clinical practice, the lesion type is often determined from the abdominal MR examination, which includes T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR images. To date, only T2-weighted images are exploited for automatic classification of focal liver lesions. In this study additional MR sequences and risk factors are used for automatic classification to improve the results and to make a step forward to a clinically useful aid for radiologists.Clinical MRI data sets of 95 patients with in total 125 benign lesions (40 adenomas, 29 cysts and 56 hemangiomas) and 88 malignant lesions (30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 58 metastases) were included in this study. Contrast curve, gray level histogram, and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features were extracted from the DCE-MR and T2-weighted images. In addition, risk factors including the presence of steatosis, cirrhosis, and a known primary tumor were used as features. Fifty features with the highest ANOVA F-score were selected and fed to an extremely randomized trees classifier. The classifier evaluation was performed using the leave-one-out principle and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The overall accuracy for the classification of the five major focal liver lesion types is 0.77. The sensitivity/specificity is 0.80/0.78, 0.93/0.93, 0.84/0.82, 0.73/0.56, and 0.62/0.77 for adenoma, cyst, hemangioma, HCC, and metastasis, respectively.The proposed classification system using features derived from clinical DCE-MR and T2-weighted images, with additional risk factors is able to differentiate five common types of lesions and is a step forward to a clinically useful aid for focal liver lesion diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2946581008,"The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain remain unclear. Here, we sought to characterize the transcriptome associated with chronic low back pain as well as the transcriptome of the transition from acute to chronic low back pain. For the analysis, we compared the whole blood transcriptome of: (a) patients at the onset of low back pain who no longer had pain within 6 weeks after onset (acute) with patients who developed chronic low back pain at 6 months (chronic T5); and, (b) patients at the onset of low back pain (chronic T1) who developed chronic pain at 6 months with healthy pain-free (normal) controls. The majority of differentially expressed genes were protein coding. We illustrate a unique chronic low back pain transcriptome characterized by significant enrichment for known pain genes, extracellular matrix genes, and genes from the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genomic locus. The transcriptome of the transition from acute to chronic low back pain was characterized by significant upregulation of antigen presentation pathway (MHC class I and II) genes and downregulation of mitochondrial genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting a unique genomic signature of vulnerability to low back pain chronicity."
https://openalex.org/W2789973986,"The advent of the digital era provided a fertile ground for the development of virtual societies, complex systems influencing real-world dynamics. Understanding online human behavior and its relevance beyond the digital boundaries is still an open challenge. Here we show that online social interactions during a massive voting event can be used to build an accurate map of real-world political parties and electoral ranks. We provide evidence that information flow and collective attention are often driven by a special class of highly influential users, that we name ""augmented humans"", who exploit thousands of automated agents, also known as bots, for enhancing their online influence. We show that augmented humans generate deep information cascades, to the same extent of news media and other broadcasters, while they uniformly infiltrate across the full range of identified groups. Digital augmentation represents the cyber-physical counterpart of the human desire to acquire power within social systems."
https://openalex.org/W2945149113,"Background With an upward trend in the number of people who return home to independent living after stroke, the ability to perform more complex activities is becoming an increasingly important long-term outcome after stroke. Although associations between Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and cognitive dysfunction, emotional problems, and fatigue have been reported, less is known about the long-term impact of these stroke consequences on the performance of everyday activities in young and middle-aged stroke survivors. Objective To explore the impact of cognitive dysfunction, emotional problems, and fatigue on long-term performance of instrumental activities of daily living in young and middle-aged stroke survivors Method Data on stroke survivors, aged 18–69 at index stroke, were collected from the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischaemic Stroke. IADL outcome was assessed using the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), and the impact of chosen variables was assessed using Spearman´s rank-order correlation and logistic regression. Results Seven years after index stroke, 296 stroke survivors (median age of 64) were included in this study. Cognitive dysfunction showed the strongest correlations with FAI outcome and independently explained worse outcome on FAI summary score and the domain of work/leisure activities. Fatigue was independently explanatory of worse outcome on FAI summary score and domestic chores, while depressive symptoms independently explained worse outcome on work/leisure activities. In a subgroup with only those participants who had no or minimal residual neurological deficits at follow-up (NIHSS score 0), cognitive dysfunction independently explained worse outcome on FAI summary score and work/leisure activities. Depressive symptoms independently explained worse outcome on FAI summary score and domestic chores. Conclusion Our results show that in young and middle-aged stroke survivors, cognitive dysfunction, depressive symptoms, and fatigue negatively impact performance of IADL even at seven years post stroke onset. Further, we have shown that an impact of both cognitive dysfunction and depressive symptoms can be found also among stroke survivors with mild or no remaining neurological deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2946458165,"The host-microbiota interplay is recognized as a key factor for the homeostatic maintenance in animals. In pigs, the weaning transition represents a drastic changes event leading to high risk of gut dysbiosis, which in most cases results in economic losses for swine industry. The blood type antigens expressed on mucosal surfaces can act as receptors for bacterial adhesion and the hypothesis of possible associations between blood groups and intestinal microbial profiles has been tested in human with contrasting results. Nevertheless, no studies testing the blood type as possible shaping factor for gut microbiota are available for pigs. The results of our previous study suggested the porcine AO blood types system as a possible factor influencing the microbiota composition. In the present study, the changes in fecal microbiota of 12 piglets were followed from 7 days after birth to 2 weeks post-weaning, testing the hypothesis that blood types may impact on its structure. No effects attributable to the difference in blood groups were detected, however, the sampling site (faeces) and the low statistical power might have masked the hypothesized impact. The data clearly showed the rearrangement of the bacterial ecosystem triggered by weaning transition; mainly consisting of a shift from a Bacteroidaceae-Enterobacteriaceae dominated community, to a Prevotellaceae-Ruminococcaceae dominated community. The functional analysis by metagenomic predictions suggested a role of the high levels of long-chain fatty acid in swine milk as energy source for Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli), in suckling piglets. This study provides a first insight for further investigations; indicating the need for larger sample size, preferably derived from intestinal mucosa, to test the potential effect of blood groups on gut microbiota profiles, and for analyses aimed at assessing the long-chain fatty acids degradation activity within the intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets, with particular attention to the role of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2945495213,"One of the primary objectives in forensic psychiatry, distinguishing it from other psychiatric disciplines, is risk management. Assessments of the risk of criminal recidivism are performed on a routine basis, as a baseline for risk management for populations involved in the criminal justice system. However, the risk assessment tools available to clinical practice are limited in their ability to predict recidivism. Recently, the prospect of incorporating neuroimaging data to improve the prediction of criminal behavior has received increased attention. In this study we investigated the feasibility of including neuroimaging data in the prediction of recidivism by studying whether the inclusion of resting-state regional cerebral blood flow measurements leads to an incremental increase in predictive performance over traditional risk factors. A subsample (N = 44) from a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography neuroimaging and clinical psychiatric assessment during their court-ordered forensic psychiatric investigation were included in a long-term (ten year average time at risk) follow-up. A Baseline model with eight empirically established risk factors, and an Extended model which also included resting-state regional cerebral blood flow measurements from eight brain regions were estimated using random forest classification and compared using several predictive performance metrics. Including neuroimaging data in the Extended model increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from .69 to .81, increased accuracy from .64 to .82 and increased the scaled Brier score from .08 to .25, supporting the feasibility of including neuroimaging data in the prediction of recidivism in forensic psychiatric patients. Although our results hint at potential benefits in the domain of risk assessment, several limitations and ethical challenges are discussed. Further studies with larger, carefully characterized clinical samples utilizing higher-resolution neuroimaging techniques are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2945835987,"Diaphorina citri is a vector of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus,’ (CLas), associated with Huanglongbing, (HLB, or citrus greening) disease in citrus. D. citri exhibits three different color morph variants, blue, gray and yellow. Blue morphs have a greater capacity for long-distance flight as compared to non-blue morphs, but little else is known about how color morphology influences vector characteristics. In this study, we show that the color morphology of the insect is derived from pigmented cells of the fat body. Blue morphs acquire a lower level of CLas in their bodies from infected trees as compared to their gray and yellow conspecifics, referred to in this paper collectively as non-blue morphs. Accordingly, CLas titer in citrus leaves inoculated by non-blue insects was 6-fold higher than in leaves inoculated by blue insects. Blue color morphs harbored lower titers of Wolbachia and ‘Candidatus Profftella armatura,’ two of the D. citri bacterial endosymbionts. Expression of hemocyanin, a copper-binding oxygen transport protein responsible for the blue coloration of hemolymph of other arthropods and mollusks, was previously correlated with blue color morphology and is highly up-regulated in insects continuously reared on CLas infected citrus trees. Based on our results, we hypothesized that a reduction of hemocyanin expression would reduce the D. citri immune response and an increase in the titer of CLas would be observed. Surprisingly, a specific 3-fold reduction of hemocyanin-1 transcript levels using RNA silencing in blue adult D. citri morphs had an approximately 2-fold reduction on the titer of CLas. These results suggest that hemocyanin signaling from the fat body may have multiple functions in the regulation of bacterial titers in D. citri, and that hemocyanin is one of multiple psyllid genes involved in regulating CLas titer."
https://openalex.org/W2946283094,"This study aimed at evaluating the impact of a classic music training program (Démos) on several aspects of the cognitive development of children from low socio-economic backgrounds. We were specifically interested in general intelligence, phonological awareness and reading abilities, and in other cognitive abilities that may be improved by music training such as auditory and visual attention, working and short-term memory and visuomotor precision. We used a longitudinal approach with children presented with standardized tests before the start and after 18 months of music training. To test for pre-to-post training improvements while discarding maturation and developmental effects, raw scores for each child and for each test were normalized relative to their age group. Results showed that Démos music training improved musicality scores, total IQ and Symbol Search scores as well as concentration abilities and reading precision. In line with previous results, these findings demonstrate the positive impact of an ecologically-valid music training program on the cognitive development of children from low socio-economic backgrounds and strongly encourage the broader implementation of such programs in disadvantaged school-settings."
https://openalex.org/W2946338566,"Arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are environmental pollutants to which people around the world are exposed through water, food and air. In mouse and in vitro studies of human cells, both of these chemicals have been shown to modulate the immune system. In some experimental studies, a synergistic disruption of immune function was observed by a combined exposure to arsenic and PAH. However, a joint effect of arsenic and PAH on immune function has not been studied in humans. We have conducted an epidemiological investigation to examine effects of chronic arsenic and PAH exposures on immune function. We assessed T-cell proliferation (TCP) and cytokine production of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated lymphocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) among 197 healthy men enrolled to the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. By design, approximately half were active smokers and the rest were never smokers. Our analyses demonstrated that IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly stimulated as a function of urinary arsenic levels in models adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and PAH-DNA adducts. After correcting for false detection rate (FDR), only IL-1b remained statistically significant. We found a U-shaped dose response relationship between urinary arsenic and IL-1b. On the other hand, PAH-DNA adducts were associated with an inhibition of TCP and appeared as an inverted U-shape curve. Dose response curves were non-monotonic for PAH-DNA adduct exposures and suggested that cytokine secretion of IFNg, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10 and IL17A followed a complex pattern. In the majority of donors, there was a trend towards a decrease in cytokine associated with PAH-DNA adducts. We did not observe any interaction between urinary arsenic and PAH-DNA adducts on immune parameters. Our results indicate that long-term exposures to arsenic and PAH have independent, non-monotonic associations with TCP and cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2945854053,"Priming effects (PEs) are defined as short-term changes in the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) caused by the addition of easily degradable organic compounds to the soil. PEs are ubiquitous but the direction (acceleration or retardation of SOM decomposition) and magnitude are not easy to predict. It has been suggested that the ratio between the amount of added PE-triggering substrate to the size of initial soil microbial biomass is an important factor influencing PEs. However, this is mainly based on comparison of different studies and not on direct experimentation. The aim of the current study is to examine the impact of glucose-to-microbial biomass ratios on PEs for three different ecosystems. We did this by adding three different amounts of 13C-glucose with or without addition of mineral N (NH4NO3) to soils collected from arable lands, grasslands and forests. The addition of 13C-glucose was equivalent to 15%, 50% and 200% of microbial biomass C. After one month of incubation, glucose had induced positive PEs for almost all the treatments, with differences in magnitude related to the soil origin and the amount of glucose added. For arable and forest soils, the primed C increased with increasing amount of glucose added, whereas for grassland soils this relationship was negative. We found positive correlations between glucose-derived C and primed C and the strength of these correlations was different among the three ecosystems considered. Generally, additions of mineral N next to glucose (C:N = 15:1) had little effect on the flux of substrate-derived C and primed C. Overall, our study does not support the hypothesis that the trigger-substrate to microbial biomass ratio can be an important predictor of PEs. Rather our results indicate that the amount of energy obtained from decomposing trigger substrates is an important factor for the magnitude of PEs."

Data were obtained from medical and microbiology records.275 patients were admitted for DF infection in 2015: 45.1% had OM (75% males). 40% were newly diagnosed with DF ulcer (DFU). 81% patients had X-ray and 28% had MRI. Bone infection was confirmed by MC&S in 53% cases. 930 microbiological isolates were obtained: 63% were Gram-positive microorganisms [S.aureus and MRSA (~40%), CoNS (20%), and E.faecalis (8%)]. All MRSA were vancomycin and linezolid sensitive. 23.2% isolates were vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 24% isolates were Gram-negative organisms: P.aeruginosa (42%), E.coli (13%), and E.cloacae (12%). Meropenem resistance was low; 5.4% P.aeruginosa, 87.5% A.baumanii. 76% patients received co-amoxiclav; 41% received ≥3 antibiotics; 17% received >3 months antibiotics. Hospital mean-length of stay was 26.1 days. Ulcer time-to-heal was >6 months in 25% patients. 22% ulcers healed without surgery, 60% healed after minor amputation, 12% patients had major amputation.Despite current MDT approach, many patients progress to amputation. DF-OM still represents a challenging clinical condition, requiring further study to develop better management guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2946596150,"Ethnic-racial classification criteria are widely recognized to vary according to historical, cultural and political contexts. In Brazil, the strong influence of individual socio-economic factors on race/colour self-classification is well known. With the expansion of genomic technologies, the use of genomic ancestry has been suggested as a substitute for classification procedures such as self-declaring race, as if they represented the same concept. We investigated the association between genomic ancestry, the racial composition of census tracts and individual socioeconomic factors and self-declared race/colour in a cohort of 15,105 Brazilians. Results show that the probability of self-declaring as black or brown increases according to the proportion of African ancestry and varies widely among cities. In Porto Alegre, where most of the population is white, with every 10% increase in the proportion of African ancestry, the odds of self-declaring as black increased 14 times (95%CI 6.08–32.81). In Salvador, where most of the population is black or brown, that increase was of 3.98 times (95%CI 2.96–5.35). The racial composition of the area of residence was also associated with the probability of self-declaring as black or brown. Every 10% increase in the proportion of black and brown inhabitants in the residential census tract increased the odds of self-declaring as black by 1.33 times (95%CI 1.24–1.42). Ancestry alone does not explain self-declared race/colour. An emphasis on multiple situational contexts (both individual and collective) provides a more comprehensive framework for the study of the predictors of self-declared race/colour, a highly relevant construct in many different scenarios, such as public policy, sociology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2945325620,"Terahertz (THz) imaging is a widely used technique in the study and detection of many chemicals and biomolecules in polycrystalline form because the spectral absorption signatures of these target materials often lie in the THz frequencies. When the size of dielectric grain boundaries are comparable to the THz wavelengths, spectral features can be obscured due to electromagnetic scattering. In this study, we first investigate this granular scattering effect in identification of chemicals with THz spectral absorption features. We then will propose a signal processing technique in the so-called ""quefrency"" domain to improve the ability to resolve these spectral features in the diffuse scattered THz images. We created a pellet with α-lactose monohydrate and riboflavin, two biologically significant materials with well-known vibrational spectral resonances, and buried the pellet in a highly scattering medium. THz transmission measurements were taken at all angles covering the half focal plane. We show that, while spectral features of lactose and riboflavin cannot be distinguished in the scattered image, application of cepstrum filtering can mitigate these scattering effects. By employing our quefrency-domain signal processing technique, we were able to unambiguously detect the dielectric resonance of lactose in the diffused scattering geometries. Finally we will discuss the limitation of the new proposed technique in spectral identification of chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2946825671,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is frequently found in biopsies of patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). The pathogenesis of SRNS/FSGS is often unknown and the disease will recur in up to 50% of patients post-transplant, indicating the presence of circulating podocyte-toxic factor(s). Several studies have reported clinical improvement after anti-TNFα therapy. However, prediction of the clinical outcome in SRNS/FSGS is difficult, and novel predictive biomarkers are needed. An image-based assay, which measures disassembly of focal adhesion complexes in cultured podocytes, was used to ascertain the presence of podocyte toxic activity in SRNS/FSGS sera. Expression of TNFα pathway genes was analysed in the Nephroseq FSGS cohort and in cultured podocytes treated with SRNS/FSGS sera. Podocyte toxic activity was detected in 48/96 SRNS/FSGS patients. It did not correlate with serum TNFα levels, age, sex, ethnicity or glomerular filtration rate. In ~25% of the toxic samples, the toxicity was strongly inhibited by blockade of TNFα signaling. Transcriptional profiling of human FSGS biopsies and podocytes treated with FSGS sera revealed significant increases in expression of TNFα pathway genes. We identified patients with serum podocyte toxic activity who may be at risk for FSGS recurrence, and those patients in whom serum podocyte toxicity may be reversed by TNFα blockade. Activation of TNFα pathway genes occurs in podocytes of FSGS patients suggesting a causative effect of this pathway in response to circulating factor(s). In vitro analyses of patient sera may stratify patients according to prognostic outcomes and potential responses to specific clinical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2944905271,"MHC molecules are essential for the adaptive immune response, and they are the most polymorphic genetic loci in vertebrates. Extreme genetic variation at these loci is paradoxical given their central importance to host health. Classic models of MHC gene evolution center on antagonistic host-pathogen interactions to promote gene diversification and allelic diversity in host populations. However, all multicellular organisms are persistently colonized by their microbiota that perform essential metabolic functions for their host and protect from infection. Here, we provide data to support the hypothesis that MHC heterozygote advantage (a main force of selection thought to drive MHC gene evolution), may operate by enhancing fitness advantages conferred by the host’s microbiome. We utilized fecal 16S rRNA gene sequences and their predicted metagenome datasets collected from multiple MHC congenic homozygote and heterozygote mouse strains to describe the influence of MHC heterozygosity on microbiome form and function. We find that in contrast to homozygosity at MHC loci, MHC heterozygosity promotes functional diversification of the microbiome, enhances microbial network connectivity, and results in enrichment for a variety of microbial functions that are positively associated with host fitness. We demonstrate that taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbiome is positively correlated in MHC heterozygote but not homozygote animals, suggesting that heterozygote microbiomes are more functionally adaptive under similar environmental conditions than homozygote microbiomes. Our data complement previous observations on the role of MHC polymorphism in sculpting microbiota composition, but also provide functional insights into how MHC heterozygosity may enhance host health by modulating microbiome form and function. We also provide evidence to support that MHC heterozygosity limits functional redundancy among commensal microbes and may enhance the metabolic versatility of their microbiome. Results from our analyses yield multiple testable predictions regarding the role of MHC heterozygosity on the microbiome that will help guide future research in the area of MHC-microbiome interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2946391226,"Agricultural expansion and the need for sustainable cultivation are challenges faced by researchers involved in the generation of new cultivars that can adapt to abiotic stress. Knowledge of the genetic effects of characteristics related to efficiency and responsiveness to phosphorus use must be considered when implementing methods to obtain better genotypes. The aim of this study was to characterize and select popcorn hybrids based on their efficiency and responsiveness to phosphorus use, and estimate their combining abilities and genetic effects via diallel analysis to implement improvement programs for sustainable agriculture. Eight contrasting inbred lines were used to obtain simple hybrids for diallel analysis. Twenty-eight diallelic hybrids plus the popcorn parental lines were evaluated at two different sites under two contrasting environments for soil phosphorus availability (6 × 6 lattice design). Grain yield, popping expansion, and volume of expanded popcorn per hectare were measured. A combined analysis of variance and a test of means were performed. The classification and utilization of the phosphorus use efficiency index, according to the grain yield performance of the hybrids under contrasting environments, was considered. Through model 2 of the Griffing’s diallel analysis method, the general and specific combining abilities were estimated, along with their environmental interactions. The best strategy to obtain genotypes that are efficient and responsive to phosphorus involves exploring popcorn hybrids using genitors that result in the accumulation of additive genes that promote popping expansion. Hybrids P7 × L80, P7 × L59, P7 × L76, and P6 × L80 presented promising results and may be evaluated as cultivation options in phosphorus-deficient soils."
https://openalex.org/W2946410634,"Transcription factors (TFs) are a special class of DNA-binding proteins that orchestrate gene transcription by recruiting other TFs, co-activators or co-repressors. Their combinatorial interplay in higher organisms maintains homeostasis and governs cell identity by finely controlling and regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Despite the rich literature on the importance of cooperative TFs for deciphering the mechanisms of individual regulatory programs that control tissue specificity in several organisms such as human, mouse, or Drosophila melanogaster, to date, there is still need for a comprehensive study to detect specific TF cooperations in regulatory processes of cattle tissues. To address the needs of knowledge about specific combinatorial gene regulation in cattle tissues, we made use of three publicly available RNA-seq datasets and obtained tissue-specific gene (TSG) sets for ten tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, duodenum, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, colon, spleen and testis). By analyzing these TSG-sets, tissue-specific TF cooperations of each tissue have been identified. The results reveal that similar to the combinatorial regulatory events of model organisms, TFs change their partners depending on their biological functions in different tissues. Particularly with regard to preferential partner choice of the transcription factors STAT3 and NR2C2, this phenomenon has been highlighted with their five different specific cooperation partners in multiple tissues. The information about cooperative TFs could be promising: i) to understand the molecular mechanisms of regulating processes; and ii) to extend the existing knowledge on the importance of single TFs in cattle tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2945036534,"Dystrophic neurites and activated microglia are one of the main neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the use of supplements with omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reduced risk and lessened AD pathology, it still remains elusive whether such a treatment could affect dystrophic neurites (DNs) formation and microglia/macrophage behavior in the early phase of disease. We analyzed the effects of short-term (3 weeks) fish oil supplementation on DNs formation, tau hyperphosphorylation, Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Aβ42) levels and microglial/macrophage response to AD pathology in the parietal cortex of 4-month-old 5xFAD mice, a mouse model of AD. The present study shows for the first time that short-term FO supplementation applied in presymptomatic stage of AD, alters the behaviour of microglia/macrophages prompting them to establish a physical barrier around amyloid plaques. This barrier significantly suppresses DNs formation through the reduction of both Aβ content and tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, the short-term FO treatment neither suppresses inflammation nor enhances phagocytic properties of microglia/macrophages in the response to Aβ pathology, the effects most commonly attributed to the fish oil supplementation. Our findings suggest that fish oil consumption may play an important role in modulating microglial/macrophage response and ameliorating the AD pathology in presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2946080958,"The extant diversity of horses (family Equidae) represents a small fraction of that occurring over their evolutionary history. One such lost lineage is the subgenus Sussemionus, which is thought to have become extinct during the Middle Pleistocene. However, recent molecular studies and morphological analysis have revealed that one of their representatives, E. ovodovi, did exist in Siberia during the Late Pleistocene. Fossil materials of E. ovodovi have thus far only been found in Russia. In this study, we extracted DNA from three equid fossil specimens excavated from northeastern China dated at 12,770-12,596, 29,525-28,887 and 40,201-38,848 cal. yBP, respectively, and retrieved three near-complete mitochondrial genomes from the specimens. Phylogenetic analyses cluster the Chinese haplotypes together with previously published Russian E. ovodovi, strongly supporting the assignment of these samples to this taxon. The molecular identification of E. ovodovi in northeastern China extends the known geographical range of this fossil species by several thousand kilometers to the east. The estimated coalescence time of all E. ovodovi haplotypes is approximately 199 Kya, with the Chinese haplotypes coalescing approximately 130 Kya. With a radiocarbon age of 12,770-12,596 cal. yBP, the youngest sample in this study represents the first E. ovodovi sample dating to the terminal Pleistocene, moving the extinction date of this species forwards considerably compared to previously documented fossils. Overall, comparison of our three mitochondrial genomes with the two published ones suggests a genetic diversity similar to several extant species of the genus Equus."

Setting Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, the main referral hospital of Zanzibar, Tanzania, from 1 April 2017 until 31 December 2018. Population All women, pregnant or until 42 days after the end of pregnancy, admitted at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, the tertiary referral hospital in Zanzibar. Methods Cases of maternal morbidity and mortality were evaluated according to WHO’s near-miss approach. The approach’s performance was determined by calculating its accuracy through sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios. The approach’s validity was assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the number of organ dysfunction markers and risk of mortality. Main outcomes measures Correlation between number of organ dysfunction markers and risk of mortality, sensitivity and specificity. Results 26,842 women were included. There were 335 with a severe maternal outcome: 256 maternal near-miss cases and 79 maternal deaths. No signs of organ dysfunction were documented in only 4 of the 79 cases of maternal death. The number of organ dysfunction markers was highly correlated to the risk of mortality with Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.89. Conclusions WHO’s near-miss approach adequately identifies women at high risk of maternal mortality in Zanzibar’s referral hospital. There is a strong correlation between the number of markers of organ dysfunction and mortality risk."
https://openalex.org/W2946251907,"Background Intimate partner violence is a major challenges faced by women especially in developing world. Its consequences range from personal health problems up to countrywide loss of productivity and poverty. There is limited empirical evidence documenting intimate partner violence and underlying reasons in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of intimate partner violence and associated factors in Ethiopia. Methods We analyzed the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. About 2,750 women aged 15–49 years were included in the survey. Intimate partner violence was measured in three dimensions: physical, emotional and sexual violence. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify independent predictors. Variables with p-value less than 0.05 were considered as significantly associated with dimensions of violence. All analysis were adjusted for clusters and sample weights. Results Overall 32.5% of Ethiopian women experienced at least one type of intimate partner violence. Physical and emotional violence were each experienced by 22.5% of the women, while 9.6% of the study participants encountered sexual violence. The age difference between a woman and her intimate partner has a positive effect on emotional and sexual violence while the opposite is true for physical violence. Moreover, physical violence was significantly associated with place of residence, and husband education. Both emotional and sexual violence were predicted by wealth of the household and husband’s employment status. In addition to these, lower educational status of the partner affects emotional violence positively. Conclusion Substantial proportion of women in Ethiopia continue to suffer from intimate partner violence. Physical and emotional violence were much more common than sexual violence. In the light of determinants, we have reported in here, we recommend empowering women in all realm of life by improving their socio-economic status with focus to their educational and economic status."
https://openalex.org/W2946253525,"White bodies (WB), multilobulated soft tissue that wraps the optic tracts and optic lobes, have been considered the hematopoietic organ of the cephalopods. Its glandular appearance and its lobular morphology suggest that different parts of the WB may perform different functions, but a detailed functional analysis of the octopus WB is lacking. The aim of this study is to describe the transcriptomic profile of WB to better understand its functions, with emphasis on the difference between sexes during reproductive events. Then, validation via qPCR was performed using different tissues to find out tissue-specific transcripts. High differentiation in signaling pathways was observed in the comparison of female and male transcriptomic profiles. For instance, the expression of genes involved in the androgen receptor-signaling pathway were detected only in males, whereas estrogen receptor showed higher expression in females. Highly expressed genes in males enriched oxidation-reduction and apoptotic processes, which are related to the immune response. On the other hand, expression of genes involved in replicative senescence and the response to cortisol were only detected in females. Moreover, the transcripts with higher expression in females enriched a wide variety of signaling pathways mediated by molecules like neuropeptides, integrins, MAPKs and receptors like TNF and Toll-like. In addition, these putative neuropeptide transcripts, showed higher expression in females’ WB and were not detected in other analyzed tissues. These results suggest that the differentiation in signaling pathways in white bodies of O. maya influences the physiological dimorphism between females and males during the reproductive phase."
https://openalex.org/W2945075192,"The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenic role of obesity on blinding eye diseases in a population of severely obese patients with no history of eye diseases, and to verify whether weight loss induced by bariatric surgery may have a protective effect.This was a pilot, monocentric, prospective, and open label study conducted at the University Hospital of Pisa. Fifty-seven severely obese patients with a mean body mass index value of 44.1 ± 6 kg/m2 were consecutively recruited and received a complete ophthalmological evaluation and optical coherence tomography. Twenty-nine patients who underwent gastric bypass were evaluated also 3 months, and 1 year after surgery.At baseline, blood pressure value were directly and significantly related to intraocular pressure values (p<0.05, R = 0.35). Blood pressure values were also significantly and inversely related to retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, particularly in the temporal sector (RE p<0.05 r-0.30; LE p<0.01, R = -0.43). Moreover, minimum foveal thickness values were significantly and inversely associated with body mass index (RE p<0.02, R = -0.40; LE p<0.02, R = -0.30). A significant reduction of body mass index (p<0.05) and a significant (p<0.05) improvement of blood pressure was observed three months and one year after gastric bypass, which were significantly associated with an increase in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and minimum foveal thickness values in both eyes (p<0.05).The results of this study suggest that obese patients may have a greater susceptibility to develop glaucomatous optic nerve head damage and age-related macular degeneration. Moreover, weight reduction and improvement of comorbidities obtained by bariatric surgery may be effective in preventing eye disease development by improving retinal nerve fiber layer and foveal thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2946340351,"Comparative studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) according to the age of onset have found differences between early-onset CRC (EOCRC) and late-onset CRC (LOCRC). Using this as a starting point, we wished to determine whether intermediate-onset CRC (IOCRC) might also be considered as an independent group within CRC. We performed a retrospective comparative study of the clinicopathological and familial features, as well as of the symptoms and their duration, of a total of 272 subjects diagnosed with CRC classified into three groups according to the age-of-onset (98 EOCRC, 83 IOCRC and 91 LOCRC). The results show that from a clinicopathological point of view, IOCRC shared certain features with EOCRC (gender, prognosis), and with LOCRC (multiple primary CRCs), whereas it also had characteristics that were specific for IOCRC (mean number of associated polyps). A gradual progression was observed from EOCRC to LOCRC from a greater family aggregation to sporadic cases, in parallel with a change of Lynch Syndrome cases to the sporadic microsatellite instability pathway, with the IOCRC being a boundary group that is more related to EOCRC. With respect to symptoms, duration and correlation with stages, IOCRC appeared more similar to EOCRC. Clinically, IOCRC behaves as a transitional group between EOCRC and LOCRC, with features in common with both groups, but also with IOCRC-specific features. Excluding cases with familial cancer history, the awareness for EOCRC diagnosis should be extended to IOCRC."
https://openalex.org/W2946372985,"Drosophila community composition is complex in temperate regions with different abundance of flies and species across the growing season. Monitoring Drosophila populations provides insights into the phenology of both native and invasive species. Over a single growing season, we collected Drosophila at regular intervals and determined the number of individuals of the nine species we found in Kansas, USA. Species varied in their presence and abundance through the growing season with peak diversity occurring after the highest seasonal temperatures. We developed models for the abundance of the most common species, Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. algonquin, and the recent invasive species, D. suzukii. These models revealed that temperature played the largest role in abundance of each species across the season. For the two most commonly studied species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, the best models indicate shifted thermal optima compared to laboratory studies, implying that fluctuating temperature may play a greater role in the physiology and ecology of these insects than indicated by laboratory studies, and should be considered in global climate change studies."
https://openalex.org/W2946828120,"Sexual appeals are widely used in advertising to attract consumers’ attention. It has already been proved that they influence the addressee’s cognitive processing, which in turn raises the question if sexual appeals may pose a serious threat for road safety when used in roadside advertising. Three studies were designed to answer this question. Study I was a nationwide survey (N = 1095) which revealed that drivers subjectively perceive sexual contents in roadside advertising as distracting and dangerous. Study II was a modified version of the Attentional Network Test (N = 1063) which proved that in cognitive tasks reaction time increases in line with the sexual content of advertisements. Study III was a simulator study (N = 55) which confirmed that driving characteristics change when sexually-oriented advertisements are located along the road. These studies have led us to a conclusion that sexually appealing cues in roadside advertising may pose a threat for road safety."
https://openalex.org/W2945880153,"Introduction Volunteer befriending can be used to address social isolation in patients with psychosis. Traditionally this involves face-to-face encounters between a volunteer and a patient, but modern digital technology also makes it possible to have these interactions remotely. This study aimed to explore the views and interests of patients with psychosis about different formats of volunteering, face-to-face or digitally. Methods A survey was conducted with patients with psychotic disorders in community mental health teams in London. Questions covered socio-demographic characteristics, quality of life, loneliness, views on the different formats of volunteering and types of volunteers, and their interest in getting volunteering support, face-to-face or digitally. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate potential predictors of interest in getting volunteering support face-to-face or digitally. Results A total of 151 patients with psychotic disorders were included in this study. More than half of the patients (n = 87, 57.6%) had not heard about these volunteering programs. Many were interested in getting face-to-face (n = 87, 57.6%) and digital (n = 56, 37.1%) volunteering. For the face-to-face encounters, most preferred them to be weekly (n = 36, 41.4%), for one-hour (n = 32, 36.8%), and with an open-ended relationship (n = 45, 51.7%). For the digital contacts, most preferred them to be weekly (n = 17, 30.9%) and through text messages (n = 26, 46.4%). A minority of patients (n = 20, 13.2%) did not use digital technology. Patients with lower quality of life were significantly more likely to prefer face-to-face volunteering (p < .05). Younger patients and with fewer years of diagnosis were significantly more likely to prefer digital volunteering (p < .05). Conclusions The variability in patients’ interests suggests that different formats of volunteer support should be offered. Digital volunteering may become more important in the future, since many younger patients are interested in it."
https://openalex.org/W2946159408,"The medication regimen complexity index (MRCI), originally developed in English, is a reliable and valid tool to assess the complexity of pharmacotherapy. This study aimed to validate the Korean version of MRCI (MRCI-K). A cross-cultural methodological study comprising 335 discharged patients of a tertiary hospital in Korea was conducted. The translation process included translation into Korean by two clinical pharmacists, back translation by two native speakers, and a pretest of the tool, culminating in the Korean version of MRCI-K. Reliability analysis was assessed using inter-rater and test-retest reliability with 25 randomly selected patients. Convergent and discriminant validity analyses were conducted by correlating MRCI scores with medication number, age, sex, adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports, and length of stay. The criterion validity was confirmed through evaluation by a nine-member expert panel that subjectively ranked these regimens. The reliability analysis demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.977), and the intraclass correlation coefficient exceeded 0.90 for all cases. The correlation coefficient for the number of medications was 0.955 (P < 0.001). Weak significant correlations were observed with age and length of stay. The MRCI-K group with ADR reports scored higher (mean, 31.8) than the group without ADR reports (mean, 27.3). The expert panel's ranking had a stronger correlation with the MRCI ranking than the medication number ranking. MRCI-K has similar reliability and validity as MRCI and is useful for analyzing therapeutic regimens with potential applications in both practice and research in Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2945523588,"Background The prognosis of lung cancer with malignant pericardial effusion is very terrible owing to the impact of cardiac tamponade. The aim of our study seeks to identify prognostic factors and establish a prognostic nomogram of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with malignant pericardial effusion. Methods NSCLC patients with malignant pericardial effusion between 2010 and 2014 are searched from SEER database.Cancer-specific death of these patients are analyzed through the Kaplan–Meier method, Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk model. Prognostic nomogram of cancer-specific death is performed and validated with concordance index (C-index), calibration plots and internal validation population. Propensity score matching is used to evaluate whether chemotherapy affected the survival of study population. Results 696 eligible NSCLC patients are involved in the study population, with 22.7% of 1-year survival rate and 8.9% of 2-year survival rate. Laterality, AJCC N, AJCC T, and chemotherapy are regarded as independent prognostic factors of cancer-specific death in the Cox proportional hazards model and competing risk model. The C-index of established nomogram is 0.703(95%CI:0.68–0.73) for cancer-specific death in the study population with acceptable calibration, which is significantly higher than classical TNM stage(C-index = 0.56, 95%CI:0.52–0.60). After 1:1 propensity score matching, chemotherapy potentially reduces the risk of cancer-specific death (HR = 0.42 95%CI: 0.31–0.58) of NSCLC with pericardial effusion. Conclusions NSCLC with malignant pericardial effusion harbors low overall survival. One prognostic nomogram based on laterality, AJCC N, AJCC T and chemotherapy is developed for cancer-specific death to predict 1-year and 2-year survival rate with good performance."

We show that the bootstrap based test is robust to a variety of distributional scenarios in terms of proper Type I error control."
https://openalex.org/W2946053174,"The aim of this study was to investigate an accuracy of modified CAD/CAM generated wafers for orthognathic surgery. A total of 20 patients who had undergone bimaxillary orthognathic surgery were included and divided into two groups: A conventional CAD/CAM generated intermediate wafer and a modified CAD/CAM generated intermediate wafer. A series of CT images were taken to compare the virtual simulations with the actual postoperative outcomes(1 month after surgery). In conventional group, the mean difference of maxillary position between virtual simulation models and postoperative results was 0.78mm and overall average error within 1mm was observed in 66.4% of the repositioned maxilla. In modified group, the mean difference was 0.77mm and overall average error within 1mm was observed in 68.3%. There were no significant statistic differences between two groups in maxillary position. This study suggests that the CAD/CAM generated wafer provides excellent accuracy. The modified CAD/CAM wafer was only comparable to conventional design in accuracy and it cannot guarantee the superior precision. However, the modified design could be beneficial in cases with unstable condylar position or for inexperienced surgeons."
https://openalex.org/W2946201782,"Body mass index (BMI) kg/m2 is a key screening tool for under-nutrition in adults, but difficult to obtain in immobile or unwell patients, particuarly in low resource settings, due to inability to accurately measure both weight and height. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is used to assess under-nutrition in children under 5 years but no standardised cut-off values exist for adults. In a cohort of adult Filipino patients admitted to a tuberculosis ward we assessed (i) cut-offs for MUAC to predict moderate under-nutrition (BMI <17kg/m2), (ii) the performance of limb lengths to predict height and; (iii) associations of body fat percentage from skinfolds and hand grip-strength with BMI. In 303 patients with MUAC and BMI at admission, aged 18–80 years (mean = 45.5, SD:14.8), BMI ranged from 11.2–30.6 kg/m2 and 141 (46.5%) had BMI <17.0 kg/m2. Using receiver operator curves, MUAC cut-offs were identified as <20.5cm for males (sensitivity: 89%, specificity: 84%) and <18.5cm for females (sensitivity: 91%, specificity: 89%), for BMI<17.0 kg/m2. Using published equations, knee height had the lowest mean difference between predicted and measured heights compared to ulnar or demi-span: (-0.98 cm, 95% CI: -1.51/-0.44). Both grip-strength and body fat percentage were positively associated with BMI, in separate linear regression models with exposure-age-sex interactions (adjusted-R-squared values: 0.15, 0.66, respectively). MUAC can predict moderate acute under-nutrition with high positive predictive value. Further research is required to determine the performance of alternative measures to BMI to predict mortality or adverse outcomes in acutely unwell patients."
https://openalex.org/W2945229143,"This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between body weight (ΔBW) or body volume variations (ΔBV) and inter- or intra-fractional variations (Δ(inter) or Δ(intra)) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing radiotherapy (RT). This study enrolled patients with HNC from December 2015 to December 2017. All patients underwent curative intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) either as definitive or adjuvant treatment. Six-dimensional inter- and intra-fractional variations (Δ(inter) and Δ(intra)) were obtained with ExacTrac (BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany) system. BV was measured 7.5 cm cranio-caudally from the centre using cone beam computed tomography. The BW, BV, and Δ(inter) were calculated based on the value obtained on the first treatment day after each simulation. Both Δ(inter) and Δ(intra) were considered in calculating the optimal margins for planning target volume (PTV), which was calculated using van Herk’s formula. In total, 678 fractions with 39 simulations in 22 patients were analysed. The average ΔBW and ΔBV was -0.43±1.90 kg (range, -7.3 to 5.0) and -24.34±69.0 cc (range, -247.15 to 214.88), respectively. In correlation analysis, Δ(intra) was more associated with ΔBW or ΔBV than Δ(inter). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed Δ(intra) could differentiate ΔBW from ΔBV, while Δ(inter) could not. The optimal margins for PTV considering both Δ(inter) and Δ(intra) were 3.70 mm, 4.52 mm, and 5.12 mm for the right-left, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. In conclusion, the PTV margin of 6 mm for anterior-posterior direction and 5 mm for the other directions were needed. ΔBW or ΔBV correlated with Δ(intra) rather than Δ(inter). Therefore, ΔBW or ΔBV should be assessed for accurate IMRT in patients with HNC."
https://openalex.org/W2945310755,"Background Critical care intensity is known to vary across regions and centers, yet the mechanisms remain unidentified. Physician behaviors have been implicated in the variability of intensive care near the end of life, but physician characteristics that may underlie this association have not been determined. Purpose We sought to identify behavioral attributes that vary among intensivists to generate hypotheses for mechanisms of intensivist-attributable variation in critical care delivery. Methods We administered a questionnaire to intensivists who participated in a prior cohort study in which intensivists made prognostic estimates. We evaluated the degree to which scores on six attribute measures varied across intensivists. Measures were selected for their relevance to preference-sensitive critical care: a modified End-of-Life Preferences (EOLP) scale, Life Orientation Test–Revised (LOT-R), Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE), Physicians' Reactions to Uncertainty (PRU) scale, Collett-Lester Fear of Death (CLFOD) scale, and a test of omission bias. We conducted regression analyses assessing relationships between intensivists’ attribute scores and their prognostic accuracy, as physicians’ prognostic accuracy may influence preference-sensitive decisions. Results 20 of 25 eligible intensivists (80%) completed the questionnaire. Intensivists’ scores on the EOLP, LOT-R, PRU, CLFOD, and omission bias measures varied considerably, while their responses on the JSE scale did not. There were no consistent associations between attribute scores and prognostic accuracy. Conclusions Intensivists vary in feasibly measurable attributes relevant to preference-sensitive critical care delivery. These attributes represent candidates for future research aimed at identifying mechanisms of clinician-attributable variation in critical care and developing effective interventions to reduce undue variation."
https://openalex.org/W2945471526,"Plant in vitro vegetative propagation using classical semi-solid culture medium is limited due to the low degree of automation, suboptimal nutrient availability and induced physiological stress which often reduce its efficiency. Temporary Immersion System (TIS) emerged as an innovative approach to optimize and eliminate the drawbacks associated with the conventional system of micropropagation. In this study, both Dioscorea and Musa spp. were subjected to conventional semi-solid culture media, complete immersion in shaking liquid culture media and TIS using RITA bioreactor. In vitro grown plantlets were screened for possible vegetative changes using agro-morphological descriptors while genetic and methylation differences were assessed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). In vitro results showed that the number of shoots produced in Musa spp. varied significantly (P≤0.001) with the type of culture system. The highest mean shoot produced was observed with TIS (28.40) and the least using semi-solid culture medium (1.13). For Dioscorea spp., there was no significant interaction between the hormone combination and the culture system. However, the lowest mean shoot value (1.55) was observed in the semi-solid culture medium. Genetic analysis via AFLP using 15 primer pair combinations revealed that the 3 culture systems maintained genetic variation for Musa and Dioscorea spp. under in vitro and field conditions. Results showed 99% and 91% of the total bands were polymorphic under in vitro and field conditions respectively for Musa and 100% polymorphism for Dioscorea under in vitro and field conditions. Methylation investigation via MSAP using 12 primer pair combinations showed 25% and 46% polymorphic methylated-sensitive loci, 100% and 78% of non-methylated loci of the total bands generated under in vitro and field conditions respectively. Unmethylated (HPA+/MSP+) levels were highest in TIS (0.0842) as compared to CI (0.0227) and SS (0.0161) while full methylation or absence of target (HPA-/MSP-) was lowest in TIS (0.5890) and highest in SS (0.7138). For Dioscorea, 52% and 53% methylated sensitive loci and 100% non-methylated loci were polymorphic under in vitro and field conditions respectively. Although in vitro plant tissue culture techniques led to methylation at some loci of both species, there were no observable changes in the phenotype of both crops under field conditions. This also confirmed that not all methylation events lead to phenotypic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2946636901,"HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6) typically circulates in Southeast Asia and exhibits the highest genetic diversity among the eight HCV genotypes. In our previous work, a group of HCV-6 sequences was not clearly classified. Here, we further characterized this HCV-6 variant and analyzed the evolutionary history of the enlarged HCV-6 family.Blood samples from eight HCV seropositive samples collected from intravenous drug users (IDUs) in 2014 in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length HCV genome sequences were amplified by using reverse transcription PCR followed by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Bayesian evolutionary analysis was performed with the complete coding region sequences of subtype 6a-6xh.The eight genomes had the same coding region of 9051 nucleotides. The complete coding region sequences of the eight HCV isolates formed a distinct phylogenetic group from the previously assigned HCV-6 subtypes (6a-6xf), however which clustered with 6xg reference sequences that were found in Kachin State, Myanmar, and recently assigned and released. The p-distances of the eight isolates to subtype 6a-6xf and 6xh ranged from 0.143 to 0.283. Based on the HCV-6 complete coding region sequences, we constructed a timescaled phylogenetic tree to reveal the HCV-6 evolutionary history, in which there were four HCV-6 phylogenetic subsets, whose median tMRCAs were 294.8, 388.5, 348.5 and 197.0 years ago, respectively. Subtype 6xg clustered into Subset I, and had the most recent common ancestor with subtype 6n, which dated back to 101.2 (95% HPD: 78.7, 125.8) years ago. The genetic evolutionary analysis further confirmed that subtype 6xg originated from Myanmar, and transmitted to Dehong through cross-border IDUs.The HCV-6 variant characterized in this study belonged to newly assigned subtype 6xg. Our finding further confirmed the assignment of 6xg. HCV-6 family was highly divers and had a complicated evolutionary history in Southeast Asia. It is necessary to further characterize HCV-6 genetics in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2945199160,"We tested the hypothesis that phonosemantic iconicity––i.e., a motivated resonance of sound and meaning––might not only be found on the level of individual words or entire texts, but also in word combinations such that the meaning of a target word is iconically expressed, or highlighted, in the phonetic properties of its immediate verbal context. To this end, we extracted single lines from German poems that all include a word designating high or low dominance, such as large or small, strong or weak, etc. Based on insights from previous studies, we expected to find more vowels with a relatively short distance between the first two formants (low formant dispersion) in the immediate context of words expressing high physical or social dominance than in the context of words expressing low dominance. Our findings support this hypothesis, suggesting that neighboring words can form iconic dyads in which the meaning of one word is sound-iconically reflected in the phonetic properties of adjacent words. The construct of a contiguity-based phono-semantic iconicity opens many venues for future research well beyond lines extracted from poems."

However, associations between chronic antibiotic use and weight among adults in the general population are unknown. Subjects/Methods The NIEHS Sister Study is a longitudinal cohort of sisters of women with breast cancer. We examined associations between chronic antibiotic use (≥ 3 months) during the fourth decade of life (30–39 years) and subsequent obesity at enrollment (mean age = 55) via logistic regression. We also examined associations between chronic antibiotic use in the 5 years and 12 months prior to enrollment and weight gain after enrollment in linear mixed models. Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, education, urban/rural status, age, and smoking. Results In adjusted analyses (n = 50,237), chronic penicillin use during the 4th decade of life was associated with obesity at enrollment (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40, 2.87), and use in the 5 years prior to enrollment was associated with increased BMI change after enrollment (β 1.00 95% CI 0.01, 2.00). Use of bactericidals (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.29, 2.26) during the 4th decade of life was also associated with obesity at enrollment. Associations for penicillins and bactericidals were consistent across indications for use. Bacteriostatic use in the 5 years prior to enrollment was associated with a reduction in BMI after enrollment (β -0.52, 95% CI -1.04, 0.00), and tetracycline use during the 4th decade of life was associated with reduced odds of obesity at enrollment (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56, 0.92). However, these inverse associations were only present for those who reported taking antibiotics for skin purposes. Cephalosporins, macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonamides were not associated with BMI change over time. Conclusions Chronic use of antibiotics during adulthood may have long-lasting impacts on BMI. Associations may differ by antibiotic class, and confounding by indication may be important for some antibiotic classes."
https://openalex.org/W2946420435,"Classical- (C-) and atypical L-type bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions cause different pathological phenotypes in cattle brains, and the disease-associated forms of each prion protein (PrPSc) has a dissimilar biochemical signature. Bovine C-BSE prions are the causative agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. To date, human infection with L-BSE prions has not been reported, but they can be transmitted experimentally from cows to cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), a non-human primate model. When transmitted to monkeys, C- and L-BSE prions induce different pathological phenotypes in the brain. However, when isolated from infected brains, the two prion proteins (PrPSc) have similar biochemical signatures (i.e., electrophoretic mobility, glycoforms, and resistance to proteinase K). Such similarities suggest the possibility that L-BSE prions alter their virulence to that of C-BSE prions during propagation in monkeys. To clarify this possibility, we conducted bioassays using inbred mice. C-BSE prions with or without propagation in monkeys were pathogenic to mice, and exhibited comparable incubation periods in secondary passage in mice. By contrast, L-BSE prions, either with or without propagation in monkeys, did not cause the disease in mice, indicating that the pathogenicity of L-BSE prions does not converge towards a C-BSE prion type in this primate model. These results suggest that, although C- and L-BSE prions propagated in cynomolgus monkeys exhibit similar biochemical PrPSc signatures and consist of the monkey amino acid sequence, the two prions maintain strain-specific conformations of PrPSc in which they encipher and retain unique pathogenic traits."

This study investigates whether, in these older persons, changes in satisfaction with their GP, on receiving improved integrated care, is related to their perceived health state.Using the Integrated Systematic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (aimed at improving person- centered integrated care) this study compared changes in satisfaction with the GP in older persons (aged ≥75 years) with a high level of complex health problems on receiving integrated care, stratified for perceived health state at baseline. Satisfaction with the GP was registered on a 5-point Likert scale. Perceived health state was estimated with the Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey-Composite End Point (TOPICS-CEP) at baseline, stratified into 33% percentiles. Differences in satisfaction change between the intervention and usual care/control groups (overall and stratified for perceived health state) are presented by percentages of 'very satisfied' participants and improving or deteriorating 1 or more points on the Likert scale. At baseline, the intervention (n = 151) and control group (n = 603) were mainly female (75%) and living alone (62%); mean age was 83 years. Medical status, perceived health state and characteristics of participants were similar. Overall, at baseline 44.4% of respondents in the intervention group were 'very satisfied' compared with 37.1% at follow-up, (difference -7.3%). In the control group, 'very satisfied' at baseline was 32% and at follow up 29.2% (difference -2.8%). The p-value for this difference in change is 0.56.

The aim of this study was to generate a new angiosarcoma model to improve research on hepatic angiosarcoma. Methods Pigs sus scrofa were treated with different regimens of diethylnitrosamine (DENA). Tissues were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Serum parameters were determined. Angiosarcoma tissue was investigated for chromosomal aberrations by aCGH analysis. Results Animals of almost all different treatment regimens developed a multitude of variable liver lesions. Different tumor types such as granulation tissue type, cellular-like, hyalinization necrosis-like, angiosarcoma-like, dysplastic nodule-like, hepatocellular-like, glandular structure-like, and leiomyoma-like lesions were observed. Weekly treatment with 15 mg/kg for up to 52 weeks or a single shot of 200 mg/kg DENA led to the development of hepatic angiosarcomas. aCGH analysis of angiosarcoma tissue revealed increased alterations in tumors compared to non-tumorous tissue. Most of the chromosomal alterations were found on chromosomes 6, 7, 12, and 14. Conclusion In this preliminary study treatment of sus scrofa with weekly injections of 15 mg/kg DENA results in a new model for primary hepatic angiosarcoma. This model may help to shed light on the pathomechanisms of primary hepatic angiosarcoma and might therefore open new treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2946050140,"The majority of maize planted in the US is genetically-engineered to express insecticidal properties, including Cry1Ab protein, which is designed to resist the European maize borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). After crop harvest, these proteins can be leached into adjacent streams from crop detritus left on fields. The environmental fate of Cry1Ab proteins in aquatic habitats is not well known. From June-November, we performed monthly short-term additions of leached Cry1Ab into four experimental streams with varying benthic substrate to estimate Cry1Ab transport and removal. At the start of the experiments, when rocks were bare, we found no evidence of Cry1Ab removal from the water column, but uptake steadily increased as biofilm colonized the stream substrate. Overall, Cry1Ab uptake was strongly predicted by measures of biofilm accumulation, including algal chlorophyll a and percent cover of filamentous algae. Average Cry1Ab uptake velocity (vf = 0.059 ± 0.009 mm s-1) was comparable to previously reported uptake of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC; mean vf = 0.04 ± 0.008 mm s-1). Although Cry1Ab has been shown to rapidly degrade in stream water, benthic biofilms may decrease the distance proteins are transported in lotic systems. These results emphasize that once the Cry1Ab protein is leached, subsequent detection and transport through agricultural waterways is dependent on the structure and biology of receiving stream ecosystems."

A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model was developed to describe the evolution of HIV RNA load and CD4 cell count (efficacy outcomes) in relation to efavirenz plasma concentration. Individual CYP2B6 516 G>T genotype data were not available for this analysis. A score (ISEFV) quantifying the effect of efavirenz concentrations on the long-term HIV replication was calculated from efavirenz concentrations and PD parameters and, a value of ISEFV below which HIV replication is likely not suppressed was determined. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of the risk of viral replication with ISEFV, and with efavirenz mid-dose concentration(C12).At treatment initiation, median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 8 years (5 to 10), body weight 17 kg (14 to 23), HIV RNA load 5.1 log10 copies/mL (4.6 to 5.4), and CD4 cell count 71 cells/mm3. A model of PK-PD viral dynamics assuming that efavirenz decreases the rate of infected host cells adequately described the relationship of interest. After adjusting for age, baseline HIV RNA load and CD4 cell counts an ISEFV <85% was significantly associated with a higher risk of viral replication (p-value <0.001) while no significant association was observed with C12 <1.0 mg/L.The ISEFV score was a good predictor of viral replication in children on efavirenz-based treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2945417630,"Background A community’s cultural beliefs, attitudes and discourse can affect their responses in surveys. Knowledge of these cultural factors and how to comply with them or adjust for them during data collection can improve data quality. Objective This study describes implications of features of Gambian culture related to women’s reproductive health, and mortality, when collecting data in surveys. Methods 13 in-depth interviews of female interviewers and a focus group discussion among male interviewers were conducted in two rural health and demographic surveillance systems as well as three key informant interviews in three regions in The Gambia. Results From the fieldworker’s viewpoint, questions relating to reproduction were best asked by women as culturally pregnancies should be concealed, and menstruation is considered a sensitive topic. Gambians were reluctant to speak about decedents and the Fula did not like to be counted, potentially affecting estimation of mortality. Asking about siblings proved problematic among the Fula and Serahule communities. Proposals made to overcome these challenges were that culturally-appropriate metaphors and symbols should be used to discuss sensitive matters and to enumerating births/deaths singly instead of collecting summary totals, which had threatening connotations. This was as opposed to training interviewers to ask standardised and precise verbatim questions. Contribution This paper presents indigenous Gambian solutions by fieldworkers to culturally sensitive topics when collecting pregnancy outcomes and mortality data in demographic and health surveys. For researchers collecting maternal mortality data, it highlights the potential shortcomings of the sibling history methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2946277881,"ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase that regulates various neuronal events including formation of the axon, dendrites and dendritic spines, and synaptic plasticity through actin cytoskeleton remodeling and endosomal trafficking. EFA6C, also known as Psd2, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf6 that is preferentially expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult mice, particularly in Purkinje cells. However, the roles of EFA6C in cerebellar development and functions remain unknown. In this study, we generated global EFA6C knockout (KO) mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and investigated their cerebellar phenotypes by histological and behavioral analyses. Histological analyses revealed that EFA6C KO mice exhibited normal gross anatomy of the cerebellar cortex, in terms of the thickness and cellularity of each layer, morphology of Purkinje cells, and distribution patterns of parallel fibers, climbing fibers, and inhibitory synapses. Electron microscopic observation of the cerebellar molecular layer revealed that the density of asymmetric synapses of Purkinje cells was significantly lower in EFA6C KO mice compared with wild-type control mice. However, behavioral analyses using accelerating rotarod and horizontal optokinetic response tests failed to detect any differences in motor coordination, learning or adaptation between the control and EFA6C KO mice. These results suggest that EFA6C plays ancillary roles in cerebellar development and motor functions."
https://openalex.org/W2944961472,"Videos of moving faces are more flattering than static images of the same face, a phenomenon dubbed the Frozen Face Effect. This may reflect an aesthetic preference for faces viewed in a more ecological context than still photographs. In the current set of experiments, we sought to determine whether this effect is unique to facial processing, or if motion confers an aesthetic benefit to other stimulus categories as well, such as bodies and objects-that is, a more generalized 'Frozen Effect' (FE). If motion were the critical factor in the FE, we would expect the video of a body or object in motion to be significantly more appealing than when seen in individual, static frames. To examine this, we asked participants to rate sets of videos of bodies and objects in motion along with the still frames constituting each video. Extending the original FFE, we found that participants rated videos as significantly more flattering than each video's corresponding still images, regardless of stimulus domain, suggesting that the FFE generalizes well beyond face perception. Interestingly, the magnitude of the FE increased with the predictability of stimulus movement. Our results suggest that observers prefer bodies and objects in motion over the same information presented in static form, and the more predictable the motion, the stronger the preference. Motion imbues objects and bodies with greater aesthetic appeal, which has implications for how one might choose to portray oneself in various social media platforms."
