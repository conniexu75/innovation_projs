https://openalex.org/W2124114936,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy is unable to eliminate HIV infection, because the virus persists in latently infected CD4+ T cells—a so-called virus reservoir. Rafick-Pierre Sekaly and his colleagues have shown that central memory CD4+ T cells and transitional memory CD4+ T cells are the main cellular reservoirs for HIV, and they suggest a mechanism that ensures the stability of this reservoir of virus. HIV persists in a reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells in individuals treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Here we identify central memory (TCM) and transitional memory (TTM) CD4+ T cells as the major cellular reservoirs for HIV and find that viral persistence is ensured by two different mechanisms. HIV primarily persists in TCM cells in subjects showing reconstitution of the CD4+ compartment upon HAART. This reservoir is maintained through T cell survival and low-level antigen-driven proliferation and is slowly depleted with time. In contrast, proviral DNA is preferentially detected in TTM cells from aviremic individuals with low CD4+ counts and higher amounts of interleukin-7–mediated homeostatic proliferation, a mechanism that ensures the persistence of these cells. Our results suggest that viral eradication might be achieved through the combined use of strategic interventions targeting viral replication and, as in cancer, drugs that interfere with the self renewal and persistence of proliferating memory T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064876347,"mTOR, part of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR cell-signalling cascade and a target for the antitumour drug rapamycin, is identified here as a regulator of CD8 T-cell differentiation. Despite its primarily immunosuppressive activity, rapamycin can enhance immune responses to experimental vaccines in mice and monkeys. This counterintuitive finding points to the ability to increase the functional qualities of memory T cells as a potential way of enhancing the efficacy of vaccines against pathogens and cancers. Inducing effective memory T-cell responses is a major goal of vaccines against chronic infections and tumours. Here, mTOR, the mammalian target for the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, is shown to enhance the quantity and quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells in mouse and non-human primate models. Memory CD8 T cells are a critical component of protective immunity, and inducing effective memory T-cell responses is a major goal of vaccines against chronic infections and tumours1,2,3. Considerable effort has gone into designing vaccine regimens that will increase the magnitude of the memory response, but there has been minimal emphasis on developing strategies to improve the functional qualities of memory T cells4. Here we show that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin5, also known as FRAP1) is a major regulator of memory CD8 T-cell differentiation, and in contrast to what we expected, the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin has immunostimulatory effects on the generation of memory CD8 T cells. Treatment of mice with rapamycin following acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection enhanced not only the quantity but also the quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells. Similar effects were seen after immunization of mice with a vaccine based on non-replicating virus-like particles. In addition, rapamycin treatment also enhanced memory T-cell responses in non-human primates following vaccination with modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Rapamycin was effective during both the expansion and contraction phases of the T-cell response; during the expansion phase it increased the number of memory precursors, and during the contraction phase (effector to memory transition) it accelerated the memory T-cell differentiation program. Experiments using RNA interference to inhibit expression of mTOR, raptor (also known as 4932417H02Rik) or FKBP12 (also known as FKBP1A) in antigen-specific CD8 T cells showed that mTOR acts intrinsically through the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) pathway to regulate memory T-cell differentiation. Thus these studies identify a molecular pathway regulating memory formation and provide an effective strategy for improving the functional qualities of vaccine- or infection-induced memory T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985839640,"Akt kinase is activated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) in diabetic kidneys, and has important roles in fibrosis, hypertrophy and cell survival in glomerular mesangial cells. However, the mechanisms of Akt activation by TGF-beta are not fully understood. Here we show that TGF-beta activates Akt in glomerular mesangial cells by inducing the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-216a and miR-217, both of which target PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue), an inhibitor of Akt activation. These miRNAs are located within the second intron of a non-coding RNA (RP23-298H6.1-001). The RP23 promoter was activated by TGF-beta and miR-192 through E-box-regulated mechanisms, as shown previously. Akt activation by these miRs led to glomerular mesangial cell survival and hypertrophy, which were similar to the effects of activation by TGF-beta. These studies reveal a mechanism of Akt activation through PTEN downregulation by two miRs, which are regulated by upstream miR-192 and TGF-beta. Due to the diversity of PTEN function, this miR-amplifying circuit may have key roles, not only in kidney disorders, but also in other diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2017151800,"James Lupski and colleagues provide evidence that a replication-based mechanism termed FoSTeS/MMBIR can mediate rearrangements in humans ranging in size from a few hundred base pairs to several megabases. They propose that FoSTeS/MMBIR could be an important mechanism for generating structural variation. We recently proposed a DNA replication–based mechanism of fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) to explain the complex genomic rearrangements associated with a dysmyelinating central nervous system disorder in humans1. The FoSTeS mechanism has been further generalized and molecular mechanistic details have been provided in the microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) model that may underlie many structural variations in genomes from all domains of life2. Here we provide evidence that human genomic rearrangements ranging in size from several megabases to a few hundred base pairs can be generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR. Furthermore, we show that FoSTeS/MMBIR-mediated rearrangements can occur mitotically and can result in duplication or triplication of individual genes or even rearrangements of single exons. The FoSTeS/MMBIR mechanism can explain both the gene duplication-divergence hypothesis3 and exon shuffling4, suggesting an important role in both genome and single-gene evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2046518908,"Although many vertebrate organs, such as kidneys, lungs and liver, are composed of epithelial tubules, little is known of the mechanisms that establish the length or diameter of these tubules. In the kidney, defects in the establishment or maintenance of tubule diameter are associated with one of the most common inherited human disorders, polycystic kidney disease. Here we show that attenuation of Wnt9b signaling during kidney morphogenesis affects the planar cell polarity of the epithelium and leads to tubules with significantly increased diameter. Although previous studies showed that polarized cell divisions maintain the diameter of postnatal kidney tubules, we find that cell divisions are randomly oriented during embryonic development. Our data suggest that diameter is established during early morphogenetic stages by convergent extension processes and maintained by polarized cell divisions. Wnt9b, signaling through the non-canonical Rho/Jnk branch of the Wnt pathway, is necessary for both of these processes."

https://openalex.org/W1990607211,"In fasted mammals, circulating pancreatic glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver in part through the CREB coactivator CRTC2/TORC2. CRTC2 is now shown to function as a dual sensor for fasting signals and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver. Crosstalk between fasting and ER stress pathways at the level of this transcriptional coactivator contributes to glucose homeostasis under lean conditions and to the development of hyperglycaemia in obesity. In fasted mammals, circulating pancreatic glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver in part through the CREB coactivator CRTC2. The production of glucose by the liver is increased in obesity, reflecting chronic increases in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that promote insulin resistance. Here, CRTC2 is shown to function as a dual sensor for fasting signals and ER stress, thereby contributing to glucose homeostasis. In fasted mammals, circulating pancreatic glucagon stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis in part through the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2, also referred to as TORC2)1,2. Hepatic glucose production is increased in obesity, reflecting chronic increases in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that promote insulin resistance3. Whether ER stress also modulates the gluconeogenic program directly, however, is unclear. Here we show that CRTC2 functions as a dual sensor for ER stress and fasting signals. Acute increases in ER stress triggered the dephosphorylation and nuclear entry of CRTC2, which in turn promoted the expression of ER quality control genes through an association with activating transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6α, also known as ATF6)—an integral branch of the unfolded protein response4,5,6,7,8,9. In addition to mediating CRTC2 recruitment to ER stress inducible promoters, ATF6α also reduced hepatic glucose output by disrupting the CREB–CRTC2 interaction and thereby inhibiting CRTC2 occupancy over gluconeogenic genes. Conversely, hepatic glucose output was upregulated when hepatic ATF6α protein amounts were reduced, either by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown or as a result of persistent stress in obesity. Because ATF6α overexpression in the livers of obese mice reversed CRTC2 effects on the gluconeogenic program and lowered hepatic glucose output, our results demonstrate how cross-talk between ER stress and fasting pathways at the level of a transcriptional coactivator contributes to glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2018707048,"Centromeres are specialized chromosomal domains that direct kinetochore assembly during mitosis. CENP-A (centromere protein A), a histone H3-variant present exclusively in centromeric nucleosomes, is thought to function as an epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity. Here we identify the essential centromere protein CENP-N as the first protein to selectively bind CENP-A nucleosomes but not H3 nucleosomes. CENP-N bound CENP-A nucleosomes in a DNA sequence-independent manner, but did not bind soluble CENP-A-H4 tetramers. Mutations in CENP-N that reduced its affinity for CENP-A nucleosomes caused defects in CENP-N localization and had dominant effects on the recruitment of CENP-H, CENP-I and CENP-K to centromeres. Depletion of CENP-N using siRNA (short interfering RNA) led to similar centromere assembly defects and resulted in reduced assembly of nascent CENP-A into centromeric chromatin. These data suggest that CENP-N interprets the information encoded within CENP-A nucleosomes and recruits other proteins to centromeric chromatin that are required for centromere function and propagation."
https://openalex.org/W1990322965,"Despite extensive characterization of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), the biochemical properties of the isolated receptor remain unclear. In light of recent reports, we proposed that the monomeric form of MOR can activate G proteins and be subject to allosteric regulation. A μ-opioid receptor fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YMOR) was constructed and expressed in insect cells. YMOR binds ligands with high affinity, displays agonist-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate binding to Gαi, and is allosterically regulated by coupled Gi protein heterotrimer both in insect cell membranes and as purified protein reconstituted into a phospholipid bilayer in the form of high density lipoprotein particles. Single-particle imaging of fluorescently labeled receptor indicates that the reconstituted YMOR is monomeric. Moreover, single-molecule imaging of a Cy3-labeled agonist, [Lys7, Cys8]dermorphin, illustrates a novel method for studying G protein-coupled receptor-ligand binding and suggests that one molecule of agonist binds per monomeric YMOR. Together these data support the notion that oligomerization of the μ-opioid receptor is not required for agonist and antagonist binding and that the monomeric receptor is the minimal functional unit in regard to G protein activation and strong allosteric regulation of agonist binding by G proteins.

Moreover, we have demonstrated that agonist binding to a monomeric β2-adrenergic receptor, another class A GPCR, can be allosterically regulated by G proteins (14Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P.

This led us to determine whether a monomer of MOR, a class A GPCR that endogenously binds peptide ligands, is the minimal functional unit required to activate coupled G proteins. We additionally investigated whether agonist binding to monomeric MOR is allosterically regulated by inhibitory G protein heterotrimer. To study the function of monomeric MOR we have purified a modified version of the receptor to near homogeneity. A yellow fluorescent protein was fused to the N terminus of MOR, and this construct (YMOR) was expressed in insect cells for purification. After reconstitution of purified YMOR into rHDL particles, single-molecule imaging of Cy3-labeled and Cy5-labeled YMOR determined that the rHDL particles contained one receptor. This monomeric YMOR sample binds ligands with affinities nearly equivalent to those observed in plasma membrane preparations. Monomeric YMOR efficiently stimulates GTPγS binding to Gi2 heterotrimeric G protein. Gi2 allosteric regulation of agonist binding to rHDL·YMOR was also observed. Single-particle imaging of binding of [Lys7, Cys8]dermorphin-Cy3, a fluorophore-labeled agonist, to rHDL·YMOR supports the notion that the rHDL particles contain a single YMOR. Taken together, these results suggest that a monomeric MOR is the minimal functional unit for ligand binding and G protein activation and illustrate a novel method for imaging ligand binding to opioid receptors.

Pooled apoA-1 was then dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium cholate. Purified apoA-1 was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C until use. HDL particles were reconstituted according to previously reported protocols (14Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7682-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Briefly, 21 mm sodium cholate, 7 mm lipids (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPG) at a molar ratio of 3:2), purified YMOR (DDM-solubilized), and 100 μm purified apoA-1 were solubilized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium cholate. The final concentration of YMOR varied from 0.2 to 0.4 μm, but YMOR always comprised 20% of the total reconstitution volume. In some reconstitutions the lipid component was modified such that porcine polar brain lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used in addition to POPC and POPG for a final concentration of 7 mm lipids at a molar ratio of 1.07:1.5:1 brain lipid:POPC:POPG. Following incubation on ice (1.5–2 h), the samples were added to Bio-BeadsTM (Bio-Rad, 0.05 mg/ml of reconstitution volume) to remove detergent and to form HDL particles. Particles containing YMOR were purified via M1 anti-FLAG immunoaffinity chromatography resin (Sigma) and eluted with 1 mm EDTA plus 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. To assess the efficiency of HDL reconstitution, the total protein concentration of rHDL·YMOR was compared with the concentration of active reconstituted YMOR. FLAG affinity column-purified rHDL·YMOR was resolved from BSA and FLAG peptide on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, and the peak fraction was analyzed for protein content with Amido Black staining (20Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar), whereas [3H]DPN saturation assays were used to measure active YMOR content. YMOR reconstituted into HDL was stored on ice until further use. Gi2 heterotrimer (Gαi2-His6Gβ1-Gγ2) was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (21Kozasa T. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis.in: Manning D.R. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 23-28Google Scholar). The concentration of active G protein was determined by filter binding of 20 μm [35S]GTPγS (isotopically diluted) in 30 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% C12E10, and 1 mm dithiothreitol after 1 h of incubation at room temperature. Purified G protein heterotrimer was added to preformed, FLAG-purified rHDL·YMOR particles at a molar ratio of 1:10 receptor to G protein. Gi2 was purified in 0.7% CHAPS, and the final volume of G protein added to rHDL·YMOR was such that the final CHAPS concentration was well below its critical micelle concentration. Reconstituted receptor and G protein samples were then incubated in Bio-BeadsTM for 30–45 min at 4 °C to remove residual detergent. Binding reactions were performed in 100-μl volumes. Membrane fractions prepared from Sf9 or HighFiveTM cells expressing YMOR (0.5–5 μg total protein, prepared as above) were incubated with [3H]DPN (0.25 to 4 nm; 54.9 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at room temperature in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (Tris-buffered saline) buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm NTX. Bound [3H]DPN was separated from free by rapid filtration through GF/B filters and three 200-μl washes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. [3H]DPN saturation binding reactions on YMOR incorporated into rHDL particles were prepared in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.7, plus 0.1% BSA, and Sephadex G-50 Fine (GE Healthcare) gravity flow columns were used to separate bound from free [3H]DPN. Agonist competition assays in insect membranes and rHDL particles were performed in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 6–7 mm NaCl. Competition assays in rHDL particles also included 0.1% BSA. [3H]DPN binding assays on detergent-solubilized YMOR were performed in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 136 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 0.01% CHS and separated on Sephadex G-50 gravity flow columns. For agonist competition assays, receptor samples were incubated with 0.5–1 nm [3H]DPN and increasing concentrations of agonist (1 pm to 1 mm) in the absence or presence of 10 μm GTPγS. The samples were measured for radioactivity on a liquid scintillation counter, and the data were fit with one-site saturation, one-site competition, or two-site competition binding models using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). 100-μl volume reactions were prepared containing 1 μg of total membrane protein from YMOR expressing HighFiveTM cells or ∼50–60 fmol of YMOR incorporated into rHDL particles in 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 or 1 μm GDP (membranes or HDL particles), and 0.1% BSA. Membrane assays and rHDL assays were incubated with 10 nm isotopically diluted [35S]GTPγS (12.5 Ci/mmol). YMOR samples were incubated with increasing concentrations of agonists (1 pm to 1 mm) for 1 h at room temperature, then rapidly filtered through GF/B (membrane samples) or BA85 filters (HDL samples), and washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The samples were measured for radioactivity on a liquid scintillation counter, and the data were fit with a log dose-response model using Prism 5.0. Purified YMOR (∼200 pmol) was incubated with NHS-ester Cy3 or Cy5 mono-reactive dye (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm EDTA, 0.1% DDM, 0.01% CHS, 100 nm NTX for 30 min at 25 °C and then 1 h at 4 °C. Conjugation reactions were quenched by the addition of Tris·HCl, pH 7.7 buffer (10 mm final). Cy-labeled YMOR was then separated from free dye using a 12-cm Sephadex G-50 column. The final dye to protein molar ratio was 3.8:1 for Cy3-YMOR and 3.7:1 for Cy5-YMOR, determined by absorbance at 280 nm for total protein, 550 nm for Cy3 dye, and 650 nm for Cy5 dye as measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. A separate aliquot of YMOR was co-labeled with both Cy3 and Cy5 for final molar ratios of 2:1 Cy3:YMOR and 1.8:1 Cy5:YMOR. HDL reconstitutions of Cy3-YMOR alone, Cy5-YMOR alone, a mixture of Cy3- and Cy5-YMOR, and Cy3-Cy5-YMOR were then performed. Reconstitutions were performed as previously described, using apoA-1 that had been biotinylated at a 3:1 molar ratio using EZ-Link NHS-Biotin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Reconstituted samples were diluted 5000-fold in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, and injected into a microfluidic channel on a quartz slide that was previously coated with biotinylated polyethylene glycol and treated with 0.2 mg/ml streptavidin to generate a surface density of ∼0.05 molecules/μm2. An oxygen scavenging system of 10 mm Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mm protocatechuic acid, and 1 μm protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase was included in the sample dilution (22Patil P.V. Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following a 10-min incubation to allow binding of the biotin-HDL·Cy-YMOR complex to the streptavidin-coated slide, the channel was washed with ice-cold 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing the oxygen scavenging system. An Olympus IX71 inverted microscope configured for prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and coupled to an intensified CCD camera was used to image Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores (CrystaLaser, 532 nm; Coherent CUBE laser, 638 nm; Chroma band pass filters HQ580/60 and HQ710/130 nm). Fluorophore intensity time traces were collected for 30–100 s at 10 frames/s. Time traces were analyzed for photobleaching with in-house software (MatLab 7.0). [Lys7, Cys8]dermorphin (Tyr-d-Ala-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Pro-Lys-Cys-NH2) was synthesized on Rink resin (solid support) using an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The samples were characterized on a Waters reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 (Protein and Peptide) 10-micron column. The samples were run on a linear gradient of 0–45% acetonitrile in an aqueous phase containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 35 °C and monitored at 254 and 230 nm (supplemental Fig. S3). Peptides were similarly purified on a Waters semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 10-micron column at room temperature. The purified peptide was labeled with Cy3-maleimide (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a ratio of 1.5:1 peptide to fluorophore and repurified by HPLC as before. The labeled peptide was further purified via semi-preparative HPLC using a 5-micron Vydac C18 column as described above. The potency and efficacy of [Lys7, Cys8]dermorphin-Cy3 at MOR were confirmed in radiolabeled [3H]DPN competition and [35S]GTPγS binding assays. Purified recombinant apoA-1 was biotinylated at a 3:1 molar ratio of biotin:apoA-1. Purified YMOR was then reconstituted with biotin-apoA-1, POPC, POPG, and brain lipid extract as above. Purified Gi2 heterotrimer was added to reconstituted receptor as above, and coupling was confirmed by observing high affinity competition of [3H]DPN binding by the agonist DAMGO. Five nanomolar biotin-rHDL·YMOR+Gi2 was then incubated with 5 μm [Lys7, Cys8]dermorphin-Cy3 for 45 min at 25 °C in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7. The samples were diluted 100-fold in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, and imaged as described above with a surface density of ∼0.25 molecules/μm2. Fluorophore intensity time traces were collected for 30–100 s at 10 frames/s and analyzed for photobleaching with in-house software (MatLab 7.0). Human YMOR (Fig. 1A) expressed in Sf9 and HighFiveTM insect cells bound the nonspecific opioid antagonist [3H]diprenorphine ([3H]DPN) with high affinity in a saturable manner (Kd = 0.6 ± 0.1 nm; Fig. 1B). Maximal receptor levels of 12–40 pmol/mg were routinely observed. The μ-selective agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin) stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes co-expressing YMOR and Gαi2-His6Gβ1-Gγ2 G protein heterotrimer (Gi2) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). DAMGO elicited strong activation of Gi2, stimulating [35S]GTPγS binding nearly 4-fold over basal levels with an EC50 of 36 ± 0.1 nm. The potency and efficacy of DAMGO at insect cell expressed YMOR is well in line with its observed pharmacological characteristics in mammalian cell expression systems (23Emmerson P.J. Clark M.J.

Allosteric regulation of agonist binding to opioid receptors by G proteins has been well established in plasma membrane preparations of brain homogenates and overexpression systems (26Frances B.

In the absence of Gi2, DAMGO competed [3H]DPN (0.5 nm) binding in a concentration-dependent manner with a Ki of ∼580 nm (Fig. 1D). In membranes expressing both YMOR and Gi2, DAMGO exhibited a biphasic mode of inhibition of [3H]DPN binding with a Ki hi of ∼2.9 nm and a Ki lo of ∼1.5 μm (fraction of Ki hi ∼0.53). The addition of 10 μm GTPγS to the YMOR + Gi2 membranes eliminated the high affinity DAMGO-binding site (Ki = ∼300 nm), illustrating that YMOR is allosterically regulated by G proteins. Therefore, YMOR expressed in HighFiveTM cells proved fully functional in regards to G protein coupling.

Current evidence suggests that type I collagenolysis is mediated by secreted as well as membrane-anchored members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family. However, the roles played by these multiple and possibly redundant, degradative systems during fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling is undefined. Herein, we use fibroblasts isolated from Mmp13(-/-), Mmp8(-/-), Mmp2(-/-), Mmp9(-/-), Mmp14(-/-) and Mmp16(-/-) mice to define the functional roles for secreted and membrane-anchored collagenases during collagen-resorptive versus collagen-invasive events. In the presence of a functional plasminogen activator-plasminogen axis, secreted collagenases arm cells with a redundant collagenolytic potential that allows fibroblasts harboring single deficiencies for either MMP-13, MMP-8, MMP-2, or MMP-9 to continue to degrade collagen comparably to wild-type fibroblasts. Likewise, Mmp14(-/-) or Mmp16(-/-) fibroblasts retain near-normal collagenolytic activity in the presence of plasminogen via the mobilization of secreted collagenases, but only Mmp14 (MT1-MMP) plays a required role in the collagenolytic processes that support fibroblast invasive activity. Furthermore, by artificially tethering a secreted collagenase to the surface of Mmp14(-/-) fibroblasts, we demonstrate that localized pericellular collagenolytic activity differentiates the collagen-invasive phenotype from bulk collagen degradation. Hence, whereas secreted collagenases arm fibroblasts with potent matrix-resorptive activity, only MT1-MMP confers the focal collagenolytic activity necessary for supporting the tissue-invasive phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2086350944,"The identification of molecular markers, useful for therapeutic decisions in pancreatic cancer patients, is crucial for advances in disease management. Gemcitabine, although a cornerstone of current therapy, has limited efficacy. RRM1 is a key molecule for gemcitabine efficacy and is also involved in tumor progression. We determined in situ RRM1 and excision repair cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1) protein levels in 68 pancreatic cancer patients. All had R0 resections without preoperative therapy. Protein levels were determined by automated quantitative analysis (AQUA), a fluorescence-based immunohistochemical method. The relationship between protein expressions and clinical outcomes, including response to gemcitabine at the time of disease recurrence, was determined. Patients with high RRM1 showed significantly better overall survival than patients with low expression (P=0.0196). There was a trend toward better overall survival for patient with high ERCC1 (P=0.0552). When both markers were considered together, patients with both high RRM1 and ERCC1 faired the best in terms of overall and disease-free survival (P=0.0066, P=0.0127). In addition, treatment benefit from gemcitabine in patients with disease recurrence was observed only in patients with low RRM1. The combination of RRM1 and ERCC1 expression is prognostic in pancreatic cancer patients after a complete resection. On disease recurrence, only patients with low RRM1 derive benefit from gemcitabine."
https://openalex.org/W2003968931,"Cell fate decisions mediated by the Notch signalling pathway require direct cell-cell contact between adjacent cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, an external sensory organ (ESO) develops from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) and its fate specification is governed by differential Notch activation. Here we show that mutations in actin-related protein-3 (Arp3) compromise Notch signalling, leading to a fate transformation of the ESO. Our data reveal that during ESO fate specification, most endocytosed vesicles containing the ligand Delta traffic to a prominent apical actin-rich structure (ARS) formed in the SOP daughter cells. Using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, we show that the ARS contains numerous microvilli on the apical surface of SOP progeny. In Arp2/3 and WASp mutants, the surface area of the ARS is substantially reduced and there are significantly fewer microvilli. More importantly, trafficking of Delta-positive vesicles from the basal area to the apical portion of the ARS is severely compromised. Our data indicate that WASp-dependent Arp2/3 actin polymerization is crucial for apical presentation of Delta, providing a mechanistic link between actin polymerization and Notch signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2042134391,"Smooth muscle-rich tissues respond to mechanical overload by an adaptive hypertrophic growth combined with activation of angiogenesis, which potentiates their mechanical overload-bearing capabilities. Neovascularization is associated with mechanical strain-dependent induction of angiogenic factors such as CCN1, an immediate-early gene-encoded matricellular molecule critical for vascular development and repair. Here we have demonstrated that mechanical strain-dependent induction of the CCN1 gene involves signaling cascades through RhoA-mediated actin remodeling and the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). Actin signaling controls serum response factor (SRF) activity via SRF interaction with the myocardin-related transcriptional activator (MRTF)-A and tethering to a single CArG box sequence within the CCN1 promoter. Such activity was abolished in mechanically stimulated mouse MRTF-A(-/-) cells or upon inhibition of CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) either pharmacologically or by siRNAs. Mechanical strain induced CBP-mediated acetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the SRF-binding site and within the CCN1 gene coding region. Inhibition of p38 SAPK reduced CBP HAT activity and its recruitment to the SRF.MRTF-A complex, whereas enforced induction of p38 by upstream activators (e.g. MKK3 and MKK6) enhanced both CBP HAT and CCN1 promoter activities. Similarly, mechanical overload-induced CCN1 gene expression in vivo was associated with nuclear localization of MRTF-A and enrichment of the CCN1 promoter with both MRTF-A and acetylated histone H3. Taken together, these data suggest that signal-controlled activation of SRF, MRTF-A, and CBP provides a novel connection between mechanical stimuli and angiogenic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1984893300,"B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukaemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of transcription repressors, which functions in stem cell maintenance and oncogenesis through the inhibition of the INK4A/ARF tumour suppressor locus. Overexpression of BMI1 is associated with poor prognosis in several human cancers, including breast cancer. We have previously shown that BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to induce transformation of MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells through dysregulation of multiple growth pathways independent of the INK4A/ARF locus. In this study, we show that BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to promote increased proliferation, invasion and resistance to apoptosis in vitro, and an increased rate of spontaneous metastases from mammary fat pad xenografts including novel metastases to the brain. Furthermore, in collaboration with H-RAS, BMI1 induced fulminant metastatic disease in the lung using a tail vein model of haematogenous spread through accelerated cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Finally, we show that knockdown of BMI1 in several established breast cancer cell lines leads to decreased oncogenic behaviour in vitro and in vivo. In summary, BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to induce an aggressive and metastatic phenotype with the unusual occurrence of brain metastasis, making it an important target for diagnosis and treatment of aggressive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977107145,"Protein ubiquitination is critical for many cellular processes, through its ability to regulate protein degradation and various signaling mechanisms. In the ubiquitin (Ub) system, substrate specificity is achieved through the E3 family of Ub ligases. Because alterations of the ubiquitination machinery have been reported in human cancers, the selective interference with Ub ligases might represent a powerful therapeutic tool. Here, we report the first wide survey of misregulation of Ub ligases in cancer. We analysed 82 Ub ligases in nine types of cancer by in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays. We found 27 instances in which an Ub ligase was altered in a given type of tumor, when compared with normal tissues: 21 cases of overexpression and 6 cases of underexpression. We further analysed selected Ub ligases in large cohorts of breast and non-small-cell lung carcinomas. In five, of six, of these extended analyses (HUWE1, CCNB1IP1, SIAH1 and SIAH2 in breast cancer and CCNB1IP1 in lung cancer), we found that the levels of Ub ligases correlated significantly with relevant prognostic factors, and with clinical outcome. Our findings show that the alteration of Ub ligases is a frequent event in cancer and identify candidate targets for molecular therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2052000300,"Understanding how the subcellular fate of newly synthesized AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is controlled is important for elucidating the mechanisms of neuronal function. We examined the effect of increased synthesis of AMPAR subunits on their subcellular distribution in rat hippocampal neurons. Virally expressed AMPAR subunits (GluR1 or GluR2) accumulated in cell bodies and replaced endogenous dendritic AMPAR with little effect on total dendritic amounts and caused no change in synaptic transmission. Coexpressing stargazin (STG) or mimicking GluR1 phosphorylation enhanced dendritic GluR1 levels by protecting GluR1 from lysosomal degradation. However, STG interaction or GluR1 phosphorylation did not increase surface or synaptic GluR1 levels. Unlike GluR1, STG did not protect GluR2 from lysosomal degradation or increase dendritic GluR2 levels. In general, AMPAR surface levels, and not intracellular amounts, correlated strongly with synaptic levels. Our results suggest that AMPAR surface expression, but not its intracellular production or accumulation, is critical for regulating synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2069049795,"Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by trypsin-like proteinases. PAR2 is detected in breast tumor specimens; however, it is not clear how PAR2 level in breast cancer cell/tissues compares with normal cell/tissues. Here, we show the elevation of PAR2 protein level in 76 of 105 breast tumor specimens but only 5 of 24 normal breast tissues. PAR2 level is also higher in breast cancer cell lines than that in normal breast cells and non-cancerous breast cell lines. To determine the role of PAR2 in breast carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of PAR2 agonists on cell proliferation and migration. Our studies show that PAR2 agonists (PAR2-activating peptide and trypsin) are neither potent growth enhancers nor chemoattractants to breast cancer cells. Instead, PAR2 agonists induce significant chemokinesis. PAR2-mediated chemokinesis is Gαi-dependent, and inhibiting Src kinase activity or silencing c-Src expression blocks PAR2-mediated chemokinesis. These results suggest that c-Src works downstream of Gαi to mediate this PAR2 agonist-induced event. To characterize c-Src effector, we reveal that PAR2 agonists activate JNKs in a Src-dependent manner and that JNK activity is essential for PAR2-mediated chemokinesis. Moreover, PAR2 agonist stimulation leads to paxillin Ser178 phosphorylation and paxillin(S178A) mutant inhibits PAR2-mediated chemokinesis. In conclusion, our studies show that PAR2 agonists facilitate breast cancer cell chemokinesis through the Gαi-c-Src-JNK-paxillin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2071974785,"Earlier we used a glioma model to identify loci in the mouse genome, which were repeatedly targeted by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-containing Moloney murine leukemia viruses. The gene Prkg2, encoding cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase II, cGKII, was tagged by retroviral insertions in two brain tumors. The insertions were both situated upstream of the kinase domain and suggested creating a truncated form of the cGKII protein. We transfected different human glioma cell lines with Prkg2 and found an overall reduction in colony formation and cell proliferation compared with controls transfected with truncated Prkg2 (lacking the kinase domain) or empty vector. All glioma cells transfected with the cGKII phosphorylate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, VASP, after cGMP analog treatment. Glioma cell lines positive for the Sox9 transcription factor showed reduced Sox9 expression when Prkg2 was stably transfected. When cGKII was activated by cGMP analog treatment, Sox9 was phosphorylated, Sox9 protein expression was suppressed and the glioma cell lines displayed loss of cell adhesion, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and G1 arrest. Sox9 repression by siRNA was similarly shown to reduce glioma cell proliferation. Expression analysis of stem and glial lineage cell markers also suggests that cGKII induces differentiation of glioma cell lines. These findings describe an anti-proliferative role of cGKII in human glioma biology and would further explain the retroviral tagging of the cGKII gene during brain tumor formation in PDGF-induced tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2117867383,"Human polymerase kappa (hPol kappa) is one of four eukaryotic Y-class DNA polymerases and may be an important element in the cellular response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene, which can lead to reactive oxygenated metabolite-mediated oxidative stress. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the activity and specificity of hPol kappa bypass opposite the major oxidative adduct 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG). Unlike its archaeal homolog Dpo4, hPol kappa bypasses this lesion in an error-prone fashion by inserting mainly dATP. Analysis of transient-state kinetics shows diminished ""bursts"" for dATP:8-oxoG and dCTP:8-oxoG incorporation, indicative of non-productive complex formation, but dATP:8-oxoG insertion events that do occur are 2-fold more efficient than dCTP:G insertion events. Crystal structures of ternary hPol kappa complexes with adducted template-primer DNA reveal non-productive (dGTP and dATP) alignments of incoming nucleotide and 8-oxoG. Structural limitations placed upon the hPol kappa by interactions between the N-clasp and finger domains combined with stabilization of the syn-oriented template 8-oxoG through the side chain of Met-135 both appear to contribute to error-prone bypass. Mutating Leu-508 in the little finger domain of hPol kappa to lysine modulates the insertion opposite 8-oxoG toward more accurate bypass, similar to previous findings with Dpo4. Our structural and activity data provide insight into important mechanistic aspects of error-prone bypass of 8-oxoG by hPol kappa compared with accurate and efficient bypass of the lesion by Dpo4 and polymerase eta."
https://openalex.org/W1979909621,"Endostatin is a C-terminal proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII that is localized in vascular basement membrane zones in various organs. It binds to heparin/heparan sulfate and to a number of proteins, but its molecular mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. We have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) arrays to identify new partners of endostatin, and to give further insights on its molecular mechanism of action. New partners of endostatin include glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin and dermatan sulfate), matricellular proteins (thrombospondin-1 and SPARC), collagens (I, IV, and VI), the amyloid peptide Abeta-(1-42), and transglutaminase-2. The biological functions of the endostatin network involve a number of extracellular proteins containing epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factor-like domains, and able to bind calcium. Depending on the trigger event, and on the availability of its members in a given tissue at a given time, the endostatin network might be involved either in the control of angiogenesis, and tumor growth, or in neurogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1993104435,"Eukaryotic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases (SOD1s) are generally thought to acquire the essential copper cofactor and intramolecular disulfide bond through the action of the CCS copper chaperone. However, several metazoan SOD1s have been shown to acquire activity in vivo in the absence of CCS, and the Cu,Zn-SOD from Caenorhabditis elegans has evolved complete independence from CCS. To investigate SOD1 activation in the absence of CCS, we compared and contrasted the CCS-independent activation of C. elegans and human SOD1 to the strict CCS-dependent activation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SOD1. Using a yeast expression system, both pathways were seen to acquire copper derived from cell surface transporters and compete for the same intracellular pool of copper. Like CCS, CCS-independent activation occurs rapidly with a preexisting pool of apo-SOD1 without the need for new protein synthesis. The two pathways, however, strongly diverge when assayed for the SOD1 disulfide. SOD1 molecules that are activated without CCS exhibit disulfide oxidation in vivo without oxygen and under copper-depleted conditions. The strict requirement for copper, oxygen, and CCS in disulfide bond oxidation appears exclusive to yeast SOD1, and we find that a unique proline at position 144 in yeast SOD1 is responsible for this disulfide effect. CCS-dependent and -independent pathways also exhibit differential requirements for molecular oxygen. CCS activation of SOD1 requires oxygen, whereas the CCS-independent pathway is able to activate SOD1s even under anaerobic conditions. In this manner, Cu,Zn-SOD from metazoans may retain activity over a wide range of physiological oxygen tensions."
https://openalex.org/W2032488599,"We developed a novel intranasal influenza vaccine approach that is based on the construction of replication-deficient vaccine viruses that lack the entire NS1 gene (DeltaNS1 virus). We previously showed that these viruses undergo abortive replication in the respiratory tract of animals. The local release of type I interferons and other cytokines and chemokines in the upper respiratory tract may have a ""self-adjuvant effect"", in turn increasing vaccine immunogenicity. As a result, DeltaNS1 viruses elicit strong B- and T- cell mediated immune responses.We applied this technology to the development of a pandemic H5N1 vaccine candidate. The vaccine virus was constructed by reverse genetics in Vero cells, as a 5:3 reassortant, encoding four proteins HA, NA, M1, and M2 of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus while the remaining genes were derived from IVR-116. The HA cleavage site was modified in a trypsin dependent manner, serving as the second attenuation factor in addition to the deleted NS1 gene. The vaccine candidate was able to grow in the Vero cells that were cultivated in a serum free medium to titers exceeding 8 log(10) TCID(50)/ml. The vaccine virus was replication deficient in interferon competent cells and did not lead to viral shedding in the vaccinated animals. The studies performed in three animal models confirmed the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Intranasal immunization protected ferrets and mice from being infected with influenza H5 viruses of different clades. In a primate model (Macaca mulatta), one dose of vaccine delivered intranasally was sufficient for the induction of antibodies against homologous A/Vietnam/1203/04 and heterologous A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 strains.Our findings show that intranasal immunization with the replication deficient H5N1 DeltaNS1 vaccine candidate is sufficient to induce a protective immune response against H5N1 viruses. This approach might be attractive as an alternative to conventional influenza vaccines. Clinical evaluation of DeltaNS1 pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates are currently in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2046894450,"Jasper Rine and colleagues examine the silencing of the HML locus in synchronous S. cerevisiae cells at single-cell resolution. They demonstrate that the establishment of silencing under native conditions occurs rapidly, within two cell cycles. The establishment of silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is similar to heterochromatin formation in multicellular eukaryotes. Previous batch culture studies determined that the de novo establishment of silencing initiates during S phase and continues for up to five cell divisions for completion. To track silencing phenotypically, we developed an assay that introduces Sir3 protein into individual sir3Δ mutant cells synchronously and then detects the onset of silencing with single-cell resolution. Silencing was completed within the first one to two cell divisions in most cells queried. Moreover, we uncovered unexpected complexity in the contributions of a histone acetyltransferase (Sas2), two histone methytransferases (Dot1 and Set1) and one histone demethylase (Jhd2) to the dynamics of silencing. Our findings showed that removal of methyl modifications at H3K4 and H3K79 were important steps in silent chromatin formation and that Jhd2 and Set1 had competing roles in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2042969349,"Lactogenic hormone regulation of beta-casein gene expression in mammary epithelial cells provides an excellent model in which to study the mechanisms by which steroid and peptide hormone signaling control gene expression. Prolactin- and glucocorticoid-mediated induction of beta-casein gene expression involves two principal regulatory regions, a proximal promoter and a distal enhancer located in the mouse approximately -6 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Using a chromosome conformation capture assay and quantitative real time PCR, we demonstrate that a chromatin loop is created in conjunction with the recruitment of specific transcription factors and p300 in HC11 mammary epithelial cells. Stimulation with both prolactin and hydrocortisone is required for the induction of these long range interactions between the promoter and enhancer, and no DNA looping was observed in nontreated cells or cells treated with each of the hormones separately. The lactogenic hormone-induced interaction between the proximal promoter and distal enhancer was confirmed in hormone-treated primary three-dimensional mammary acini cultures. In addition, the developmental regulation of DNA looping between the beta-casein regulatory regions was observed in lactating but not in virgin mouse mammary glands. Furthermore, beta-casein mRNA induction and long range interactions between these regulatory regions were inhibited in a progestin-dependent manner following stimulation with prolactin and hydrocortisone in HC11 cells expressing human PR-B. Collectively, these data suggest that the communication between these regulatory regions with intervening DNA looping is a crucial step required to both create and maintain active chromatin domains and regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2161854785,"The amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein whose cleavage product, the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein, is deposited in amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, and head injury. We recently reported that this protein, normally associated with neurodegenerative conditions, is expressed by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We now report that the differential processing of AβPP via secretase enzymes regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hESCs. hESCs endogenously produce amyloid-β, which when added exogenously in soluble and fibrillar forms but not oligomeric forms markedly increased hESC proliferation. The inhibition of AβPP cleavage by β-secretase inhibitors significantly suppressed hESC proliferation and promoted nestin expression, an early marker of neural precursor cell (NPC) formation. The induction of NPC differentiation via the non-amyloidogenic pathway was confirmed by the addition of secreted AβPPα, which suppressed hESC proliferation and promoted the formation of NPCs.

AβPP has structural similarity to growth factors (1.Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct.

AβPP is processed by at least two pathways, the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways. Non-amyloidogenic processing of AβPP yields secreted AβPPα (sAβPPα), the secreted extracellular domain of AβPP that acts as a growth factor for many cell types and promotes neuritogenesis (3.Milward E.A. Papadopoulos R. Fuller S.J. Moir R.D. Small D. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Neuron. 1992; 9: 129-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Amyloidogenic processing of AβPP releases sAβPPβ, the AβPP intracellular domain, and Aβ proteins. The Aβ protein has both neurotoxic and neurotrophic properties (4.Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) dependent on the differentiation state of the neuron; Aβ is neurotoxic to differentiating neurons via a mechanism involving differentiation-associated increases in the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (5.Liu T.

Evidence supporting a neurotrophic function for Aβ during development include its neurogenic activity toward rat neural stem cells (4.Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A.

Alzheimers Dis. 2007; 12: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) express AβPP and that both the stemness of the cells and the pregnancy-associated hormone human chorionic gonadotropin alter AβPP expression (9.Porayette P. Gallego M.J. Kaltcheva M.M. Meethal S.V. Atwood C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggest a functional role for AβPP during early human embryogenesis. To further investigate the function of AβPP and its cleavage products during early embryonic neurogenesis, we examined the expression and processing of this protein and its role in proliferation and differentiation of hESCs into neural precursor cells (NPCs). We found that amyloidogenic processing of AβPP promotes hESC proliferation whereas non-amyloidogenic processing induces hESC differentiation into NPCs. These data reveal an important function for AβPP during early human embryonic neurogenesis. Our data imply that any dysregulation in AβPP processing that leads to altered sAβPPα/Aβ production could result in aberrant neurogenesis as reported in the AD and DS brains. Pluripotent H9 hESCs (passage 22–32; XX karyotype; also known as WA09, a National Institutes of Health registered line) were obtained from WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI). Cells were plated onto irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (1.875 × 105 cells/well; Biovintage, San Diego, CA) in 6-well plates (Fisher Scientific) coated with 1 ml of sterile 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) solution. Prior to addition of hESCs, MEF cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). After 24 h of MEF plating, hESCs were plated on this MEF feeder layer and grown in the presence of DMEM-F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), and 20% Knock-outTM Serum Replacer (Invitrogen). Continual propagation of cells required colonies to be enzymatically lifted with 1 ml of a sterile solution of collagenase type IV (Invitrogen) (1 mg/ml of DMEM-F-12), dissected into multiple small pieces, and transferred onto a fresh MEF feeder layer every 4–5 days. hESCs also were grown on MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences), a basement membrane preparation extracted from a murine Englebreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma, in the presence of mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada), a defined culture medium developed by WiCell Research Institute (10.Ludwig T.E. Bergendahl V. Levenstein M.E. Yu J. Probasco M.D. Thomson J.A. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Matrigel (100 μg/ml in DMEM-F-12; 1 ml) was added to each well of a 6-well plate and left for 1 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. hESCs were transferred onto these plates, cells were passaged by enzymatic lifting using a sterile solution of dispase (1 mg/ml in DMEM-F-12; Invitrogen), and the colonies were dissected into multiple small pieces, transferred onto new plates coated with Matrigel, and cultured in mTeSR1 medium. The culture medium (2.5 ml/well) was replaced every day in all the above culture conditions. This protocol mimics the formation of the blastocyst during human embryogenesis (11.Itskovitz-Eldor J. Schuldiner M. Karsenti D. Eden A. Yanuka O. Amit M. Soreq H. Benvenisty N. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 88-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pluripotent hESCs (H9) grown on MEFs in a 6-well plate were rinsed twice with 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; without calcium or magnesium; Invitrogen)/well. Colonies were then incubated with 1 ml of dispase (0.5 mg/ml in DMEM-F-12) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until the colonies detached intact while avoiding dispersing the colonies into single cells. T25 flasks (Fisher Scientific) were incubated with 5 ml of a 2% poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 5 min. The flask was placed in a horizontal position for 5 min with the cap on. This allowed optimal coating of the working surface area of the flask. This process was repeated for each side of the flask. The caps of coated flasks were opened, and the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) solution was aspirated off. The open flasks were allowed to remain in the hood for 1 h to dry. After 1 h, the surface was washed twice with DPBS, and the detached hESC colonies were cultured in 15% characterized fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 85% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) in these poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated T25 flasks and incubated under standard conditions (37 °C in 5% CO2) on an orbital shaker (Boekel Orbitron, Feasterville, PA) with constant gentle rocking for 10–14 days to allow the hESCs to aggregate into cystic spheroidal structures. The poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) coat and the constant gentle rocking prevented the adherence of these spheroidal structures to the flask. The protocol described below for the differentiation of hESCs into columnar NPCs mimics in vivo NPC development in terms of timing and morphology (12.Li X.J. Zhang S.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 331: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, hESCs differentiate into columnar NPCs that organize into neural tubelike rosettes within 12–14 days. Considering that hESCs are equivalent to a 5–6-day embryo, development of the NPCs in vitro takes about 18–20 days, the time window when the neural tube forms in a human embryo (13.Müller F. O'Rahilly R. Anat. Embryol. 1985; 172: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Zhang S.C. J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 2003; 12: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pluripotent hESC (H9) colonies grown on MEFs in 6-well plates were rinsed twice with DPBS (1 ml/well) and then treated with dispase (1 ml of 1 mg/ml in DMEM-F-12) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until the edges of the colonies began to curl up. The plate was then swirled to detach the colonies intact without dispersing the colonies into individual cells. The hESC colonies were grown in T25 flasks in a special embryonic stem cell growth medium (78.5% DMEM-F-12, 20% Knock-out Serum Replacer, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 4 days with daily replacement of medium to form embryonic stem cell aggregates. Cells were then adhered to the culture surface where they formed monolayer colonies in a chemically defined neural induction medium (32.6% F-12 (Invitrogen), 65.2% DMEM, 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.2% 1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor). Under this culture condition, columnar NPCs appear in the center of each colony and organize into neural tubelike rosettes after a total of 9–10 days of differentiation culture. The neural induction medium was replaced every other day. The NPCs in the rosettes were selectively isolated through differential enzymatic treatment using dispase (0.5 mg/ml in DMEM-F-12) and incubated for 2 h in neural induction medium to allow the non-neural cells to differentially attach to the T25 flasks. After this, the floating cells (mostly aggregates of NPCs) were transferred to new T25 flasks where they rolled up to form round clusters. Some of these clusters were collected and probed for nestin to confirm NPC differentiation. The remaining formed clusters were continuously passaged by manually splitting the clusters using a sterile scalpel. Cells were collected, and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (9.Porayette P. Gallego M.J. Kaltcheva M.M. Meethal S.V. Atwood C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because of the dramatic changes that occur in protein expression during the dynamic developmental period under consideration, it was difficult to find an internal control to demonstrate equal protein loading (see Ref. 9.Porayette P. Gallego M.J. Kaltcheva M.M. Meethal S.V. Atwood C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given this variability, we chose to load samples according to total protein as described previously (5.Liu T. Perry G. Chan H.W. Verdile G. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Atwood C.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The following antibodies (with dilution ratio) were used throughout this study: anti-human nestin monoclonal antibody, anti-human amyloid-β precursor protein, amino terminus (22C11) monoclonal antibody, anti-human amyloid-β precursor protein, carboxyl terminus polyclonal antibody (against YKFFEQMQN), anti-human anterior pharynx defective-1 (APH-1) polyclonal antibody, anti-human CD147 monoclonal antibody, and anti-human neuronal nuclei monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA); anti-human amyloid-β, amino acids 1–16 (6E10) monoclonal antibody, and anti-human amyloid-β amino acids 17–24 (4G8) monoclonal antibody (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA); anti-human PHF-1 monoclonal antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY); anti-human BACE-1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); anti-human presenilin enhancer-2 (PEN-2) polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc., South San Francisco, CA); anti-human ADAM-10 polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem); anti-human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody (Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA); anti-human α-fetoprotein monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN); anti-human nicastrin (N-19) polyclonal antibody, anti-human presenilin 1 (B-6) monoclonal antibody, anti-human OCT-3/4 monoclonal antibody, anti-human CDK2 monoclonal antibody, anti-human caspase monoclonal antibody, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) goat polyclonal antibody (V-18), anti-human β-actin goat polyclonal antibody (C-11), and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, and donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). hESC and NPC culture media were collected for Aβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). hESCs and NPCs were then washed twice with ice-cold DPBS and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a supernatant and cell pellet. The supernatant (Triton-soluble fraction) was analyzed for Aβ by ELISA (see below). The cell pellet was washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl to remove remaining Triton-soluble proteins. The pellet was sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Following centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was diluted 1:12 in doubly deionized water to give a final concentration of guanidine hydrochloride of 0.5 m (which has been shown not to affect protein-antibody binding (15.Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). This was the Triton-insoluble fraction. The samples were then subjected to a sandwich ELISA using Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) ELISA kits (Signet Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly the plate was coated with antibody that captures the amino terminus of the Aβ peptide. Standards containing known amounts of Aβ peptide and samples were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed to remove unbound peptide, and a primary antibody was added that binds to the carboxyl terminus of Aβ peptide. After incubation and washing, a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added. The plate was washed, o-phenylenediamine substrate was added, and bound Aβ peptide was visualized at 492 nm on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus384 spectrophotometer. The level of Aβ was expressed as pg/mg of total cellular protein. Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42) peptides were synthesized, purified, and characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, amino acid analysis, and mass spectroscopy by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Aβ peptides were reconstituted in sterile doubly deionized water under sterile conditions. The Aβ solution was sonicated indirectly three times for 45 s each (38 MHz) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The concentration of Aβ in the soluble supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 214 nm, and the supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm filter; Fisher Scientific) into a new microcentrifuge tube under sterile conditions and incubated for 3 days at 37 °C to form fibrillized Aβ (modified from Ref. 16.Wei W. Wang X. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17649-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This Aβ was then diluted in mTeSR1 medium. Soluble, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of Aβ also were prepared using the protocol described previously (17.Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Briefly Aβ was dissolved to 1 mm in 100% hexafluoroisopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Hexafluoroisopropanol was then removed under vacuum, and the peptide was stored at −20 °C. For the aggregation protocols, the peptide was first resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Fisher Scientific) to 5 mm. For oligomeric conditions, F-12 culture medium was added to bring the peptide to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the peptide was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. For fibrillar conditions, 10 mm HCl was added to bring the peptide to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the peptide was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. For unaggregated conditions, the 5 mm Aβ in DMSO was diluted directly into mTeSR1 medium. hESCs were evenly plated in 6-well plates coated with Matrigel in 2.5 ml of mTeSR1 medium/well. Cells were treated each day with 0, 1, or 5 μm Aβ in mTeSR1 medium for a period of 5 days prior to cell counting using the trypan blue assay. hESCs differentiated into NPCs were treated with freshly prepared 0 or 5 μm fibrillar Aβ-(1–42) (fAβ-(1–42)) for 10 days in neural induction medium. The cells were then collected and stored at −80 °C for immunoanalyses of Aβ-induced changes in differentiation. hESCs were evenly plated in 6-well plates coated with Matrigel in 2.5 ml of mTeSR1 medium/well. After confirmation of even plating using the trypan blue assay, the cells were either treated with β-secretase inhibitor IV (100 nm), β-secretase inhibitor III (5.5 μm), or γ-secretase inhibitor IX (300 nm; all from Calbiochem) in mTeSR1 medium. Stock solutions of β-secretase inhibitor IV were prepared in methanol, and the β-secretase inhibitor III and γ-secretase inhibitor IX were prepared in DMSO. Corresponding concentrations of methanol or DMSO were added to control wells. Similarly hESCs were treated with sAβPPα (amino acids 19–612; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 nm in mTeSR1 medium. After 5 days of treatment, the cells were trypsinized, and cell proliferation was assessed using the trypan blue assay. Cells also were collected in DPBS after 5 days of treatment and stored at −80 °C for immunoanalyses of the effect of the inhibitors or sAβPPα on hESC differentiation. To examine the effect of inhibitor treatment on NPCs, hESCs cultured on MEFs were treated with β-secretase inhibitor IV (100 nm) or γ-secretase inhibitor IX (300 nm) for 4–5 days and then cultured as described above for another 14 days to induce the formation of NPCs in the presence or absence of the above inhibitors in their respective media. Corresponding concentrations of methanol or DMSO were added to control wells and flasks. Fully formed NPC-containing rosettes were collected in DPBS and stored at −80 °C for immunoblot analyses. Similarly hESCs differentiated into NPCs were treated with freshly prepared sAβPPα (1 nm) for 10 days in neural induction medium. These cells were then collected and stored at −80 °C for immunoanalyses of sAβPPα-induced changes in differentiation. hESCs were washed with DPBS and stained using the live/dead assay (4 μm ethidium homodimer and 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester; Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence inverted microscope connected to a Fluo Arc light source and an Axio Cam MRC-5 camera. Images were visualized using Axio Vision 4.0. Calcein fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescein filter, and EthD-1 fluorescence was visualized using a rhodamine filter. hESC proliferation was assessed using the Click-iTTM EdU Alexa Fluor® Assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells plated on coverslips in 6-well plates were treated with fAβ1–42 in mTeSR1 medium for 36 h. Equal volumes of doubly deionized H2O were added to the controls. The wells were then incubated with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdUrd; 10 μm) in mTeSR1 medium for 2 h, the EdUrd was removed, and the cells were cultured for a further 36 h. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and washed twice with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton® X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS prior to addition of the Click-iT reaction mixture for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS prior to nuclear staining with Hoechst dye. Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter for EdUrd incorporation and a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter for nuclear staining. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test and analyses of variance followed by pairwise comparisons with Fisher's protected least significant difference procedure to determine significant changes between treatment groups (Statview 5.0 and SuperAnova 3.0 programs, SAS Institute, Inc.). To understand the molecular functions of AβPP during early human embryogenesis, we examined whether the expression and/or proteolytic processing of AβPP was altered during hESC differentiation into NPCs. Pluripotent hESCs were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) or into NPC-containing rosettes. EBs resemble early postimplantation embryos (blastocysts) in that they consist of endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells (18.O'Shea K.S. Anat. Rec. 1999; 257: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rosettes consist of more than 70% columnar NPCs and are the in vitro equivalent of a rudimentary neural tube (12.Li X.J. Zhang S.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 331: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain the stage of hESC differentiation, we immunoprobed these cell lineages for octamer (OCT)-3/4, a 43-kDa POU transcription factor that is required to maintain stem cell self-renewal (i.e. pluripotency) and that is a master regulator of pluripotency that controls lineage commitment (19.Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). This marker was absent in human M17 neuroblastoma cells and MEFs as expected for lineage-committed cells, was present in hESCs grown on Matrigel in mTeSR1 medium, was decreased in EBs, and was absent in NPCs (Fig. 1a, top panel). Concurrent with the loss of pluripotency was an increase in the expression of the NPC marker nestin in EBs and NPCs (Fig. 1a, middle panel). We next probed this immunoblot with a series of antibodies specific for different regions of AβPP, including an antibody against amino acids 66–100 of the amino terminus of AβPP (22C11; Fig. 1a, lower panel), an antibody against the first 16 amino acids of Aβ (6E10; Fig. 1b), an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 9 amino acids of AβPP (see supplemental Fig. 1a), and an antibody against amino acids 17–24 of Aβ (4G8; see supplemental Fig. 1b). Each antibody identified both the mature and immature forms of full-length AβPP that were variably expressed between cell lineages. The amino-terminal antibody identified a number of AβPP cleavage products including 72-, 58-, 47-, 42-, 29-, and 20-kDa variants. Antibodies directed against the Aβ sequence of AβPP recognized variants of different molecular mass compared with the amino-terminal antibody, including 47- and 25-kDa (both 6E10 and 4G8) and 78-, 67-, and 53-kDa (4G8) variants (Fig. 1b and supplemental Fig. 1b). A carboxyl-terminal antibody detected AβPP variants of 78, 67, and 41 kDa (supplemental Fig. 1a). The expression of both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal variants was generally increased with the differentiation of hESCs into EBs and NPCs. Antibodies directed against the carboxyl terminus of AβPP also identified the 99-amino acid carboxyl-terminal (∼10-kDa) fragment, a β-secretase cleavage product of AβPP (20.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar), which was variably expressed during differentiation. The presence of AβPP cleavage products in pluripotent hESCs, EBs, and NPCs suggests the presence of secretase enzymes in these cell lineages that modulate AβPP processing toward the amyloidogenic, non-amyloidogenic, and other pathways. To confirm the presence of secretase enzymes, we probed the immunoblot described above with antibodies against ADAM-10 (α-secretase) (21.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), BACE-1 (β-secretase) (20.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S.

Haass C. Steiner H. Neurodegener. Dis. 2006; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands representing the unprocessed proform of ADAM-10 (100 kDa) were detected in hESCs and NPCs, but the mature (active) form of ADAM-10 (60 kDa) was only detected in NPCs. An additional band (80 kDa) representing a partially processed form (23.McCulloch D.R. Akl P. Samaratunga H. Herington A.C. Odorico D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also was apparent in hESCs, EBs, and NPCs (Fig. 1c). The expression of BACE-1 enzyme (70 kDa) was detected in hESCs and increased with differentiation toward NPCs (Fig. 1d). Although the expression of PEN-2 (13 kDa) did not change during hESC differentiation, the expression of nicastrin (110 kDa) and APH-1 (75 kDa) decreased (Fig. 1e). Expression of f"

Aβ·copper complexes have been identified in AD and catalytically oxidize cholesterol and lipid to generate H2O2 and lipid peroxides. The site and mechanism of this abnormality is not known. Growing evidence suggests that amyloidogenic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs in lipid rafts, membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol. β- and γ-secretases, and Aβ have been identified in lipid rafts in cultured cells, human and rodent brains, but the role of copper in lipid raft amyloidogenic processing is presently unknown. In this study, we found that copper modulates flotillin-2 association with cholesterol-rich lipid raft domains, and consequently Aβ synthesis is attenuated via copper-mediated inhibition of APP endocytosis. We also found that total cellular copper is associated inversely with lipid raft copper levels, so that under intracellular copper deficiency conditions, Aβ·copper complexes are more likely to form. This explains the paradoxical hypermetallation of Aβ with copper under tissue copper deficiency conditions in AD.

Cholesterol is enriched in lipid rafts, membrane microdomains implicated in Aβ generation from APP cleavage by β- and γ-secretases. Recruitment of BACE1 (β-secretase) into lipid rafts increases the production of sAPPβ and Aβ (23Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J.

Currently, copper and cholesterol have been reported to modulate APP processing independently. However, evidence indicates that, despite tissue copper deficiency, Aβ·Cu2+ complexes form in AD that catalytically oxidize cholesterol and lipid to generate H2O2 and lipid peroxides (e.g. hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde), which contribute to oxidative damage observed in AD (29Nelson T.J.

In this study, we show that copper alters the structure of lipid rafts, and attenuates Aβ synthesis in lipid rafts by inhibition of APP endocytosis. We also identify a paradoxical inverse relationship between total cellular copper levels and copper distribution to lipid rafts, which appear to possess a privileged pool of copper where Aβ is more likely to interact with Cu2+ under copper-deficiency conditions to form Aβ·Cu2+ complexes. These data provide a novel mechanism by which cellular copper deficiency in AD could foster an environment for potentially adverse interactions between Aβ, copper, and cholesterol in lipid rafts. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in RPMI media 1640 with GLUTAMAXTM-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum.

Confluent cells were preincubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide in serum-free Hanks舗 balanced salt solution (HBSS; Sigma) for 20 min. Cells were then incubated in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide in HBSS with copper chelators (50 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS) and 50 μmd-penicillamine), CuCl2 (2 μm or 5 μm), FeCl3 (2 μm), or ZnCl2 (2 μm) for 3 h. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen), using either MOPS or MES running buffer (Invitrogen). After separation, proteins were transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots for detection of Aβ were boiled for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline prior to blocking. Blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween® 20 (Sigma) and 5% skim milk, and probed with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer. For detection of protein by chemiluminescence, appropriate secondary IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used. Blots were developed using an ECLTM Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized using the LAS-3000 Imaging System (Fujifilm). Densitometry quantification of immunoreactive signals was performed using MultiGauge (version 3; Fujifilm). Cell surface proteins were isolated from confluent SH-SY5Y cells cultured in 75-cm2 flasks post-copper treatments using the Pierce® Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer舗s instructions (Pierce) with some modifications. Briefly, for post-copper treatments, each flask of cells were labeled with 10 ml of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched with 500 μl of Quenching Solution supplied in the kit. Each flask of cells was harvested by scraping, and processed individually. After cell lysis, total protein concentration in the cell lysate was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and total protein of 150 μg from each flask was incubated with 125 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose to precipitate biotinylated surface proteins. Unbound proteins were removed by washes in Wash Buffer supplied in the kit supplemented with CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Biotinylated surface proteins were eluted from NeutrAvidin with 30 μl of 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and analyzed by Western blotting.

Briefly, after metal treatments as described above, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Brij-58 (Sigma) supplemented with CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cells were homogenized by passages through a 25-gauge needle. Total protein concentration in homogenates was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and homogenates containing 4 mg of total protein were adjusted to a 45% final concentration of sucrose (final volume, 1 ml). This was layered sequentially with 35% sucrose (2 ml) and 5% sucrose (2 ml) to form a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 46,600 × g at 4 °C for 19 h in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Ten 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. For the detection of Aβ, lipid rafts were isolated from SH-SY5Y (swAPP695) cells. For γ-secretase activity assay, sucrose gradient fractions, diluted with lysis buffer, were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 55,000 × g at 4 °C for 70 min in a Beckman TLA55 rotor. Lipid rafts were isolated from mice brains as described previously (28Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Younkin L.H. Wen-Lang L. Dickson D.W. Murakami T. Matsubara E. Abe K. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3801-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, brain homogenates containing 10 mg of total protein were adjusted to a 45% final concentration sucrose (final volume, 4 ml). The discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by sequential layering of 35% sucrose (4 ml) and 5% sucrose (4 ml). The samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 39,000 × g at 4 °C for 19 h in a Beckman SW40 rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Equal volumes (10 μl) of sucrose gradient fraction samples were analyzed for protein by Western blotting. SH-SY5Y cells and mice brain homogenates were pre-digested overnight in 50 μl of concentrated HNO3 (Aristar Grade, BDH), followed by heating to 90 °C for 20 min. The digested homogenate and sucrose gradient fraction samples were diluted with 1% HNO3 and metal levels (copper, iron, and zinc) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Ultramass 700, Varian, Australia). The instrument was calibrated using certified inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry standard solutions (AccuStandard) containing 0, 10, 50, and 100 ppb of all metals measured in 1% HNO3. Cholesterol was measured using the fluorometric Amplex Red cholesterol assay (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Fluorescence was detected with excitation wavelength at 560 ± 5 nm and emission at 590 ± 5 nm. Cholesterol levels in lipid raft fractions were expressed as a percentage of the total cellular or brain cholesterol. In vitro γ-secretase activity in sucrose gradient fractions were determined as the generation of ϵ-CTF from a recombinant APP substrate, as described previously (40Hoke D.E. Tan J.L. Ilaya N.T. Culvenor J.G. Smith S.J. White A.R. Masters C.L. Evin G.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5544-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membranes from the sucrose gradient fractions sedimented by ultracentrifugation were pooled, fractions 3–5 were designated lipid rafts and fractions 8–10, non-lipid rafts. Pooled lipid raft and non-lipid raft membrane pellets were resuspended in 18 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m KCl, and 0.5% CHAPSO. To start the reaction, 1 mm ATP and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine; 2.5 μg/ml each) were added to the reaction mixture, followed by 0.3 μg of purified MC99–3FLAG peptide. Assays were performed in parallel in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458 (1 μm; Merck). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Following Western blotting, ϵ-CTF was detected using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Gene Tools (version 3.07; SynGene) was used to quantify the density of ϵ-CTF immunoreactivity. Data were normalized to protein concentrations in the fraction pools. To account for nonspecific release of ϵ-CTF, γ-secretase activity for each sample was determined by subtracting ϵ-CTF immunoreactivity in the presence of L-685,458 from that without immunoreactivity. Quantified data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PrismTM Software for Windows. For SH-SY5Y cell data, statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni or linear trend post hoc tests; and for mice brain tissue data, statistical significance was determined by t test. Significance was defined as *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001. Amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs in lipid rafts (23Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J.

To eliminate confounding metal-mediated changes in APP expression and in cholesterol biosynthetic genes expression, all cell culture experiments were performed in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. We manipulated the intracellular copper levels by exposing SH-SY5Y cells for 3 h to serum-free HBSS medium containing: 1) copper chelators (50 μm BCS and 50 μmd-penicillamine) to induce copper deficiency; 2) 2 μm CuCl2; or 3) 5 μm CuCl2. The rationale for performing the in vitro SH-SY5Y cell culture experiments in the absence of serum was based on the observation that copper released from hippocampal neurons exists freely in solution, not bound to any protein (47Schlief M.L. Craig A.M. Gitlin J.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Also, the use of serum-free HBSS removes additional factors present in serum that could affect our data interpretation. Physiological concentrations of copper were selected based on the serum concentration of “free” non-ceruloplasmin bound copper in AD being 2.6 ± 4.6 μm (48Squitti R. Ventriglia M. Barbati G. Cassetta E. Ferreri F. Dal Forno G. Ramires S. Zappasodi F. Rossini P.M. J. Neural. Transm. 2007; 114: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the estimation of synaptic cleft copper concentration being 14 ± 4 μm (49Hopt A. Korte S. Fink H. Panne U. Niessner R. Jahn R. Kretzschmar H. Herms J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 128: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to medium containing 2 μm FeCl3 or ZnCl2 were included as metal specificity controls. Metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed that copper chelation selectively reduced intracellular copper levels and did not affect iron and zinc levels (supplemental Fig. S1, a–c). However, cellular copper deficiency induced by chelators was statistically insignificant compared with untreated control, and this was possibly due to partial metal deficiency as the result of serum-free HBSS usage. Intracellular copper levels were responsive to elevations in extracellular copper concentrations, and exogenous iron and zinc (2 μm) did not have an effect on intracellular copper levels (supplemental Fig. S1a). Similarly, intracellular iron and zinc levels were responsive only to changes in extracellular iron and zinc conditions, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1, b and c). Lipid rafts are recognized as detergent-insoluble membrane structures primarily composed of cholesterol and sphingolipids (50Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). We isolated lipid rafts, according to established protocols, as low-density buoyant detergent-insoluble membranes on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Flotillin-2, a commonly used lipid raft protein marker (51Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), was localized predominantly to the low-density fraction 4 of the untreated control cells with moderate immunoreactivity in fractions 3 and 5 (Fig. 1a). Smaller amounts of flotillin-2 immunoreactivity were also detected in heavier fractions 6–10. Fractions 3–5 were confirmed to contain lipid rafts by cholesterol analysis (Fig. 1b), which indicated that they were most enriched in cholesterol. On this basis, fractions 3–5 were designated as the lipid raft fractions. Extracellular copper manipulations (across a low phys"

In cardiovascular disease, the myofilament response to Ca(2+) is often altered. Compounds that rectify this perturbation are of considerable interest as therapeutics. Plant flavonoids have been found to provide protection against a variety of human illnesses such as cancer, infection, and heart disease. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), the prevalent flavonoid in green tea, modulates force generation in isolated guinea pig hearts (Hotta, Y., Huang, L., Muto, T., Yajima, M., Miyazeki, K., Ishikawa, N., Fukuzawa, Y., Wakida, Y., Tushima, H., Ando, H., and Nonogaki, T.

In this study we describe the solution structure of the Ca(2+)-saturated C-terminal domain of troponin C in complex with EGCg. Moreover, we show that EGCg forms a ternary complex with the C-terminal domain of troponin C and the anchoring region of troponin I. The structural evidence indicates that the binding site of EGCg on the C-terminal domain of troponin C is in the hydrophobic pocket in the absence of troponin I, akin to EMD 57033. Based on chemical shift mapping, the binding of EGCg to the C-terminal domain of troponin C in the presence of troponin I may be to a new site formed by the troponin C.troponin I complex. This interaction of EGCg with the C-terminal domain of troponin C.troponin I complex has not been shown with other cardiotonic molecules and illustrates the potential mechanism by which EGCg modulates heart contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2051560486,"Colorectal cancers with mutations in the p53 gene have an invasive property, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Through the screening of two data sets of the genome-wide expression profile, one for p53-introduced cells and the other for the numbers of cancer tissues, we report here X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR), a member of the TNFR superfamily, as a novel p53 target that has a crucial role in colorectal carcinogenesis. p53 upregulated XEDAR expression through two p53-binding sites within intron 1 of the XEDAR gene. We also found a significant correlation between decreased XEDAR expressions and p53 gene mutations in breast and lung cancer cell lines (P=0.0043 and P=0.0122, respectively). Furthermore, promoter hypermethylation of the XEDAR gene was detected in 20 of 20 colorectal cancer cell lines (100%) and in 6 of 12 colorectal cancer tissues (50%), respectively. Thus, the XEDAR expression was suppressed to <25% of surrounding normal tissues in 12 of 18 colorectal cancer tissues (66.7%) due to either its epigenetic alterations and/or p53 mutations. We also found that XEDAR interacted with and subsequently caused the accumulation of FAS protein, another member of p53-inducible TNFR. Moreover, XEDAR negatively regulated FAK, a central component of focal adhesion. As a result, inactivation of XEDAR resulted in the enhancement of cell adhesion and spreading, as well as resistance to p53-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings showed that XEDAR is a putative tumor suppressor that could prevent malignant transformation and tumor progression by regulating apoptosis and anoikis."
https://openalex.org/W1546045511,"Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) plays a critical role in the enterohepatic absorption of free cholesterol. Cellular cholesterol depletion induces the transport of NPC1L1 from the endocytic recycling compartment to the plasma membrane (PM), and cholesterol replenishment causes the internalization of NPC1L1 together with cholesterol via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Although NPC1L1 has been characterized, the other proteins involved in cholesterol absorption and the endocytic recycling of NPC1L1 are largely unknown. Most of the vesicular trafficking events are dependent on the cytoskeleton and motor proteins. Here, we investigated the roles of the microfilament and microfilament-associated triple complex composed of myosin Vb, Rab11a, and Rab11-FIP2 in the transport of NPC1L1 from the endocytic recycling compartment to the PM. Interfering with the dynamics of the microfilament by pharmacological treatment delayed the transport of NPC1L1 to the cell surface. Meanwhile, inactivation of any component of the myosin Vb.Rab11a.Rab11-FIP2 triple complex inhibited the export of NPC1L1. Expression of the dominant-negative mutants of myosin Vb, Rab11a, or Rab11-FIP2 decreased the cellular cholesterol uptake by blocking the transport of NPC1L1 to the PM. These results suggest that the efficient transport of NPC1L1 to the PM is dependent on the microfilament-associated myosin Vb.Rab11a.Rab11-FIP2 triple complex."
https://openalex.org/W2071844030,"Lafora progressive myoclonous epilepsy (Lafora disease; LD) is caused by mutations in the EPM2A gene encoding a dual specificity protein phosphatase named laforin. Our analyses on the Epm2a gene knock-out mice, which developed most of the symptoms of LD, reveal the presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (Ser(396) and Ser(202)) as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Intriguingly, NFTs were also observed in the skeletal muscle tissues of the knock-out mice. The hyperphosphorylation of Tau was associated with increased levels of the active form of GSK3 beta. The observations on Tau protein were replicated in cell lines using laforin overexpression and knockdown approaches. We also show here that laforin and Tau proteins physically interact and that the interaction was limited to the phosphatase domain of laforin. Finally, our in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that laforin dephosphorylates Tau, and therefore laforin is a novel Tau phosphatase. Taken together, our study suggests that laforin is one of the critical regulators of Tau protein, that the NFTs could underlie some of the symptoms seen in LD, and that laforin can contribute to the NFT formation in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1979553116,"Mirk/Dyrk1B is a serine/threonine kinase widely expressed in colon cancers. Serum starvation induced HD6 colon carcinoma cells to enter a quiescent G0 state, characterized by a 2N DNA content and a lower RNA content than G1 cells. Compared with cycling cells, quiescent cells exhibited 16-fold higher levels of the retinoblastoma protein p130/Rb2, which sequesters E2F4 to block entry into G1, 10-fold elevated levels of the CDK inhibitor p27kip1, and 10-fold higher levels of Mirk. However, depletion of Mirk did not prevent entry into G0, but enabled quiescent HD6, SW480, and colo320 colon carcinoma cells to acquire some biochemical characteristics of G1 cells, including increased levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 because of slower turnover, increased activity of their CDK4/cyclin D complexes, and increased phosphorylation and decreased E2F4 sequestering ability of the CDK4 target, p130/Rb2. As a result, depletion of Mirk allowed some cells to escape quiescence and enabled cells released from quiescence to traverse G1 more quickly. The kinase activity of Mirk was increased by the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Treatment of p53 mutant colon cancer cells with 5-FU led to an elongated G1 in a Mirk-dependent manner, as G1 was shortened by ectopic overexpression of cyclin D1 mutated at the Mirk phosphorylation site (T288A), but not by wild-type cyclin D1.

Mirk, through regulating cyclin D turnover, and the CDK inhibitor p27, as shown by depletion studies, functioned independently and additively to regulate the exit of tumor cells from quiescence. Solitary disseminated tumor cells that are negative for proliferation markers such as Ki67 are thought to be the source of tumor recurrence. These dormant tumor cells are quiescent, reversibly arrested in the G0 part of the cell cycle, and can re-enter the cell cycle under favorable clues from the microenvironment. Quiescence is not simply a long G1 period, but is characterized by specific changes in gene expression (1Coller H. Sang L. Roberts J.M. PLOS Biol. 2006; 4: 329-349Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Factors that allow the prolonged survival of quiescent tumor cells in vivo are of clinical relevance and include antioxidant proteins.

The serine/threonine kinase Mirk was recently shown to reduce ROS levels in two pancreatic cancer cell lines by increasing transcription of a cohort of genes that detoxify superoxides and prevent the generation of hydroxyl radicals (3Deng X.

Mirk/Dyrk1B is a member of a conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that are activated by intramolecular tyrosine phosphorylation and which mediate maturation in different tissues: Mirk in skeletal muscle, Dyrk1A in the brain, etc. One role of Mirk in skeletal muscle differentiation after a stress signal of serum deprivation is to block cycling myoblasts in the G0 quiescent state (4Deng X.

Phosphorylation by Mirk at a conserved ubiquitination site initiated proteolysis of cyclin D1, while p27kip1 was stabilized following phosphorylation by Mirk at Ser-10. Recently the survival factors Bcl2 and BclXL were shown to mediate G0 quiescence in NIH3T3 cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts through increasing p27kip1 stability, which required phosphorylation of p27Ser-10 by Mirk (7Janumyan Y.

These observations are consistent with Mirk function as a G0 kinase in nontransformed cells. Recently, observations have pointed to the importance of cancer cells arrested in a reversible quiescent state to undergo repair. Cell cycle restriction through the CDK inhibitor p21cip1 was shown to both limit DNA damage and maintain the self-renewal of leukemia stem cells (8Viale A. De Franco F. Orleth A. Cambiaghi V.

Expression of leukemia-associated oncogenes in mouse hematopoietic stem cells induced DNA damage and activated a p21cip1-dependent response that led to reversible cell cycle arrest in a quiescent state and DNA repair.

Immunodetection was performed as described (15Jin K. Lim S. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42097-42105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HT29/clone HD6 colon carcinoma cells were chosen for this study because, after culture to confluent density, they cease cell division and differentiate into the goblet cell lineage without the addition of chemical agents (17Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these cultured cells can enter a quiescent state. In earlier studies on Mirk effects on cell cycling, cell lines were used in which the Mirk gene was highly amplified, elevating Mirk protein levels 10–20-fold higher than in other cancer cell lines (3Deng X. Ewton D.Z. Friedman E. Cancer Research. 2009; 69: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Mirk gene is not amplified in HD6 cells, which may be more representative of the typical cancer cell in which Mirk is expressed. Stably overexpressed Mirk in HT29 subclones mediated cell survival, so these colon cancer cells were suitable for the study of Mirk function (9Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies showed that most HD6 cells could be made to reversibly enter a quiescent state when the cells were cultured for 48 h in serum-free conditions in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A two-stage staining method used Hoechst dye to bind to all double-stranded DNA followed by Pyronin Y dye to bind RNA. The majority of serum-starved cells (74–88%) had a 2N DNA content by flow cytometric analysis after binding Hoechst 33258 (Fig. 1, C and D) or, in parallel experiments, propidium iodide (Fig. 2A, Table 1). Most serum-starved cells that had accumulated with a 2N DNA content also had a low RNA level (Fig. 1C), so were in G0 (Fig. 1D, gold cells). Cultures of the serum-starved cells were analyzed in parallel to cultures of serum-starved cells released by a change to growth medium containing the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU to initiate S phase checkpoints, and the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole to block any remaining cycling cells in G2+M, so only one cell cycle was allowed in the 24-h release period. Analysis of serum-starved cultures by two-parameter flow cytometry demonstrated that 86% of cells were in G0, with few cells in other cell cycle phases (Fig. 1D), while after release from quiescence, most cells had entered the cell cycle, with only 22% remaining in G0 (Fig. 1D). Thus the majority of the quiescent HD6 cells remained capable of re-entering the cell cycle under appropriate conditions.FIGURE 2Mirk depletion enables colon cancer cells to rapidly traverse G1 when released from quiescence, but does not detectably affect cycling of human diploid fibroblasts. A, HD6 colon carcinoma cells were depleted of Mirk by RNAi duplexes siA or siC or mock-depleted and then made quiescent as in Fig. 1. Cells were then released by change to medium containing 7% FBS and the mitotic inhibitor vinblastine at 2 nm so only one cell cycle would be analyzed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Data shown are representative of five replicate experiments, with the quantitation shown in Table 1. B, Mirk depletion does not detectably affect cell cycle progression of human diploid fibroblasts. Strain BJ cells were depleted of Mirk by transient transfection with RNAi duplexes siA and siC or mock-depleted with control RNAi by a 48-h transfection in growth medium with Lipofectamine 2000, then accumulated in G0/G1 by 24 h culture in serum-free medium. Cells were then released by a change to medium containing 7% FBS and 2 nm vinblastine to arrest cycling cells in G2+M and were analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry 0 and 48 h following release. The number of cells analyzed per panel was 3680 ± 1218 (S.D.) (n = 6), with similar results in three similar experiments.

Open table in a new tab A time course analysis was used to characterize the quiescent cultures. During serum-starvation Mirk protein levels increased 10-fold, as did levels of the CDK inhibitor p27kip1, a well known marker of quiescent cells (Fig. 1A). The retinoblastoma protein family member p130/Rb2 sequesters the E2F4 transcription factor, preventing progression of mammalian cells into G1. The protein level of p130/Rb2 is elevated in quiescent cells and decreased in proliferating cells (18Smith E.J. Leone G. Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent HD6 cells (48-h point, Fig. 1A) exhibited 16-fold higher levels of p130/Rb2 than cells in log phase growth (zero time point). When cells are stimulated to enter G1 by addition of mitogens, p130/Rb2 is phosphorylated by G1 cyclin/CDK complexes and migrates more slowly. When HD6 cells were in log phase growth, their p130/Rb2 exhibited slow mobility, while when cells entered a quiescent state after 48 h of serum starvation, their p130/Rb2 species exhibited a more rapid migration, consistent with less phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, compare upper and lower ●, left margin). The differentially phosphorylated p130/Rb2 forms were more readily seen in a lower percent gel (Fig. 1A, lowest panel). When cells are stimulated to enter G1 by addition of mitogens, p130 is phosphorylated by G1 cyclin/CDK complexes, migrates more slowly, and releases E2F4. Depletion of Mirk gave the same result as addition of FBS, conversion of p130/Rb2 by phosphorylation into slower-migrating species (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of lysates with lambda phosphatase collapsed all of the p130/Rb2 bands into one high mobility form in a dose-dependent manner. Thus Mirk depletion in these quiescent colon carcinoma cells increased the activity of the CDK4/cyclin D complexes which inactivate the pRb2 protein by phosphorylation. Moreover, quiescent HD6 cells in G0 accumulate the G1 phase biochemical marker of inactivated p130/Rb2 when depleted of Mirk. The role of Mirk in quiescent cells was evaluated by RNA interference using transient transfection of synthetic RNAi duplexes (Fig. 2C). Mirk-depleted cells still entered a G0 quiescent state, but fewer cells were found in G0 (71% versus 86%) and more in sub-G0 regions (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Depletion of Mirk in quiescent SU86.86 pancreatic cancer cells led to increased cell death because of a 2-fold higher intracellular level of ROS (3Deng X. Ewton D.Z. Friedman E. Cancer Research. 2009; 69: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A similar 2-fold increase in ROS levels was seen in Mirk-depleted colon cancer cells (data not shown), suggesting that the loss of cells from quiescent colon cancer cultures was a common feature when Mirk was depleted. Surprisingly, when Mirk-depleted quiescent cells were released into growth medium, more cells entered cycle, with 76% in S and G2+M, versus 46% for the mock-depleted culture (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Mirk-depleted cells were more capable of exiting the quiescent state. To explore this further, Mirk was depleted by two RNAi duplexes, each targeted to a different region of the Mirk mRNA (Fig. 2C), and time course studies were done using flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining (Fig. 2A). By this analysis, more Mirk-depleted HD6, SKCO1, and SW480 colon cancer cells than control cells had slipped from quiescence during serum starvation and had a >2N DNA content (zero time points in Fig. 2A and Table 1). After 12 h of release from quiescence, the majority of HD6 cells depleted of Mirk by either RNAi duplex were either in S phase or G2/M, while the majority of the mock-depleted cells remained in G0/G1 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were found whether cells were released into medium containing either of two microtubule inhibitors, nocodazole or vinblastine (Table 1). Depletion of Mirk primed quiescent colon cancer cells so they could rapidly enter cycle when serum growth factors were restored. Because Mirk is widely expressed in normal tissues at low levels (9Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), depletion of Mirk might allow quiescent normal diploid cells to re-enter cycle. Culture of the human BJ strain of normal diploid fibroblasts in serum-free medium led cells to accumulate predominately with a 2N DNA content whether depleted of Mirk by either of two RNAi duplexes (Fig. 2C) or mock-depleted with GC-matched control RNAi, 70–74% (±2%) and 77 (±2)%, respectively (Fig. 2B, three replicate experiments, Table 1). A similar fraction of Mirk-depleted and mock-depleted cells were either in S phase or G2/M 24 and 48 h after release from serum-starvation (Fig. 2B, Table 2 and data not shown). Thus depletion of Mirk had no detectable effect on the cycling of normal diploid fibroblasts, possibly because these cells had a normal G1 checkpoint. Each of the three colon cancer cell lines studied in Fig. 2A and TABLE 1, TABLE 2 had mutant p53, so lacked the p53-induced p21 G1 checkpoint. Mirk protein was not detectable in colon cancer cell lines RKO and HCT116 with wild-type p53 (data not shown) so the effect of Mirk depletion could not be tested in these lines.TABLE 2Mirk depletion increases the cycling of colon cancer cells but not of normal diploid fibroblasts as analyzed by one-parameter flow cytometry in BJ diploid human fibroblasts+2 nm vinblastine% Cells in G0/G1% Cells in S phase% Cells in G2+MCt siMirk siAMirk siCCt siMirk siAMirk siCCt siMirk siAMirk siC0 h77 (2)an = 3; mean (S.D.).70 (2)74 (2)8 (3)14 (4)8 (3)15 (5)16 (6)18 (4)24 h64 (6)62 (8)56 (13)19 (3)20 (8)28 (9)17 (6)17 (6)17 (6)48 h302629393336314035a n = 3; mean (S.D.). Open table in a new tab In microarray analysis, depletion of Mirk did not alter expression of cell cycle regulatory genes such as cyclins or CDK inhibitors, or any growth factor (not shown). However, in earlier studies with nontransformed Mv1Lu cells overexpression of Mirk was observed to initiate a reversible arrest in G0 because Mirk targeted the G1 cyclin, cyclin D1, for rapid turnover by phosphorylation at a ubiquitination site conserved in all cyclin D isoforms (5Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of cyclin D1 are commonly seen in colon cancer (19Wang H.L. Wang J. Xiao S.Y. Haydon R. Stoiber D. He T.C. Bissonnette M. Hart J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 101: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) so all cells were expected to exhibit some level of this cyclin. Depletion of Mirk in SW480 and colo320 colon cancer cells by two RNAi duplexes targeted to different regions of the Mirk mRNA led to average 2-fold and 4-fold increases in cyclin D1 levels, respectively (Fig. 3A), because of an increase in cyclin D half-life (data not shown). Similarly, quiescent HD6 cells had an average of 3-fold more cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 if Mirk had been depleted because of less turnover (Fig. 3, B and E and data not shown). The Mirk phosphorylation site is conserved between cyclins D1 and D3, and Mirk has been shown to increase the turnover of both cyclins in pancreatic cancer cells (3Deng X. Ewton D.Z. Friedman E. Cancer Research. 2009; 69: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Depletion of Mirk in HD6 cells increased the half-life of cyclin D1 compared with control-depleted cells (Fig. 3E), accounting for the increased protein abundance. In earlier studies, stable Mirk transfectants of colon cancer cells were shown to exhibit a faster turnover of cyclin D1 (20Ewton D.Z. Lee K. Deng X. Lim S. Friedman E. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, both Mirk depletion (this study) and Mirk overexpression studies showed that Mirk destabilized cyclin D isoforms in colon cancer cells. Progression from G0 into G1 and through G1 is mediated by CDK4/cyclin complexes, which phosphorylate members of the retinoblastoma protein family, pRb and p130/Rb2. Depletion of Mirk led to more phosphorylation of p130/Rb2 (Fig. 1B), consistent with increased CDK4 activity. CDK4 activity was directly measured by immunoprecipitation of CDK4/cyclin complexes from mock-depleted and Mirk-depleted quiescent cultures of HD6 cells, and for another control, from mock-depleted cultures 12 h after release from quiescence (Fig. 3C) when levels of cyclins D3, D1, and E were at low levels as cells had entered cycle (Figs. 3B and 2A). Mirk-depleted quiescent cells exhibited about three times as much CDK4 activity as mock-depleted quiescent HD6 cells, consistent with their higher levels of cyclin D3 and D1 (Fig. 3C). When many HD6 cells were progressing through S and G2 12 h after release from quiescence (Fig. 2A), their CDK4 activity was even lower, reflecting the low levels of G1 cyclins (Fig. 3, B and C). Depletion of Mirk led to inactivation of the G0 maintaining protein p130/Rb2, the retinoblastoma protein family member that blocks entry into G1. Mirk was significantly depleted in HD6 and in SW620 cells by a different duplex RNAi (siD) (Fig. 3D) than that used in Fig. 1B (siA); but in both experiments decreased mobility of p130 was seen when Mirk is depleted. Slower migrating p130/Rb2 bands consistent with more phosphorylation by cyclin D/CDK complexes were seen (arrowhead). The p130/Rb2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE by Western blotting for E2F4 co-immunoprecipitated with p130, with loading controlled by the amount of antibody heavy chain (H-chain) in the immunoprecipitates. There was less E2F4 associated with p130/Rb2 in Mirk-depleted HD6 cells and in Mirk-depleted SW620 cells (Fig. 3D). Thus depletion of Mirk increased the percentage of p130 in more highly phosphorylated forms with lower mobility, that have less ability to sequester the transcription factor E2F4 which controls entry into G1. As a result, Mirk-depleted quiescent HD6 cells, although primarily in G0 (Fig. 1D), attained some biochemical markers of cells in G1: elevated levels of G1 cyclins, elevated CDK4 kinase activity on the retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 3), and phosphorylated p130/Rb2 (Figs. 1B and 3D). DNA damage activates p38MAPK in tumor cells with mutant p53 (21Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), such as HD6, SW480, and colo320 colon cancer cells. The kinase Mirk is activated by the same SAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6 (10Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Lim S. Zou Y. Friedman E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), so drugs that activate stress signaling would be expected to activate Mirk. In fact, the nucleoside analogue 5-FU induced a long-term 2–3-fold increase in Mirk kinase activity with activation seen at least for 24 h (Fig. 4A). Treatment with 5-FU led to lower cyclin D1 levels (Fig. 4B), possibly by initiating the rapid turnover of cyclin D1 through activation of Mirk, suggesting that 5-FU activation of Mirk would alter cell cycling. Four colon cancer cell lines were made quiescent with at least 70% of cells in G0/G1, then released into growth medium containing 1 μm 5-FU and the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole to block any cycling cells in G2+M. RKO cells have wild-type p53 genes, so when released from quiescence, they were arrested by 5-FU at a G1 checkpoint through p53 induction of p21cip1 (Fig. 4C), while control cells not treated with 5-FU passed through G1 and S and were accumulated in G2+M by nocodazole. SW480, colo320, and HD6 cells are all deficient in p53 so they lack its G1 checkpoint. When released from quiescence into medium containing 5-FU for 24 h, some cells from each of these 3 lines were found accumulated in G1 (Figs. 4C and 1D, data not shown) as well as at the S and G2 checkpoints known to be mediated by the Chk1 and Chk2 checkpoint kinases (24Zachos G. Rainey M.D. Gillespie D.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Robinson H.M. Jones R. Walker M. Zachos G. Brown R. Cassidy J. Gillespie D.A.

DNA damage initiated by 5-FU has been seen to activate a G1 checkpoint in some tumor cells by other investigators (27Yoshikawa R. Kusunoki M. Yanagi H. Noda M. Furuyama J.I. Yamamura T. Hashimoto-Tamaoki T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1029-1037PubMed Google Scholar), so engagement of this checkpoint may cause the accumulation in G1 of HD6 (Fig. 1D), SW480 (Fig. 4D), and colo320 (data not shown) colon cancer cells. To more fully determine whether Mirk may mediate some aspects of this G1 checkpoint in p53 mutant colon cancer cells, time course experiments were performed following Mirk depletion. HD6 cultures of either Mirk-depleted or mock-depleted cells were made quiescent, then released for 0–24 h in the presence"

https://openalex.org/W2070828244,"We have purified and characterized a specific CTP:molybdopterin cytidylyltransferase for the biosynthesis of the molybdopterin (MPT) cytosine dinucleotide (MCD) cofactor in Escherichia coli. The protein, named MocA, shows 22% amino acid sequence identity to E. coli MobA, the specific GTP:molybdopterin guanylyltransferase for molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis. MocA is essential for the activity of the MCD-containing enzymes aldehyde oxidoreductase YagTSR and the xanthine dehydrogenases XdhABC and XdhD. Using a fully defined in vitro assay, we showed that MocA, Mo-MPT, CTP, and MgCl2 are required and sufficient for MCD biosynthesis in vitro. The activity of MocA is specific for CTP; other nucleotides such as ATP and GTP were not utilized. In the defined in vitro system a turnover number of 0.37+/-0.01 min(-1) was obtained. A 1:1 binding ratio of MocA to Mo-MPT and CTP was determined to monomeric MocA with dissociation constants of 0.23+/-0.02 microm for CTP and 1.17+/-0.18 microm for Mo-MPT. We showed that MocA was also able to convert MPT to MCD in the absence of molybdate, however, with only one catalytic turnover. The addition of molybdate after one turnover gave rise to a higher MCD production, revealing that MCD remains bound to MocA in the absence of molybdate. This work presents the first characterization of a specific enzyme involved in MCD biosynthesis in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1980179678,"It is well established that CpG promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine and antibody production by B cells via the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent pathway. However, scavenger receptors (SRs) are also capable of binding such pathogen-derived molecules, yet their contribution to CpG-induced signaling events has not yet been evaluated. Here we identified a novel TLR9-independent mechanism of CpG-induced signaling and immune function that is mediated by the scavenger B1 receptor (SR-B1).

CpG-induced calcium signals and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 adhesion are TLR9-independent and are mediated exclusively by SR-B1. Although pro-inflammatory cytokine and Ig production induced by CpG require TLR9 expression, we also found that SR-B1 negatively regulates TLR9-dependent production of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and IgM.

PLCγ2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (for review see Ref. 1Berridge M.J.

Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores and the resulting depletion of Ca2+ (not an increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+]) are the central and prerequisite events required to activate plasma membrane “store-operated” calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels.

CRAC channels are responsible for antigen receptor-triggered calcium entry; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that CRAC channels do not underlie all the diverse calcium-regulated responses of lymphocytes, particularly those triggered by innate stimuli. For example, we previously identified several calcium-permeant non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) that are uniquely activated by distinct arachidonic acid-derived (eicosanoid) inflammatory mediators and by mechanical stimuli (5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Zhu P. Liu X. Labelle E.F. Freedman B.D. J.

Thus, multiple calcium-permeant channels with distinct activation mechanisms may underlie stimulus-specific calcium-dependent B cell functions in vivo. Surprisingly, a number of pathogen-associated Toll-like receptor agonists are known to be strong B cell mitogens, yet the potential for calcium-dependent signaling functions by these polyclonal B cell mitogens has not yet been fully evaluated. Studies detailed in this report focus on the mechanism of calcium signaling elicited by unmethylated CpG DNA in primary B cells. Unmethylated CpG DNA is typically considered a pathogen-derived molecule that triggers polyclonal B cell activation, cytokine production, and immunoglobulin production via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement (8Bauer S. Kirschning C.J. Häcker H. Redecke V. Hausmann S. Akira S. Wagner H. Lipford G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 9Hemmi H. Takeuchi O.

Because CpG induces a subset of the B cell responses normally elicited by cognate antigen binding to the BCR complex, we asked whether CpG stimulation mobilizes calcium. We found that while CpG stimulation and BCR engagement both elicit similar biphasic calcium signals, CpG-mediated calcium entry is regulated by TRPC3, a calcium-permeant NSCC of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel family (10Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and that, unlike the BCR, which couples to calcium entry via PLCγ-2, TRPC3 activation involves an adaptor like function of PLCγ-1. We also report that CpG-mediated calcium signals are initiated by the scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) independently of TLR9. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SR-B1 function in B lymphocytes; although scavenger receptors have been implicated in the responses of other immune cells. For example, bacterial pathogens and byproducts of apoptotic cells contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases, including lupus in part via MARCO and CD36 expressed by marginal zone macrophages (11Wermeling F. Chen Y. Pikkarainen T. Scheynius A. Winqvist O. Izui S. Ravetch J.V. Tryggvason K. Karlsson M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In naïve B cells, CD36 expression is largely restricted to marginal zone cells. Notably, CD36 cooperates with TLR2 to produce antibodies against phosphocholine, which is an endogenous antigen (13Won W.J. Bachmann M.F. Kearney J.F. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given our finding that CpG elicits calcium signals via SR-B1 on lymphocytes, we asked whether SR-B1 might also act cooperatively, in this case with TLR9, to trigger inflammatory responses of B cells. In fact, our results indicate that SR-B1 negatively regulates CpG/TLR9-mediated production of specific immunoglobulins (IgM) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) by B cells. These findings have important implications for understanding how calcium is regulated in B cells, but also point to novel mechanisms by which pathogen-associated molecules regulate B cell activation. B lymphocytes purified from spleens of C57Bl/6 mice by negative immunomagnetic separation (Stemcell Technologies) were loaded with fura-2 AM (3.0 μm, Invitrogen) and intracellular Ca2+ was measured by digital imaging microscopy as previously described (5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All results are expressed as the fura-2 fluorescence emission ratio at 510 nm. The BCR was engaged using soluble anti-mouse F(ab′)2 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Phosphorothioester derivatives of stimulatory (CpG, ODN1826: 5′-TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT-3′) and a control variant of ODN1826 (GpC, 5′-TCC ATG AGC TTC CTG AGC TT-3′) were synthesized and high-performance liquid chromatography purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). CpG was used at a final concentration of 2.5 μm for calcium measurements unless stated otherwise. Total RNA was extracted from purified splenic B cells or bone narrow derived macrophages with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA), and cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA), and random hexamer primers. cDNA was subject to 40 amplification cycles with SR primers (300 nm) of the following sequences: SRA sense, 5′-AGA ATT TCA GCA TGG CAA CTG; SRA antisense, 5′-ACG GAC TCT GAC ATG CAG TG; MARCO sense, 5′-GCA CTG CTG CTG ATT CAA GTT C-3′; MARCO antisense, 5′-AGT TGC TCC TGG CTG GTA TG-3′; SRB1 sense, 5′-GAC GGG CGT CCA GAA TTT C-3′; SR-B1 antisense, 5′-AGC GAG GAT TCG GGT GTC AT-3′; SRB2 sense, 5′-AAAAGGCATGCATCCCAACA-3′; SRB2 antisense, 5′-GTC CTG ATG TCT CCC GTT TCA-3′; CD36 sense, 5′-GTG ACG TGG CAA AGA ACA G-3′; CD36 antisense, 5′-AAA GGA GGC TGC GTC TGT G-3′; Macrosialin sense, 5′-TCC AAG ATC CTC CAC TGT TG-3′; Macrosialin antisense, 5′-CAT TGT ATT CCA CCG CCA TG-3′; LOX1 sense, 5′-ATG AAT TTG GAA ATG GCT TTT G-3′; LOX1 antisense, 5′-TCA CTG AGT TAG CAA TAA ATT TG-3′; SRECI sense, 5′-CTG GGC CGT CAT GGT AAG AA-3′; SRECI antisense, 5′-GGG CCA TAG GGA CCA TCT CT-3′; SRECII sense, 5′-CAA CGT TTT TGT GGA AGC TTC AG-3′; and SRECII antisense, 5′-GCA GTT GAG TGT GTT GTC TAG GTC AT-3′. For Western analysis, B cells lysates with ∼30 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis. Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membrane were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). siRNA transfection of primary cells was performed by a modification of the procedure previously described (14Gomez T.S. Kumar K. Medeiros R.B. Shimizu Y. Leibson P.J. Billadeau D.D. Immunity. 2007; 26: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Purified splenic B cells were first activated with lipopolysaccharide (0.5 μg/ml) for 24 h, then incubated (5 million B cells) in 500 μl of culture medium (without 2-mercaptoethanol or antibiotics) containing 1000 pmol of TRPC3 or SR-B1 SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) for 10 min at room temperature in an electroporation cuvette (BTX, 4-mm gap). Transfection was performed using a single 10-ms pulse at 295 V with a BTX ECM 830 electroporator. Transfected cells were washed and cultured for an additional 48 h in complete medium, and then used in functional experiments. The efficiency of RNA interference-mediated protein suppression was assessed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against targeted proteins and typically exceeded 90% suppression. Antibodies against TRPC3 were obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel), SR-B1 were obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and phosphotyrosine (4G11) from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Single cell suspensions were prepared from dissociated spleens. Purified B cells (2 × 105) were stimulated with CpG or other agonists for 48–72 h in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, non-essential amino acids, OPI media supplement (Sigma), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Ig levels in culture supernatants at 48 h were measured using a kit (Southern Biotech). Supernatants collected at 72 h were analyzed for IL-6 and IL-10 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (eBiosciences). Samples were processed in duplicate and recombinant cytokines used to establish standard curves (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) ranging from 8 to 4000 pg/ml. Cell integrin avidity changes were assessed using a VCAM-1 adhesion assay as previously described (5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Patch clamp recordings were performed on primary B lymphocytes identified visually by negative immunofluorescence (CD3 negative) in the microscope recording chamber. Patch pipettes were fabricated with a 4- to 6-MΩ (for whole cell recording) or 5- to 10-MΩ (for single channel recording) tip resistance (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) from borosilicate glass and were back-filled with appropriate internal solution. Liquid junction potentials were calculated and were corrected manually with the patch clamp amplifier or post analysis. Capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. Between 50 and 70% of the series resistance was electronically compensated to minimize voltage errors. Command potentials were generated using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and currents acquired, stored, and analyzed using PulseFit software (Heka Elektronic, Germany). Single channel amplitude frequency analysis was performed using QuB software (15Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 264-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded using the standard whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique. Cells were first held at 0 mV, then stepped to −80 mV and subjected to a linear voltage ramp (100 ms) to 80 mV with a sampling interval of 0.2 ms. This ramp protocol was repeated every 2 s, and the time course of the whole cell currents was obtained by plotting the mean current amplitude at −80 mV for each cycle. Cell membrane capacitance values were used to estimate the cell surface area, and results are expressed as the current amplitude per unit membrane capacitance (pA/pF). All ramp currents were leak-corrected by subtracting ramp currents obtained after establishing a stable whole cell recording from the ramp current obtained after agonist-induced current activation. Measurements of the relative Ca2+ versus Na+ permeability (PCa/PNa) were calculated using the measured reversal potential of CpG-induced currents recorded in a bath solution containing 30 mm Ca2+ and a pipette solution containing 10 mm Na+ using the equation, Erev = RT/2F ln{4PCa2+[Ca2+]o/PNa+[Na+]i}. Single channel recordings were also obtained using the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp as previously described (7Liu X. Zhu P. Freedman B.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C873-C882Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membrane-permeant drugs were typically applied by direct addition to the bath. For some whole cell, patch clamp recording measurements, membrane-impermeant monoclonal antibodies were dialyzed from the recording microelectrode into the cytoplasm of single cells to neutralize the function of PLCγ isoforms as previously demonstrated by us and others (5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Physiol. 2000; 523: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Direct visualization of cytoplasmic filling with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies demonstrated that the time required for complete cytoplasmic dialysis using this approach is <2 min. Given that unmethylated bacterial CpG DNA is a powerful polyclonal B cell mitogen and that calcium regulates lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and effector functions, studies were initiated to examine whether CpG mobilizes calcium in primary B lymphocytes. We found that CpG elicited a large [Ca2+]i increase comparable to that triggered by BCR engagement (Fig. 1A). Notably, this response, which was observed in both murine and human primary B cells (Fig. 1B), did not require TLR9 (Fig. 1C) or MyD88 expression (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting the presence of a previously unrecognized CpG-induced TLR9-independent pathway. Although CpG-induced calcium mobilization was not observed in a previous studies (17Busconi L. Bauer J.W. Tumang J.R. Laws A. Perkins-Mesires K. Tabor A.S. Lau C. Corley R.B. Rothstein T.L. Lund F.E. Behrens T.W. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7397-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Uccellini M.B. Busconi L. Green N.M. Busto P. Christensen S.R. Shlomchik M.J. Marshak-Rothstein A. Viglianti G.A. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5875-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), low concentrations (∼100 nm) utilized also did not produce a response in our hands (Fig. 1D, left panel). These findings suggested that different thresholds may exist for unique CpG-induced functional effects. Importantly, the calcium signals we observe are not selective for CpG, as a control oligonucleotide that differed from CpG 1826 only by the inversion of two CG motifs (GpC) elicited a signal with the identical dose sensitivity as CpG 1826 (Fig. 1D, right panel). Thus, together with the data demonstrating CpG-induced calcium mobilization in TLR9-deficient B cells, these data indicate that DNA (both CpG and GpC) elicits calcium signals through a novel TLR9-independent pathway that is less restrictive in its nucleotide recognition. Because the calcium signal triggered by CpG superficially resembles that initiated by BCR engagement, we next asked whether it occurs by a similar mechanism. Antigen receptor-induced calcium entry occurs through CRAC channels, which are activated by intracellular calcium store depletion. In calcium-free medium, we found that CpG produced a transient elevation in cytoplasmic calcium due to release from intracellular stores and subsequent perfusion with calcium replete medium produced a secondary sustained [Ca2+] elevation in primary mouse and human B cells (see Fig. 1, B and C) consistent with entry via plasma membrane calcium-permeant channels. We used the patch clamp to determine whether CpG, like the BCR, activates CRAC channels or if distinct store-operated or store-independent channels are responsible for CpG-induced calcium entry. CpG treatment elicited relatively large amplitude inward currents (−37.4 ± 10.0 picoamps/picofarad, Vm = −80 mV, n = 26) that exhibited a linear current-voltage relationship and a reversal potential near 0 mV in primary mouse (−4.2 ± 1.6 mV; Fig. 2A, left panels) and human B cells (Fig. 2A, right panels). The single channel conductance (Fig. 2B, 18.8 ± 0.2 pS, n = 5) and the relative Ca2+ versus Na+ permeability (2.2 ± 0.3, n = 4) suggest that calcium-permeant NSCCs and not CRAC channels are responsible for CpG-induced calcium entry. We previously identified the expression of eight TRP family NSCCs in murine B cells (5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and, of these, TRPC3 has biophysical properties that most closely resemble currents elicited by CpG (Fig. 2C). To determine if TRPC3 contributed functionally to the CpG-induced calcium elevations that we observe, primary B cells were transfected with siRNA, to suppress TRPC3 expression (Fig. 2D). Notably reduction of TRPC3 expression substantially attenuated CpG-induced calcium signals (Fig. 2E) but had no effect on BCR-induced responses. Neither CpG- nor BCR-induced Ca2+ signals were affected by suppression of the SR MARCO (supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these results indicate that CpG-induced calcium signaling is regulated by activation of TRPC3. Native TRPC3 is not store-operated; however, some studies have reported that ectopically expressed TRPC3 channels can operate in a store-dependent manner (19Löf C. Blom T. Törnquist K. J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 216: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given that CpG triggers calcium release from stores (see Fig. 1, B and C), we examined whether calcium store depletion activates endogenous TRPC3-like currents in primary B cells. Thapsigargin, which blocks sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase that maintain stores in a filled state, elicited CRAC currents in B cells (Fig. 2F) but did not elicit non-selective cation currents. Together, these data suggest that CpG-induced calcium signals are mediated by TRPC3 activation via a store-independent mechanism. Given that CpG, like BCR engagement, induces calcium release from stores, we next examined whether CpG activates the proximal effector proteins involved in BCR-mediated calcium mobilization. Although CpG increases phosphorylation of dual protein bands with the mobility of Lyn kinase, it does not induce phosphorylation of other critical molecules which link the BCR to calcium release from stores, including Syk, Btk, BLNK, or PLCγ-2 (Fig. 3A). We confirmed that Lyn was indeed phosphorylated by CpG by performing a Lyn immunoblot analysis of phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B, top panel). Given that PLCg-2 is not phosphorylated by CpG, we next examined whether CpG activates PLCγ-1. PLCγ-1 is not considered a major isoform in B cell; however, it was detectable in primary B cells (Fig. 3B, bottom panel, right lane). Because neither CpG nor BCR engagement induced a measurable change in PLCγ-2 or PLCγ-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, bottom panel), we used a direct approach to determine whether TRPC3 activation by CpG requires either PLCγ-1 or PLCγ-2. To do this we neutralized these distinct isoforms in situ by dialyzing isoform-specific antibodies into the cytoplasm of single B cells. Antibodies used in this approach are capable of recognizing two-dimensional forms of these proteins and were identical to those we used previously to define the mechanism of mechanical signaling in B cells (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 5Liu Q.H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. Freedman B.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that PLCγ-2 neutralization blocked BCR-induced CRAC channel activation and did not affect CpG-induced TRPC3 activation. Surprisingly the converse was observed for CpG responses. PLCγ-1 neutralization in situ efficiently blocked CpG activation of TRPC3 channels, yet it did not disrupt activation of CRAC channels by BCR engagement (Fig. 3C). Together, these results demonstrate that neutralization of these proteins in situ is specific, as the BCR response served as both a positive and negative control for these antibodies, and that although CpG-mediated activation of TRPC3 is store independent, it is regulated by PLCγ-1. Direct interactions between PLCγ-1 and TRPC3 have been identified in cell lines, and it appears that this physical interaction regulates TRPC3 activity (20van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine if PLCγ-1 serves a similar adaptor-like role for TRPC3 activation in B cells, we generated a membrane permeant peptide, corresponding to the domain of PLCγ-1 that interacts with TRPC3, to serve as a competitive inhibitor of this interaction (Fig. 3D, 10987). Notably, peptide 10987 completely blocked CpG (Fig. 3E, left panel)-, but not BCR-mediated calcium mobilization (Fig. 3E, right panel). These conditions had no effect on CpG-induced calcium release from stores but strongly suppressed calcium entry. The small degree of residual calcium entry in the presence of the PLCγ-1 peptide was similar to that observed upon solution change and did not reflect cell activation by CpG. Consequently, our inability to elicit CRAC currents in B cells with CpG and the fact that CpG-induced calcium entry is fully suppressed when TRPC3 activation is blocked indicates that TPC3 alone underlies this response. Together, these data suggest that TRPC3 activation is regulated by a physical interaction with PLCγ-1. Given that TLR9 and MyD88 are not required for CpG-induced calcium mobilization, we next sought to identify the responsible receptor. We focused on the scavenger receptors (SRs) as candidates; because, like TLRs, they bind pathogen-associated molecules and have been shown to regulate macrophage and dendritic cell responses to TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide and CpG (22Józefowski S. Sulahian T.H. Arredouani M. Kobzik L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Gordon S. Cell. 2002; 111: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). To determine if SRs were capable of mediating CpG-induced calcium signals in B cells, we first evaluated the effect of several broadly specific SR antagonists (poly-inosine, fucoidan, and low density lipoprotein). Notably each of the SR antagonists tested blocked CpG-induced calcium responses in primary B cells (Fig. 4A), implicating SRs in this response to CpG. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of SR expression identified MARCO, CD36, SR-B1, and its splice variant SR-B2 in primary mouse B cells (Fig. 4B). Given that B cells express multiple SR and the broad specificity of antagonists tested, we next evaluated the effect of individual anti-SR antibodies on CpG-induced calcium signaling. Although neither anti-MARCO nor -CD36 antibodies affected CpG-induced calcium signals (supplemental Fig. S2), the anti-SR-B1/2 antibody was clearly inhibitory (Fig. 4C). To directly verify the requirement for SR-B1 in CpG-induced calcium signaling, we examined the response of SR-B1-deficient B cells (24Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) to this ligand. In the absence of SR-B1 expression, CpG failed to mobilize calcium (Fig. 4D) or elicit a cation current (Fig. 4E) in primary B cells. This failure of CpG-induced signaling does not reflect a general calcium defect; however, because BCR-induced calcium elevations and CRAC channel activation were unaffected by SR-B1 deficiency (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that SR-B1 mediates CpG-induced calcium mobilization in B lymphocytes. Although little is known about the role of SRs in B cells, it is noteworthy that Toll-like receptors and scavenger receptors expressed by B cells bind a similar range of cellular and pathogen-associated molecules (23Gordon S. Cell. 2002; 111: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 25Gough P.J. Gordon S.

Gordon S. Immunobiology. 2004; 209: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, TLR2 co-engagement with the scavenger receptor CD36 positively regulates B cell activation (13Won W.J. Bachmann M.F. Kearney J.F. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given our findings that CpG activates the CD36-related class B family member SR-B1, we asked whether SR-B1 serves a similar co-stimulatory role in TLR9-mediated activation of B cells. We found that neither SR-B1 nor TRPC3 activation was required for NFκB activation (IκBα degradation and p65 activation) or B cell proliferation (supplemental Fig. S3). However, in addition to calcium mobilization we found that VLA-4 integrin activation (VCAM-1 adhesion) by CpG was independent of TLR9 (Fig. 5A) and fully dependent upon SR-B1 expression (Fig. 5B). CpG did not increase B cell adhesion to the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 (supplemental"
https://openalex.org/W2007809048,"Recently, mutations in the gene of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) were discovered in patients suffering from chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and leukemia. As suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are potent feedback inhibitors of Jak-mediated signaling, we investigated their role in signal transduction through constitutively active Jak2 mutants. We selected two mutants, Jak2-V617F and Jak2-K539L, found in patients with MPDs and Jak2-T875N identified in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We found SOCS family members to be induced through Jak2-V617F in human leukemia cell lines expressing the mutant allele and in stable HEK transfectants inducibly expressing constitutively active Jak2 mutants. SOCS proteins were recruited to the membrane and bound to the constitutively active Jaks. In contrast to wild-type Jak2, the mutant proteins were constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded through the proteasome. Taken together, we show a SOCS-mediated downregulation of the constitutively active, disease-associated mutant Jak2 proteins. Furthermore, a threshold level of mutant Jak expression has to be overcome to allow full cytokine-independent constitutive activation of signaling proteins, which may explain progression to homozygocity in MPDs as well as gene amplification in severe phenotypes and leukemia."

The reactivity of a substituted cysteine to thiolate-directed probes provides an indication of aqueous accessibility because the reactive thiolate species is preferentially formed in an aqueous environment. The aqueous accessibility of the five TMHs in subunit a of E. coli F0 has been probed using Ag+ and NEM (19.Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y.

The results suggest the presence of an aqueous accessible channel in subunit a in the center of TMHs 2–5 extending from the periplasm to the center of the membrane. Protons entering through this periplasmic access channel are postulated to bind to the essential Asp-61 residues of the c-ring and exit to the cytoplasm by a still uncertain pathway at the peripheral face of aTMH4 with protonation/deprotonation of Asp-61 driving c-ring rotation.During H+-driven ATP synthesis, two models for the pathway by which H+ or Na+ exit to the cytoplasm have been proposed. The first model proposes that the ions bound at Asp-61 exit to the cytoplasm via a half-channel composed at least partially by residues in TMH4 of subunit a (25.Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Chemical modification studies of Cys-substituted subunit a of E. coli revealed an aqueous accessible surface of TMH4 that includes the essential Arg-210 residue, which extended from the center of the membrane to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the ion exit channel may lie at the a-c interface (19.Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25.Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively studies of the c-ring from the I. tartaricus enzyme indicate that Na+ can access Glu-65 in the absence of other F0 subunits, suggesting an intrinsic channel in subunit c (28.von Ballmoos C. Meier T. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5581-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29.Meier T. Matthey U. von Ballmoos C. Vonck J. Krug von Nidda T. Kühlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, no such channel was apparent in the crystal structure of the c11-ring (8.Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In a previous study (30.Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12365-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we probed the thiolate reactivity of Cys substitutions in the cytoplasmic half of TMH2 in subunit c. These experiments revealed extensive reactivity to sulfhydryl-directed reagents on the peripheral face of cTMH2, supporting the presence of the cytoplasmic exit channel at the a-c interface. In this study, we extended the survey of aqueous accessibility in transmembrane regions by probing thiolate reactivity of Cys substitutions in TMH1 and in the periplasmic half of TMH2. The reactivity of Cys substituted into these regions proved to be more limited. Only a small region of TMH1, lying directly behind Asp-61, was reactive with Ag+. In addition to Ag+, we used Cd2+ as a complementary, membrane-impermeant probe for aqueous accessibility. The survey of Cd2+ sensitivity confirmed that aqueous accessibility from the cytoplasm is much greater for residues packing at the periphery of the c-ring. The experiments reported here distinguish the aqueous accessible and inaccessible regions of the c-ring and strengthen evidence that the cytoplasmic H+ exit channel is situated at the a-c interface.DiscussionIn this study we extended a survey of aqueous accessibility in the transmembrane regions of subunit c by probing Cys substitutions for inhibition by the thiolate-reactive probes Ag+, Cd2+, NEM, and a series of MTS reagents. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic half of TMH2 and region around Asp-61 show greatest aqueous accessibility as judged by the inhibition assay. Accessibility on the periplasmic half of TMH2 diminished as the Cys substitutions were moved from the center of the membrane to the periplasmic surface. These results support a model in which the outer helices of the c-ring form at least part of the cytoplasmic proton exit channel.Of the 13 functional Cys substitutions in TMH1 that were probed with Ag+, inhibition was restricted to a pocket of four residues lying directly behind Asp-61 (Fig. 7A). Replacement of residue 20, 24, or 25 with Cys conferred sensitivity to inhibition by Ag+ but not by any of the other reagents we tested. The I28C replacement conferred sensitivity to Cd2+ as well as Ag+, whereas the other Ag+-sensitive residues in TMH1 were unaffected by Cd2+. Ag+ could be accessing more sites because of its lower charge density or increased membrane permeability. Aqueous accessibility of these four residues is not unexpected because of their proximity to Asp-61. These residues seem to interact in a functional way as they pack in the aqueous pocket surrounding Asp-61. The essential Asp residue can be moved to position 24 with retention of function, suggesting that the side chains at positions 24 and 61 occupy a similar location (38.Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ala-20 can be replaced with Pro to compensate for a non-functional P64A substitution in TMH2 with the wild type Pro-64 lying one helical turn toward the periplasm from Asp-61 (39.Dmitriev O.Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27449-27454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations of Ile-28 prevent reaction of Asp-61 with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide suggesting that Ile-28 contributes to the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding pocket around Asp-61 (40.Hoppe J. Schairer H.U. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41.Fillingame R.H. Oldenburg M. Fraga D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20934-20939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an I28E substitution can compensate for the replacement of Asp-61 with Gly (42.Jones P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the I. tartaricus subunit c, Ile-28 is replaced at an equivalent position by Gln-32, the side chain of which directly chelates with bound Na+ (8.Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Our previous study showed that Ag+ reactivity with Cys substitutions in TMH2 is widespread, including the face of TMH2 that is thought to be less accessible because of its interaction with TMH1. We suggested that this extensive reactivity might indicate that this helix is dynamic at least over the time course of the experiment. We would not expect the same mobility in TMH1 because the inner helices of the c-ring are thought to pack tightly against neighboring subunits. The I30C substitutions at the center of the ring can be cross-linked to each other without loss of function, arguing against any functional necessity for mobility of this helix (6.Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover the lack of extensive reactivity of Cys substitutions outside the pocket surrounding Asp-61 would suggest that TMH1 does not contribute significantly to an aqueous pathway to the cytoplasmic surface of the c-ring.Ag+ has been used as a probe of the aqueous accessibility of Cys substitutions in a Shaker K+ channel (24.Lü Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The Ag+-sensitive residues were more recently mapped onto an x-ray structure of the Kv1.2 K+ channel (43.Long S.B. Tao X. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2007; 450: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). 3C. Miller, personal communication. With the exception of three bulky residues (Trp-362, Trp-363, and Leu-371) that were partially buried and not fully solvent-accessible, the Ag+-sensitive residues at eight other positions were solvent-exposed, and the Ag+-insensitive positions were buried within the protein. These results support the use of Ag+ as a probe for aqueous accessible regions within transmembrane proteins and reinforce the argument that the Ag+-sensitive substitutions in the transmembrane regions of subunit c are likely to lie in aqueous accessible positions.To confirm and refine the pattern of aqueous accessibility in the c-ring, we surveyed Cys reactivity in transmembrane regions of subunit c using Cd2+. Cd2+ has an ionic radius close to that of Ag+ and H3O+ but proved to be more selective. 4Ionic radii are: Ag+, 1.15 Å; Cd2+, 0.95 Å; and H3O+, 1.41 Å. This selectivity may be in part due to the decreased association of Cd2+ with the membrane versus that previously seen with Ag+. That is, under the conditions used here, most of the Cd2+ ions remain in aqueous solution and do not partition into the membrane, whereas most of the Ag+ ions associate with the membrane under equivalent conditions (25.Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The presence of chloride in the ATP-driven H+ pumping assay may have also contributed to the selectivity of Cd2+. Cd2+ is known to form soluble complexes with chloride (37.Aylett B.J. Webb M. The Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology of Cadmium. Elsevier, Amsterdam1979: 1-92Google Scholar) that would effectively increase the size of the ion and prevent access to narrower cavities. Free Cd2+ may be able to penetrate farther into the membrane explaining the increased sensitivity of the A24C, A62C, P64C, and M65C substitutions at the border of the Cd2+-sensitive pocket when assayed in chloride-free buffer. Some of the chloride complexes might also be less inhibitory because of charge neutralization.The pattern of cadmium sensitivity in subunit c confirms that the cytoplasmic half of TMH2 is the most accessible membrane-embedded region of the subunit (Fig. 7B). The Cd2+ inhibition pattern is similar to that of MTSEA reported previously (30.Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12365-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) where MTSEA-sensitive residues formed a pocket around Asp-61. This pocket includes residues 57, 58, 59, 62, 63, 64, and 65. The Cd2+ inhibition pattern is more restricted and includes primarily residues 57, 58, and 59 on the cytoplasmic side of Asp-61.We show here that the membrane-impermeant probe MTSET has access from the cytoplasm to G58C in the region of subunit c that is sensitive to Cd2+ and MTSEA. MTSET modified one in 10 subunits of the c-ring, a stoichiometry consistent with that of NEM modification measured previously (30.Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12365-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MTSET cannot access this membrane-embedded region of subunit c in the absence of subunit a. The simplest explanation for the limited stoichiometry of modification and the requirement of subunit a for modification is that subunit a mediates aqueous access from the cytoplasm to the Cd2+- and MTSEA-sensitive face of cTMH2. This face of cTMH2 most likely packs against the Ag+-sensitive residues on the cytoplasmic side of TMH4 of subunit a (Fig. 8). This peripheral surface of aTMH4 was shown to cross-link to the peripheral surface of the c-ring (20.Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Further the three NEM-sensitive residues in these subunits (cG58C, aS206C, and aN214C) would pack at this interface (25.Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

The reactivity pattern for all reagents shows that cTMH2 is more accessible than cTMH1 and provides further evidence for a proton exit pathway to the cytoplasm that is likely formed at the interface of TMH2 in subunit c and the peripheral surface of TMH4 in subunit a.FIGURE 8Reagent accessibility at the interface of subunits a and c.

Obtaining the structure of the sperm-specific isoform to allow rational inhibitor design has therefore been a goal for a number of years but has proved intractable because of the insoluble nature of both native and recombinant protein. We have obtained soluble recombinant sperm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a heterotetramer with the Escherichia coli glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a ratio of 1:3 and have solved the structure of the heterotetramer which we believe represents a novel strategy for structure determination of an insoluble protein. A structure was also obtained where glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate binds in the P(s) pocket in the active site of the sperm enzyme subunit in the presence of NAD. Modeling and comparison of the structures of human somatic and sperm-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase revealed few differences at the active site and hence rebut the long presumed structural specificity of 3-chlorolactaldehyde for the sperm isoform. The contraceptive activity of alpha-chlorohydrin and its apparent specificity for the sperm isoform in vivo are likely to be due to differences in metabolism to 3-chlorolactaldehyde in spermatozoa and somatic cells. However, further detailed analysis of the sperm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structure revealed sites in the enzyme that do show significant difference compared with published somatic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structures that could be exploited by structure-based drug design to identify leads for novel male contraceptives."
https://openalex.org/W1996975232,"We have previously reported that fish pathogens causing vibriosis specifically adhere to GM4 on the epithelial cells of fish intestinal tracts (Chisada, S., Horibata, Y., Hama, Y., Inagaki, M., Furuya, N., Okino, N., and Ito, M. (2005) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 333, 367-373). To identify the gene encoding the enzyme for GM4 synthesis in the fish intestinal tract, a phylogenetic tree of vertebrate ST3GalVs, including Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes, was generated in which two putative subfamilies of fish ST3GalVs were found. Two putative ST3GalVs of zebrafish (zST3GalV-1 and -2), each belonging to different subfamilies, were cloned from the zebrafish cDNA library. Interestingly, zST3GalV-1 synthesized GM3 (NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4Glcbeta1-1'Cer) but not GM4, whereas zSTGalV-2 synthesized both gangliosides in vitro when expressed in CHO-K1 and RPMI1846 cells. Flow cytometric analysis using anti-GM4 antibody revealed that the transformation of RPMI1846 cells with zST3GalV-2 but not zST3GalV-1 cDNA increased the cell-surface expression of GM4. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed that the zST3GalV-2 transcript was strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas zST3GalV-1 was expressed in the brain and esophagus but not gastrointestinal tract in 3-day post-fertilization embryos. It has long been a matter of controversy which enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of GM4 in mammals. We found that three isoforms of mouse ST3GalV (mST3GalV) having different N-terminal sequences can synthesize GM4 as well as GM3 when expressed in RPMI1846 and CHO-K1 cells. Furthermore, mST3GalV knock-out mice were found to lack GM4 synthase activity and GM4 in contrast to wild-type mice. These results clearly indicate that zST3GalV-2 and mST3GalV are the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of GM4 in zebrafish and mice, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2072133503,"Various studies have detailed the role of E2F proteins in both transcription activation and repression. Further study has shown that distinct promoter elements, but comprising the same E2F-recognition motif, confer positive or negative E2F control and that this reflects binding of either activator or repressor E2F proteins, respectively. We now show that the specificity of binding of an activator or repressor E2F protein is determined by adjacent sequences that bind a cooperating transcription factor. We propose that the functional E2F element is a module comprising not only the E2F-binding site but also the adjacent site for the cooperating transcription factor."

We have determined the fine structure of this cell-wall polymer. The muropeptides resulting from the digestion of peptidoglycan by mutanolysin were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis, dinitrophenylation, enzymatic determination of the configuration of the chiral amino acids, and mass spectrometry. The high-performance liquid chromatography profile contained four main peaks, two monomers, and two dimers, plus a few minor peaks corresponding to anhydro forms.

Peptidoglycan (or murein) is a giant macromolecule whose main function is the protection of the cytoplasmic membrane against the internal osmotic pressure. It is composed of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidA2pmdiaminopimelic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightPBPpenicillin-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidA2pmdiaminopimelic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightPBPpenicillin-binding protein. cross-linked by short peptides (1Rogers H.J. Perkins H.R. Ward J.B. Microbial Cell Walls and Membranes. Chapman and Hall, London1980: 190-214Crossref Google Scholar). The composition of the peptide stem in nascent peptidoglycan is l-Ala1-γ-d-Glu2-X3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5, where X is most often meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm) or l-lysine in Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, respectively (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). In the mature macromolecule, the last d-Ala residue is removed. Cross-linking of the glycan chains generally occurs between the carboxyl group of d-Ala at position 4 of a donor peptide stem and the side-chain amino group of the diamino acid at position 3 of an acceptor peptide stem (4→3 cross-links). Cross-linking is either direct or through a short peptide bridge such as pentaglycine in Staphylococcus aureus (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The enzymes for the formation of the 4→3 cross-links are active-site serine dd- transpeptidases that belong to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) family and are the essential targets of β-lactam antibiotics in pathogenic bacteria (4Sauvage E. Kerff F. Terrak M. Ayala J.A. Charlier P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 234-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Catalysis involves the cleavage of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 bond of a donor peptide stem and the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl of d-Ala4 and the side chain amine at the third position of an acceptor stem. Transpeptidases of the ld specificity are active-site cysteine enzymes that were shown to act as surrogates of the PBPs in mutants of Enterococcus faecium resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (5Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol.

This alternate mode of cross-linking is usually marginal, although it has recently been shown to predominate in non-replicative “dormant” forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6Lavollay M. Arthur M.

A morphological characteristic is the presence of an outer sheath-like envelope called “toga.” Although the organism has received considerable attention for its biotechnological potential, studies about its peptidoglycan are scarce (8Offant J.

In their initial work, Huber et al. (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar) showed that the composition of its peptidoglycan was unusual for a Gram-negative species, because it contained both isomers of lysine and no A2pm. Recently, we purified and studied the properties of T. maritima MurE (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); this enzyme is responsible for the addition of the amino acid residue at position 3 of the peptide stem (13van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 14Barreteau H. Kovač A. Boniface A. Sova M. Gobec S. Blanot D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 168-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that T. maritima MurE added in vitro l- and d-Lys to UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu. Although l-Lys was added in the usual way, yielding the conventional nucleotide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys containing a d-Glu(γ→α)l-Lys amide bond, the d-isomer was added in an “upside-down” manner, yielding the novel nucleotide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu(γ→ϵ)d-Lys. We also showed that the d-Lys-containing nucleotide was not a substrate for T. maritima MurF, the subsequent enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, whereas this ligase catalyzed the addition of dipeptide d-Ala-d-Ala to the l-Lys-containing tripeptide, yielding the conventional UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).However, both the l-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and d-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide were used as substrates by T. maritima MraY with comparable efficiencies in vitro (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This observation implies that the unusual d-Lys-containing peptide stems are likely to be translocated to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and to participate in peptidoglycan polymerization. Therefore, we have determined here the fine structure of T. maritima peptidoglycan and we have shown that l-Lys- and d-Lys-containing peptide stems are both present in the polymer, the latter being involved in the formation of two novel types of peptidoglycan cross-link.DISCUSSIONIn Gram-negative organisms, the amino acid at position 3 of the peptide stem is generally meso-A2pm with a few exceptions, such as l-ornithine in spirochetes (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Therefore, the occurrence of lysine at this position in the peptidoglycan of T. maritima was surprising. Even more surprising was the co-existence of both enantiomers of lysine, the d-isomer representing as much as 40% of the overall peptidoglycan content of this residue. d-Lys has only been previously found in the peptidoglycan of Butyribacterium rettgeri where it participates in the peptide cross-bridge (21Guinand M. Ghuysen J.M. Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, the current analysis provides the first direct determination of the position of d-Lys in the peptide stems of peptidoglycan.Two different amino acids at position 3 of stem peptides have been detected in Bifidobacterium globosum (l-Lys and l-Orn) (22Hammes W.P. Neukam R. Kandler O. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 115: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and Myxococcus xanthus (meso-A2pm and LL-A2pm) (23Bui N.K. Gray J. Schwarz H. Schumann P. Blanot D. Vollmer W. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This results from the unusually low specificity of the MurE ligase of these species (14Barreteau H. Kovač A. Boniface A. Sova M. Gobec S. Blanot D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 168-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In T. maritima, MurE catalyzes in vitro two modes of acylation of the lysine enantiomers: l-Lys is conventionally acylated on its α-amino function, whereas d-Lys is acylated on its ϵ-amino function. This leads to the unusual γ→ϵ arrangement of the d-Glu2-d-Lys3 amide bond. We show here that these two modes of acylation operate in vivo, leading to formation of monomers I and II in similar amounts. d-Lys was only detected in the tripeptide monomer (I), reflecting the impossibility for the MurF ligase to add d-Ala-d-Ala to the d-Lys-containing nucleotide precursor (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Strikingly, structural analysis of T. maritima peptidoglycan revealed that d-Lys participated in two novel types of cross-linking. The first cross-link, present in dimer IV, originates from a transpeptidation reaction involving a conventional l-Lys-containing pentapeptide donor and a d-Lys-containing tripeptide acceptor. In the resulting 4→3 cross-link, the α- amino group of d-Lys plays the role of the side-chain amino groups of meso-A2pm found in most Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, dimer IV is likely to be cross-linked by classic dd- transpeptidases belonging to the PBP family. Indeed, this class of active-site serine enzymes functions with conserved donors ending in d-Ala-d-Ala, or rarely in d-Ala-d-Ser and d-Ala-d-lactate, whereas extensive variation is tolerated in the residue that carries the reacting amino group in the acceptor (17Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Impaired growth of T. maritima in the presence of penicillin (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar) is in agreement with this notion. None of the dimers detected in the peptidoglycan of T. maritima contained 4→3 cross-links involving l-Lys at position 3 in the acceptor stem. This observation suggests that the dd-transpeptidases of this species are specific of amino groups that are linked to a carbon bearing also a carboxyl group and having the d configuration. The dd-transpeptidases of Escherichia coli display the same specificity since incorporation of l-Lys instead of meso-A2pm into peptidoglycan results in cell lysis (24Mengin-Lecreulx D. Falla T. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Adams D.J. Chopra I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5909-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, d-Lys appears to act as a surrogate of meso-A2pm by providing the essential amino group and its accompanying carboxyl group with the d configuration of the asymmetric carbon. One major consequence of this model is that the donor and the acceptor substrates of the transpeptidation reaction have distinct structures, an l-Lys-containing pentapeptide ending in d-Ala-d-Ala and a d-Lys-containing tripeptide. The control of the supply of the two types of peptide stems to the dd-transpeptidases is therefore likely to be critical for peptidoglycan polymerization and cell wall morphology.The second cross-link, present in dimer III, originates from the l-Ala1-d-Glu2 bond of a peptide stem as the acyl donor and the d-Lys-containing tripeptide as the acceptor, generating a 1→3 cross-link. To date, four modes of peptidoglycan cross-linking have been observed in the bacterial world (3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The most frequent 4→3 cross-links produced by active-site serine PBPs are present in T. maritima as discussed above. In Micrococcus luteus, 4→1 cross-links involve “head-to-tail” transpeptidation of the peptide stem (25Ghuysen J.M. Bricas E. Lache M. Leyh-Bouille M. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this case, the amino group of l-Ala at position 1 of the acceptor stem is thought to be generated by cleavage of the MurNAc-l-Ala1 amide bond. In certain coryneform bacteria, 4→2 cross-links have been found (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This particular mode of cross-linking requires a diamino acid between d-Ala at position 4 and d-Glu at position 2. The latter modes of cross-linking (4→1 and 4→2) should involve as yet uncharacterized dd-transpeptidases that cleave the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 peptide bond of the donor and use different amino groups in the acceptor. In contrast, the remaining cross-links of the 3→3 mode are produced by active-site cysteine ld-transpeptidases that cleave the l-Lys3-d-Ala4 peptide bond of the donor in β-lactam-resistant E. faecium and non-replicative forms of M. tuberculosis (see the introduction) (5Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35801-35807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Lavollay M. Arthur M. Fourgeaud M. Dubost L. Marie A. Veziris N. Blanot D. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The 1→3 cross-link found in the present work is a novel mode of cross-linking. The nature of the enzyme catalyzing its formation is unknown. In Bacillus subtilis, an enzyme (LytH) hydrolyzes the l-Ala1-d-Glu2 bond of the polymer during endospore cortex formation (26Horsburgh G.J. Atrih A. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3813-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A gene homologous to lytH is present in the T. maritima genome (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). By analogy with active-site serine enzymes belonging to the PBP family, that comprise both hydrolases (dd-carboxypeptidases) and biosynthetic enzymes (dd-transpeptidases), the LytH homologue of T. maritima could generate the 1→3 cross-links by functioning as a transpeptidase rather than a hydrolase. The absence of disaccharide-l-Ala in the T. maritima peptidoglycan, contrary to that of B. subtilis endospores (27Atrih A. Zöllner P. Allmaier G. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6173-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggests an exclusive biosynthetic role for the putative transpeptidase.The structural analysis of T. maritima peptidoglycan reveals additional features. The existence of anhydro-muropeptides V–IX shows that the glycan strands do not terminate with a reducing MurNAc residue but with 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc, as is the case in many bacteria (28Vollmer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The absence of detectable l-Lys-containing pentapeptide or tripeptide should also be noted. This means that (i) the dd-carboxypeptidases have removed most (if not all) of the d-Ala residues at position 5 remaining after transpeptidation, and (ii) no ld-carboxypeptidase or ld-endopeptidase activity is present, or at least active, during the normal growth of T. maritima.T. maritima peptidoglycan appears to be loosely cross-linked as indicated by the cross-linking index estimated here (10%), a value that is low when compared with that of E. coli (25%) (16Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 29Glauner B. Höltje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or other Gram-negative bacteria (26–60%) (30Quintela J.C. Caparrós M. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 95-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the average chain length found (30 disaccharide units) is comparable to that of E. coli (26–38 disaccharide units) (16Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 29Glauner B. Höltje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other Gram-negative species, this parameter varies widely, from 10 to 53 disaccharide units (30Quintela J.C. Caparrós M. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 95-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the glycan strands in T. maritima are fairly long.Hyperthermophiles such as thermotogales are adapted to hot environments by their physiological and nutritional requirements (31Huber R. Stetter K.O. Balows A. Trüper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes: A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria: Ecophysiology, Isolation, Identification, Applications, 2nd ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 3809-3815Google Scholar). As a consequence, cell components such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, which are usually heat-sensitive, have to be stable at temperatures as high as 70–90° (32Stetter K.O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For instance, membrane lipids of T. maritima contain a glycerol ether lipid which, in contrast to ester lipids found in mesophiles, may increase the stability of membranes against hydrolysis at high temperature (33De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Huber R. Lanzotti V. Nicolaus B. Stetter K.O. Trincone A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988; : 1300-1301Crossref Google Scholar). Whether the unusual 1→3 cross-links discovered in this study contribute to the thermostability of the cell wall of T. maritima is unknown. Such a contribution might relate to the constraint imposed by 1→3 cross-links to the distance separating adjacent glycan chains: indeed, two cross-linked disaccharide subunits are connected by 4 amino acid residues in this case, instead of 7 and 12 in E. coli and S. aureus peptidoglycans, respectively. However, further experiments will be necessary to ascertain that this structural feature is linked to the thermophilic character of T. maritima.In conclusion, we have investigated here the composition and fine structure of T. maritima peptidoglycan. Analyses have revealed for the first time the key role of d-Lys in peptidoglycan synthesis, both as a surrogate of meso-A2pm at the third position of peptide stems, and in the formation of two novel types of cross-link, namely l-Ala1(α→α)d-Lys3 and d-Ala4(α→α)d-Lys3. Peptidoglycan (or murein) is a giant macromolecule whose main function is the protection of the cytoplasmic membrane against the internal osmotic pressure. It is composed of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidA2pmdiaminopimelic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightPBPpenicillin-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidA2pmdiaminopimelic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightPBPpenicillin-binding protein. cross-linked by short peptides (1Rogers H.J. Perkins H.R. Ward J.B. Microbial Cell Walls and Membranes. Chapman and Hall, London1980: 190-214Crossref Google Scholar). The composition of the peptide stem in nascent peptidoglycan is l-Ala1-γ-d-Glu2-X3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5, where X is most often meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm) or l-lysine in Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, respectively (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). In the mature macromolecule, the last d-Ala residue is removed. Cross-linking of the glycan chains generally occurs between the carboxyl group of d-Ala at position 4 of a donor peptide stem and the side-chain amino group of the diamino acid at position 3 of an acceptor peptide stem (4→3 cross-links). Cross-linking is either direct or through a short peptide bridge such as pentaglycine in Staphylococcus aureus (2Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The enzymes for the formation of the 4→3 cross-links are active-site serine dd- transpeptidases that belong to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) family and are the essential targets of β-lactam antibiotics in pathogenic bacteria (4Sauvage E. Kerff F. Terrak M. Ayala J.A. Charlier P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 234-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Catalysis involves the cleavage of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 bond of a donor peptide stem and the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl of d-Ala4 and the side chain amine at the third position of an acceptor stem. Transpeptidases of the ld specificity are active-site cysteine enzymes that were shown to act as surrogates of the PBPs in mutants of Enterococcus faecium resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (5Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol.

This alternate mode of cross-linking is usually marginal, although it has recently been shown to predominate in non-replicative “dormant” forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6Lavollay M. Arthur M.

A morphological characteristic is the presence of an outer sheath-like envelope called “toga.” Although the organism has received considerable attention for its biotechnological potential, studies about its peptidoglycan are scarce (8Offant J.

In their initial work, Huber et al. (7Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar) showed that the composition of its peptidoglycan was unusual for a Gram-negative species, because it contained both isomers of lysine and no A2pm. Recently, we purified and studied the properties of T. maritima MurE (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); this enzyme is responsible for the addition of the amino acid residue at position 3 of the peptide stem (13van Heijenoort J.

Rev. 2008; 32: 168-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that T. maritima MurE added in vitro l- and d-Lys to UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu. Although l-Lys was added in the usual way, yielding the conventional nucleotide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys containing a d-Glu(γ→α)l-Lys amide bond, the d-isomer was added in an “upside-down” manner, yielding the novel nucleotide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu(γ→ϵ)d-Lys. We also showed that the d-Lys-containing nucleotide was not a substrate for T. maritima MurF, the subsequent enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, whereas this ligase catalyzed the addition of dipeptide d-Ala-d-Ala to the l-Lys-containing tripeptide, yielding the conventional UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (12Boniface A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15680-15686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, both the l-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and d-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide were used as substrates by T. maritima MraY with comparable efficiencies in vitro (12Boniface A.

HO-1(-/-) mice exposed to chronic hypoxia develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with exaggerated right ventricular (RV) injury consisting of dilation, fibrosis, and mural thrombi. Our objective was to identify the HO-1 product(s) mediating RV protection from hypoxic injury in HO-1(-/-) mice.HO-1(-/-) mice were exposed to seven weeks of hypoxia and treated with inhaled CO or biliverdin injections. CO reduced right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and prevented hypoxic pulmonary arteriolar remodeling in both HO-1(-/-) and control mice. Biliverdin had no significant effect on arteriolar remodeling or RVSP in either genotype. Despite this, biliverdin prevented RV failure in the hypoxic HO-1(-/-) mice (0/14 manifested RV wall fibrosis or thrombus), while CO-treated HO-1(-/-) mice developed RV insults similar to untreated controls. In vitro, CO inhibited hypoxic VSMC proliferation and migration but did not prevent cardiomyocyte death from anoxia-reoxygenation (A-R). In contrast, bilirubin limited A-R-induced cardiomyocyte death but did not inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration.CO and bilirubin have distinct protective actions in the heart and pulmonary vasculature during chronic hypoxia. Moreover, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance may not prevent RV injury in hypoxia-induced PAH; supporting RV adaptation to hypoxia and preventing RV failure must be a therapeutic goal."

We tested the effects of NO-aspirin 2 on Phase I and Phase II carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes. In HepG2 human hepatoma cells and in LS180 colonic adenocarcinoma cells, NO-aspirin 2 inhibited 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity and CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA expression. These effects were further characterized as being mediated through transcriptional regulation: NO-aspirin 2 inhibited binding of ligand (TCDD)-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor to the CYP1A1 enhancer sequence; additionally, NO-aspirin 2 suppressed carcinogen-induced expression of CYP1A heterogeneous nuclear RNA. The fate of carcinogen metabolites depends not only on activation by CYP enzymes but also detoxification by Phase II enzymes. Both HepG2 and LS180 cells treated with NO-aspirin 2 showed an increase in glutathione S-transferase-P1 (GST-P1), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) expression. Compared with two other NO-releasing compounds, diethylenetriamine-NO and the organic nitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, the inhibitory effects of NO-aspirin 2 on TCDD-induced CYP activity and mRNA expression were considerably more potent. Furthermore, aspirin alone had no inhibitory effect on TCDD-induced CYP activity, nor did aspirin up-regulate GCL, GST-P1, or NQO1 expression. Consequent to the effects on carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, NO-aspirin 2 inhibited [3H]benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct formation and DNA damage elicited by TCDD or benzo[a]pyrene. Our results demonstrate that NO-aspirin 2 may be an effective chemopreventive agent by favorably affecting the inhibitory and enhancing effects of Phase I and Phase II carcinogen metabolism, thereby protecting DNA from carcinogenic insult.

Tumor Res. 2003; 37: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The potential for NSAIDs to serve as chemoprotective agents has been particularly evident for colorectal cancer, as demonstrated by epidemiological and clinical studies, as well experimental animal models. Unfortunately, even at low doses, long term NSAID usage is associated with significant gastrointestinal and renal side-effects, some of which are potentially life-threatening (3Soll A. Am. J. Med. 1998; 105: 10S-16SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Segasothy M. Samad S.A. Zulfigar A. Bennett W.M. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1994; 24: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In fact, in 1998, the number of deaths in the United States from NSAID complications paralleled the number of deaths from AIDS (5Bjorkman D.J. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107 (discussion 8S–10S): 3S-8SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Singh G. Triadafilopoulos G. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1999; 56: 18-24PubMed Google Scholar). This has prompted the emergence of novel strategies in efforts to maintain the desired pharmacological effects of NSAIDs, while diminishing the deleterious properties. One such strategy led to the development of coxibs, selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, which, although they do in fact reduce gastrointestinal complications, are also associated with increased cardiovascular side-effects (7Jüni P.

NO-NSAIDs consist of a NO-releasing moiety covalently bound to a spacer (via ester linkage), which in turn is bound to the parent NSAID (Fig. 1). NO is recognized as a key modulator in a wide array of physiological pathways (11Cirino G. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Wallace J.L. Del Soldato P. Baydoun A.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Of particular importance with regard to chemopreventive therapy are its effects on the gastrointestinal tract. The release of NO might compensate for NSAID-induced reductions in prostaglandin levels through the capacity of NO to increase mucosal blood circulation (12Wallace J.L. Miller M.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 512-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and mucous release (13Brown J.F. Keates A.C. Hanson P.J. Whittle B.J. Am. J.

Notably, NO-NSAIDs are associated with a significant reduction in renal toxicity as well (16Fujihara C.K. Malheiros D.M. Donato J.L. Poli A. De Nucci G. Zatz R. Am. J.

Med. 2004; 10: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Studies indicate that not only are both the NSAID and the NO moieties responsible for the physiological manifestations of the drugs (22Wallace J.L. Ignarro L.J. Fiorucci S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but, particularly in the case with NO-aspirin, the intact drug works more effectively than administration of aspirin together with an organic nitrate (22Wallace J.L. Ignarro L.J. Fiorucci S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Kashfi K. Borgo S. Williams J.L. Chen J. Gao J. Glekas A. Benedini F. Del Soldato P.

Although some progress has been made in clarifying the mechanisms by which NO-aspirin affords enhanced anticancer properties, relatively little is understood concerning its superior potency and its functional role as a chemopreventive agent. Recently, our laboratory has shown that the aspirin derivative salicylamide suppresses carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes (25MacDonald C.J. Ciolino H.P. Yeh G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and work by others has called attention to roles for aspirin and other NSAIDs in inhibiting chemically induced carcinogenesis (26Rao C.V. Reddy B.S. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that NO-aspirin 2 (nitric oxide-2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester; NCX-4040) may act as a chemopreventive agent by enhancing cellular detoxification mechanisms against environmental carcinogens. Among the compounds we tested in this report, NO-aspirin 2 was the most potent modulator of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes; therefore, we further studied its effects on the inhibition of DNA strand breakage and carcinogen-DNA adduct formation. We found that the inhibition of Phase I enzymes together with induction of Phase II enzymes by NO-aspirin 2 resulted in a significant suppression of DNA damage caused by environmental carcinogens. HepG2 human hepatoma cells and human colon epithelial cancer LS180 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). NO-aspirin 2; NCX-4040) was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). RPMI 1640, Eagle舗s minimum essential medium with Earle舗s balanced salt solution, glutamine, fetal bovine serum, TRIzol, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). TCDD was from the Midwest Research Institute (Kansas City, MO). Human recombinant CYP1A1, -1A2, and -1B1 SupersomesTM were from BD Biosciences Gentest (Woburn, MA). Omniscript kits and PCR purification kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Random primers for cDNA synthesis were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR primers for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, GCL-m, GCL-c, NQO1, GST-P1, and 18S were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Protease inhibitors tablets were from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Anti-AhR rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A/G-Sepharose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). [3H]BP was from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. HepG2 human hepatoma cells were grown with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. LS180 colon epithelial cancer cells were grown with Eagle舗s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine, also in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. For all of the treatment compounds, DMSO was used as the vehicle and did not exceed 0.1%. The ability of NO-aspirin 2 to affect CYP enzyme activity was determined in intact cells by measurement of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Either HepG2 or LS180 cells, in 24-well plates, were treated with or without 1 nm TCDD, for 6 h, in the presence of the increasing concentrations of NO-aspirin 2. At the end of the incubation, the medium was decanted, and the cells were washed once with PBS. Then, medium containing 5 μm ethoxyresorufin was added. Increasing fluorescence as a result of the conversion of ethoxyresorufin to resorufin by CYP enzymes was measured using a CytoFluor multiwell plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with an excitation of 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The reaction was allowed to run for 30 min. To determine the capacity for NO-aspirin 2 to directly inhibit CYP enzymes, recombinant enzymes were used. Recombinant CYP1A1 (0.75 μm), CYP1A2 (2.5 μm), or CYP1B1 (3.5 μm) SupersomesTM were incubated with 0.4 μm ethoxyresorufin and increasing concentrations of NO-aspirin 2 in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS, pH 7.2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 500 μm NADPH. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate, and EROD activity was determined as described above. In 6-well plates, cells were treated with or without 250 pm TCDD and the indicated concentrations of NO-aspirin 2, for 6 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol® according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. CDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using random primers and the Omniscript kit according to manufacturer舗s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing 12.5 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 8.75 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate water, 1.25 μl of primers, and 2.5 μl of CDNA using a Bio-Rad iCycler Real Time Detection System. All primers had a FAMTM reporter dye at the 5′-end and a non-fluorescent quencher at the 3′-end of the probe. Amplification conditions were 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min and ended with 1 cycle at 60 °C for 1 min. All samples to be compared in the same experiments were run in the same plate. Gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA expression. Normalization to 18 S was done by subtracting the CT for 18 S from the CT of each CYP gene: dCTt = CTt(gene) − CTt(18S) (t = time). To calculate the -fold change (FC) in transcript level, the equation, FC = 2−ddCTt, was used. To determine the rate of transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes, levels of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) were measured by real-time PCR as described by Elferink and Reiners (27Elferink C.J. Reiners Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This assay has been well characterized as a valid substitute for nuclear run-on experiments as a measure of transcription rate (28Ryu D.Y. Levi P.E. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. Hodgson E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 443-446PubMed Google Scholar). In 6-well plates, HepG2 cells were treated with 250 pm TCDD and various concentrations of NO-aspirin 2, for 6 h. RNA isolation and CDNA synthesis were performed as described above. Primer sequences were designed using Primer3(MIT) software. Sequences for hnCYP1A1 forward and reverse primers were CTTGGACCTCTTTGGAGCTG and TGACTGTGTCAAACCCTGGA, respectively. Sequences for hnCYP1A2 forward and reverse primers were ACAACCCTGCCAATCTCAAG and CCGTCTTTCTGTCCCCACTA, respectively. Amplification conditions for were 15 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The levels of hnCYP1A1 and hnCYP1A2 were normalized to the level of 18 S rRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a method described by Matthews et al. (29Matthews J. Wihlén B. Thomsen J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5317-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In 75-cm2 flasks, HepG2 cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD and the indicated concentrations of NO-aspirin 2, for 1.5 h. Cells were washed with warm PBS, and protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 125 mm glycine. Cells were then washed with PBS, collected by scraping (in PBS), resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors) and sonicated three times for 30 s each time (Bronsen sonicator; setting 3, 50% duty cycle). The soluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation, and supernatants (200 μl) were diluted with 800 μl of dilution buffer (1.1% Triton-X 100, 1.1 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, 167 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). An aliquot of the diluted sample (20 μl) was put aside for the input fraction. The supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) under gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, 1 μg of anti-AhR antibody or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was added, and the tubes were incubated overnight on a tiltboard at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose/salmon sperm DNA (30 μl of a 50% slurry) was then added, and incubation was continued for 1.5 h. Samples were spun down, and the resulting pellets were washed for 5 min in 1 ml of low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), 1 ml of high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and two times in 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Protein-DNA complexes were eluted by adding 250 μl of fresh elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) for 30 min with rotation, and the cross-links were reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit and eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer provided by the manufacturer. DNA was amplified by real-time PCR with conditions and primers sequences for the XRE present in CYP1A1 enhancer region, as described by Matthews et al. (29Matthews J. Wihlén B. Thomsen J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5317-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The results were normalized to the input samples. Measurement of [3H]BP-DNA adduct formation was performed using the methods of Wen et al. (30Wen X. Walle U.K. Walle T. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells, in 6-well plates, were treated with [3H]BP (10 μCi/well) alone, or in combination with either 1 or 10 μm NO-aspirin 2, for 9 h. Controls were treated with [3H]BP for 10 s. Two wells were pooled for each sample. Following the treatments, DNA was isolated and quantified by UV spectroscopy. [3H]BP-DNA binding was measured by liquid scintillation counting, and relative counts per minute/μg of DNA were compared between groups. Single cell gel electrophoresis assay (31Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9117) Google Scholar) with alkaline electrophoresis was performed according to the CometAssay protocol (TREVIGEN, Gaithersburg, MD), and under protective yellow lighting. In brief, HepG2 cells were treated with either 10 μm BP or 10 nm TCDD alone, or in combination with NO-aspirin 2 (1 or 10 μm), for 24 h. For positive controls, cells were treated with H2O2 for 30 min. Following the treatment, cells were lifted with rubber policemen and counted before being fixed on CometSlides. After SYBR Green I staining, 100 cells were screened per sample using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Maple Grove, MN). The single strand breaks relax the supercoils of the DNA, allowing it to be pulled to one side in the electrophoretic field. Cells were analyzed and quantitated with TriTek CometScore version 1.5 software. The DNA damage was expressed as tail length, where tail length is the distance of DNA migration from the body of the nuclear core, and it is used to evaluate the extent of DNA damage. Undamaged cells appeared as intact nuclei without tails, whereas damaged cells had the appearance of a comet. A longer DNA tail length indicated a higher level of DNA damage. Statistical analyses were performed with STATVIEW Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute, San Francisco, CA). Differences between group mean values were determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher protected least significant difference post-hoc analysis for pairwise comparison of means. The capacity for enzymatic activation of carcinogens was measured by EROD assay, which measures the conversion of ethoxyresorufin to a fluorescent product (resorufin). This conversion specifically measures CYP1A1, -1A2, and -1B1 enzyme activity, although the majority of this activity can be attributed to the 1A1 isoform. These are the principal enzymes involved in the transformation of numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pro-carcinogens to their ultimate carcinogenic forms. Because the primary site for metabolism of environmental carcinogens is the liver, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells. These cells are well established in the study of PAH activation, and are often utilized in pre-clinical evaluation of potential chemopreventive candidate drugs (32o舗Brien P.J. Irwin W. Diaz D. Howard-Cofield E. Krejsa C.M. Slaughter M.R. Gao B. Kaludercic N. Angeline A. Bernardi P. Brain P. Hougham C. Arch.

In Vitro. 2005; 19: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the majority of reports demonstrating chemoprotective effects of NSAIDs focus on colon cancer, and because the colon represents another important site for PAH metabolism, we performed our studies in the human adenocarcinoma LS180 cell line. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 1 nm TCDD for 6 h resulted in an increase in EROD-specific activity from non-detectable levels in controls to 18.5 ± 0.47 pmol/min/well. NO-aspirin 2 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of EROD activity, with an interpolated IC50 of ∼3.25 μm (Fig. 2A). In addition to TCDD, we discovered that NO-aspirin 2 effectively inhibited induction of EROD activity by two other PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, with IC50 values of 7.5 and 2 μm, respectively (data not shown). In TCDD-treated LS180 cells, EROD-specific activity was 7.7 ± 0.27 pmol/min/well. Co-treatment with NO-aspirin 2 resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of EROD activity, with an interpolated IC50 of ∼7.5 μm (Fig. 2A). The standard NO-releasing compound, DETANO, also inhibited TCDD-induced EROD activity, but was much less potent (IC50 ∼ 200 μm, Fig. 2B). In contrast, isosorbide dinitrate, an organic NO-donating compound, had no inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 500 μm (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, aspirin itself up to 500 μm in HepG2 cells had no inhibitory capacity toward CYP enzyme activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast to DETANO, we did not detect NO release by NO-aspirin 2 at 10 μm or 25 μm in HepG2 cells measured by chemiluminescent reaction and electrophoresis method (data not shown). The inhibition of EROD activity by NO-aspirin 2 was also examined using recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, to test for direct CYP enzyme inhibition. NO-aspirin 2 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in EROD activity (Fig. 3) from CYP1A1 (IC50 = 0.8 μm), CYP1A2 (IC50 = 3.0 μm), and CYP1B1 (IC50 = 0.6 μm). In HepG2 cells, 250 pm TCDD treatment induced CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA expression by 20- and 5-fold, respectively, compared with DMSO controls (Fig. 4A). In LS180 cells, TCDD (250 pm) treatment resulted in 41- and 19-fold increases in CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression, respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 4B). NO-aspirin 2 co-treatment suppressed the inductive effect of TCDD on CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression in both cell lines. When NO-aspirin 2 was given alone (i.e. in the absence of an inducing agent), the basal expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in HepG2 cells was suppressed as well (Fig. 4C). Maximum inhibition was observed with 15 μm NO-aspirin 2, reducing expression to 27 and 17% of control levels, respectively. In LS180 cells, maximal inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 occurred with 10 μm NO-aspirin 2, suppressing expression to 35 and 12% of control levels, respectively (Fig. 4D). There was no significant inhibitory effect by NO-aspirin 2 on CYP1B1 (data not shown). The transcription rate of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was measured by quantifying the level of hnRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. Incubation of HepG2 cells with TCDD (250 pm) caused a profound increase in both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 hnRNA, by 35.1- and 8.2-fold above control levels, respectively. The stimulatory effect of TCDD on the transcription rate of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes was diminished significantly by the addition of NO-Aspirin 2 (Fig. 5A). A similar trend was observed in LS180 cells in which TCDD induced CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 hnRNA by 77.0- and 6.3-fold above controls, respectively, and co-treatment with NO-aspirin 2 significantly inhibited this effect (Fig. 5B). The effect of NO-aspirin 2 on the mRNA expression of carcinogen detoxification enzymes was investigated. HepG2 cells treated with NO-aspirin 2 showed increases in (glutamate-cysteine ligase-modulatory subunit) GCL-m, (glutamate-cysteine ligase-catalytic subunit) GCL-c, GST-P1, and NQO1 by up to 6.6-, 5.9-, 4.9-, and 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6A). Similarly, in LS180 cells, 7.6-, 4.3-, 1.4-, and 4.4-fold increases were seen in GCL-m, GCL-c, GST-P1, and NQO1 expression, respectively (Fig. 6B). In the LS180 cells the induction of GST-P1 was not as great as exhibited in HepG2 cells. This difference in -fold increase between the two cell lines is likely due to the fact that the basal level of GST-P in human liver is extremely low (35Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas GST-P is the major form found in most extrahepatic tissues, including the colon (36Singhal S.S. Saxena M. Awasthi S. Ahmad H. Sharma R. Awasthi Y.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar); therefore, a smaller increase in hepatic GST-P expression will result in a greater -fold increase. In HepG2 cells, aspirin at the highest concentration tested (1000 μm) caused a marginal, non-significant, 1.4-fold increase in GST-P1 expression (compared with controls; data not shown). There was no increase in GCL-m or GCL-c expression with aspirin treatment alone (data not shown). Our results with Phase II enzymes are in contrast to those by Patten and DeLong (38Patten E.J. DeLong M.J. Cancer Lett. 1999; 147: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) who showed that aspirin treatment resulted in modest increases in GST and QR activities of 3.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with controls. The differences in their report may be due to use of a different cell line (HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells), longer assay time (24 h), and/or higher concentration tested (3000 μm). Transcriptional regulation of Phase I genes is controlled by the cytosolic AhR. We us"

We have previously used in vitro and in planta activity assays to examine the functional importance of the Fe-binding sites. In this report, we conduct alanine-scanning mutagenesis on the 14 other conserved sites using our in vitro and in planta assay procedures.

Our data are consistent with the proposed role of some of these residues in active site conformation, substrate binding, and/or catalysis. Titration experiments showed that down-regulation of PTOX to ∼3% of wild-type levels did not compromise plant growth, at least under ambient growth conditions.

McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water and branches from the cytochrome pathway at the level of the quinone pool (1Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 2Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The alternative oxidase is found in two of the three domains of life, Bacteria and Eucarya, but not in Archaea; among Eucarya it is found in all kingdoms (i.e. plants, animals, fungi, protists) (4McDonald A.

It is thought that AOX is activated when the cytochrome pathway becomes saturated, for instance, during oxidative stress when the inner membrane is highly energized and prone to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (3Affourtit C.

IM-like proteins have subsequently been found in a diverse array of plant, algal, and cyanobacterial species; IM does not appear to be present in animals (12McDonald A.E. Amirsadeghi S. Vanlerberghe G.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also similar to AOX, IM functions as a terminal oxidase, transferring electrons from the plastoquinol (PQ) pool to molecular oxygen (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol.

(To avoid confusion, we will use the term PTOX in this report and IMMUTANS when describing the Arabidopsis gene for PTOX.) Current thinking is that PTOX is an important alternative electron sink in plastid membranes and that it lies at the intersection of many redox pathways. These include the desaturation reactions of carotenoid biosynthesis and chlororespiration (18Josse E.M. Alcaraz J.P. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Reminiscent of AOX, PTOX has been hypothesized to serve as a “safety valve” for the dissipation of excess electron flow, e.g. during stress (20Rizhsky L. Hallak-Herr E. Van Breusegem F. Rachmilevitch S. Barr J.E. Rodermel S. Inzé D. Mittler R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Baerr J.N. Thomas J.D. Taylor B.G. Rodermel S.R. Gray G.R. Physiol.

Kuntz M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, studies in tomato ghost (the ortholog of the Arabidopsis im mutant) reveal that lack of PTOX in young seedlings as well as in mature tomato leaves results in increased sensitivity to high light stress due to disturbances in the redox status of the plastoquinone pool (23Shahbazi M. Gilbert M. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence measurements reveal that modulating IMMUTANS expression and/or protein accumulation does not alter the flux of intersystem electrons during steady state photosynthesis in Arabidopsis nor does it afford photoprotection (17Rosso D. Ivanov A.G. Fu A. Giesler-Lee J. Hendrickson L. Geisler M. Stewart G. Krol M. Hurry V. Rodermel S.R. Maxwell D.P. Hüner N.P. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, IMMUTANS expression is strongly regulated by developmental factors in Arabidopsis, and the phenotype of im strongly argues that PTOX function in Arabidopsis is required early in chloroplast biogenesis. Together, these studies suggest that PTOX functions in a developmental- and species-specific manner. AOX and PTOX are members of the DOX (non-heme diiron carboxylate quinol oxidase) family of proteins (4McDonald A. Funct. Plant Biol. 2008; 35: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Moore A.L. Albury M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Moore A.L.

By analogy to crystal structure determinations of non-plant members of this family, it has been proposed that the diiron centers of AOX and PTOX are coordinated by four carboxylate and two His residues on a four-helix bundle (26Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys.

Sequence alignments have revealed that the six putative Fe-binding residues are highly conserved in the sequences of all AOX and PTOX proteins examined to date. In addition, nearly all PTOX enzymes contain a 16-amino acid domain near the C terminus that is highly conserved, but that is not found in AOX (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Curiously, this sequence corresponds precisely to exon 8 of the gene. We previously used PTOX as a model to test the functional significance of the conserved Fe-binding and exon 8 sequences (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These experiments were facilitated by the availability of two important tools: 1) an in vitro activity assay, developed by Josse et al. (15Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffé J. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M.

Arabidopsis im mutants have a light-sensitive green- and white-variegation due to action of a nuclear recessive gene -enhanced light intensities promote white sector formation (30Rédei G.P.

Plant J. 1994; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 32Aluru M.R. Bae H. Wu D. Rodermel S.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The white sectors contain abnormal, photooxidized plastids as a consequence of a lack of colored carotenoid production, while the green sectors contain morphologically normal chloroplasts. When transformed with a wild-type IM sequence, im plants revert to an all-green phenotype. Mutagenized copies of IM can thus be tested for their ability to normalize the im variegation and restore a wild type appearance. Our previous in vitro and in planta experiments showed that the six amino acids that bind iron do not tolerate change, even conservative ones, and that the exon 8 domain is required for PTOX activity and stability (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine 14 other amino acids that are perfectly conserved, or nearly so, in the sequences of all AOX and PTOX reported to date: Leu-135, Pro-142, Ala-139, His-151, Glu-171, Asn-174, Leu-179, Tyr-212, Pro-216, Ala-230, Tyr-234, Asp-287, Arg-293, Asp-295 (numbering refers to the Arabidopsis PTOX sequence). Most of these residues are predicted to reside in close proximity to the six Fe-binding sites. In this report, we test the functional significance of these sites by in vitro and in planta alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and report that very few of these sites are absolutely essential for activity. In addition, some mutant enzymes are defective in vitro, but are able to complement im. RNAi, antisense, and co-suppression experiments showed that transgenic plants with less than 3% of wild-type PTOX levels produce normal appearing plants. Considered together, the data suggest that PTOX is normally in excess, especially during the process of thylakoid formation early in leaf development when sector formation is established (33Aluru M.R. Yu F. Fu A. Rodermel S. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plants in this report included wild-type Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype), the spotty allele of im (also in Columbia) (10Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and transgenic im plants (described below). The plants were germinated and grown at 22 °C under conditions of continuous illumination. The wild-type plants were maintained at 100 μmol m−2 s−1. However, spotty is light sensitive and therefore was germinated under low light (15 μmol m−2 s−1 for 5 days) before transfer to normal light (100 μmol m−2 s−1). An IM cDNA lacking the N-terminal chloroplast-targeting sequence (10Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was cloned into the BamH1 and Nhe1 sites of the Escherichia coli expression vector pET-11a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate mutations; the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Following standard notation, the mutant clones are designated by the amino acid that was altered, its location in the A. thaliana IM sequence, and the amino acid to which it was changed (e.g. L135A means Leu-135 was changed to Ala). The following primers were used to introduce mutations into 14 conserved amino acids residues of AOX and IM: L135A: 5′-gcaaggttctttgttgctgagacagc-3′, 5′-gctgtctcagcaacaaagaaccttgc-3′.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. In brief, mutations were introduced (as above) into full-length IM cDNAs, and the mutant cDNAs were cloned behind the CaMV 35 S promoter in the binary vector pBI121. The constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and introduced into im plants (spotty allele) by the floral dip method (34Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant seedlings were selected at the T1 generation on plates containing 1 × MS salts (pH 5.7), 1% sucrose, and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. PCR and Southern blotting methods were performed to verify that the plants were transformed. Phenotypic analyses and protein analysis were conducted on T2 generation plants. To generate RNAi plants, gene-specific sense and antisense fragments of IM were amplified by RT-PCR using primers: sense strand (5′-CCGGATATCGCAGTAAAATACTATACG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCTAGACCAAGGCTAGTAGTATGG-3′), antisense strand (5′-GCGGAATTCGCAGTAAAATACTATACG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCCAAGGCTAGTAGTATGG-3′). The resulting sense and antisense fragments were linked by a 1-kb spacer, which is a partial DNA fragment of the β-glucuonidase (GUS) gene. The whole DNA fragment containing sense, spacer, and antisense regions was cloned behind the CaMV 35 S promoter in the binary vector pBI121. To generate antisense and co-suppression plants, full-length wild-type IM cDNAs (the same as used for the in planta site-directed mutagenesis experiments) were cloned in the forward and reverse orientations behind the CaMV 35 S promoter in the binary vector pBI121. For all three constructs, the same procedures were used as described above for plant transformation. Western blotting was performed to identify antisense and co-suppression lines with reduced levels of the PTOX protein in T2 generation plants; these procedures have been described (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have previously described methods to estimate in vitro PTOX activity based on procedures described by Josse et al. (15Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffé J. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Josse E.M. Alcaraz J.P. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, mutant constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21-DE3, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). The cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3% protease inhibitor mixture (PIC). The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C), and the concentration of proteins in the pellet was measured using the BioRad protocol with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oxygen consumption was monitored at 25 °C with a Clark O2 electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, England) using 100–200 μg of membrane protein in a 1.5-ml reaction mixture that contained a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-maleate (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm decyl-plastoquinone (2,3-methyl-5decyl-1,4-benzoquinone) (Sigma). The reactions were initiated by the addition of NADH (1 mm final concentration), followed by KCN (3 mm final concentration) and n-propyl gallate (3,4,5-tri-hydroxy-benzoic acid-n-propyl ester) (0.5 mm final concentration), all from Sigma. Reactions were followed for a total of 8 min: KCN was added 1 min after initiating the reaction with NADH; n-PG was added after 6 min. The activity measured in these assays represents the CN-resistant and nPG-sensitive oxygen uptake by PTOX. Proteins were isolated from partially purified chloroplasts by previously described procedures (35Perry S.E. Li H.M. Keegstra K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, leaves from 4-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were homogenized in 0.33 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and the filtrate was centrifuged at 2600 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0) then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.33 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), and the chlorophyll concentration of the suspension was determined (35Perry S.E. Li H.M. Keegstra K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Procedures for Western blotting have been described (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μg of protein (for E. coli samples) or an amount of protein corresponding to 5 μg of chlorophyll (for chloroplast samples) were electrophoresed through 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal antibody generated to the Arabidopsis PTOX protein (1:3000 dilution) (20Rizhsky L. Hallak-Herr E. Van Breusegem F. Rachmilevitch S. Barr J.E. Rodermel S. Inzé D. Mittler R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the proteins were visualized using the ECL immunodetection procedure (Pierce). Fig. 1A shows that AOX and PTOX have two structural features in common: both have an N-terminal transit peptide (TP) that targets the protein to the organelle (mitochondria in the case of AOX and chloroplasts in the case of PTOX); and both have a “DOX” domain, which comprises a four-helix bundle that includes the catalytic site (27Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Finnegan P.M. Umbach A.L. Wilce J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The active site is composed, in part, of six amino acids that serve as ligands for two iron atoms (Glu-136, Glu-175, His-178, Glu-227, Glu-296, and His-299) (Fig. 1B). AOX and PTOX also have unique structural domains: AOX contains a “dimerization domain” (D-domain) that has been implicated in AOX-AOX dimer formation (36Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 234-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and PTOX contains a 16 amino acid (exon 8) domain near the active site that is essential for protein stability and activity (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When the present experiments were initiated, 7 PTOX and 20 AOX protein sequences were available for comparison. 20 residues were found to be perfectly conserved among these sequences, and these 20 became the focus of our structure/function studies. Many more AOX and PTOX protein sequences have become available since that time, and a recent comparison of these sequences using ClustalW reveals that the 20 amino acid residues are still the most highly conserved, with exceptions being largely confined to those taxa that are distantly related to higher plants such as protists, cyanobacteria, and fungi. For example, an alignment of over 100 plant AOX and PTOX sequences from NCBI reveals that 18 of the 20 amino acids are perfectly conserved in plants and that the other two have single exceptions (Glu-171 is Gln in Zea mays PTOX whereas His-299 is Ile in wheat PTOX). Several of these residues have been shown to be essential for catalytic activity and/or are predicted to play a role in AOX regulation and stability (4McDonald A. Funct. Plant Biol. 2008; 35: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Moore A.L. Albury M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Six of the 20 residues are putative Fe-binding sites, and our results of in vitro and in planta mutagenesis of these six have been reported (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The present report describes mutagenesis studies on the other 14 residues (Fig. 1B). To test the functionality of the 14 residues, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis using an in vitro PTOX activity assay developed by Josse et al. (15Josse E.M. Simkin A.J. Gaffé J. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Carol P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Josse E.M. Alcaraz J.P. Labouré A.M. Kuntz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); this assay was used by us in our functional analyses of the six Fe-binding sites (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, this assay involves the measurement of CN-resistant and nPG-sensitive O2 consumption using membranes from E. coli transformed with various mutant IM constructs. Prior to measurement, the membranes are treated sequentially with NADH, KCN, and n-propyl gallate (n-PG). The rationale is that NADH serves as an electron donor to quinone (via a membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase), and electrons are then transferred to molecular oxygen via either PTOX or the cytochrome pathway. Flux is regulated by KCN, which inhibits the cytochrome pathway (but not PTOX activity), or by n-propyl gallate (n-PG), which inhibits PTOX but not the cytochrome pathway. In short, O2 consumption occurs by the cytochrome pathway when n-PG is added to the membranes, but by PTOX when KCN is added. Addition of both inhibitors abolishes O2 consumption. For our experiments, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis on 12 of 14 residues; the two conserved alanine residues (Ala-139 and Ala-230) were mutated to glycine. Fig. 2A shows that wild-type PTOX has an average KCN-resistant O2 consumption activity of 115 nmol O2·min−1·mg-protein−1; this activity is negligible in an empty vector control (∼3 nmol O2·min−1·mg-protein−1). Nine of the mutants have high KCN-resistant O2 consumption rates that in most cases closely resemble the wild-type protein (A139G, P142A, E171A, N174A, L179A, P216A, A230G, D287A, R293A), but O2 consumption is nearly abolished in five of the mutants (L135A, H151A, Y212A, Y234A, and D295A). We conclude that five of the conserved amino acids are essential for in vitro activity. To examine whether the severe decreases in KCN-resistant O2 consumption are due to poor expression and/or instability of the mutant proteins, PTOX abundance was assayed by Western blot analysis of membrane proteins from the various transformants using a polyclonal IM antibody (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Rizhsky L. Hallak-Herr E. Van Breusegem F. Rachmilevitch S. Barr J.E. Rodermel S. Inzé D. Mittler R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that mutant and wild type PTOX accumulate to similar levels in E. coli; the empty expression vector, as anticipated, lacks PTOX. We also found that PTOX is localized in the membrane (versus soluble) fractions in all the samples, consistent with the idea that the various mutations do not compromise protein incorporation into the E. coli membrane (data not shown). One other possibility for the lack of activity of some of the constructs is that the proteins fail to fold properly. We have previously discussed the evidence that makes this unlikely (13Fu A. Park S. Rodermel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42489-42496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One is that the three-dimensional structures of DOX proteins appear to be quite stable and resistant to alterations in charge or mobility of side chains. Taken together, the data indicate that the mutant PTOX proteins are expressed and stable at wild-type enzyme levels, and that reductions in O2 consumption are due to reductions in PTOX activity. Mutants that lack PTOX (e.g im) are a powerful tool to gain insight into structure/function relationships of PTOX and AOX (13F"
https://openalex.org/W2078357342,"Previous work has shown that Y-family DNA polymerases tolerate large DNA adducts, but a substantial decrease in catalytic efficiency and fidelity occurs during bypass of N2,N2-dimethyl (Me2)-substituted guanine (N2,N2-Me2G), in contrast to a single methyl substitution. Therefore, it is unclear why the addition of two methyl groups is so disruptive. The presence of N2,N2-Me2G lowered the catalytic efficiency of the model enzyme Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 16,000-fold. Dpo4 inserted dNTPs almost at random during bypass of N2,N2-Me2G, and much of the enzyme was kinetically trapped by an inactive ternary complex when N2,N2-Me2G was present, as judged by a reduced burst amplitude (5% of total enzyme) and kinetic modeling. One crystal structure of Dpo4 with a primer having a 3'-terminal dideoxycytosine (Cdd) opposite template N2,N2-Me2G in a post-insertion position showed Cdd folded back into the minor groove, as a catalytically incompetent complex. A second crystal had two unique orientations for the primer terminal Cdd as follows: (i) flipped into the minor groove and (ii) a long pairing with N2,N2-Me2G in which one hydrogen bond exists between the O-2 atom of Cdd and the N-1 atom of N2,N2-Me2G, with a second water-mediated hydrogen bond between the N-3 atom of Cdd and the O-6 atom of N2,N2-Me2G. A crystal structure of Dpo4 with dTTP opposite template N2,N2-Me2G revealed a wobble orientation. Collectively, these results explain, in a detailed manner, the basis for the reduced efficiency and fidelity of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of N2,N2-Me2G compared with mono-substituted N2-alkyl G adducts."

Using membrane vesicles expressing the mouse class I major histocompatibility complex, i.e. Ld plus costimulatory ligands, i.e. B7-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 along with 2C T cell receptor transgenic T cells, we investigated the roles of CD28 and LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) in the activation of PLC-γ1 and Ca2+ signaling.

The extracellular Ca2+ entry is key for a myriad of physiological changes leading to cell cycle progression and development of effector functions of T cells. Downstream signaling events requiring an influx of extracellular Ca2+ involve activation of calcineurin/NF-AT and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways together resulting in transcriptional activation of multiple genes, including interleukin-2 (2Oh-hora M.

A well known Ca2+-signaling mechanism in T cells is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). According to that mechanism, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) activated by T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum to induce release (mobilization) of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, Ca2+ channel in plasma membrane opens to allow entry of extracellular Ca2+. Recent advances in the field entail identification of specific proteins involved in the process such as STIM-1, a Ca2+ sensor in endoplasmic reticulum, and ORAI-1, a Ca2+ channel in plasma membrane (4Feske S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1), an integrin composed of αL (CD11a) and β2 (CD18) subunits, plays multiple roles in various stages of T cell immune responses, i.e. in activation of resting T cells, migration of activated effector T cells to the site of infection, and execution of their effector functions (5Evans R.

Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). LFA-1 acts as both an adhesion and a signaling molecule so that interaction of LFA-1 with its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), not only facilitates firm contact between T cell and APC but also induces intracellular signaling events (7Mor A. Dustin M.L. Philips M.R. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 218: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The importance of LFA-1 in Ca2+ signaling has been identified. Earlier studies showed that engagement of LFA-1 resulted in prolonged IP3 production and the sustained increase of intracellular [Ca2+] as well as stronger PLC-γ1 activation (8Kanner S.B.

It was also shown that a specific motif (NPXF) in the intracellular domain of the CD18 subunit was responsible for the action of LFA-1 (10Sirim P. Zeitlmann L. Kellersch B. Falk C.S. Schendel D.J.

It was also suggested that LFA-1 facilitated entry of extracellular Ca2+ by promoting the formation of immunological synapse by which production of IP3 could be amplified and stabilized (12Wülfing C.

We have been using nanometric membrane vesicles prepared from the purified plasma membrane fraction of Drosophila cells engineered to express Ld class I MHC plus B7-1 and ICAM-1, along with 2C TCR transgenic T cells, for studying membrane-proximal TCR signaling events leading to LFA-1 activation (13Hwang I.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated Ca2+ signaling of 2C T cells being cultured with the plasma membrane-derived membrane vesicles (pMVs), and we present data revealing that LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry, manifest in T cells undergoing the activation process after suboptimal TCR stimulation, proceeds via a mechanism separate from SOCE. CD28−/− (B6) and β2-integrin−/− (LFA-1−/−) (B6) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at The Scripps Research Institute. Wild type, CD28−/−, and LFA-1−/− 2C TCR transgenic mice (15Sha W.C. Nelson C.A. Newberry R.D. Kranz D.M. Russell J.H. Loh D.Y.

PP2, Ly294002, wortmannin, and U73122 were purchased from EMD Bioscience. Anti-CD28 (37.51) monoclonal Ab (mAb), anti-CD11a (M17/4) mAb, and rat mAb (RTK 2758) used as an isotype control, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Ld (28-14-8), anti-B7-1 (16-10A1), anti-ICAM-1 (YN1/1.7.4), and anti-B7-2 (GL-1) mAbs were purchased from Biolegend. Anti-CD8 mAb was prepared as an ascites form (a gift from Dr. Surh, Department of Immunology, The Scripps Research Institute). Polyclonal Abs directed to pan-Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308), PLC-γ1, and phospho-PLC-γ1 (Tyr783) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG Ab was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. CD8+ 2C T cells were negatively purified from pooled lymph nodes using CD8a+ T cell isolation MACSTM kit (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by panning on anti-CD8 mAb (3.168)-coated plates (13Hwang I. Shen X. Sprent J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Drosophila APCs were maintained in Schneider舗s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics (13Hwang I. Shen X. Sprent J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The pMVs were prepared as described by Goldberg and Kornfeld (16Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3159-3165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, Drosophila APCs induced to express transfected mouse immunomolecules were washed and resuspended in buffer A (15 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and lysed with Contes homogenizer (loose-fitting pestle). The cell lysate was spun down at low centrifugal force (1500 × g) to remove unlysed cells and nuclei. The supernatant was recovered and mixed with 0.5 volume of buffer B (375 mm KCl, 22.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 220 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and subjected to ultracentrifugation (1 h at 50,000 × g at 4 °C) to collect the crude membrane particles. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer C (40 mm Tris·Cl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and finely dispersed using Contes homogenizer (tight-fitting pestle). Resuspended membrane vesicles were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, 200,000 × g for 2 h at 0 °C. Membrane vesicles derived from plasma membrane fractions were taken from the interface of 20:35% sucrose layers, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The amount of pMVs was determined by measuring the protein concentration in the sample. 2C T cells cultured with peptide-loaded pMVs were washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) followed by sonication for further homogenization. Equal amounts of lysates (determined by the protein concentration) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as described (17Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R. Naugle J.E. Meszaros J.G. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Proteins of interest were visualized by ECL reagent (Pierce). Kinetic analysis of changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] was performed as described (18Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 700 μl of purified CD8+ 2C T cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with 3 μm Indo-1/Am (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 37 °C followed by thorough washing with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in normal Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (catalog number 21041, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or Ca2+-free Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (catalog number 21068, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Seven hundred microliters of Indo-1-loaded 2C T cells (2 × 106/ml) were pre-warmed for 15 min at 37 °C and mixed with 70 μl of peptide-loaded pMVs (1 mg/ml). Flow cytometric analysis began 60 s before addition of pMVs and continued for 720 s afterward; flow cytometric analysis was carried out with an LSR II flow cytometer equipped with a temperature control device. Changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ were determined measuring changes in the ratio of fluorescence intensities of Indo-1-loaded T cells detected by two separate photomultiplier tubes with bandpath filters of 440/40 nm (violet) and 530/30 nm (blue), respectively; Indo-1 was excited by a 351-nm UV laser. We had shown that culture of 2C T cells with QL9 (or P2Ca) peptide-loaded LdB7-1ICAM-1 Drosophila pMVs resulted in activation of membrane-proximal signaling cascades involving protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) exemplified by tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (19Law C.L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and threonine phosphorylation of Akt (14Kim K. Wang L. Hwang I. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the contributing roles of TCR/pMHC, CD28/B7-1, and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions in the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 occurred rapidly upon culture of 2C T cells with the pMVs loaded with QL9 (1 μm) peptide. The level of the Akt phosphorylation reached near maximum within 5 min of culture and was sustained through 30 min (Fig. 1A, left). Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 at Tyr783 was also detected within 5 min of the culture, but the level of the phosphorylation increased gradually as the culture time extended (Fig. 1B, left). Both CD28/B7-1 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions had positive effects on the PLC-γ1 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B, right, and supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, wild type 2C T cells treated with either anti-CD28 or anti-LFA-1 mAb and mutant 2C T cells deficient in CD28 (2C.CD28−/−) or LFA-1 (2C.LFA-1−/−) expression showed significantly reduced levels of phosphorylation of both PLC-γ1 and Akt compared with wild type 2C T cells treated with control mAb. A further decrease in levels of phosphorylation was observed when the wild type T cells were co-treated with anti-CD28 plus anti-LFA-1 mAbs, and 2C.CD28−/− and 2C.LFA-1−/− T cells were treated with anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD28 mAbs, respectively. Observation that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 progressed quickly during culture of 2C T cells with the pMVs loaded with QL9 peptide prompted us to examine Ca2+ signaling during the culture. Wild type 2C T cells being cultured with the QL9 (1 μm)-loaded LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs showed a prominent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 2). The increase became evident ∼2.5 min after mixing of 2C T cells with the pMVs and continued through the culture up to 12 min. mAb blocking of CD28/B7-1 interaction slightly reduced the extent of Ca2+ increase (Fig. 2, left). In contrast, mAb blocking of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction almost completely abolished the Ca2+ increase. Importance of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction in the cytosolic Ca2+ increase was confirmed by experiments using 2C. LFA-1−/− T cells, in which no measurable Ca2+ increase was observed. Consistent with the result obtained with 2C T cells treated with anti-CD28 mAb, 2C.CD28−/− T cells showed conspicuous increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] during the culture (Fig. 2). According to the mechanism of SOCE, entry of extracellular Ca2+ resulting in a surge in cytosolic [Ca2+] is preceded by mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ store following PLC-γ1 activation by TCR triggering (2Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] observed during culture of 2C T cells with QL9-loaded LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs was accompanied by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by culturing the cells in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, no change in cytosolic [Ca2+] was detected during the culture (Fig. 3A, right). Note that strong mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was detected after treatment of 2C T cells with thapsigargin, a well known intracellular Ca2+ mobilizer, both in the Ca2+-containing and -free media (Fig. 3A, left) (21Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of Ld expression in LdB7-1ICAM-1 Drosophila APCs is modest (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, it was suggested that the level of Ld/QL9 expression in LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs was too low to trigger TCR signaling strong enough to induce mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in primary resting T cells such as 2C transgenic T cells. To test the idea, we used pMVs prepared from Drosophila APCs expressing higher levels of Ld, namely pMVs prepared from two separate Drosophila APC clones expressing Ld alone (Ld) and higher level of Ld plus B7-1 plus ICAM-1 (Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1) (supplemental Fig. S2). 2C T cells cultured with Ld pMVs loaded with QL9 peptide (1 μm) in Ca2+-containing medium showed a rapid increase in intracellular [Ca2+], which became evident less than a minute after addition of the pMVs (Fig. 3B, left). Different from the Ca2+ increase by LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVS, the Ca2+ increase by Ld pMVs did not proceed progressively; instead, after an initial spike, the [Ca2+] decreased slightly and was sustained at a steady level throughout the culture. Consequently, at the end of the culture, the cytosolic [Ca2+] in 2C T cells cultured with QL9-loaded Ld pMVs was considerably lower than that in 2C T cells cultured with the QL9-loaded LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, a transient but significant increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] was detected in 2C T cells cultured with QL9-loaded Ld pMVs in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3B, left). 2C T cells cultured with Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs loaded with QL9 (1 μm) peptide in Ca2+-containing medium showed a rapid and progressive increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 3B, right). The [Ca2+] measured after 12 min of culture with QL9-loaded Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs was higher than that measured after culture with LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs, but the difference was marginal. As with QL9-loaded Ld pMVs, rapid and transient increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] was detected when 2C T cells were cultured with QL9-loaded Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3B, right). Next, we examined an effect of concentration of QL9 peptide loaded to Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs on both entry of extracellular Ca2+ and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ observed in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free media, respectively (Fig. 4). When wild type 2C T cells were cultured with the pMVs loaded with QL9 peptide at 200 and 40 nm, respectively, both mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and influx of extracellular Ca2+ were readily detected. When the pMVs were loaded with the peptide at 8 nm, a considerable increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] was detected when the T cells were cultured in Ca2+-containing medium, although no measurable change was monitored when cultured in Ca2+-free medium. When the pMVs were loaded with the peptide at a further lower concentration (1.6 nm), no Ca2+ increase was detected in either medium (Fig. 4, left). When 2C.LFA-1−/− T cells were used in the experiments (Fig. 4, right), different results were obtained. As with wild type 2C T cells, the mutant T cells being cultured with Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs loaded with QL9 peptide at higher concentrations (200 and 40 nm, respectively) displayed both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The pattern of Ca2+ increase in the mutant 2C T cells cultured in Ca2+-containing medium was, however, different from that in wild type 2C T cells and rather resembled that in wild type 2C T cells cultured with QL9-loaded Ld pMVs (Fig. 3B). When the same mutant T cells were cultured with Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs loaded with the peptide at lower concentrations (8 and 1.6 nm, respectively), they showed no Ca2+ increase in either medium. We also examined the involvement of key signaling molecules engaged in membrane-proximal TCR signaling, i.e. PTKs, PI3K, and PLC-γ1, in LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry using pharmacological agents specifically targeting those molecules. Treatment of wild type 2C T cells with PP2, Ly294002, or U73122, which target PTKs, PI3K, and PLC-γ1, respectively, before culture with LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs loaded with QL9 (1 μm) peptide strongly inhibited the Ca2+ entry (Fig. 5), indicating a critical role of those signaling molecules in the LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry. The importance of PI3K was further supported by comparable inhibition of the Ca2+ entry by wortmannin (500 nm), another well known PI3K inhibitor. 3K. Kim, L. Wang, and I. Hwang, unpublished data. Microvesicles prepared from plasma membrane of Drosophila APCs expressing defined mouse immunomolecules of interest (i.e. pMVs) (13Hwang I. Shen X. Sprent J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Kim K. Wang L. Hwang I. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Kovar M. Boyman O. Shen X. Hwang I. Kohler R. Sprent J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11671-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have several advantageous features in investigation of membrane-proximal signaling mechanisms primed by TCR stimulation. Given that physiological ligands expressed in biological membrane are used for stimulating T cells, experimental results obtained with pMVs may have superior physiological relevance compared with those obtained with receptor-specific mAbs or ligands immobilized on the surface of plastic or magnetic beads. Because of the huge difference in their sizes, separation of T cells from pMVs after culture is simple, and thus instant biochemical analysis of molecular alterations occurring during the culture becomes feasible; when intact cells are used for stimulating T cells, a complicated method is needed to separate T cells from stimulating cells. In addition, kinetic flow cytometric analysis of physiological changes occurring in the early stage of T cell activation, e.g. influx of extracellular Ca2+, is facilitated. We initiated this study for investigating contributing roles of CD28/B7-1 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions in a series of molecular changes in the early stage of T cell activation. We have shown before that the sole interaction of 2C TCR with Ld-QL9 complex expressed in LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs is necessary and sufficient to induce a near maximum level of F-actin polymerization; in that process, CD28 and LFA-1 played little role (14Kim K. Wang L. Hwang I. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Different from in F-actin polymerization, both CD28 and LFA-1 took a significant and comparable part in phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), conforming to their roles in activation of PI3K signaling cascades reported by others (23Okkenhaug K. Bilancio A. Emery J.L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Sánchez-Martín L. Sánchez-Sánchez N. Gutiérrez-López M.D. Rojo A.I. Vicente-Manzanares M. Pérez-Alvarez M.J. Sánchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Cuadrado A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Rodríguez-Fernández J.L. Cabañas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). They also exerted comparable effects on phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Considering that PLC-γ1 phosphorylation at Tyr783 is mediated by the Syk family PTK, i.e. ZAP-70 in T cells, one may reason that CD28 and LFA-1 may take part in activation of ZAP-70 (25Soede R.D. Wijnands Y.M. Van Kouteren-Cobzaru I. Roos E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also plausible that CD28/B7-1 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions make contributions to the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 via up-regulation of PI3K activity through which more phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate becomes available. As a result, functionality of signaling molecules containing the PH domain is escalated facilitating formation of signalsome centered by PLC-γ1 and phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 by ZAP-70 (26Michel F. Attal-Bonnefoy G. Mangino G. Mise-Omata S. Acuto O. Immunity. 2001; 15: 935-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Wange R.L. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In striking contrast to roles in the PLC-γ1 phosphorylation, roles of CD28 and LFA-1 in the increase of cytosolic [Ca2+] were clearly distinct (Fig. 2). Considering that phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 at Tyr783 is reportedly critical for activation of its enzymatic activity (19Law C.L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), those results were intriguing and suggested a novel Ca2+ entry mechanism exerted by LFA-1 other than SOCE. Supporting that notion, the LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry proceeded without mobilization of measurable levels of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). The lack of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization during culture of 2C T cells with LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs was ensured by the result that pre-culture of 2C T cells with the QL9-loaded pMVs in the calcium-free medium did not alter either onset or magnitude of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by thapsigargin (supplemental Fig. S3). Studies for SOCE have been routinely conducted following Ab cross-linking of TCRs, which elicits strong Signal 1; the TCR-mediated signaling mechanisms are collectively termed as Signal 1 (28Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Reflecting the importance of Signal 1 in mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, a transient but distinct level of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was readily detected when 2C T cells were cultured with pMVs expressing an elevated level of Ld class I MHC (Fig. 3B). The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ occurred almost instantly after mixing of 2C T cells with the pMVs and peaked within a minute of the culture. In line with this, an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] in 2C T cells cultured with the same pMVs in Ca2+-containing medium progressed much more promptly than with LdB7-1ICAM-1 pMVs. Experiments using wild type and LFA-1−/− 2C T cells cultured with Ld(high)B7-1ICAM-1 pMVs loaded with titrated concentrations of QL9 peptide confirmed that significance of the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction in extracellular Ca2+ entry was determined by the level of cognate pMHC expression in the pMVs (Fig. 4). Under conditions that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was detected, namely when 2C T cells were cultured with the pMVs loaded with high concentrations of QL9 peptide, extracellular Ca2+ entry occurred without involvement of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction even though the Ca2+ entry proceeded more progressively in the presence of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction. Extracellular Ca2+ entry could still occur under a condition that intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was not detected. In that condition, extracellular Ca2+ entry was totally dependent on LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction. It is of interest that LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry still relies on activity of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 5) because the level of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation at Tyr783 showed little correlation with the level of cytosolic Ca2+ increase (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). PLC-γ1 plays multiple roles in T cell activation. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate catalyzed by PLC-γ1 results in production of diacylglycerol (DAG) as well as IP3. DAG is imperative for activation of a family of protein kinase C and small GTP-binding proteins such as Rap1 (29Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 by DAG may hold significant implications in LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry because of its role in inside-out signaling for LFA-1 activation (7Mor A. Dustin M.L. Philips M.R. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 218: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Kinashi T. Katagiri K. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 93: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry by the PLC-γ1 inhibitor (U73122) could be explained by inhibition of DAG production by which LFA-1 activation process is impeded, and consequently signaling cascades promoted by high affinity/avidity LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction are silenced (31Katagiri K. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11875-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+ channels involved in SOCE (e.g. ORAI-1), other types of Ca2+ channels are also expressed in T cells, e.g. L-type Ca2+ channel and transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) (2Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Quintana A. Griesemer D. Schwarz E.C. Hoth M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 450: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Kotturi M.F. Hunt S.V. Jefferies W.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesize that TRPC-mediated Ca2+ entry mechanism may be of special relevance to LFA-1-dependent Ca2+ entry for the following reasons. First, TRPC-mediated TCR-dependent Ca2+ entry has been revealed in human T cells (33Philipp S. Strauss B. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Mery L. Flockerzi V. Hoth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26629-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, TRPC-mediated Ca2+ entry has been found to operate without mobilization of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ store (34Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Nikolaidis N. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 688-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Third, a few TRPCs have been found to be activated by DAG (35Hardie R.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 735-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). According to recent study by Mor et al. (36Mor A. Campi G. Du G. Zheng Y. Foster D.A. Dustin M.L. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 induces strong activation of phospholipase D to produce DAG functioning in the plasma membrane. Together, it appears possible that TCR triggering leads to activation of LFA-1 via inside-out signaling, and consequently, high affinity/avidity interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 results in amplification of DAG production via activation of phospholipase D. As a result, formation of TRPC is facilitated to allow entry of extracellular Ca2+. It has been perceived that enhancement of Ca2+ signaling by LFA-1 is attained via strengthening signaling cascades induced by the TCR/pMHC interaction, namely stable and prolonged T/APC contact established by the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction allows more sustainable TCR signaling to facilitate activation of the downstream Ca2+ signaling pathway (11Bachmann M.F.

The results of this study appear to contradict that view and instead represent that LFA-1 activated by TCR triggering acts independently to drive extracellular Ca2+ entry via a mechanism separate from SOCE.
