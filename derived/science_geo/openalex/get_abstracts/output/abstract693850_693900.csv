https://openalex.org/W4280598306,"Despite the availabilty of imaging-based and mass-spectrometry-based methods for spatial proteomics, a key challenge remains connecting images with single-cell-resolution protein abundance measurements. Here, we introduce Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP), which combines artificial-intelligence-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated single-cell or single-nucleus laser microdissection and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. By individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and uncharacterized proteins. In an archived primary melanoma tissue, DVP identified spatially resolved proteome changes as normal melanocytes transition to fully invasive melanoma, revealing pathways that change in a spatial manner as cancer progresses, such as mRNA splicing dysregulation in metastatic vertical growth that coincides with reduced interferon signaling and antigen presentation. The ability of DVP to retain precise spatial proteomic information in the tissue context has implications for the molecular profiling of clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W4280528160,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receive highly targeted biologic therapies without previous knowledge of target expression levels in the diseased tissue. Approximately 40% of patients do not respond to individual biologic therapies and 5-20% are refractory to all. In a biopsy-based, precision-medicine, randomized clinical trial in RA (R4RA; n = 164), patients with low/absent synovial B cell molecular signature had a lower response to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) compared with that to tocilizumab (anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody) although the exact mechanisms of response/nonresponse remain to be established. Here, in-depth histological/molecular analyses of R4RA synovial biopsies identify humoral immune response gene signatures associated with response to rituximab and tocilizumab, and a stromal/fibroblast signature in patients refractory to all medications. Post-treatment changes in synovial gene expression and cell infiltration highlighted divergent effects of rituximab and tocilizumab relating to differing response/nonresponse mechanisms. Using ten-by-tenfold nested cross-validation, we developed machine learning algorithms predictive of response to rituximab (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74), tocilizumab (AUC = 0.68) and, notably, multidrug resistance (AUC = 0.69). This study supports the notion that disease endotypes, driven by diverse molecular pathology pathways in the diseased tissue, determine diverse clinical and treatment-response phenotypes. It also highlights the importance of integration of molecular pathology signatures into clinical algorithms to optimize the future use of existing medications and inform the development of new drugs for refractory patients."
https://openalex.org/W4280529341,"Cancer immunoediting1 is a hallmark of cancer2 that predicts that lymphocytes kill more immunogenic cancer cells to cause less immunogenic clones to dominate a population. Although proven in mice1,3, whether immunoediting occurs naturally in human cancers remains unclear. Here, to address this, we investigate how 70 human pancreatic cancers evolved over 10 years. We find that, despite having more time to accumulate mutations, rare long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer who have stronger T cell activity in primary tumours develop genetically less heterogeneous recurrent tumours with fewer immunogenic mutations (neoantigens). To quantify whether immunoediting underlies these observations, we infer that a neoantigen is immunogenic (high-quality) by two features-'non-selfness' based on neoantigen similarity to known antigens4,5, and 'selfness' based on the antigenic distance required for a neoantigen to differentially bind to the MHC or activate a T cell compared with its wild-type peptide. Using these features, we estimate cancer clone fitness as the aggregate cost of T cells recognizing high-quality neoantigens offset by gains from oncogenic mutations. With this model, we predict the clonal evolution of tumours to reveal that long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer develop recurrent tumours with fewer high-quality neoantigens. Thus, we submit evidence that that the human immune system naturally edits neoantigens. Furthermore, we present a model to predict how immune pressure induces cancer cell populations to evolve over time. More broadly, our results argue that the immune system fundamentally surveils host genetic changes to suppress cancer."

Although the conserved catalytic lysine in protein kinases is an attractive candidate for a covalent approach, selectivity remains an obvious challenge. Moreover, few covalent inhibitors have been shown to engage the kinase catalytic lysine in animals. We hypothesized that reversible, lysine-targeted inhibitors could provide sustained kinase engagement in vivo, with selectivity driven in part by differences in residence time. By strategically linking benzaldehydes to a promiscuous kinase binding scaffold, we developed chemoproteomic probes that reversibly and covalently engage >200 protein kinases in cells and mice. Probe-kinase residence time was dramatically enhanced by a hydroxyl group ortho to the aldehyde. Remarkably, only a few kinases, including Aurora A, showed sustained, quasi-irreversible occupancy in vivo, the structural basis for which was revealed by X-ray crystallography. We anticipate broad application of salicylaldehyde-based probes to proteins that lack a druggable cysteine."

https://openalex.org/W4280509802,"The available data to determine the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) burden in Saudi Arabia are scarce. Therefore, this study closely examines and tracks the trends of the COPD burden in Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 2019 using the dataset of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019.This study used the GBD 2019 dataset to analyse the COPD prevalence, incidence, morbidity and mortality rates in the Saudi Arabian population from 1990 to 2019, stratified by sex and age. The age-standardised rate was used to determine the prevalence, incidence, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths.In 2019, an estimated 434,560.64 people (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI) 396,011.72-473,596.71) had COPD in Saudi Arabia, corresponding to an increase of 329.82% compared with the number of diagnosed people in 1990 [101,104.05 (95% UI 91,334.4-111,223.91)]. The prevalence rate of COPD increased by 49%, from 1,381.26 (1,285.35-1,484.96) cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 2,053.04 (1918.06-2194.29) cases per 100,000 in 2019, and this trend was higher in males than females. The incidence rate of COPD in 2019 was 145.06 (136.62-154.76) new cases per 100,000, representing an increase of 43.4% from the 1990 incidence rate [101.18 (95.27-107.86)]. In 2019, the DALYs rate was 508.15 (95% UI 434.85-581.58) per 100,000 population. This was higher in males than females, with a 14.12% increase among males. In 2019, YLLs contributed to 63.6% of DALYs due to COPD. The death rate due to COPD was 19.6 (95% UI 15.94-23.39) deaths per 100 000 in 2019, indicating a decrease of 41.44% compared with the death rate in 1990 [33.55 deaths per 100 000 (95% UI 25.13-47.69)]. In 2019, COPD deaths accounted for 1.65% (1.39-1.88) of the total of deaths in Saudi Arabia and 57% of all deaths caused by chronic respiratory diseases.Over the period 1990-2019, the prevalence and incidence of COPD in Saudi Arabia have been steadily rising. Even though COPD morbidity and death rates have been decreasing, they remain higher in men and older age. The holistic assessment and interventions with careful attention to optimising the community-based primary care management, such as screening for early diagnosis, smoking cessation programs and pulmonary rehabilitation, are likely to be the most successful strategies to reduce the burden of COPD in Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W4280491924,"One of the most striking features of human cognition is the ability to plan. Two aspects of human planning stand out—its efficiency and flexibility. Efficiency is especially impressive because plans must often be made in complex environments, and yet people successfully plan solutions to many everyday problems despite having limited cognitive resources1–3. Standard accounts in psychology, economics and artificial intelligence have suggested that human planning succeeds because people have a complete representation of a task and then use heuristics to plan future actions in that representation4–11. However, this approach generally assumes that task representations are fixed. Here we propose that task representations can be controlled and that such control provides opportunities to quickly simplify problems and more easily reason about them. We propose a computational account of this simplification process and, in a series of preregistered behavioural experiments, show that it is subject to online cognitive control12–14 and that people optimally balance the complexity of a task representation and its utility for planning and acting. These results demonstrate how strategically perceiving and conceiving problems facilitates the effective use of limited cognitive resources. Strategically perceiving and conceiving problems facilitates the effective use of limited cognitive resources."
https://openalex.org/W4280509744,"The legal status of Cannabis is changing, fueling an increasing diversity of Cannabis -derived products. Because Cannabis contains dozens of chemical compounds with potential psychoactive or medicinal effects, understanding this phytochemical diversity is crucial. The legal Cannabis industry heavily markets products to consumers based on widely used labeling systems purported to predict the effects of different “strains.” We analyzed the cannabinoid and terpene content of commercial Cannabis samples across six US states, finding distinct chemical phenotypes (chemotypes) which are reliably present. By comparing the observed phytochemical diversity to the commercial labels commonly attached to Cannabis -derived product samples, we show that commercial labels do not consistently align with the observed chemical diversity. However, certain labels do show a biased association with specific chemotypes. These results have implications for the classification of commercial Cannabis , design of animal and human research, and regulation of consumer marketing—areas which today are often divorced from the chemical reality of the Cannabis -derived material they wish to represent."
https://openalex.org/W4280595762,"Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is characterized by vascular inflammation and thrombosis. We and others have proposed that the inflammatory response to coronavirus infection activates endothelial cells, leading to endothelial release of pro-thrombotic proteins. These mediators can trigger obstruction of the pulmonary microvasculature, leading to worsening oxygenation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that higher levels of biomarkers released from endothelial cells are associated with worse oxygenation in patients with COVID-19. We studied 83 participants aged 18-84 years with COVID-19 admitted to a single center. The severity of pulmonary disease was classified by oxygen requirement, including no oxygen requirement, low-flow oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and death. We measured plasma levels of two proteins released by activated endothelial cells, von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen and soluble P-Selectin (sP-Sel), and a biomarker of systemic thrombosis, D-dimer. Additionally, we explored the association of endothelial biomarker levels with the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokines, and vascular inflammation biomarkers. We found that levels of VWF, sP-sel, and D-dimer were increased in individuals with more severe COVID-19 pulmonary disease. Biomarkers of endothelial cell activation were also correlated with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Taken together, our data demonstrate increased levels of VWF and sP-selectin are linked to the severity of lung disease in COVID-19 and correlated with biomarkers of inflammation and vascular inflammation. Our data support the concept that COVID-19 is a vascular disease which involves endothelial injury in the context of an inflammatory state."
https://openalex.org/W4280507017,"Feature selection (FS) can eliminate many redundant, irrelevant, and noisy features in high-dimensional data to improve machine learning or data mining models' prediction, classification, and computational performance. We proposed an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) and improved k-nearest neighbors (IKNN) classifier approaches for feature selection (IWOAIKFS). Firstly, WOA is improved by using chaotic elite reverse individual, probability selection of skew distribution, nonlinear adjustment of control parameters and position correction strategy to enhance the search performance of the algorithm for feature subsets. Secondly, the sample similarity measurement criterion and weighted voting criterion based on the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the weight matrix M are proposed to improve the KNN classifier and improve the evaluation performance of the algorithm on feature subsets. The experimental results show: IWOA not only has better optimization performance when solving benchmark functions of different dimensions, but also when used with IKNN for feature selection, IWOAIKFS has better classification and robustness."

https://openalex.org/W4280608766,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays important roles in the cellular stress response. While SGK1 has been reported to restrain inflammatory immune responses, the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive, especially in oral bacteria-induced inflammatory milieu. Here, we found that SGK1 curtails Porphyromonas gingivalis–induced inflammatory responses through maintaining levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3, thereby suppressing NF-κB signaling. Specifically, SGK1 inhibition significantly enhances production of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 in P. gingivalis–stimulated innate immune cells. The results were confirmed with siRNA and LysM-Cre–mediated SGK1 KO mice. Moreover, SGK1 deletion robustly increased NF-κB activity and c-Jun expression but failed to alter the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Further mechanistic data revealed that SGK1 deletion elevates TRAF2 phosphorylation, leading to TRAF3 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Importantly, siRNA-mediated traf3 silencing or c-Jun overexpression mimics the effect of SGK1 inhibition on P. gingivalis–induced inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation. In addition, using a P. gingivalis infection–induced periodontal bone loss model, we found that SGK1 inhibition modulates TRAF3 and c-Jun expression, aggravates inflammatory responses in gingival tissues, and exacerbates alveolar bone loss. Altogether, we demonstrated for the first time that SGK1 acts as a rheostat to limit P. gingivalis–induced inflammatory immune responses and mapped out a novel SGK1–TRAF2/3–c-Jun–NF-κB signaling axis. These findings provide novel insights into the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms of SGK1 and suggest novel interventional targets to inflammatory diseases relevant beyond the oral cavity.

These findings provide novel insights into the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms of SGK1 and suggest novel interventional targets to inflammatory diseases relevant beyond the oral cavity. Homeostasis between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory response is critical to the outcome of immune responses and progression of many inflammatory diseases. Concomitant to initiation of proinflammatory responses, anti-inflammatory mechanisms are also ignited to restrain the overwhelming inflammation (1Murray P.J. Smale S.T.

With advances in understanding the mechanism of anti-inflammatory machinery, it is becoming evident that anti-inflammatory response is almost always activated concurrently with proinflammatory response, lasts from several seconds to several years, and acts as a positive process rather than a negative one (1Murray P.J.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by severe gingival inflammation and destruction of alveolar bone and connective tissues surrounding the teeth. It is estimated that over half of the adult population in the United States has periodontitis (8Eke P.I. Dye B.A. Wei L. Thornton-Evans G.O. Genco R.J.

In oral cavity, the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses ensures a state of immune homeostasis, which is critical for the maintenance of gingival health. Tissue destruction is primarily a consequence of excessive intensity and/or prolonged duration of host immune inflammatory responses to dysbiotic microbiota.

While P. gingivalis was found to induce proinflammatory responses through binding to pattern recognition receptors on host immune cells, the P. gingivalis–mediated anti-inflammatory immune mechanisms and their functional role in the overall periodontal disease process remain less explored. P. gingivalis frequently exploits host machinery, especially the amount and/or activity of protein kinases, such as β-catenin, mTORC1, or Akt, and by which it can modulate the course and magnitude of inflammatory responses (7Nakayama M.

However, the role of SGK1 in P. gingivalis–induced inflammation and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factors (TRAFs) are a large family of intracellular (IC) signaling molecules that include six typical members (TRAF1–6) and one atypical member (TRAF7) in mammalian cells (30Dhillon B. Aleithan F. Abdul-Sater Z. Abdul-Sater A.A. The evolving role of TRAFs in mediating inflammatory responses.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10: 104Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Xie P. TRAF molecules in cell signaling and in human diseases.J. Mol. Signal. 2013; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Originally identified as signaling adaptors, the TRAF molecules are now known to act as ubiquitin E3 ligases (E3s) and mediate a large variety of signaling transduction upon activation of immune receptors, such as pattern-recognition receptors, antigen receptors, cytokine receptors and, importantly, TNF receptor superfamily members (32Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar, 33Etemadi N. Chopin M. Anderton H. Tanzer M.C. Rickard J.A. Abeysekera W. et al.TRAF2 regulates TNF and NF-kappaB signalling to suppress apoptosis and skin inflammation independently of Sphingosine kinase 1.Elife. 2015; 4e10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All TRAF members but TRAF1 have been revealed to contain a RING domain located in the N-terminal region. This is key to mediate protein ubiquitination as well as oligomerization and association of TRAF members with their upstream receptors, adaptors, and downstream effector proteins. Through the lysine (K)-48 and K63-linked polyubiquitin chain, TRAF members control multiple signaling pathways that in turn are important for the induction of genes associated with innate immunity, inflammation, and cell survival (34Skaug B.

On the other hand, our and other studies found that some protein serine and threonine kinases such as SGK1 and Janus kinase 3 regulate the activity of an ubiquitin E3 ligase, Nedd4 (neural precursor cell–expressed developmentally downregulated 4)-2, and thereby control the activity of downstream inflammatory signaling pathways (5Lu L.

Moreover, P. gingivalis infection was closely associated with activation of SGK1 and multiple E3 ligases such as Nedd4-2 and Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1) (5Lu L. Yakoumatos L. Ren J.

Surprisingly, there are no studies about the possible activation of TRAF2/3 in P. gingivalis–induced inflammatory responses nor about whether SGK1 affects E3 activity of TRAF members, and thereby functions in the regulation of inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that SGK1 acts as a gatekeeper to restrain the inflammatory immune response in cultured cells and a P. gingivalis–induced periodontal bone loss model. Moreover, our mechanistic data identified that SGK1 inhibition enhances expression of c-Jun and phosphorylation of TRAF2, which in turn elevates the degradation of TRAF3, diminishes its suppressive effect on NF-κB, and ultimately aggravates P. gingivalis–mediated inflammatory immune responses. In addition, SGK1 inhibition aggravates P. gingivalis–induced periodontal inflammation in mice gingiva and exacerbates subsequent alveolar bone loss, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory signaling axis, SGK1–TRAF2/3–c-Jun/NF-κB, could be targeted for the development of novel interventional therapeutics to control periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases beyond the oral cavity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SGK1 promotes macrophage polarization to M2 and restrains secretion of TLR-mediated inflammatory cytokines (22Ren J. Han X. Lohner H. Liang R. Liang S.

P. gingivalis is a key pathogenic bacterium that triggers periodontitis and was associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (41Hajishengallis G. Chavakis T. Local and systemic mechanisms linking periodontal disease and inflammatory comorbidities.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 426-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Olsen I.

Modulation of inflammasome activity by Porphyromonas gingivalis in periodontitis and associated systemic diseases.J. Oral Microbiol. 2016; 8: 30385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine if SGK1 also functions in P. gingivalis–induced inflammation and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved, we first examined activation of SGK1 in response to the challenge of P. gingivalis in different innate cells. We found that P. gingivalis infection enhanced phosphorylation of SGK1 at serine 422 in human monocytes (Fig. 1, A and D), bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Fig. 1, B and E), and primary oral epithelial cells (Fig. 1, C and F) throughout all the time points measured (up to 24 h). In contrast, other oral bacteria including Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis failed to do so (Fig. 1, A and D). To further confirm if P. gingivalis activated SGK1, we next examined phosphorylation of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a bona fide substrate of SGK1 (44Murray J.T. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Auld G.C. Shpiro N. Marquez R. et al.Exploitation of KESTREL to identify NDRG family members as physiological substrates for SGK1 and GSK3.Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 45Schmid E. Xuan N.T. Zahir N. Russo A. Yang W. Kuhl D. et al.Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 sensitive NF-kappaB signaling in dendritic cells.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2014; 34: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Like the phosphorylation of SGK1, infection of P. gingivalis indeed elevated phosphorylation of NDRG1 at threonine 346/356/366 in all cells we investigated (Fig. 1). Moreover, the expression of total SGK1 and NDRG1 was not substantially changed in human monocytes or BMDM cells (Fig. S1) after culture for 24 h, which substantiated the effect of SGK1 inhibition on the phosphorylation of SGK1 and NDRG1. Taken together, these results demonstrated that infection with P. gingivalis activates SGK1 in innate cells. Since P. gingivalis infection activates SGK1 in innate immune cells, we next examined if SGK1 affects production of inflammatory cytokines in response to P. gingivalis challenge. Using EMD638683, a specific SGK1 inhibitor, we found that pretreatment with SGK1 inhibitor drastically decreased phosphorylation of NDRG1 in response to the challenge of P. gingivalis, indicating the inhibitory efficacy of EMD638683 on SGK1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, inhibition of SGK1 with EMD638683 significantly increased the secretion of TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 in human monocytes upon the challenge with P. gingivalis (Fig. 2B). We also examined the possible effect of SGK1 on the secretion of IL-10, a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, in P. gingivalis–stimulated monocytes. By using IC IL-10 staining and analysis with flow cytometry, we found that SGK1 inhibition significantly decreased IL-10 in P. gingivalis–stimulated human monocytes, represented by a decrease in positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, C–E), suggesting SGK1 may differentially regulate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. To exclude the possible unspecific effects of chemical inhibitor, we next utilized specific sgk1 siRNA to verify the effects of SGK1 on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. We found that silencing of SGK1 (Fig. 2F) significantly elevated the levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 production in P. gingivalis–stimulated human monocytes (Fig. 2G). Given the possible off-target effects of siRNA, we next utilized BMDMs from LysM-Cre+sgk1fl/fl mice, in which the expression of SGK1 was efficiently expunged (Fig. 2H), represented by the disappearance of p-NDRG1, to confirm the influences of SGK1 on P. gingivalis–induced inflammatory cytokines. We found that SGK1 deficiency significantly elevated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 (Fig. 2I), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) (Fig. 2J) in P. gingivalis–stimulated cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that inhibition of SGK1 promotes production of P. gingivalis–induced proinflammatory cytokines while concurrently decreasing IL-10 secretion in innate immune cells, suggesting SGK1 may act as a rheostat to restrain P. gingivalis–mediated inflammatory immune responses. Since we have demonstrated that SGK1 restrains P. gingivalis–mediated inflammatory responses, we next sought to delineate how SGK1 affects inflammatory responses in innate immune cells upon the challenge of P. gingivalis. As shown in Figure 3A, we found that SGK1 inhibition robustly promotes the activity of NF-κB, represented by the phosphorylation of NF-κB P65 at serine 536, in P. gingivalis–stimulated monocytes. Notably, SGK1 inhibition–mediated increases of p-NF-κB were more evident for the samples with prolonged treatment (Fig. 3A, right panel). The incapability of the SGK1 inhibitor at early stage of treatments like 30 min might result from the proteolytic effect of gingipain, which could directly cleave NF-κB P65 and thus decrease its phosphorylation level at the early treated period. The results were consolidated by SGK1-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 3B). However, we did not observe the substantial changes of other prototypical inflammatory signaling pathways including phosphorylation of P38 and extracellular signal–regulated kinases in monocytes pretreated with EMD638683 (Fig. 3C) or SGK1-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 3B). In addition, SGK1 inhibition or sgk1 gene deficiency drastically increased expression of c-Jun in P. gingivalis–stimulated human monocytes and BMDMs (Fig. 3, D and E). Given both NF-κB and c-Jun are key transcriptional factors that bind to the promoters of inflammatory cytokines, these results suggest that SGK1 inhibition–enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production in P. gingivalis–stimulated cells could arise from the increased NF-κB activity and c-Jun expression. Next we tested whether and how P. gingivalis–activated SGK1 affects TRAF2/3 in immune cells. As shown in Figure 4, A and B, SGK1 deficiency led to a drastic reduction of TRAF2 and TRAF3 in P. gingivalis–stimulated BMDMs, especially at 2 h postinfection. Since phosphorylation of TRAF2 is essential for degradation of TRAF3 and subsequently increased activity of NF-κB signaling (46Workman L.M. Zhang L. Fan Y. Zhang W. Habelhah H. TRAF2 ser-11 phosphorylation promotes cytosolic translocation of the CD40 complex to regulate downstream signaling pathways.Mol. Cell.

An association between physical performance and survival could further enhance the importance of physical performance. We aimed to assess the association between different measures of physical performance and survival in dialysis patients.117 patients on haemodialysis were included from December 2016 and followed up to September 2020. Muscle strength (quadriceps, handgrip strength, and sit-to-stand), exercise capacity (six-minute walking test, 6MWT) and the risk of falls (Dialysis Fall Index, Tinetti, and Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques) were measured at the time of inclusion. Hospitalisation, morbidity (Davies Stoke index) and death were recorded. Data were analysed by least squares linear regression models and competing risks survival hazard models.During the observation period (median 33, min 30 max 45 months), 45 patients died (= 38.5%), resulting in a mortality rate of 15% per year. Cardiovascular disease (42.9%) was the most common cause of death. All domains of physical performance were associated with mortality, with the highest hazards for an increased risk of falls (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 20.4, p = 0.003) and poor exercise capacity (HR = 7.4, p<0.001). A score lower than 298 meters (specificity = 0.583; sensitivity = 0.889) on the 6MWT was established as a haemodialysis-specific cut-off point for mortality risk. Each increase in 6MWT (m) corresponded with a 0.4% decrease in mortality risk (HR = 0.996, 95%CI [0.994; 0.998]). The 6MWT as also associated with comorbidity (F-value = 6.1, p = 0.015). Physical performance was not associated with hospitalisation.The 6MWT is associated with mortality in patients on haemodialysis and can be considered as a valid assessment tool to identify high-risk patients."

This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial resistance, the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes, and characterize the MLST genotypes of Salmonella serovar 4,[5],12:i:- isolates from Guizhou province, China. We collected 363 non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) isolates of Guizhou from 2013 to 2018. Biochemical identification, serogroups testing, and specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay were conducted to identify Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates. Isolates were determined the antimicrobial resistance by the micro broth dilution method, detected the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes by PCR, and examined the molecular genotyping by Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Eighty-seven Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates were detected, accounting for 23.9% (87/363) of the total NTS isolates. All Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates showed highly resistant to sulfaoxazole (93.1%), streptomycin (90.8%), ampicillin (88.5%), tetracycline (86.2%) and doxycycline (86.2%). A high proportion (94.2%) of multi-drug resistance (MDR) isolates were found. Most (83.9%) Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates carried four antimicrobial resistance genes, especially blaTEM-1, strA-strB, sul2, and tetB genes. Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates showed a high rate of invA, sseL, mgtC, siiE, sopB, gipA, gtgB, sspH1, and sspH2 (72.4%~98.9%). On the contrary, none of the isolates were detected the spvC and pefA genes. MLST analysis revealed three sequence types (STs), and ST34 (97.7%) was the dominant sequence type. This study is the first report of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- in humans from Guizhou province, China. The data might be useful for rational antimicrobial usage against Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- infections, risk management, and public health strategies in Guizhou."

The role of the Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA, in Ca2+ handling is pivotal, and its activity is regulated, inter alia, by interacting with distinct proteins. Herein, we give evidence that 4E binding protein (4E-BP) is a novel regulator of SERCA activity in Drosophila melanogaster during cardiac function. Flies over-expressing 4E-BP showed improved cardiac performance in young individuals associated with incremented SERCA activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that SERCA interacts with translation initiation factors eIF4E-1, eIF4E-2 and eIF4E-4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The specific identification of eIF4E-4 in cardiac tissue leads us to propose that the interaction of elF4E-4 with SERCA may be the basis of the cardiac effects observed in 4E-BP over-expressing flies associated with incremented SERCA activity."

However, there is a paucity of research directly asking Australian community members about their mental health experiences, and what they perceive to be the most important mental health issues in the context of the pandemic. This study utilises qualitative data from Alone Together , a longitudinal mixed-methods study investigating the effects of COVID-19 on mental health in an Australian community sample (N = 2,056). A total of 1,037 participants, ranging in sex (69.9% female), age (M = 40–49 years), state/territory of residence, and socioeconomic status, shared responses to two open-ended questions in the first follow up survey regarding their mental health experiences and priorities during COVID-19. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants described COVID-19 as primarily impacting their mental health through the disruption it posed to their social world and financial stability. A key concern for participants who reported having poor mental health was the existence of multiple competing barriers to accessing high quality mental health care. According to participant responses, the pandemic placed additional pressures on an already over-burdened mental health service system, leaving many without timely, appropriate support. Absent or stigmatising rhetoric around mental health, at both a political and community level, also prevented participants from seeking help. Insights gained from the present research provide opportunities for policymakers and health practitioners to draw on the expertise of Australians’ lived experience and address priority issues through targeted policy planning. This could ultimately support a more responsive, integrated, and effective mental health system, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."

We investigated the frequency of fire use, control and perceptions of fire regimes for selected livelihood and socio-cultural activities in six districts in the Guinea savanna of Ghana. The six districts were selected to have a good representation of fire prone areas in the region based on fire frequency data obtained from the CSIR Meraka Institute, South Africa. A multiple regression analysis showed that people's use of fire for the selected socio-cultural activities from district, occupation, gender, age and ethnic group significantly predicted fire use for the activities R2 = 0.043, F (5,498) = 5.43, p < 0.000. Age and occupation added significantly to the use of fire. The study revealed that the majority of respondents (83%) across the study districts used fire once a year for at least one of the following activities: land preparation, weed/pest control, burning postharvest stubble, bush clearing around homesteads, firebreaks, charcoal burning and hunting. The study also showed a higher frequency of fire use for land preparation for cropping than for the other activities. Less than a fifth of the respondents (17%) indicated that they do not use fire for any of the selected activities. The majority of respondents (65%) mentioned that they controlled their use of fire to prevent destruction to property or injuring humans. The study revealed a higher frequency of fire use in the dry season for land preparation for cropping. However, respondents rated season of burning as the most important attribute, with little attention to the other attributes of a fire regime, contrary to what is theoretically recognized. Understanding traditional fire use practices in terms of how to regulate the mix of frequency, intensity/severity, season, size and type of fire for these and other socio-cultural purposes could help to mitigate and/or manage bushfires in West African savannas and enhance savanna conservation and management. Hence, the need to better understand people's knowledge and perceptions of fire regimes in fire assisted socio-cultural practices in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4280651599,"Birds can assess nest predation risk and adjust their parental activity accordingly. Risk taking behavior should be related to investment in reproduction as well as to confidence in parenthood that often differ between sexes. In those cases, sexual differences in risk taking behavior may be expected. For example, in blue tits, females invest more time and energy than males in nest-building, egg laying and incubation. Furthermore, confidence in parenthood is supposed to be higher for females, as extrapair paternity is common in this species. Therefore, the reproductive value of nestlings may be higher for females than for males and the former may assume greater risks to ensure nestling growth and maximize their reproductive success. We examined potential sexual differences in the risk assumed by parents in relation to perceived risk of predation inside the nest cavity, where predation risk perception may be higher. We increased perceived predation risk by adding predator chemical cues inside blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nest-boxes, and we tested whether female and male parents differed in the risk assumed when taking care of nestlings. Females and males did not differ in the risk assumed in response to perceived predation risk. However, females reduced time devoted to nest sanitation activities when predator chemical cues were detected inside the nest-box, likely as an anti-predatory strategy to minimize their own risk of predation. Therefore, these results add to the evidence that birds can detect chemical cues of predators inside the nest cavity and suggest that the behavioral response to an increase in risk of predation perceived through olfactory cues is not sex-dependent in blue tit."

However, the dynamics of how the relationship of neighborhood context on health varies by individual socioeconomic status is less well understood.To examine the relationship between neighborhood context and mortality among older adults and examine how the influence of neighborhood context on mortality differs by individual socioeconomic status, using two measures of income-level and homeownership.A retrospective study of 362,609 Medicare Advantage respondents to the 2014-2015 Medicare Health Outcomes Survey aged 65 and older.Neighborhood context was defined using the deciles of the Area Deprivation Index. Logistic regression was used to analyze mortality with interaction terms between income/homeownership and neighborhood deciles to examine cross-level relationships, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, number of chronic conditions, obese/underweight, difficulties in activities of daily living, smoking status, and survey year. Predicted mortality rates by group were calculated from the logistic model results.Low-income individuals (8.9%) and nonhomeowners (9.1%) had higher mortality rates compared to higher-income individuals (5.3%) and homeowners (5.3%), respectively, and the differences were significant across all neighborhoods even after adjustment. With regression adjustment, older adults residing in less disadvantaged neighborhoods showed lower predicted 2-year mortality among high-income (4.86% in the least disadvantaged neighborhood; 6.06% in the most disadvantaged neighborhood; difference p-value<0.001) or homeowning individuals (4.73% in the least disadvantaged neighborhood; 6.25% in the most disadvantaged neighborhood; difference p-value<0.001).

Utilizing next-generation and long-read sequencing technologies, we assembled the whole chloroplast genome of I. dabieshanensis. The genome was 157,218 bp in length, exhibiting a typical quadripartite structure with a large single copy (LSC: 86,607 bp), a small single copy (SSC: 18,427 bp) and a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRA and IRB: each of 26,092 bp). A total of 121 predicted genes were encoded, including 113 distinctive (79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs) and 8 duplicated (8 protein-coding genes) located in the IR regions. Overall, 132 SSRs and 43 long repeats were detected and could be used as potential molecular markers. Comparative analyses of four traditional Ilex tea species (I. dabieshanensis, I. paraguariensis, I. latifolia and I. cornuta) revealed seven divergent regions: matK-rps16, trnS-psbZ, trnT-trnL, atpB-rbcL, petB-petD, rpl14-rpl16, and rpl32-trnL. These variations might be applicable for distinguishing different species within the genus Ilex. Phylogenetic reconstruction strongly suggested that I. dabieshanensis formed a sister clade to I. cornuta and also showed a close relationship to I. latifolia. The generated chloroplast genome information in our study is significant for Ilex tea germplasm identification, phylogeny and genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4280578683,"Surface determinants newly expressed by apoptotic cells that are involved in triggering potent immunosuppressive responses, referred to as ""innate apoptotic immunity (IAI)"" have not been characterized fully. It is widely assumed, often implicitly, that phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid normally cloistered in the inner leaflet of cells and externalized specifically during apoptosis, is involved in triggering IAI, just as it plays an essential role in the phagocytic recognition of apoptotic cells. It is notable, however, that the triggering of IAI in responder cells is not dependent on the engulfment of apoptotic cells by those responders. Contact between the responder and the apoptotic target, on the other hand, is necessary to elicit IAI. Previously, we demonstrated that exposure of protease-sensitive determinants on the apoptotic cell surface are essential for initiating IAI responses; exposed glycolytic enzyme molecules were implicated in particular. Here, we report our analysis of the involvement of externalized phosphatidylserine in triggering IAI. To analyze the role of phosphatidylserine, we employed a panel of target cells that either externalized phosphatidylserine constitutively, independently of apoptosis, or did not, as well as their WT parental cells that externalized the phospholipid in an apoptosis-dependent manner. We found that the externalization of phosphatidylserine, which can be fully uncoupled from apoptosis, is neither sufficient nor necessary to trigger the profound immunomodulatory effects of IAI. These results reinforce the view that apoptotic immunomodulation and phagocytosis are dissociable and further underscore the significance of protein determinants localized to the cell surface during apoptosis in triggering innate apoptotic immunity."

This concern is well justified, since needle-based biopsies gather tissue information limited to needle size. In this work, we show that molecular harvesting with electroporation, e-biopsy, could increase the sampled tissue volume in comparison to tissue sampling by a needle alone. Suggested by numerical models of electric fields distribution, the increased sampled volume is achieved by electroporation-driven permeabilization of cellular membranes in the tissue around the sampling needle. We show that proteomic profiles, sampled by e-biopsy from the brain tissue, ex vivo , at 0.5mm distance outside the visible margins of mice brain melanoma metastasis, have protein patterns similar to melanoma tumor center and different from the healthy brain tissue. In addition, we show that e-biopsy probed proteome signature differentiates between melanoma tumor center and healthy brain in mice.

This paper examines the pre-tournament predictions made using this model for the Euro 2020 football tournament. These predictions won the Royal Statistical Society’s prediction competition, demonstrating that even this simple model can produce high-quality results. Moreover, the paper also presents a range of novel analytic results which exactly quantify the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the equations for the model parameters. After deriving these results, it provides a novel examination of a potential problem with the model—the over-weighting of the results of weaker teams—and illustrates the effectiveness of ignoring results against the weakest opposition. It also compares the predictions with the actual results of Euro 2020, showing that they were extremely accurate in predicting the number of goals scored. Finally, it considers the choice of start date for the dataset, and illustrates that the choice made by the authors (which was to start the dataset just after the previous major international tournament) was close to optimal, at least in this case. The findings of this study give a better understanding of the mathematical behaviour of the double Poisson model and provide evidence for its effectiveness as a match prediction tool."
https://openalex.org/W4280488425,"Background Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) encodes numerous outer membrane proteins (OMPs), with considerable geographic heterogeneity and related to different clinical outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the distribution characteristics of five important OMP genes ( sabA , hofC , homA , homB and frpB-4 ) in different regions of China. Materials and method A total of 266 strains were isolated from 348 stomach biopsy specimens in Shandong, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan, and Qinghai provinces. The presence of sabA , hofC , homA , homB and frpB-4 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from H . pylori genomic DNA. Results Among the strains in five regions, the prevalence of frpB-4 was 100% and that of hofC was 97.7%. The prevalence of homB in the isolates from Qinghai (45.5%) was significantly lower than that in Shandong (75.3%), Guangxi (76.9%) and Hunan (69.6%) ( P &lt;0.05). The frequency of homA in Shandong (30.1%) was significantly lower than in Guangxi (57.7%) and Qinghai (63.6%) ( P &lt;0.05). The prevalence of the sabA gene in Shandong, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan and Qinghai provinces was 21.9%, 59.7%, 45.9%, 52.2%, and 18.2%, respectively ( P &lt;0.05). The sabA “on” status was significantly more frequent in isolates from Guangxi (46.8%), Heilongjiang (37.8%), and Hunan (47.8%) than Qinghai (3.0%) ( P &lt;0.05). The presence of homA and sabA genes may be negatively correlated with the development of gastritis. There was no significant association between the frpB-4 , hofC , homB gene and clinical outcomes. Conclusion The prevalence of homA , homB , and sabA genes and the sabA “on” or “off” status have significant geographical differences among five provinces in China. The presence of homA and sabA genes may be protective factors of gastritis."
https://openalex.org/W4280488693,"Background Open defecation is the disposal of human faeces in the fields, forests, bushes, and open bodies of water. It is practiced more in sub-Saharan African countries and is considered a sign of underdevelopment. Open defecation facilitates the transmission of pathogens that cause diarrheal diseases which is the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease. In Ethiopia, it kills half a million under-five children annually. Even though open defecation practice is a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in Ethiopia, there is minimal evidence on the trend, spatiotemporal distribution, wealth-related inequalities, and other determinates of open defecation practice. Objectives Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the trend, spatiotemporal distribution, and determinants of open defecation among households in Ethiopia. Methods Cross-sectionally collected secondary data analysis was conducted based on 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total weighted sample of 16,554 households was included. We assessed the 16 years (2000–2016) trend of open defecation with 95% confidence intervals. Data were weighted, recoded, cleaned, and analyzed using STATA version 14.2 software. A mixed-effect analysis was employed to identify factors contributing to open defecation practice in Ethiopia. In the final multivariable analysis, the associations between dependent and independent variables were presented using adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with a p-value of &lt;0.05. The concentration index was used to assess wealth-related inequalities, while spatial analysis was used to explore the spatial distribution and significant windows of open defecation practice. Results The trend of open defecation practice in Ethiopia was significantly decreased from 81.96% (95% CI: 81.08, 82.8) in 2000 EDHS, to 32.23% (95% CI: 31.16, 33.31) in 2016 EDHS. Individual-level factors such as; age, educational attainment, marital status, media exposure, wealth status, and source of drinking water, as well as community-level factors such as residence, region, community-level poverty, and community level media usage, had a significant association. Open defecation practice was significantly and disproportionately concentrated on the poor households [C = -0.669; 95% CI: -0.716, -0.622]. A non-random open defecation practice was observed in Ethiopia. Among the 11 regions, primary clusters were identified in only 3 regions (Afar, Somali, and Eastern Amhara) Conclusion Open defecation practice remains a public health problem irrespective of the significant decrease seen in Ethiopia for the past 16 years. Individual and community-level factors had a significant association with this problem. Since it is a leading cause of under-five children mortality and morbidity, the Ethiopian ministry of health should plan and work on basic sanitation programs that focus on the poorest communities, rural societies, and small peripheral regions. These programs should include regional planning for sanitation, and translation of materials into local languages to prevent under-five mortality and morbidity due to diarrheal diseases caused by open defecation."
https://openalex.org/W4280503035,"Since the 1960s, East African athletes, mainly from Kenya and Ethiopia, have dominated long-distance running events in both the male and female categories. Further demographic studies have shown that two ethnic groups are overrepresented among elite endurance runners in each of these countries: the Kalenjin, from Kenya, and the Oromo, from Ethiopia, raising the possibility that this dominance results from genetic or/and cultural factors. However, looking at the life history of these athletes or at loci previously associated with endurance athletic performance, no compelling explanation has emerged. Here, we used a population approach to identify peaks of genetic differentiation for these two ethnicities and compared the list of genes close to these regions with a list, manually curated by us, of genes that have been associated with traits possibly relevant to endurance running in GWAS studies, and found a significant enrichment in both populations (Kalenjin, P = 0.048, and Oromo, P = 1.6x10-5). Those traits are mainly related to anthropometry, circulatory and respiratory systems, energy metabolism, and calcium homeostasis. Our results reinforce the notion that endurance running is a systemic activity with a complex genetic architecture, and indicate new candidate genes for future studies. Finally, we argue that a deterministic relationship between genetics and sports must be avoided, as it is both scientifically incorrect and prone to reinforcing population (racial) stereotyping."
https://openalex.org/W4280522525,"Objectives To determine the perceptions of staff and resident physicians on the impact of implementation of a new team based multi-specialty resident night shift system. Methods An electronic survey was distributed anonymously to all resident physicians in the Core Internal Medicine residency program at the University of Alberta. A similar survey was distributed to staff physicians in the 4 specialties impacted by this new system: hematology, respirology, nephrology and gastroenterology. Results 74 physicians completed the survey. A majority of respondents (67%) indicated the new system was a positive change. Most shared it was better than traditional 1 in 4 call (65%), with resident physicians appreciating the team based nature of the system (65%), and just more than half of residents (55%) indicating this system improved their overall wellness. Most respondents (78%) did not feel the additional handover required had a negative impact. Respondents indicated daytime teaching and feedback improved as a result of this system (52%) with most others indicating it had no impact, although overnight feedback remained a challenge. Conclusion The implementation of this new team based system was well accepted by both staff and resident physicians across a number of domains. Future study is required to determine its impact on access and quality of care."
https://openalex.org/W4280528343,"Genetic purity is a prerequisite for exploiting the potential of hybrids in cross-pollinated crops, such as sunflower. In this regard DNA-based study was conducted using 110 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to check the genetic purity of 23 parents and their 60 hybrids in sunflower. The polymorphism was shown in 92 markers with value 83.63%. The SSR markers ORS-453 and CO-306 showed the highest PIC values of 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. The primer ORS-453 amplified allele size of 310 base pairs (bp) for female parent L6 and 320 bp for L11, while for male parents, T1 and T2 had allele size 350 bp and 340 bp, respectively. The hybrids from these parents showed a similar size of alleles with parents, including hybrids L6×T1 (310 bp and 350 bp), L6×T2 (310 bp and 340 bp), and L11×T2 (320 bp and 340 bp). Similarly, the primer CO-306 amplified allele size 350 bp and 330 bp for female parents L6 and L11, respectively, while, allele size 300 bp and 310 bp for male parents T1 and T2, respectively. The hybrids’ allele size was like the parents viz ., L6×T1 (350 bp and 300 bp), L6×T2 (350 bp and 310 bp), and L11×T2 (330 bp and 310 bp). All 60 hybrids and their 23 parents were grouped into three main clusters (A, B and C) based upon DARWIN v.6.0 and STRUCTURE v.2.3 Bayesian analyses using genotypic data. Further, each main cluster was divided into two sub-divisions. Each sub-division showed the relatedness of parents and their hybrids, thus authenticating the genetic purity of hybrids. In conclusion, this study provides useful for accurate and effective identification of hybrids, which will help to improve seed genetic purity testing globally."
https://openalex.org/W4280573215,"To study the association between the socioeconomic environment of area of residence and prevalence and characteristics of children with cerebral palsy (CP).Data on 8-year-old children with CP born in 2000-2011 (n = 252) were extracted from a regional population-based register in France. The European Deprivation Index (EDI), available at census block level, characterised socioeconomic deprivation in the child's area of residence at age of registration. The prevalence of CP was estimated in each group of census units defined by EDI distribution tertiles in the general population. The association between deprivation level and CP severity was assessed according to term/preterm status.CP prevalence differed between deprivation risk groups showing a J-shaped form with the prevalence in the most deprived tertile (T3) being the highest but not significantly different of the prevalence in the least deprived one (T1). However, the prevalence in the medium deprivation tertile (T2) was significantly lower than that in the most deprived one with a prevalence risk ratio (PRR) of: PRRT2/T3 = 0.63 95% CI [0.44-0.89]). Prevalences of CP with associated intellectual disability (ID) and CP with inability to walk were significantly higher in the most deprived tertile compared to the least deprived one (respectively PRRT3/T1 = 1.86 95% CI [1.19-2.92] and PRRT3/T1 = 1.90 95% CI [1.07-3.37]). Compared to children living in the least deprived areas, children with CP born preterm living in the most deprived areas had more severe forms of motor impairment, such as an inability to walk or a combination of an inability to walk and moderate to severe impairment of bimanual function. They also had more associated intellectual disability. No associations were observed among term-born children.A significant association between area deprivation group and CP severity was observed among preterm children but not among term-born children."
https://openalex.org/W4280580470,"We earlier reported that coating poorly water-soluble drugs with nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAP) improves bioavailability after oral administration. In the present study, we coated BCS Class IV drug acetazolamide (AZ) with nano-HAP (AZ/HAP formulation), and investigated its bioavailability and nano-HAP’s role in promoting it. We tested AZ bioavailability after a single oral dose of the AZ/HAP formulation in rats , followed by a series of in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo testing. The binding state of AZ and nano-HAP was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. AZ permeability was studied using a Caco-2 cell monolayer assay kit, to test for tight junction penetration, then using an Ussing chamber mounted with intestinal epithelium, both with and without Peyer’s patch tissue, to examine the role of intracellular transport. Fluorescence-labeled nano-HAP particles were administered orally in rats to investigate their localization in the intestinal tract. The area under the blood concentration time-curve in rats was about 4 times higher in the AZ/HAP formulation group than in the untreated AZ group. Gel filtration analysis showed AZ and nano-HAP were not bound. The Caco-2 study showed equivalent AZ permeability for both groups, but without significant change in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating that tight junctions were not penetrated. In the Ussing chamber study, no significant difference in AZ permeability between the two groups was observed for epithelium containing Peyer’s patch tissue, but for epithelium without Peyer’s patch tissue, at high concentration, significantly higher permeability in the AZ/HAP formulation group was observed. Fluorescent labeling showed nano-HAP particles were present in both intestinal villi and Peyer’s patch tissue 30 min after oral administration. Our results suggest that nano-HAP’s enhancement of drug permeability from the small intestine occurs not via tight junctions, but intracellularly, via the intestinal villi. Further study to elucidate the mechanism of this permeability enhancement is required."
https://openalex.org/W4280593813,"Gait asymmetry is present in several pathological populations, including those with Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and stroke survivors. Previous studies suggest that commonly used discrete symmetry metrics, which compare single bilateral variables, may not be equally sensitive to underlying effects of asymmetry, and the use of a metric with low sensitivity could result in unnecessarily low statistical power. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of commonly used discrete symmetry metrics to better inform design of future studies. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the statistical power of each symmetry metric at a range of asymmetry magnitudes, group/condition variabilities, and sample sizes. Power was estimated by repeated comparison of simulated symmetric and asymmetric data with a paired t-test, where the proportion of significant results is equivalent to the power. Simulation results confirmed that not all common discrete symmetry metrics are equally sensitive to reference effects of asymmetry. Multiple symmetry metrics exhibit equivalent sensitivities, but the most sensitive discrete symmetry metric in all cases is a bilateral difference (e.g. left—right). A ratio (e.g. left/right) has poor sensitivity when group/condition variability is not small, but a log-transformation produces increased sensitivity. Additionally, two metrics which included an absolute value in their definitions showed increased sensitivity when the absolute value was removed. Future studies should consider metric sensitivity when designing analyses to reduce the possibility of underpowered research."
https://openalex.org/W4280596789,"There is growing evidence that racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden from COVID-19. Temporal changes in the pandemic epidemiology and diversity in the clinical course require careful study to identify determinants of poor outcomes. We analyzed 6255 hospitalized individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from one of 5 hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 2020 and March 2021, using electronic health records to assess risk factors and outcomes through 8 weeks post-admission. Discharge, readmission and mortality outcomes were analyzed in a multi-state model with multivariable Cox models for each transition. Mortality varied markedly over time, with cumulative incidence (95% CI) 30 days post-admission of 19.1% (16.9, 21.3) in March-April 2020, 5.7% (4.2, 7.5) in July-October 2020 and 10.5% (9.1,12.0) in January-March 2021; 26% of deaths occurred after discharge. Average age (SD) at admission varied from 62.7 (17.6) to 54.8 (19.9) to 60.5 (18.1); mechanical ventilation use declined from 21.3% to 9–11%. Compared to Caucasian, Black race was associated with more severe disease at admission, higher rates of co-morbidities and residing in a low-income zip code. Between-race risk differences in mortality risk diminished in multivariable models; while admitting hospital, increasing age, admission early in the pandemic, and severe disease and low blood pressure at admission were associated with increased mortality hazard. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with fewer baseline co-morbidities and lower mortality hazard (0.57, 95% CI: 0.37, .087). Multi-state modeling allows for a unified framework to analyze multiple outcomes throughout the disease course. Morbidity and mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied over time but post-discharge mortality remained non-trivial. Black race was associated with more risk factors for morbidity and with treatment at hospitals with lower mortality. Multivariable models suggest there are not between-race differences in outcomes. Future work is needed to better understand the identified between-hospital differences in mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4280601347,"In humid and temperate areas, Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) is a major fungal disease of common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) in which grain yield is reduced when the pathogen, Parastagonospora nodorum , infects leaves and glumes during grain filling. Foliar SNB susceptibility may be associated with sensitivity to P . nodorum necrotrophic effectors (NEs). Both foliar and glume susceptibility are quantitative, and the underlying genetics are not understood in detail. We genetically mapped resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) to leaf and glume blotch using a double haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between the moderately susceptible cultivar AGS2033 and the resistant breeding line GA03185-12LE29. The population was evaluated for SNB resistance in the field in four successive years (2018–2021). We identified major heading date (HD) and plant height (PH) variants on chromosomes 2A and 2D, co-located with SNB escape mechanisms. Five QTL with small effects associated with adult plant resistance to SNB leaf and glume blotch were detected on 1A, 1B, and 6B linkage groups. These QTL explained a relatively small proportion of the total phenotypic variation, ranging from 5.6 to 11.8%. The small-effect QTL detected in this study did not overlap with QTL associated with morphological and developmental traits, and thus are sources of resistance to SNB."
https://openalex.org/W4280613099,"Background Chronic pain can lead to economic instability, decreased job productivity, and poor mental health. Therefore, reliable identification and quantification of chronic pain is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Objective To determine the psychometric properties of the Spanish language versions of the Pain Interference Index (PII) and the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPG) among a population of working adults who experienced injury in Santiago, Chile. Methods A total of 1,975 participants with work-related injuries were interviewed to collect sociodemographic, occupational, and chronic pain characteristics. Construct validity and factorial structure of the PII and SF-MPG were assessed through exploratory factor analyses (EFA). Cronbach’s alpha was used to evaluate internal consistency. Results The PII mean score was 3.84 ± 1.43 among all participants. The SF-MPG median score was 11 [IQR: 6–16] in this study population. Cronbach’s alpha for the PII was 0.90 and 0.87 for the SF-MP. EFA resulted in a one factor solution for the PII. A two-factor solution was found for the SF-MPG. The two-factors for SF-MPG were sensory and affective subscales with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82 and 0.714, respectively. When the two scales were combined, an EFA analysis confirmed the PII and SF-MPG measure different aspects of chronic pain. Conclusions The PII and SF-MPG had good construct validity and reliability for assessing different aspects of chronic pain among working Chilean adults."

https://openalex.org/W4280629974,"To identify difficulties in accessing health services by the elderly in the city of São Paulo/Brazil and the contributory factors that reflect inequalities. This is a cross-sectional study that used data from the Health, Well-being and Aging Study (SABE). The population is composed of elderly ≥ 60 years old, of both sexes, living in the urban area of São Paulo. For this analysis, we used data from the 2015 cohort of the SABE study, containing a sample of 1,221 individuals. The proportions of access difficulty and, through logistic regression, the associated factors were verified, based on Andersen's Behavioral Model, which considers factors of predisposition, enabling and need as individual determinants of access to health care. It was observed that 37.0% of the elderly reported difficulty accessing health services when they needed it. This difficulty was greatest among females (42.3%), aged 60 to 69 years (40.9%), black race/color (58.8%), illiterate (44.5%), single/separated/divorced (44.3%), with income slower than one salary minimum (46.8%), without health insurance (51.9%), with poor/very poor self-assessment of health (54.7%), with multimorbidity (40.1%), frail (47.2%) and among those who used polypharmacy (40.8%). After multivariate analysis, in the final model, there was a positive association between difficulty of access and predisposing factors (female gender, age group 60 to 69 years, black race/color, illiterate), enabling factors (possession of health insurance) and need factors (regular and poor/very poor self-assessment of health and pre-fragility and frailty condition). The presence of difficulty in access associated with predisposing, enabling and need factors reflect the existence of inequalities caused by barriers that point to weaknesses in the organization of services. The identification of these barriers that hinder access highlights important points that can have an impact on the equity and resolution of care."
https://openalex.org/W4280561051,"Configuring the network connections in industrial, power, and water networks to mimic the structural patterns of ecological food webs has been shown to improve the resilience of human networks. This work investigates the ability of food web inspiration to specifically guide the incorporation of renewable energy and water sources for resilience. Feasibility is tested using the water and electricity networks of the Texas A&amp;M University main campus, demonstrating the potential of university campus case studies as analogies for other multi-use networks, such as cities or industrial-commercial regions, due to the variety of functions met within the system boundaries. Ecological robustness, the unique and characteristic behavior of ecosystems to slightly favor redundancy over efficiency, is used to correlate the incorporation and supply-levels of solar power and rainwater collection in a realistic campus model with the overall resilience of the electricity and domestic water networks. Non-obviously, the results suggest that the ecologically-similar resilience is achieved when less than 100% of utilities come from renewable sources, indicating an important potential tradeoff between efforts to shift to 100% renewable sources and network resilience concerns."
https://openalex.org/W4280597714,"Weather is the most important driver of crop development. However, spatial variability in weather makes it hard to obtain reliable high resolution datasets across large areas. Most growers rely on data from a single station that can be up to 50km away to make decisions about irrigation, pest management and penology-associated cultural practices at the block level. In this regard, we hypothesize that kriging a large network of weather stations can improve thermal time data quality compared to using the closest station. This study aims to explore the spatial variability in California's Central Valley and what is the relationship between the density of weather stations used and the error in the measurement of temperature related metrics and derived models. For this purpose, we used temperature records from January 1st 2020 to March 1st 2021 collected by the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) and a system of 731 weather stations placed above the canopy of trees in commercial orchards (in-orchard). We observed large discrepancies (>300 GDDTb0) in thermal time accumulation between using an interpolation of all stations available and just using the closest CIMIS station. Our data suggests these differences are not systematic bias but true differences in mesoclimate. Similar results were observed for chill accumulation in areas especially prone to not meeting pistachio chill requirements where the discrepancies between using the site-specific in-orchard weather station network and not using them were up to 10 CP. The use of this high resolution network of weather stations revealed spatial patterns in grape, almond, pistachio and pests phenology not reported before. Whereas previous studies have been focused on predictions at the county or state or regional level, our data suggests that a finer resolution can result in major improvements in the quality of data crucial for crop decision making."

However, there is limited evidence of screening, and vaccination status of this subgroup. The aim of this study was to establish the predictors of screening and completion of the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. Methods A cross-sectional study using respondent driven sampling was used to enrol respondents from twelve out of fifty-seven informal settlements in Kampala city. Data were collected using an electronic structured questionnaire uploaded on the KoboCollect mobile application, and analysed using Stata version 14. A “modified” Poisson regression analysis was done to determine the predictors of screening while logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of completion of the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule. Results About 13.3% (102/768) and 2.7% (21/768) of the respondents had ever screened for Hepatitis B, and completed the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule respectively. Being female (aPR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.11–2.33), earning a monthly income &gt;USD 136 (aPR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.11–2.86); completion of the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule (aPR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.26–2.70); lack of awareness about the recommended Hepatitis B vaccine dose (aPR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.27–0.68); and the belief that the Hepatitis B vaccine is effective in preventing Hepatitis B infection (aPRR 3.67, 95% CI: 2.34–5.73) were associated with “ever screening” for Hepatitis B. Knowledge of the recommended Hepatitis B vaccine dose (aOR 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01–0.35); “ever screening” for hepatitis B (aOR 9.68, 95% CI: 2.17–43.16) and the belief that the hepatitis B vaccine is effective in preventing Hepatitis B infection (aOR 11.8, 95% CI: 1.13–110.14) were associated with completion of the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. Conclusions Our findings indicate a low prevalence of Hepatitis B screening and completion of the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule among young psychoactive substance users in informal settings. It is evident that lack of awareness about Hepatitis B is associated with the low screening and vaccination rates. We recommend creation of awareness of Hepatitis B among young people in urban informal settlements."
https://openalex.org/W4280622769,"High Duty Cycle (HDC) echolocating bats use high frequency echolocation pulses that are clutter resistant, but their high frequencies give them limited range. Despite their unique ability to reject background clutter while simultaneously detecting fluttering prey, the frequency of their echolocation pulses has a strong correlation with level of environmental clutter, lower frequency pulses of HDC bats being associated with more open environments. The Foraging Habitat Hypothesis (FHH) proposes that the ecological significance of these lower frequency pulses in HDC bats in open environments is that they allow longer prey detection distances. To test the FHH, we compared the frequencies, Source Levels (SLs) and detection distances of Rhinolophus capensis, a HDC bat that has been shown to vary its call frequency in relation to habitat structure. As a further test of the FHH we investigated the SLs and detection distances of Rhinolophus damarensis (a heterospecific species that occurs in the same open desert environment as R. capensis but echolocates at a higher dominant pulse frequency). In the open desert, R. capensis emitted both lower frequency and higher SL pulses giving them longer detection distances than R. capensis in the cluttered fynbos. SL contributed more to differences in detection distances in both R. capensis and R. damarensis than frequency. In a few instances, R. damarensis achieved similar detection distances to desert-inhabiting R. capensis by emitting much higher SLs despite their average SLs being lower. These results suggest that lower frequency echolocation pulses are not a prerequisite for open desert living but may increase detection distance while avoiding energetic costs required for high SLs."

The current adherence behavior toward short-term antibiotic regimens has never been investigated before in Jordan. This study assessed the prevalence and predictors of non-adherence to short-term antibiotics among Jordanians and investigated participants' views about different reasons related to antibiotics non-adherence. A cross-sectional face-to-face survey-based interview was conducted in three hospital pharmacies in Jordan. Adults and mother of children (≤12 years old) who completed their short course treatment (<30 day) of oral antibiotic within the last month were recruited. A total of 2000 participants (adults: 1000 and mothers of children: 1000) were included in the study with a response rate of 91.60%. The prevalence of non-adherence was estimated to be 32.10%. Non-adherent respondents scored a lower Medication Adherence Report Scale [16.76±5.02 vs. 23.04 ±3.24] than adherent respondents (p<0.001). Adults without comorbidity and children with higher number of doses per regimen were significantly less adherent to antibiotic [(OR = 0.615, 95%CI = 0.444-0.853, p = 0.004) and (OR = 0.965, 95%CI = 0.950-0.981, p<0.001)], respectively. Patients-related factors were the most common antibiotic non-adherence reason reported by the participants. The multivariate analysis for all the participants (adults and children), indicated that mothers were 2.6 times more likely to be adherent in giving antibiotics to their children than adults (p<0.001). These findings highlight that more than half of the participants were adherent to short-term antibiotics. However, improving the current prescription-related practices and implementing pharmaceutical consultation services upon antibiotic dispensing are encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W4280547450,"Two non-ionic reagents, polyethylene glycol 4000 and Tween-80, two anionic reagents, sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate and sodium lauryl sulfate, and a mixture of these non-ionic and anionic reagents were used as penetrants. The processes of replacement desorption and relief-pressure desorption of gas-containing coal were studied, the influence of the penetrant on the amount of gas replacement desorption and relief-pressure desorption was explored, and the change rule of the amounts of gas replacement desorption and relief-pressure desorption was analysed. The results show that the increase rate of the replacement desorption amount of the mixed penetrant is 11.81%-34.75%, and the decrease rate of the relief-pressure desorption amount is 51.68%-72.69%, which are higher values than those with a single penetrant. As the mass fraction of penetrant increases within the range of 0.5%~2%, the capacity of gas replacement desorption and hindering gas relief-pressure desorption will increase. At the same mass fraction, the effect of the mixed penetrant is better than that of the anionic penetrant, which in turn is better than that of the non-ionic penetrant."
https://openalex.org/W4280552681,"Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role in agricultural water resource management. Understanding regional agricultural water consumption characteristics can be improved by predicting ET using remote sensing. However, due to the lack of high-resolution images on clear-sky days or the limitation of ET reconstruction on cloudy-sky days, it remains challenging to continuously derive ET at the field scale. In this study, the Landsat and MODIS data were initially fused to obtain the Landsat-like vegetation index and land surface temperature on clear-sky days. Then the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was applied to calculate the daily ET during the clear-sky. A canopy resistance-based gap-filling method was involved in reconstructing regional ET on cloudy days while considering different environmental factors. The estimations were validated by automatic weather system data (AWS) and eddy covariance (EC) measurements in Guantao County. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme performed well in estimating cropland ET, with an RMSE of 0.86 mm·d −1 and an R 2 of 0.65, and the NSE and PBias were 0.61 and -0.29%, respectively. The crop water consumption analysis revealed that the daily ET of winter wheat peaked during the maturation stage. Nevertheless, summer maize water consumption peaked in the middle of the growing season in this area. The temperature during the early development stage and the soil moisture in the mid and late growth stages had the greatest impact on the ET of winter wheat. During the entire growing period, soil moisture had the largest effect on the ET of summer maize. The findings showed that the TSEB model can be effectively applied to field-scale water consumption monitoring in North China through MODIS and Landsat data fusion and ET temporal reconstruction considering environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W4280568398,"Fluorescence microscopy is a core method for visualizing and quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of complex biological processes. While many fluorescent microscopy techniques exist, due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility, widefield fluorescent imaging remains one of the most widely used. To accomplish imaging of 3D samples, conventional widefield fluorescence imaging entails acquiring a sequence of 2D images spaced along the z-dimension, typically called a z-stack. Oftentimes, the first step in an analysis pipeline is to project that 3D volume into a single 2D image because 3D image data can be cumbersome to manage and challenging to analyze and interpret. Furthermore, z-stack acquisition is often time-consuming, which consequently may induce photodamage to the biological sample; these are major barriers for workflows that require high-throughput, such as drug screening. As an alternative to z-stacks, axial sweep acquisition schemes have been proposed to circumvent these drawbacks and offer potential of 100-fold faster image acquisition for 3D-samples compared to z-stack acquisition. Unfortunately, these acquisition techniques generate low-quality 2D z-projected images that require restoration with unwieldy, computationally heavy algorithms before the images can be interrogated. We propose a novel workflow to combine axial z-sweep acquisition with deep learning-based image restoration, ultimately enabling high-throughput and high-quality imaging of complex 3D-samples using 2D projection images. To demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed workflow, we apply it to live-cell imaging of large 3D tumor spheroid cultures and find we can produce high-fidelity images appropriate for quantitative analysis. Therefore, we conclude that combining axial z-sweep image acquisition with deep learning-based image restoration enables high-throughput and high-quality fluorescence imaging of complex 3D biological samples."
https://openalex.org/W4280584642,"We introduce the statistical concept of ’compensatory selection’, which arises when selecting a subset of applicants based on multiple predictors, such as when standardized test scores are used in combination with other predictors required in a school application (e.g., previous grades, references letters, and personal statements). Post-hoc analyses often fail to find a positive correlation between test scores and subsequent success, and this failure is sometimes taken as evidence against the predictive validity of the standardized test. The present analysis reveals that the failure to find a negative correlation indicates that the standardized test is in fact a valid predictor of success. This is due to compensation between predictors during selection: Some students are admitted despite a low test score because their application is exceptional in other respects, while other students are admitted primarily based on a high test score despite weakness in the rest of their application. This compensatory selection process introduces a negative correlation between test scores and other predictors among those admitted (a ’collider bias’ or ’Berkson’s paradox’ effect). If test scores are valid predictors of success, this negative correlation between the predictors counteracts the positive correlation between test scores and success that would have been observed if all applicants were admitted. If test scores are not predictive of success, but were nevertheless used in a compensatory selection process, there would be a spurious negative correlation between test scores and success (i.e., an admitted student with a weak application except for a high test score would be unlikely to succeed). The selection effect that is described here is fundamentally different from the well-known ’restricted range’ problem and can powerfully alter results even in situations that accept most applicants."
https://openalex.org/W4280589298,"Bacillus cereus is a food contaminant with widely varying enterotoxic potential due to its virulence proteins. In this article, phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences from the whole-genomes of 41 strains, evolutionary distance calculation of the amino acid sequences of the virulence genes, and functional and structural predictions of the virulence proteins were performed to reveal the taxonomically diverse distribution of virulence factors. The genome evolution of the strains showed a clustering trend based on the protein-coding virulence genes. The strains of B. cereus have evolved into non-toxic risk and toxic risk clusters with medium-high- and medium-low-risk subclusters. The evolutionary transfer distances of incomplete virulence genes relative to housekeeping genes were greater than those of complete virulence genes, and the distance values of HblACD were higher than those of nheABC and CytK among the complete virulence genes. Cytoplasmic localization was impossible for all the virulence proteins, and NheB, NheC, Hbl-B, and Hbl-L1 were predicted to be extracellular. Nhe and Hbl proteins except CytK had similar spatial structures. The predicted structures of Nhe and Hbl mainly showed 'head' and 'tail' domains. The 'head' of NheA and Hbl-B, including two α-helices separated by β-tongue strands, might play a special role in the formation of Nhe trimers and Hbl trimers, respectively. The 'cap' of CytK, which includes two 'latches' with many β-sheets, formed a β-barrel structure with pores, and a 'rim' balanced the structure. The evolution of B. cereus strains showed a clustering tendency based on the protein-coding virulence genes, and the complete virulence-gene operon combination had higher relative genetic stability. The beta-tongue or latch associated with β-sheet folding might play an important role in the binding of virulence structures and pore-forming toxins in B. cereus."
https://openalex.org/W4280638364,"Decline of ovarian function in menopausal women increases metabolic disease risk. Curcuma comosa extract and its major compound, (3R)-1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)-4,6-heptadien-3-ol (DPHD), improved estrogen-deficient ovariectomized (OVX) rat metabolic disturbances. However, information on their effects on metabolites is limited. Here, we investigated the impacts of C. comosa ethanol extract and DPHD on 12-week-old OVX rat metabolic disturbances, emphasizing the less hydrophobic metabolites. Metabolomics analysis of OVX rat serum showed a marked increase compared to sham-operated rat (SHAM) in levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs), particularly lysoPC (18:0) and lysoPC (16:0), and of arachidonic acid (AA), metabolites associated with inflammation. OVX rat elevated lysoPCs and AA levels reverted to SHAM levels following treatments with C. comosa ethanol extract and DPHD. Overall, our studies demonstrate the effect of C. comosa extract in ameliorating the metabolic disturbances caused by ovariectomy, and the elevated levels of bioactive lipid metabolites, lysoPCs and AA, may serve as potential biomarkers of menopausal metabolic disturbances."
