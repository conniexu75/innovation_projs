https://openalex.org/W4306880076,"Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)1—a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The increasing prevalence of IBD in industrialized countries and the augmented disease risk observed in migrants who move into areas of higher disease prevalence suggest that environmental factors are also important determinants of IBD susceptibility and severity2. However, the identification of environmental factors relevant to IBD and the mechanisms by which they influence disease has been hampered by the lack of platforms for their systematic investigation. Here we describe an integrated systems approach, combining publicly available databases, zebrafish chemical screens, machine learning and mouse preclinical models to identify environmental factors that control intestinal inflammation. This approach established that the herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine. Moreover, we show that an AHR–NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling axis operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation, and is targeted by propyzamide. In conclusion, we developed a pipeline for the identification of environmental factors and mechanisms of pathogenesis in IBD and, potentially, other inflammatory diseases. The herbicide propyzamide increases inflammation in the small and large intestine, and the AHR–NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling axis—which operates in T cells and dendritic cells to promote intestinal inflammation—is targeted by propyzamide."
https://openalex.org/W4306888850,"Reading and writing are crucial life skills but roughly one in ten children are affected by dyslexia, which can persist into adulthood. Family studies of dyslexia suggest heritability up to 70%, yet few convincing genetic markers have been found. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of 51,800 adults self-reporting a dyslexia diagnosis and 1,087,070 controls and identified 42 independent genome-wide significant loci: 15 in genes linked to cognitive ability/educational attainment, and 27 new and potentially more specific to dyslexia. We validated 23 loci (13 new) in independent cohorts of Chinese and European ancestry. Genetic etiology of dyslexia was similar between sexes, and genetic covariance with many traits was found, including ambidexterity, but not neuroanatomical measures of language-related circuitry. Dyslexia polygenic scores explained up to 6% of variance in reading traits, and might in future contribute to earlier identification and remediation of dyslexia."

https://openalex.org/W4306923158,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following severe trauma, but the extent to which genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to individual clinical outcomes is unknown. Here, we compared transcriptional responses to hydrocortisone exposure in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from combat veterans with PTSD (n = 19 hiPSC and n = 20 PBMC donors) and controls (n = 20 hiPSC and n = 20 PBMC donors). In neurons only, we observed diagnosis-specific glucocorticoid-induced changes in gene expression corresponding with PTSD-specific transcriptomic patterns found in human postmortem brains. We observed glucocorticoid hypersensitivity in PTSD neurons, and identified genes that contribute to this PTSD-dependent glucocorticoid response. We find evidence of a coregulated network of transcription factors that mediates glucocorticoid hyper-responsivity in PTSD. These findings suggest that induced neurons represent a platform for examining the molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD, identifying biomarkers of stress response, and conducting drug screening to identify new therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4307009068,"Since the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, modeling the related factors became mandatory, requiring new families of statistical distributions to be formulated. In the present paper we are interested in modeling the vaccination rate in some African countries. The recorded data in these countries show less vaccination rate, which will affect the spread of new active cases and will increase the mortality rate. A new extension of the inverted Nadarajah-Haghighi distribution is considered, which has four parameters and is obtained by combining the inverted Nadarajah-Haghighi distribution and the odd Lomax-G family. The proposed distribution is called the odd Lomax inverted Nadarajah-Haghighi (OLINH) distribution. This distribution owns many virtuous characteristics and attractive statistical properties, such as, the simple linear representation of density function, the flexibility of the hazard rate curve and the odd ratio of failure, in addition to other properties related to quantile, the rth-moment, moment generating function, Rényi entropy, and the function of ordered statistics. In this paper we address the problem of parameter estimation from frequentest and Bayesian approach, accordingly a comparison between the performance of the two estimation methods is implemented using simulation analysis and some numerical techniques. Finally different goodness of fit measures are used for modeling the COVID-19 vaccination rate, which proves the suitability of the OLINH distribution over other competitive distributions."
https://openalex.org/W4307002391,"Skin rash is a well-known predictive marker of the response to cetuximab (Cmab) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the mechanism of skin rash development is not well understood. Following exposure to EGFR-targeted therapies, changes in IL-8 levels have been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between skin rash and inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-8. Between 2014 and 2017, we prospectively enrolled 38 mCRC patients who underwent chemotherapy with either Cmab or bevacizumab (Bmab) at two hospitals. We performed multiplex cytokine ELISA with 20 inflammatory cytokines including E-selectin, GM-CSF, IFN-alpha, IFN-γ, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, P-selectin, sICAM-1, and TNF-alpha at baseline before cycle 1, 24 h after cycle 1, before cycle 2 (= 14 d), and before cycle 3 (= 28 d). Cytokine levels were compared using ANOVA after log-transformation. IL-8 genotypes in 30 patients treated with Cmab were determined using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Depending on the RAS mutational status, 30 and eight patients were treated with Cmab and Bmab-based chemotherapy, respectively. Skin rash developed in 23 (76.6%) of the 30 patients treated with Cmab plus FOLFIRI, after cycle 1. Only the mean log-transformed serum IL-8 level in patients with skin toxicity was statistically lower (2.83 ± 0.15) than in patients who did not experience skin toxicity (3.65 ± 0.27) and received Bmab (3.10 ± 0.26) (ANOVA test, p value = 0.0341). In addition, IL-8 polymorphism did not affect IL-8 levels, skin toxicity, or tumor response in Cmab treated patients. This study suggests that the inflammatory cytokine levels might be affected by Cmab exposure and are associated with the development of skin rash in mCRC patients. Further studies are warranted to evaluate this interaction in Cmab treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W4307002784,"Background Peer reviewed data describing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant symptoms and clinical outcomes as compared to prior surges in the United States is thus far limited. We sought to determine disease severity, presenting features, and epidemiologic factors of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant compared to prior surges. Methods Retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients admitted during five surges in Louisiana between March 2020 and January 2022. Patient data was pulled from the medical record and a subset of patients during Surge 5 were manually abstracted. Patients who were admitted to one of six Louisiana hospitals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the 5 defined surge periods were included. Surges were compared using chi-squared tests and one way ANOVA for age, sex, vaccination status, length of stay, ICU status, ventilation requirement, and disposition at discharge. The records of patients admitted during the omicron surge were analyzed for presenting symptoms and incidental SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Results With each subsequent surge, a smaller proportion of patients presenting to the emergency department were admitted. Patients admitted during surge 5 had shorter lengths of stay and fewer comorbidities than prior surges. Fewer patients in surge 5 presented with a respiratory condition and fewer required ICU admission. In surges 4 and 5, fewer vaccinated patients were admitted compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. Overall mortality was lower in surge 5 (9%) than in surge 4 (15%) p &lt; .0005. Of the SARS-Cov-2 admissions in surge 5, 22.3% were felt to be incidental diagnoses. Conclusions As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, a younger and less vaccinated population was associated with higher risk for severe disease, fewer patients required ICU admission and overall mortality decreased. Vaccinations seemed to be protective for overall risk of hospitalization but once admitted did not seem to confer additional protection against severe illness during the omicron surge. Age also contributed to patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4307009044,"Primary care services are essential in achieving universal health coverage and Malaysia is looking into public-private partnership to overcome resource constraints. The study aims to compare the performance of primary care service delivery dimensions between public and private sector.This cross-sectional study used the data from the Malaysian International Quality and Costs of Primary Care (QUALICOPC) study conducted in 2015-2016. The relative performance of each sector in four dimensions was compared using multi-level linear regression by incorporating a dummy variable indicating public sector in the model.The public sector was shown to have higher performance in comprehensiveness and coordination, while the private sector was better in continuity. There was no significant difference in accessibility. The public primary care services were better in serving primary care sensitive conditions, better informational continuity, and with better skill-mix and inter- and intra- professional relationship. Meanwhile, the private sector was stronger in referral decision making process, specialist feedback and greater out of hours facilities access.The public and private sectors differ in their strengths, which the government may tap into to strengthen primary care services. Other areas for improvement include seamless care strategies that promote good referral, feedback, and information continuity."
https://openalex.org/W4306888870,"Obesity is a global pandemic that is causally linked to many life-threatening diseases. Apart from some rare genetic conditions, the biological drivers of overeating and reduced activity are unclear. Here, we show that neurotensin-expressing neurons in the mouse interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC), a nucleus of the central extended amygdala, encode dietary preference for unhealthy energy-dense foods. Optogenetic activation of IPACNts neurons promotes obesogenic behaviors, such as hedonic eating, and modulates food preference. Conversely, acute inhibition of IPACNts neurons reduces feeding and decreases hedonic eating. Chronic inactivation of IPACNts neurons recapitulates these effects, reduces preference for sweet, non-caloric tastants and, furthermore, enhances locomotion and energy expenditure; as a result, mice display long-term weight loss and improved metabolic health and are protected from obesity. Thus, the activity of a single neuronal population bidirectionally regulates energy homeostasis. Our findings could lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4307002335,"Background Screening questionnaires are not sufficient to improve diagnostic quality of depression in primary care. The additional consideration of the general practitioner’s (GP’s) assessment could improve the accuracy of depression diagnosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether the GP rating supports a reliable depression diagnosis indicated by the PHQ-9 over a period of three months. Methods We performed a secondary data analysis from a previous study. PHQ-9 scores of primary care patients were collected at the time of recruitment (t1) and during a follow-up 3 months later (t2). At t1 GPs independently made a subjective assessment whether they considered the patient depressive (yes/no). Two corresponding groups with concordant and discordant PHQ-9 and GP ratings at t1 were defined. Reliability of the PHQ-9 results at t1 and t2 was assessed within these groups and within the entire sample by Cohen’s Kappa, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. Results 364 consecutive patients from 12 practices in the region of Upper Bavaria/Germany participated in this longitudinal study. 279 patients (76.6%) sent back the questionnaire at t2. Concordance of GP rating and PHQ-9 at t1 led to higher replicability of PHQ-9 results between t1 and t2. The reliability of PHQ-9 was higher in the concordant subgroup (κ = 0.507) compared to the discordant subgroup (κ = 0.211) (p = 0.064). The Bland-Altman Plot showed that the deviation of PHQ-9 scores at t1 and t2 decreased by about 15% in the concordant subgroup. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between PHQ-9 scores at t1 and t2 increased significantly if the GP rating was concordant with the PHQ-9 at t1 (r = 0.671) compared to the discordant subgroup (r = 0.462) (p = 0.044). Conclusions The combination of PHQ-9 and GP rating might improve diagnostic decision making regarding depression in general practices. PHQ-9 positive results might be more reliable and accurate, when a concordant GP rating is considered."
https://openalex.org/W4307002379,"Gait speed modulation, including abruptly decreasing or increasing gait speed, is a challenging task and prerequisite for safe mobility in the community. Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) exhibit gait deficits under challenging walking conditions which may increase their risk of falls. The purpose of this study was to investigate spatiotemporal variability during slow and fast speed transitions in older adults with and without MCI. Twenty-five older adults with MCI (mean age = 68.56 ± 3.79 years) and 25 cognitively intact controls (mean age = 68.72 ± 4.67 years) participated. Gait performance during gait speed transitions was measured in two walking conditions: 1) a slow to fast speed transition in response to a randomly presented cue, and 2) a fast to slow speed condition in response to a randomly presented cue. Means and variability of spatiotemporal parameters during the transitions were measured and mixed model repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess interaction and main effects. The older adults with MCI exhibited greater variability of step length (MCI = 13.93 ± 5.38, Control = 11.12 ± 3.15, p = 0.03) and swing time (MCI = 13.35 ± 6.01, Control = 10.43 ± 2.87, p = 0.03) than the controls during the fast to slow speed transitions. No other between-group differences were evident for the gait parameters across the two walking conditions. The findings suggest that older adults with MCI have reduced ability to adapt their gait during transitions from fast to slow walking speeds. This impairment may indicate a decline in automated regular rhythmic gait control and explain in part why this group is at increased risk of falls. Slow speed transition task might be incorporated as a fall risk screening in older adults with MCI."
https://openalex.org/W4307002951,"Thermophilic Campylobacter species are common cause of animal and human bacterial diseases with growing resistance to antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Campylobacter species from bovine, knives and personnel in Jimma Town, Ethiopia. Faecal samples and carcasses swabs were collected from cattle systematically selected from the annual plan of Jimma Municipal Abattoir. Personnel hand and knife swabs were collected after slaughtering each selected cattle. A cross-sectional study with systematic sampling method was conducted from October 2019 to September 2020 for the isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of thermophilic Campylobacter species. Isolation and identification of Campylobacter species were performed according to the techniques recommended by the International Organization for Standardization, and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing was screened using the standard agar disc diffusion method as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institutions. A total of 684 samples (171 samples from faeces, carcasses, knives and personnel hands, were collected independently). The overall prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacterspecies was 5.6% (38/684). Majority of the isolates were from faecal samples (12.9%, n = 22) followed by carcass swabs(4.1% n = 7), knife swabs(3.5% n = 6) and personnel hand swabs(1.8% n = 3). Isolated and identified species of C.jejuni, C. coli and C. lari accounted for 63.2%, 23.7% and 13.2%, respectively. The isolated Campylobacter species were found to be resistant to Cephalothin (100%), Ampicillin (60.5%), Cefotaxime (60.5%), Chloramphenicol (47.4%) and Tetracycline (42.1%). On the other hand, the isolates were susceptible to Nalidixic acid (86.8%), Ciprofloxacin (86.8%), Sulphamethazole (84.2%), Ceftriaxone (78.9%), Clindamycin (68.4%) and Cefixime (65.8%). 84.2% of the isolates showed multi-drug resistance for three-to-six drug classes. All the C. lari isolates were multidrug resistant. All the three isolated species of Campylobacter were resistant to Cephalothin, and most were multidrug resistant. Isolation of Campylobacter species from faecal, carcass, knife and hand swabs revealed possible risk of contamination and exposure to Campylobacter infection of those who consume raw meat. Therefore, enactment of hygienic practices during the slaughtering process, proper handling and cooking of meat and awareness creation on jurisdictional antibiotic usage are required to avoid Campylobacter infection."
https://openalex.org/W4307009040,"Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) are highly prevalent in the sexually active populations, with a significant burden in terms of health and psychological cost in all class ages. High-risk (HR) HPV genotypes are associated with anogenital dysplasia and cancers, and anal HPV-induced cancer is increasingly observed in women. The interactions of HPV genotype's between the anus and the cervix, and the subsequent occurrence of dysplasia remains unclear. This clinical study set out to test the hypothesis that risk factors for anal HR-HPV and dysplasia may differ in women with or without cervical dysplasia or in HIV-positive women.Cervical and anal HPV genotypes and cytology testing will be performed prospectively in a cohort of women recruited in a tertiary university hospital in Switzerland. Women will be allocated to three groups: 1) normal previous cervical smear; 2) high-grade cervical dysplasia (H-SIL) at previous cervical smear; 3) HIV+, independently of previous cervical smear result. General inclusion criteria comprised the followings: Female-Age > = 18 years; Satisfactory understanding of French; No objection to HIV testing. Specific inclusion criteria are: Group 1, no past or current gynecological dysplasia and HIV negative; Group 2, Gynecological dysplasia (H-SIL) or carcinoma in situ demonstrated by histology (vulvar, vaginal or cervical) and HIV negative; Group 3: HIV-positive (regardless of viremia or CD4 count) with or without gynecological dysplasia. General exclusion criteria are: Pregnancy; History of anal dysplasia/cancer; Status after pelvic radiotherapy; Absence of anus and anal canal. Estimated prevalences of anal dysplasia are: in group 1, 1% (0-2%); in group 2, 15% (5-27%), and in group 3, 30% (19-45%). With a 10% margin error, a sample size of 120 women per group is required to reach 90% power for detecting statistical significance (unilateral α error of 5%).The primary endpoint is the prevalence of anal and cervical dysplasia, and description of the respective HPV genotypes in each group. The results of this study could improve the standard of screening of cervical and anal dysplasia in women through evidence of concomitant presence of HPV's and/or dysplasia in anus or cervix to support vaccination for instance. Beginning of recruitment started in September 2016. Results should be presented in end of 2022. Preliminary analysis for first 100 patients reveals that the mean age of the population is 39.6 (± 10.9) years with mean age of first sexual intercourse of 18.5 (± 3.9) years. In this cohort, 12% are vaccinated and 38% having had anal intercourse. Overall, 43% of the studied population had cervical HR-HPV in the studied population, and 53% had normal cytology. Anal LR HPV and HR HP were found in 27.6% and 38.4% of all patients respectively. Eighty percent had normal anal cytology. Groups 1,2 and 3 had a significant difference in terms of age, gestity, parity, age of first sexual intercourse, systematic use of condom, number of cervical LR HPV and HR HPV and abnormal cervical cytologies.The study was approved by the institutional review board-CER-VD#2015-00200-on the 29th of June 2016 and is registered on the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal (SNCTP), SNCTP000002567, Registered 29 June 2016, https://www.kofam.ch/en/snctp-portal/study/40742/."
https://openalex.org/W4307009048,"Extensive research has framed vaccine hesitancy as a property of a heterogeneous group of individuals, ranging from total acceptance to complete refusal. Nevertheless, not much research has explored this heterogeneity, mainly focusing on central tendencies of single belief-related items. Using data from an original survey on a sample of Italian citizens, this paper examines this heterogeneity, exploiting individuals' cognitive variation to map clusters of individuals who share similar cognitive schemas on vaccine uptake. The results showed the existence three groups, characterized by a different articulation of predictors of vaccine hesitancy, revealing different understandings of vaccine uptake. We then analyzed within-cluster characteristics and showed that cognitive segmentation was connected to different levels of perceived risk, confidence, and support for vaccination. We further showed that cognitive clustering also entailed a mean of social stratification that was correlated with individuals' educational levels, and that the predictors of vaccine hesitancy were articulated differently in each group. This study, adopting a recent perspective in the analysis of systems of beliefs, moves one step further in disentangling the complexity of vaccine acceptance. Results suggested the usefulness of including individuals' cognitive characteristics in vaccine hesitancy research and in the development of interventions addressed at increasing vaccine acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W4307009054,"This paper proposes that laser cutting has potential as a viable alternative to stamping for mass manufacture of thin steel components such as stator and rotor components in the electric automotive sector. Current laser cutting processes are much less efficient than stamping. However, laser cutting is much more flexible and is used for small batches and one-off production. This paper assesses the potential of performing laser cutting operations of multiple sheets or layers simultaneously. This method is referred to herein as polystromata cutting. A numerical model is used to assess the manufacturing performance of stamping, traditional laser cutting and polystromata laser cutting. Polystromata laser cutting is shown to be capable of producing parts at 37% less cost than stamping. However, polystromata remains slower than stamping, taking 79% more time to produce each stator stack. Through this research it has been identified that optimisation of polystromata processes is more complex and performance efficiency varies wildly dependent on manufacturing set-up. This work aims to provide a best practice optimisation methodology for polystromata laser cutting by assessing results using different manufacturing objectives."
https://openalex.org/W4307036179,"Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is responsible for multiple ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vascular occlusive diseases. Increased vascular permeability contributes to vasogenic edema and tissue damage, with consequent adverse effects on vision. Herein, we found that endothelial CYP2J2 overexpression maintained BRB integrity after ischemia-reperfusion injury and consequently protected against retinal ganglion cell loss. Oxidative stress repressed endothelial ANXA1 expression in vivo and in vitro. CYP2J2 upregulated methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) expression and hence promoted ANXA1 translation via ANXA1 m6 A modification in endothelium under oxidative stress. CYP2J2 maintained the distribution of endothelial tight junctions and adherens junctions in an ANXA1-dependent manner. Endothelial ANXA1 plays an indispensable role in vascular homeostasis and stabilization during development. Endothelial ANXA1 deletion disrupted retinal vascular perfusion as well as BRB integrity. CYP2J2 metabolites restored BRB integrity in the presence of ANXA1. Our findings identified the CYP2J2-METTL3-ANXA1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for relieving BRB impairments."
https://openalex.org/W4307002336,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a major cause of central visual deterioration in retinitis pigmentosa. The exact reason for CME and its prognostic significance in this patient population is unknown. We seek to find clues to answer these questions by examining the anatomical correlations between retinal cysts and retinal morphometric parameters in a cohort of patients with retinitis pigmentosa and CME. For this reason, 103 patients (196 eyes) with untreated cystoid macular edema (CME) were identified from a pool of 578 genotyped patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Image analyses were conducted using three central horizontal OCT scans of these patients to calculate cross-sectional areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer, outer retinal, inner retinal, cysts, and total retinal areas. Lengths of the ellipsoid zone and outer limiting membrane were also measured. Best-fit curves were derived for analyzing the factors playing a role in the size of the retinal cysts and the patients' visual acuity. Generalized Estimating Equation and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlations between visual acuity, morphometric and clinical data, and the significant cyst size and visual acuity determinants. Twenty-five percent of the screened patients (103/578) had CME. Patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa had the highest incidence of CME (43.6%, p<0.001) but also had the best visual acuity (20/34±20/30, p = 0.02). The total cyst area was 0.14±0.18 mm2. Outer retinal area (B = 0.214; p = 0.008), age (B = -0.003; p<0.001) and retinal nerve fiber area (B = 0.411; p = 0.005) were main determinants of the (r = 0.44; p<0.001) cyst size. Cysts resolved with progressing retinal degeneration. Length of the intact ellipsoid zone (B = -5.16E-5; p<0.001), the inheritance pattern (B = 0.04; p = 0.028) and retinal nerve fiber area (B = 0.751; p<0.001) were the main determinants of visual acuity. In patients with retinitis pigmentosa and cystoid macular edema, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness is associated with decreasing visual acuity and cyst size. This finding suggests that intraretinal cysts may compress retinal axons and cause subsequent visual loss in retinitis pigmentosa."
https://openalex.org/W4307002340,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive ability for lung cancer of symptoms reported in an adaptive e-questionnaire, separately for never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers.Consecutive patients referred for suspected lung cancer were recruited between September 2014 and November 2015 from the lung clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. A total of 504 patients were later diagnosed with lung cancer (n = 310) or no cancer (n = 194). All participants answered an adaptive e-questionnaire with a maximum of 342 items, covering background variables and symptoms/sensations suspected to be associated with lung cancer. Stochastic gradient boosting, stratified on smoking status, was used to train and test a model for predicting the presence of lung cancer.Among never smokers, 17 predictors contributed to predicting lung cancer with 82% of the patients being correctly classified, compared with 26 predictors with an accuracy of 77% among current smokers and 36 predictors with an accuracy of 63% among former smokers. Age, sex, and education level were the most important predictors in all models.Methods or tools to assess the likelihood of lung cancer based on smoking status and to prioritize investigative and treatment measures among all patients seeking care with diffuse symptoms are much needed. Our study presents risk assessment models for patients with different smoking status that may be developed into clinical risk assessment tools that can help clinicians in assessing a patient's risk of having lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4307002346,"Central Asia is positioned at a crossroads linking several zones important to hominin dispersal during the Middle Pleistocene. However, the scarcity of stratified and dated archaeological material and paleoclimate records makes it difficult to understand dispersal and occupation dynamics during this time period, especially in arid zones. Here we compile and analyze paleoclimatic and archaeological data from Pleistocene Central Asia, including examination of a new layer-counted speleothem-based multiproxy record of hydrological changes in southern Uzbekistan at the end of MIS 11. Our findings indicate that Lower Palaeolithic sites in the steppe, semi-arid, and desert zones of Central Asia may have served as key areas for the dispersal of hominins into Eurasia during the Middle Pleistocene. In agreement with previous studies, we find that bifaces occur across these zones at higher latitudes and in lower altitudes relative to the other Paleolithic assemblages. We argue that arid Central Asia would have been intermittently habitable during the Middle Pleistocene when long warm interglacial phases coincided with periods when the Caspian Sea was experiencing consistently high water levels, resulting in greater moisture availability and more temperate conditions in otherwise arid regions. During periodic intervals in the Middle Pleistocene, the local environment of arid Central Asia was likely a favorable habitat for paleolithic hominins and was frequented by Lower Paleolithic toolmakers producing bifaces."
https://openalex.org/W4307002350,"Respectful maternity care (RMC) is believed to improve women’s childbirth experience and increase health facility delivery. Unfortunately, few women in low- and middle-income countries experience RMC. Patient surveys and independent observations have been used to evaluate RMC, though seldom together. In this study, we assessed RMC received by women using two methodologies and evaluated the associated factors of RMC received. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in nine public health facilities in Ibadan, a large metropolis in Nigeria. We selected 269 pregnant women by cluster sampling. External clinical observers observed them during childbirth using the 29-item Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program RMC observational checklist. The same women were interviewed postpartum using the 15-item RMC scale for self-reported RMC. We analysed total RMC scores and RMC sub-category scores for each tool. All scores were converted to a percentage of the maximum possible to facilitate comparison. Correlation and agreement between the observed and reported RMC scores were determined using Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman analysis respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with observed RMC. No woman received 100% of the observed RMC items. Self-reported RMC scores were much higher than those observed. The two measures were weakly positively correlated (rho = 0.164, 95%CI: 0.045–0.278, p = 0.007), but had poor agreement. The lowest scoring sub-categories of observed RMC were information and consent (14.0%), then privacy (28.0%). Twenty-eight percent of women (95%CI: 23.0% -33.0%) were observed to be hit during labour and only 8.2% (95%CI: 4.0%-18.0%) received pain relief. Equitable care was the highest sub-category for both observed and reported RMC. Being employed and having completed post-secondary education were significantly associated with higher observed RMC scores. There were also significant facility differences in observed RMC. In conclusion, the women reported higher levels of RMC than were observed indicating that these two methodologies to evaluate RMC give very different results. More consensus and standardisation are required in determining the cut-offs to quantify the proportion of women receiving RMC. The low levels of RMC observed in the study require attention, and it is important to ensure that women are treated equitably, irrespective of personal characteristics or facility context."
https://openalex.org/W4307002389,"Gastrointestinal disease (GI) is the most common illness in pre-weaned dairy calves. Therefore, effective strategies to manipulate the microbiome of dairy calves under commercial dairy operations are of great importance to improve animal health and reduce antimicrobial usage. The objective of this study was to develop a farm-specific FMT product and to investigate its effects on clinical outcomes and fecal microbial composition of dairy calves. The FMT product was derived from feces from healthy donors (5–24 days of age) raised in the same calf ranch facility as the FMT recipients. Healthy and diarrheic calves were randomly enrolled to a control (n = 115) or FMT (n = 112) treatment group (~36 g of processed fecal matter once daily for 3 days). Fecal samples were collected at enrollment and again 9 days later after the first FMT dose. Although the FMT product was rich in organisms typically known for their beneficial probiotic properties, the FMT therapy did not prevent or ameliorate GI disease in dairy calves. In fact, calves that received FMT were less likely to recover from GI disease, and more likely to die due to GI disease complications. Fecal microbial community analysis revealed an increase in the alpha-diversity in FMT calves; however, no major differences across treatment groups were observed in the beta-diversity analysis. Calves that received FMT had higher relative abundance of an uncultured organism of the genus Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus reuteri on day 10. Moreover, FMT calves had lower relative abundance of Clostridium nexile and Bacteroides vulgatus on day 10. Our results indicate the need to have an established protocol when developing FMT products, based on rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of FMT donors free of potential pathogens, no history of disease or antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4307002692,"Contemporary literature has revealed that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes acute sialadenitis and related symptoms, such as discomfort, pain, swelling, and secretory dysfunction in salivary glands. The secretory dysfunction is due to SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced xerostomia and other associated clinical courses such as sore tongue, mucosal ulcer, and gingivitis in the oral cavity. Furthermore, it has been reported that COVID-19 causes the development of other oral manifestations.A prospective clinical follow-up (a prevalent cohort) study was conducted to identify the possible oral manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients admitted toat the Eka General Hospital COVID-19 treatment center. Furthermore, the study aimed to calculate the prevalence rate of oral clinical courses in the cohorts. The study consisted of two follow-up phases: Hospital and patient-home-based.A total of 55 patients (36 males and 19 females) met the inclusion criteria and were followed for 7.5 weeks. The 3.5 weeks hospital-based prospective follow-up study documented an 18% (n = 10) prevalence rate of oral clinical courses among the cohorts. Twelve oral symptoms appeared in these ten patients. The manifested oral symptoms were oral mucosal lesions (n = 6), xerostomia (n = 5), and thickening of saliva (n = 1). The oral mucosal lesions per se consisted of aphthous lesions (n = 3), candidiasis (n = 1), geographic tongue (n = 1), and localized gingivitis (n = 1). The four weeks' home-based follow-up study disclosed four newly manifested oral symptoms: hemorrhagic crust, bulla, buccal mucositis, and petechiae. These manifestations appeared among six patients (four males and two females) who had not manifested any oral symptoms during the hospital-based follow-up. Accordingly, the overall prevalence of oral clinical courses among patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 is raised from 18% (n = 10) to 29% (n = 16). Similarly, the number of clinical courses increased from 12 to 16 after four additional weeks of follow-up.The study's findings suggest the importance of initiating oral health care for patients with COVID-19. Therefore, multidisciplinary healthcare approaches should be delivered to assure optimal health outcomes. Accordingly, oral health professionals must be a substantial part of the interdisciplinary approach in caring for patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4307002942,"The sulfonylurea herbicide nicosulfuron is efficient, harmless and selective at low doses and has been widely used in maize cultivation. In this study, a pair of corn sister lines, HK301 (nicosulfuron-tolerence, NT) and HK320 (nicosulfuron-sensitive, NS), was chosen to study the effect of nicosulfuron on plant growth and sugar metabolism in sweet maize ( Zea mays L.) seedlings. All the experimental samples were subjected to treatment with water or 80 mg kg –1 of nicosulfuron when the sweet maize seedlings grew to the four-leaf stage. Nicosulfuron significantly inhibited the growth of NS line. The content of sucrose and the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose synthase in the two inbred lines increased differentially under nicosulfuron stress compared with the respective control treatment. After nicosulfuron treatment, the activities of hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase and the contents of pyruvic acid and citric acid in NS line decreased significantly compared with those of NT line, while the content of sucrose and activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose synthase increased significantly. The disruption of sugar metabolism in NS line led to a lower supply of energy for growth. This study showed that the glycolysis pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enhanced in nicosulfuron-tolerant line under nicosulfuron stress in enhancing the adaptability of sweet maize."
https://openalex.org/W4307002949,"Previous studies have shown that, thread carpal tunnel release (TCTR), an ultrasound-guided transverse carpal ligament (TCL) transection procedure through needle and thread, to be a safe and effective technique for carpal tunnel release, compared to an open and endoscopic technique. We developed a newly improved thread (Smartwire-01, 0.27mm in diameter, Korea). This pilot study was performed to propose the effectiveness of TCTR with Smartwire-01 compared to the commercial thread in clinical settings.A total of 22 TCTR procedures have been performed on 19 patients by one physiatrist during a 42-month period. The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was based on standard clinical criteria including electromyography (EMG). Patients were divided into two groups, one dissected with commercial thread and the other with Smartwire-01. The technique was standardized by keeping the entry point at the middle of the palm and the exit point at just medial to the palmaris longus tendon. The Numeric Rating Scale and Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) were used to assess monthly outcomes for 6 months following the procedure. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Mann-Whitney-U test were performed to analyze the above variables in the two groups.There was no definite evidence that the two groups have significant differences for any of the surveyed variables. The TCTR procedure with our newly developed thread also had significant improvements for all variables, showing its effectiveness in both pain and functional ability. The NRS and BCTQ severity and functional scales showed significant decreases just after the dissection and progressive improvement during each monthly follow-up of our study until the last assessment at 6 months.The study suggests that, our newly developed thread is as safe and effective as the commercial thread in TCTR, we therefore recommend a randomize controlled trial with above methodology."
https://openalex.org/W4307002957,"In the field of work, there is a shift towards more value-based approaches to study the sustainable employability of the present-day worker. The capability approach offers a value based and innovative conceptualisation and framework of sustainable employability characterized by contextuality, normativity and diversity. The capabilities of Dutch employees have been established and validated, yet it is not known which conversion factors on a personal, work and organizational level enable employees to achieve value in work in different Dutch occupational sectors.Our qualitative approach included seven focus groups in different occupational sectors including elderly care, higher education, insurance work, facility management and the oil-, car- and chemical industry. Each focus group included 5-11 participants and took approximately one and a half hour. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data, by combining deductive and inductive coding respectively. Deductive coding involved assigning themes to the conversion of resources into capabilities at the organizational, work and personal level.On the organizational conversion level, important themes were cultural aspects, power relations, shortage of personnel and policies for self-management. On the work conversion level, social contacts, communication and workload, tasks and schedules were identified. Social contacts were described as a work value in itself, but also conditional for achieving other work values. On the personal conversion level, experienced work stress, motivation and the ability to achieve values informally within the company.From our findings it follows that focus groups are sensitive to identify conversion factors on all three levels of conversion. In addition, companies and their employees might effectively increase work capabilities by being sensitive to all three conversion levels simultaneously. Further research is necessary to study the effect of a capability-based intervention at the work floor."
https://openalex.org/W4307009059,"Introduction Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Children with asthma are at high risk for complications from influenza; however annual influenza vaccination rates for this population are suboptimal. The overall aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of a high-risk population of children with asthma presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department according to influenza vaccination status. Methods The study was a retrospective chart review of 4355 patients aged 2 to 18 years evaluated in a Michigan pediatric emergency department (PED) between November 1, 2017 and April 30, 2018 with an ICD-10-CM code for asthma (J45.x). Eligible patient PED records were matched with influenza vaccination records for the 2017–2018 influenza season from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry. Geospatial analysis was employed to examine the distribution of influenza vaccination status. Results 1049 patients (30.9%) with asthma seen in the PED had received an influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccination coverage varied by Census Tract, ranging from 10% to &gt;99%. Most vaccines were administered in a primary care setting (84.3%) and were covered by public insurance (76.8%). The influenza vaccination rate was lowest for children aged 5–11 years (30.0%) and vaccination status was associated with race (p&lt;0.001) and insurance type (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Identification of neighborhood Census Tract and demographic groups with suboptimal influenza vaccination could guide development of targeted public health interventions to improve vaccination rates in high-risk patients. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with pediatric asthma, a data-driven approach may improve outcomes and reduce healthcare-associated costs for this pediatric population."
https://openalex.org/W4307009074,"Background Polypharmacy is highly prevalent in older patients with multimorbidity and is associated with increased risk of adverse drug events. This pilot study investigated the added value of a bedside medication review with cognitive and depression screening by a clinical pharmacist to identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and medication use issues in older patients with polypharmacy. Methods and results In the period from September 2018 to March 2019, a clinical pharmacist took part in the comprehensive geriatric assessment of 37 older patients hospitalized at Antwerp University Hospital and conducted a medication review consisting of a record review, a bedside interview questionnaire covering medication use, evaluation of cognitive function (abbreviated MMSE), depression (GDS-4), and systematic check for possible PIMs (STOPP/START criteria). Patients were 83±4 years old and on a median of 12 home medications (range 5–20). The clinical pharmacist formulated an average of 7.7 recommendations to optimize medication use per patient, of which 89.9% were considered clinically relevant by the geriatrician. Only 2 out of 286 PIMs were discovered during routine electronic validation of medication prescriptions. Supervision of medication intake was absent in 75% of cognitively impaired patients, but advice to do so was implemented in 86.4% of cases. The multidisciplinary geriatric advice was communicated to the treating physician, who fully implemented 33.8% of the recommendations. Conclusions Bedside medication review with cognitive and depression screening by a clinical pharmacist is useful to discover polypharmacy related problems and medication intake issues in a population of geriatric patients. Systematic screening for cognitive impairment and depression are needed to detect patients in need of support for correct medication use and therapy compliance."

The study hypothesis was based on the oral inflammation vs . systemic health paradigm. A sample of 2,168 subjects from an original cohort of 105,718 individuals from the greater Stockholm area in Sweden that had been followed since 1985 was investigated. Swedish national health registers were used in the study. Chi-square tests and logistic multiple regression analyses were conducted. The results showed that periodontitis was significantly associated with any cancer after adjusting for gender, age, income, and education (p = 0.015). The probability of getting cancer increased on average by 38% if the patient had periodontitis vs . had not; the odds ratio was 1.380 (95% confidence interval l.066-1.786). No significant association was observed between periodontitis and breast cancer (p = 0.608), while the association between periodontitis and prostate cancer tended towards significance (p = 0.082). However, no statistically significant difference was found between the observed and the calculated distribution of any cancer in gingivitis groups (p = 0.079). Thus, the study hypothesis was partly confirmed by showing a statistically significant association between periodontitis and any cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4307002378,"Introduction Since the evolution of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), a near-perfect ART adherence level (&gt;95%) is needed to control viral suppression. Non-adherence to treatment may lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and drug resistance. Though the Bangladesh government provides free treatment and counselling services to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), only 22% of the identified PLHIV continue treatment. Therefore, this study aims to explore the barriers that obstruct the Bangladeshi PLHIV to ensure ART adherence. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and recruited the sensitive study population following non-probability, mainly purposive sampling from a community-based registered organization for PLHIV. We conducted the in-depth interview using a semi-structured guideline with 15 consented respondents. We transcribed the audio-recorded interviews in the local language (Bangla) and then translated those into English for data analysis. During the data extraction process, the lead and corresponding authors independently extracted raw data to generate different themes and sub-themes and invited other authors to contribute when they could not solve any discrepancies. Results The study identified three significant categories of barriers at the individual, community, and institutional levels that negatively interfered with ART adherence. The most dominant barriers were discrimination and rejection related to stigma, as almost all participants mentioned these barriers. Stigmatizing attitudes and the discriminatory act of the community people and healthcare providers critically affected their treatment adherence. Other leading barriers were improper inventory management of ART-related medicines and CD4 tests and lack of proper counselling. In addition, we found that a positive approach toward life and family support motivated some respondents to overcome the barriers. Conclusions We recommended strengthening Bangladesh’s HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and management program with a special focus on the improvement of the supply chain of ART-related medicines and CD4 tests and ensuring proper counselling. In addition, we recommended strengthening the behaviour change communication and IEC activities at a large scale to destigmatize health facilities and community levels."
https://openalex.org/W4307002690,"Objectives This study establishes age- and sex-specific reference values for fat mass index (FMI), lean mass index (LMI), appendicular LMI (aLMI), and body fat distribution indices including Android/Gynoid % fat ratio and Trunk/Limb % fat ratio in multi-ethnic Singaporean adults. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery Wi) was carried out to measure whole body and regional fat and lean mass in community-dwelling adults. A total of 537 adults (57.5% women), aged from 21 to 90 years, were recruited from the large north-eastern residential town of Yishun. Age- and sex-specific percentile reference values were generated for FMI, LMI, aLMI, Android/Gynoid % fat ratio and Trunk/Limb % fat ratio using the Lambda–Mu–Sigma method. The relationship between the parameters and age were assessed through the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results All parameters demonstrated significant correlation with age ( p &lt; 0.05) for both men and women, except for LMI in women, with the strength of r ranging from 0.12 (weak correlation) to 0.54 (strong correlation). LMI ( r = −0.45) and appendicular LMI ( r = −0.54) were negatively associated with age in men while none ( r = −0.06) to weak correlation ( r = −0.14) were shown in women for the same parameters respectively. The Android/Gynoid % fat ratio and Trunk/Limb % fat ratio were positively related to age for both men ( r = 0.37 &amp; 0.43, p &lt; 0.001) and women ( r = 0.52 &amp; 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion We have established DXA-based body composition reference data for the Singapore adult population. These reference data will be particularly useful in geriatric, obesity and oncology clinics, enabling the prescription of appropriate therapy to individuals at risk of morbidity from unfavorable body composition phenotypes.

https://openalex.org/W4307002701,"Conceptualising internet addiction and assessing its symptoms has presented a significant challenge for researchers over the past 25 years. Recently, the Internet Disorder Scale (IDS-15), which is based on the criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) from DSM-5, has emerged as a promising instrument to assess internet addiction. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Slovenian IDS-15.The sample was recruited from the National Survey on the Use of Tobacco, Alcohol and Other Drugs that was conducted in 2018 on a nationally representative sample (N = 16,000; age range: 15-64 years; 62.4% response rate). The final sample comprised 9,161 participants, with 80.9% reporting having used the internet at least once a week (n = 7,413). A structured questionnaire was designed and internet addiction was assessed using the IDS-15.Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed acceptable fit to the proposed four-factor structure of the IDS-15. The reliability, and criterion, convergent and discriminant validity were also found to be adequate with a notable exception of the first item of the scale, as shown by its lower factor loading and higher variability. Additionally, latent profile analysis was used to distinguish between internet users with low (n = 3,818; 51.5%), medium (n = 3,111; 42.0%) and high (n = 484; 6.4%) addiction risk. Furthermore, the high-risk class was associated with higher IDS-15 factor scores, higher frequency of internet use in leisure time, and lower age of first internet use.The present study provides new insights about the strengths and shortcomings of the IDS-15. Moreover, the results provide an insight into the prevalence of internet addiction in Slovenia, as well as associations with other potential factors. The results serve as the basis for further analyses on internet addiction epidemiology, policymaking activities, and design for targeted public health interventions in Slovenia."
https://openalex.org/W4307002774,"Background A diagnosis of cancer is associated with significant physical, psychological and financial burden. Including costs of cancer is an important component of shared decision making. Doctors bear a responsibility towards educating patients about the financial aspects of care. Multiple organisations have advocated for price transparency and implementing Informed Financial Consent in the clinic. However, few studies have evaluated the perspectives of oncologists on the current state of this discussion. Aims The aim of this study is to determine the views and perspectives of medical oncologists regarding communication of costs and financial burden in patients with cancer. Methods We conducted a prospective cross-sectional online survey via REDCap. The survey was distributed to medical oncologists and advanced trainees currently registered with Medical Oncology Group of Australia (MOGA). Data was collected using the online survey comprising socio-demographic characteristics, discussion of costs and financial burden, and facilitators and barriers to these discussions. Results 547 members of MOGA were invited to participate in the study, and 106 of 547 MOGA members (19%) completed the survey. Most oncologists (66%) felt that it was their responsibility to discuss costs of care, however a majority of oncologists (59.3%) reported discussing costs with less than half of their patients. Only 25% of oncologists discussed financial concerns with more than half of their patients, and most oncologists were unfamiliar with cancer-related financial burden. Most Oncologists with greater clinical experience and those working in private practice were more likely to discuss costs with a majority of their patients. Conclusions Certain characteristics of medical oncologists and their practices were associated with reported prevalence of discussing costs of care and financial burden with their patients. In the context of rising costs of cancer care, interventions targeting modifiable factors such as raising oncologist awareness of costs of care and financial burden, screening for financial toxicity and availability of costs information in an easily accessible manner, may help increase the frequency of patient-doctor discussions about costs of care, contributing to informed decision-making and higher-quality cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W4307002941,"Purpose We aimed to discover loci associated with triglyceride (TG) levels in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 424,120 genotyped participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) with T2D status and TG levels. Methods We stratified the cohort based on T2D status and conducted association analyses of TG levels for genetic variants with minor allele count (MAC) at least 20 in each stratum. Effect differences of genetic variants by T2D status were determined by Cochran’s Q-test and we validated the significantly associated variants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB). Results Among 21,176 T2D and 402,944 non-T2D samples from UKB, stratified GWAS identified 19 and 315 genomic risk loci significantly associated with TG levels, respectively. Only chr6p21.32 exhibited genome-wide significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 98.4%; p heterogeneity = 2.1x10 -15 ), with log(TG) effect estimates of -0.066 (95%CI: -0.082, -0.050) and 0.002 (95%CI: -0.002, 0.006) for T2D and non-T2D, respectively. The lead variant rs9274619:A (allele frequency 0.095) is located 2Kb upstream of the HLA-DQB1 gene, between HLA - DQB1 and HLA - DQA2 genes. We replicated this finding among 25,137 participants (6,951 T2D cases) of MGBB (p heterogeneity = 9.5x10 -3 ). Phenome-wide interaction association analyses showed that the lead variant was strongly associated with a concomitant diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) as well as diabetes-associated complications. Conclusion In conclusion, we identified an intergenic variant near HLA-DQB1/DQA2 significantly associates with decreased triglycerides only among those with T2D and highlights an immune overlap with T1D."
https://openalex.org/W4307002950,"This article is based on the relocation project of the 330 kV overhead line in Xi'an, China. In this paper, the soil settlement under different jacking depths was calculated by using the modified Peck's formula. Meanwhile, by modeling in ABAQUS, the jacking process of a single-chamber double-line large diameter pipeline under different soil conditions was simulated, and the ground deformation data under the different simulated working conditions were obtained. The results of the two methods were compared with the construction monitoring results, and it was found that the finite element simulation results were closer to the actual results. The control variable method was used in the analysis of the surface soil deformation law to analyze the effect of different soil parameters and pipe jacking depths on surface soil deformation. Finally, the best soil conditions applicable to single-chamber double-line large diameter pipe jacking construction were obtained through comparative analysis. The results show that (1) when using double-line construction, the maximum surface settlement under different soil conditions is located 11-15 m from the centerline of the soil above the pipeline, the minimum settlement location is inside the isolation pile, and with the increase in jacking distance, the settlement at the same section of the surface will gradually decrease and finally produce a small uplift. (2) In the first jacking, the settlement of powder clay is the largest, and the maximum settlement points in the surface section are more distributed. The maximum settlement value is approximately 11.66 mm. The settlement of powder soil is the smallest but produces a certain uplift deformation, and its maximum settlement is more concentrated in the surface section. After the comparison of deformation and soil parameters, loess-like soil is more suitable for single-compartment double-line large diameter pipe jacking construction. (3) When the top pipe burial depth changes, the greater the burial depth is, the smaller the settlement but the greater the lateral influence range. In the soil parameters, the modulus of elasticity only changes 3 MPa, and the settlement change value is approximately 5 mm. By changing the parameters, it can be obtained that the larger the modulus of elasticity of the soil is, the smaller its deformation. The larger the internal friction angle of the soil is, the smaller its deformation, but the maximum value of settlement change is only 1.7 mm, which means that the change in the internal friction angle has little effect on the soil deformation."
https://openalex.org/W4307009042,"After the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, digital teaching had to be implemented by most universities at short notice and widely replaced classroom teaching. As a consequence, digital teaching further reduced direct social interaction for students. One year after the introduction of digital teaching formats at our university medical center (department of psychiatry and psychotherapy), teaching evaluation of students from summer semesters 2020 and 2021 (SS20, SS21) were compared. The main objective of this study was to objectify whether students evaluate digital teaching less favorably after one year of its implementation. Ratings of 311 medical students on (1) knowledge gain, (2) teaching contents and (3) subjective advantages of digital teaching were analyzed for the two separate cohorts SS20 (n = 175) and SS21 (n = 136). Students also rated their pandemic-related stress level, and if learning progress had been reduced by the pandemic in general. Significant knowledge gain was achieved for all included domains in psychiatry (all p < .001), and did not differ between SS20/SS21. Teaching contents in SS21 were rated worse in six out of eight domains compared to SS20 (p < .001 to .05). Also, subjective advantages of digital teaching vanished in most domains comparing the cohorts of SS21 and SS20 (p < .001 to .05). No differences were found for pandemic-related stress level and subjective learning progress. Limitations include the post-hoc design, possible bias from individual exam grades, and sampling bias. The present study showed that knowledge gain can be considered to be stable one year after the pandemic-related implementation of digital teaching. However, sustainability of this teaching format should be monitored critically: The subject of psychiatry and psychotherapy thrives on direct communication, which can be compromised when using digital formats only. In this light, implementation of more interactive formats in digital teaching is discussed."

PD often accompanied other dysmenorrhea-associated symptoms to trigger exacerbations, and even cause depression and anxiety for patients. As the effective first-line medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become widespread across China and combined with oral traditional Chinese patent medicines (TCPMs) for PD in clinical practice. We hope to provide better efficacy and safety evidence about oral TCPMs combined with NSAIDs (oral TCPMs+NSAIDs) for patients with PD by this network meta-analysis.We will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis of all oral TCPMs+NSAIDs for clinical diagnosis as PD.

https://openalex.org/W4307009060,"Though native to Scotland, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) was extirpated c.250 years ago as part of a global eradication drive. The global population has recently expanded, now occupying 67% of its former range. Evidence is growing that apex predators provide a range of ecological benefits, most stemming from the reduction of overgrazing by deer-something from which Scotland suffers. In this study, we build a rule-based habitat suitability model for wolves on the Scottish mainland. From existing literature, we identify the most important variables as land cover, prey density, road density and human density, and establish thresholds of suitability for each. Fuzzy membership functions are used to assign suitability values to each variable, followed by fuzzy overlay to combine all four: a novel approach to habitat suitability modelling for terrestrial mammals. Model sensitivity is tested for land cover and prey density, as these variables constitute a knowledge gap and an incomplete dataset, respectively. The Highlands and Grampian mountains emerge strongly and consistently as the most suitable areas, largely due to high negative covariance between prey density and road/human density. Sensitivity testing reveals the models are fairly robust to changes in prey density, but less robust to changes in the scoring of land cover, with the latter altering the distribution of land mainly through the 70-100% suitability range. However, in statistical significance tests, only the least and most generous versions of the model emerge as giving significantly different results. Depending on the version of the model, a contiguous area of between 10,139km2 and 18,857km2 is shown to be 80 to 100% suitable. This could be sufficient to support between 50 and 94 packs of four wolves, if the average pack range size is taken to be 200km2. We conclude that in terms of habitat availability, reintroduction should be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W4307009070,"Sustained engagement with Internet-based behavioural interventions is crucial to achieve successful behaviour change outcomes. As this has been problematic in many interventions, a lot of research has focused on participants with little or no engagement. However, few studies have attempted to understand users with continuous long-term engagement, the so called 'super engaged users', and why they keep on using programs when everybody else has long stopped. Therefore, the aim of this research was to qualitatively examine characteristics, usage profile and motivations of super engaged users in the 10,000 Steps program.Twenty 10,000 Steps users (10 with more than 1 year of engagement, and 10 with more than 10 years of engagement) participated in semi-structured interviews, that were transcribed and thematically analysed.Participants were aged 60 years on average, with more than half being overweight/obese and/or suffering from chronic disease despite logging high step counts (219 million steps per participant on average) on the 10,000 Steps platform. Participants indicated that the reasons for sustained use were that engaging the program had become a habit, that the program kept them motivated, and that it was easy to use. Few participants had suggestions for improvement or expressed there were program elements they did not like. Uptake of program innovations (e.g., app-version, use of advanced activity tracker instead of pedometer) was modest among the super engaged users.The findings from this study emphasise the need for digital health programs to incorporate features that will support the development of habits as soon as participants start to engage with the program. While a program's usability, user-friendliness and acceptability are important to engage and retain new users, habit formation may be more important for sustained long-term engagement with the behaviour and the program."
https://openalex.org/W4307009086,"In bottom-up proteomics, proteins are enzymatically digested into peptides before measurement with mass spectrometry. The relationship between proteins and their corresponding peptides can be represented by bipartite graphs. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of bipartite graphs using quantified peptides from measured data sets as well as theoretical peptides from an in silico digestion of the corresponding complete taxonomic protein sequence databases. The aim of this study is to characterize and structure the different types of graphs that occur and to compare them between data sets. We observed a large influence of the accepted minimum peptide length during in silico digestion. When changing from theoretical peptides to measured ones, the graph structures are subject to two opposite effects. On the one hand, the graphs based on measured peptides are on average smaller and less complex compared to graphs using theoretical peptides. On the other hand, the proportion of protein nodes without unique peptides, which are a complicated case for protein inference and quantification, is considerably larger for measured data. Additionally, the proportion of graphs containing at least one protein node without unique peptides rises when going from database to quantitative level. The fraction of shared peptides and proteins without unique peptides as well as the complexity and size of the graphs highly depends on the data set and organism. Large differences between the structures of bipartite peptide-protein graphs have been observed between database and quantitative level as well as between analyzed species. In the analyzed measured data sets, the proportion of protein nodes without unique peptides ranged from 6.4% to 55.0%. This highlights the need for novel methods that can quantify proteins without unique peptides. The knowledge about the structure of the bipartite peptide-protein graphs gained in this study will be useful for the development of such algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4307009107,"We investigated the influence of impaired renal function on fundus characteristics, pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) details, and outcomes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).A retrospective cohort study.We investigated a consecutive series of PDR patients who underwent PPV. The diabetic complications, previous photocoagulation, intravitreal injections before PPV, ocular findings during PPV, surgical details, short-term visual outcome and post-PPV complications were recorded and compared between patients with and without impaired renal function.149 patients had normal renal function (67.7%), and 71 (32.3%) patients had impaired renal function; 85.4% of patients were identified with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during the preoperative assessment. Impaired renal function was related to hypertension (3.40[1.58-7.29], p = 0.002), incomplete pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) (3.18[1.50-6.72], p = 0.002), severe fibrovascular membrane (8.19[3.43-19.54], p<0.001), and extensive retinal vascular closure (3.40[1.54-7.52], p = 0.002). There was a more frequent occurrence of severe intraoperative bleeding (56.3%, 32.2%, p = 0.001) and a higher percentage of intraocular subretinal fluid drainage (45.1%, 22.1%, p = 0.008) in patients with impaired renal function. The percentage of patients whose visual acuity (VA) increased was similar between the two groups (42.3%, 54.4%, p = 0.34).In PDR patients, screening for CKD was required before PPV. PDR patients with impaired renal function tended to have more severe ischemic retinal conditions. Comparable PPV outcomes could be obtained in patients with and without impaired renal damage."
https://openalex.org/W4307009113,"Background and purpose Screening for and treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are recommended. However, there is limited evidence on safety and treatment completion in this population. The objective of the study is to evaluate three short-course rifamycin-based regimens for the treatment of latent TB in ESKD patients. Methods Study design and setting . This is a prospective, open label, randomized clinical trial, that will be conducted at seven teaching hospitals in Spain. Study population, randomization, and interventions . Consecutive adult patients with ESKD requiring treatment for a latent TB infection will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive one of the three treatment regimens of the study: three months of daily isoniazid plus rifampicin (3HR); three months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP); or four months of daily rifampicin (4R). Participants will be followed regularly through pre-established visits and a blood test schedule from enrolment to a month after finishing the assigned treatment. Outcomes . The primary outcome will be treatment completion, while the secondary outcomes will be discontinuation of the assigned treatment due to adverse events, related or unrelated to the study treatment; definitive discontinuation of the assigned treatment because of adverse events related to the treatment of the study, and death. Sample size . Two hundred and twenty-five subjects (75 per arm) will be enrolled, which will enable the demonstration, if it exists, of an increase of 0.16 in treatment completion rates either in the 3HP or 4R arm with respect to the 3HR arm. Discussion Results of this clinical trial will contribute to evidence-based recommendations on the management of latent TB infection in ESKD patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05021731 ."
https://openalex.org/W4307009299,"Although parental support is an important component in programs designed to prevent overweight in children, current programs pay remarkably little attention to the role of parenting. We therefore developed a web-based parenting program entitled ""Making a healthy deal with your child"". This e-learning program can be incorporated into existing overweight prevention programs. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of this e-learning program.The effectiveness was examined in a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial. The participants were 475 parent-child dyads of children 9-13 years of age in the Netherlands who participated in an existing schoolclass-based overweight prevention program. At the school grade level, parents were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control condition. Measurements were taken from both parents and children at baseline, and 5 and 12 months after baseline. Primary outcomes included the child's dietary and sedentary behavior, and level of physical activity. Secondary outcomes included general parenting style, specific parenting practices, and parental self-efficacy. Linear mixed effects models and generalized linear mixed effects models were conducted in R.Intention-to-treat analyses and completers only revealed no significant effects between the intervention and control condition on energy balance-related behaviors of the child and parenting skills after correction for multiple testing. The parents' mean satisfaction with the e-learning program (on a 10-point scale) was 7.0±1.1.Although parents were generally satisfied with the parenting program, following this program had no significant beneficial effects regarding the children's energy balance-related behaviors or the parenting skills compared to the control condition. This program may be more beneficial if used by high-risk groups (e.g. parents of children with unhealthy energy balance-related behaviors and/or with overweight) compared to the general population, warranting further study."
https://openalex.org/W4307035310,"Many studies have shown that graphene oxide (GO) promotes proliferation and differentiation of a variety of stem cells. However, its effect on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (Ad-MSCs) apoptosis is still unclear. Apoptosis is a significant factor affecting stem cell-based treatment of diabetic wounds. Therefore, we explored the effect of GO on Ad-MSC apoptosis and diabetic wound healing. In this study, qRT-PCR was used to detect Ad-MSC expression of LncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs under high-glucose environment. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, and luciferase assays were used to detect interactions of specific lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. The effects of GO on Ad-MSC apoptosis were explored by flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and Western blot. A diabetic wound model was used to explore the function of Linc00324 on Ad-MSC reparative properties in vivo. As a result, GO inhibited high glucose-induced apoptosis in Ad-MSCs, and Linc00324 contributed to the anti-apoptotic effect of GO. RIP and RNA pull-down confirmed that Linc00324 directly interacted with miR-7977, functioning as a miRNA sponge to regulate expression of the miR-7977 target gene STK4 (MST1) and downstream signaling pathways. In addition, GO reduced the apoptosis of Ad-MSCs in wounds and promoted wound healing. Taken together, these findings suggest GO may be a superior auxiliary material for Ad-MSCs to facilitate diabetic wound healing via the Linc00324/miR-7977/STK4 pathway."
