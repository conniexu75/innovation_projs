https://openalex.org/W1969103349,"Recent advances in far-field optical nanoscopy have enabled fluorescence imaging with a spatial resolution of 20 to 50 nanometers. Multicolor super-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce a family of photo-switchable fluorescent probes and demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Each probe consists of a photo-switchable “reporter” fluorophore that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an “activator” that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution STORM image. Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of DNA model samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution. This technique will facilitate direct visualization of molecular interactions at the nanometer scale."

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which was recently found to be a promising deep ultraviolet light emitter, has traditionally been synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature. We successfully synthesized high-purity hBN crystals at atmospheric pressure by using a nickel-molybdenum solvent. The obtained hBN crystals emitted intense 215-nanometer luminescence at room temperature. This study demonstrates an easier way to grow high-quality hBN crystals, through their liquid-phase deposition on a substrate at atmospheric pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2006141070,"Aneuploidy is a condition frequently found in tumor cells, but its effect on cellular physiology is not known. We have characterized one aspect of aneuploidy: the gain of extra chromosomes. We created a collection of haploid yeast strains that each bear an extra copy of one or more of almost all of the yeast chromosomes. Their characterization revealed that aneuploid strains share a number of phenotypes, including defects in cell cycle progression, increased glucose uptake, and increased sensitivity to conditions interfering with protein synthesis and protein folding. These phenotypes were observed only in strains carrying additional yeast genes, which indicates that they reflect the consequences of additional protein production as well as the resulting imbalances in cellular protein composition. We conclude that aneuploidy causes not only a proliferative disadvantage but also a set of phenotypes that is independent of the identity of the individual extra chromosomes."

We combine continuous measurements of the MOC (beginning in 2004) using the purposefully designed transatlantic Rapid Climate Change array of moored instruments deployed along 26.5°N, with time series of Gulf Stream transport and surface-layer Ekman transport to quantify its intra-annual variability. The year-long average overturning is 18.7 ± 5.6 sverdrups (Sv) (range: 4.0 to 34.9 Sv, where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean water of 10 6 cubic meters per second). Interannual changes in the overturning can be monitored with a resolution of 1.5 Sv."

https://openalex.org/W2020444654,"The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is a key integrator of neuromuscular activity in skeletal muscle. Ectopic expression of PGC-1α in muscle results in increased mitochondrial number and function as well as an increase in oxidative, fatigue-resistant muscle fibers. Whole body PGC-1α knock-out mice have a very complex phenotype but do not have a marked skeletal muscle phenotype. We thus analyzed skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1α knock-out mice to identify a specific role for PGC-1α in skeletal muscle function. These mice exhibit a shift from oxidative type I and IIa toward type IIx and IIb muscle fibers. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1α knock-out animals have reduced endurance capacity and exhibit fiber damage and elevated markers of inflammation following treadmill running. Our data demonstrate a critical role for PGC-1α in maintenance of normal fiber type composition and of muscle fiber integrity following exertion.

Skeletal muscle has an enormous capacity to adapt to motor neuron activity. Many changes in gene expression are controlled by motor neuron-induced calcium signaling (1Olson E.N. Williams R.S.

By coactivating the myocyte enhancer factor 2 members MEF2C and MEF2D, PGC-1α potently drives transcription of myofibrillar genes typical of oxidative muscle fibers (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T.

Interestingly, MEF2 and PGC-1α also control PGC-1α gene transcription in an autoregulatory loop (7Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Fishman G.I. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metabolic genes, including those responsible for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are induced by a transcriptional cascade with coactivation of the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα, official nomenclature NR3B1), the nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2, alternatively called GA-binding protein, GABP), and the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) by PGC-1α and subsequent increase in the levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and mitochondrial transcription specificity factors TFB1M and TFB2M (9Wu Z.

Recently, we have found that activity-induced remodeling of the postsynaptic side of neuromuscular junctions involves a complex between PGC-1α, GABP, and host cell factor that assembles upon phosphorylation of PGC-1α and GABP in post-synaptic nuclei (14Handschin C. Kobayashi Y.M. Chin S. Seale P. Campbell K.P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Data obtained from muscle-specific PGC-1α transgenic animals underline the importance of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle in vivo (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). These mice have increased number and function of mitochondria accompanied by a higher number of type IIa and type I oxidative, slow twitch, high endurance muscle fibers (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even in the absence of functional motor nerve signaling following hind leg denervation, ectopically expressed PGC-1α maintains skeletal muscle function and blunts skeletal muscle atrophy that normally occurs in the absence of motor neuron signaling (15Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W. Arany Z.P. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16260-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Thus, PGC-1α apparently controls most if not all of the transcriptional changes induced by motor neuron signaling in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, whole body PGC-1α knock-out animals do not exhibit a marked skeletal muscle phenotype (16Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S.

Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Despite a significant reduction of transcription of several mitochondrial genes, no difference in the relative numbers of the different fiber types is observed (17Arany Z. He H. Lin J. Hoyer K.

However, whole body PGC-1α knock-out animals have a dominant central nervous system phenotype that might mask the effects of loss-of-function of PGC-1α in peripheral tissues (16Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S.

These mice are hyperactive, show circadian abnormalities, and have constitutively activated AMP-activated kinase in skeletal muscle, all of which might compensate for the loss of PGC-1α in this tissue (16Lin J.

In the liver, gluconeogenic and heme biosynthetic genes are constitutively elevated in whole body PGC-1α knock-out animals even in the fed state (16Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Krainc D. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In contrast, and as expected from previous studies, fasting induction of gluconeogenic and heme biosynthetic genes is severely blunted in the liver of liver-specific PGC-1α knock-out animals (19Handschin C. Lin J. Rhee J. Peyer A.K. Chin S. Wu P.H. Meyer U.A. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To clarify the genetic requirement for PGC-1α in skeletal muscle function without the confounding variables seen in the whole body knockouts, skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1α knock-out animals (MKOs) were generated. 4Handschin, C., Choi, C. S., Chin, S., Kim, S., Kawamori, D., Kurpad, A. J., Neubauer, N., Hu, J., Mootha, V. K., Kim, Y.-B., Kulkarni, R. N., Shulman, G. I., and Spiegelman, B. M. (2007) J. Clin. Investig. in press. Here, we report a moderate reduction in the number of oxidative type I and type IIa muscle fibers and exercise capacity in these mice. Strikingly, skeletal muscle of MKOs has a low level of damaged and regenerating fibers. This compromised skeletal muscle integrity is dramatically exacerbated by physical exercise and accompanied by elevated markers of systemic inflammation. Our data thus highlight the importance of PGC-1α in maintaining proper function and integrity of skeletal muscle. Animal Experimentation—Generation of MKOs has been described elsewhere. 4Handschin, C., Choi, C. S., Chin, S., Kim, S., Kawamori, D., Kurpad, A. J., Neubauer, N., Hu, J., Mootha, V. K., Kim, Y.-B., Kulkarni, R. N., Shulman, G. I., and Spiegelman, B. M. (2007) J. Clin. Investig. in press. Mice were held under standard conditions. All experiments and protocols were performed in accordance with the respective Animal Facility Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations. Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase I digest, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed and analyzed using Applied Biosystems Real-time PCR System 7300 using the ΔΔCt method. Relative gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA levels. Histology—Tissues were dissected, embedded in OCT compound (VWR Scientific), dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. The sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Evans blue dye (1% solution) was intraperitoneal injected at a concentration of 1% volume/bodyweight 16 h before the treadmill exercise. Mice were sacrificed pre- and 30 min post-exercise and skeletal muscle frozen histological sections prepared. Evans blue incorporation was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Evans blue-penetrated muscle fibers and fibers with centrally located nuclei were counted in 20 randomly chosen sections in blinded fashion and were normalized by the total number of muscle fibers per field. Immunofluorescent staining for type I, type Iia, and type IIb muscle fibers was performed with antibodies against the respective myosin heavy chains as described (20Waters R.E. Rotevatn S. Li P. Annex B.H. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1342-C1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The relative numbers of the different fiber types were quantified by counting 20 sections of each muscle bed (type I, red; type Iia, blue; type Iix, black; type Iib, green). Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System—Comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system (Columbia Instruments) analysis was performed for four light and three dark periods after an acclimatization of 2 days. Data about locomotive activity were collected every 48 min on 16 mice simultaneously. Grip Strength—Grip strength was assessed by an inverted screen test as described (21Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Each mouse was placed on top of an elevated wire mesh grid, the screen was inverted, and the animals were timed until release from the grid. A maximum score of 60 s was given if the animal did not fall. Treadmill Exercise—For 3 days, animals were acclimatized to treadmill running (Columbus Instruments) for 5 min at a speed of 10 m/min and on a 0% grade. One day before the treadmill experiment, animals were injected with a 1% Evans blue dye solution. The next day, animals ran on a treadmill tilted 10% uphill starting at a speed of 10 m/min for 5 min. Every subsequent 2 min, the speed was increased by 2 m/min until mice were exhausted or a maximal speed of 46 m/min was reached ( supplemental Fig. S1). Exhaustion was defined as the inability of the animal to remain on the treadmill despite an air puff stimulus and mechanical prodding. Running time was measured and running distance, work, and power calculated. Distance is a function of time and speed of the treadmill. Work is calculated as the product of bodyweight (kg), gravity (9.81 m/s2), vertical speed (m/s * angle), and time (s). Power is the product of bodyweight (kg), gravity (9.81 m/s2), and vertical speed (m/s * angle). Determination of TNFα Serum Concentration—Serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was determined from mouse serum using a Quantikine Mouse TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Serum Creatine Kinase Assay—Mouse blood was collected and serum isolated using heparin-coated collection tubes (BD Biosciences). Serum creatine kinase activity was then determined with the Creatine Kinase-SL Assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Diagnostic Chemicals Limited). Denervation, Determination of Muscle Mass—Disuse atrophy was induced by surgical ablation of the sciatic nerve on one hind leg as described (15Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W. Arany Z.P. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16260-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Muscle mass of the control leg and the denervated leg was determined 12 days after the surgery. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means, and error bars depict standard errors. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine p values. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. For all experiments, at least 8 mice/group were used. Muscle-specific Knock-out Animals of PGC-1α Have an Increased Number of Glycolytic Myofibers—The generation of the MKOs of PGC-1α and analysis of mRNA and protein expression have been described elsewhere.4 These animals have a reduced expression of number of mitochondrial genes (Fig. 1) that were previously found to be elevated in PGC-1α muscle transgenic mice (15Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W. Arany Z.P. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16260-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PGC-1β levels are not altered by PGC-1α ablation in skeletal muscle as a compensatory mechanism (Fig. 1). Mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism are hallmarks of the slow twitch, oxidative type I and IIa myofiber (3Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Thus, to study whether the corresponding myofibrillar gene expression is also altered in MKOs compared with controls, we measured the relative gene expression levels of the respective myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms I, IIa, IIx, and IIb in gastrocnemius by semiquantitative real-time PCR, comparing control to MKO mice. Transcript levels for MyHCI and MyHCIIa were lower in MKOs versus control animals, being reduced by 47 and 78%, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, MKOs had significantly higher expression of MyHCIIx (+22% versus controls) and MyHCIIb (+29% versus controls) (Fig. 2A), indicating a reduction in oxidative, high endurance fibers and an increase in fast twitch, glycolytic fibers in MKOs. These findings were consistent with histological analysis of different muscle beds (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). Type IIa fibers were predominantly replaced by type IIb fibers in gastrocnemius, plantaris, and tibialis anterior. In MKO soleus muscle, a muscle rich in type I and IIa fibers, type I and type IIa fibers were reduced by 11 and 45%, respectively, and a clear increase in type IIb fibers was observed (+10%) (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). In control animals, type IIb fibers were very rarely found in soleus (Fig. 2B). Thus, both in terms of gene expression and histology of myofibrillar proteins, skeletal muscles of MKOs have a higher percentage of the glycolytic IIx and IIb fibers at the apparent expense of a loss of oxidative type I and IIa fibers (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Notably, the loss in type IIa fibers exceeds the reduction in type I fibers. In fact, a significant reduction of type I fibers was only observed in the gastrocnemius and the soleus, whereas the number of type IIa fibers was lower in all four muscles. Interestingly, muscle-specific PGC-1α transgenic animals show a greater increase in type IIa than type I fibers (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M.

A, relative gene expression was measured from cDNA extracted from gastrocnemius and normalized to 18 S rRNA levels.

Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PGC-1α levels in muscle correlate with the degree of physical activity: PGC-1α transcription is induced by exercise and repressed by disuse (15Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W. Arany Z.P. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16260-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 22Russell A.P. Feilchenfeldt J. Schreiber S.

To study the impact of PGC-1α ablation on skeletal muscle function in intact animals, we assessed the physical condition of MKOs and control animals. Monitoring of locomotive activity in comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring systems revealed that MKOs have regular circadian rhythms in terms of physical activity (Fig. 3A). However, MKOs are hypoactive compared with control mice (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings are in stark contrast to the hyperactive PGC-1α total knock-out animals (16Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Krainc D. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the decrease in physical activity in MKOs is similar in the light and the dark period (Fig. 3B). The hyperactivity of PGC-1α total knock-out mice was predominantly caused by abnormal activity during the light period (16Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Krainc D. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Thus, voluntary physical activity is uniformly reduced in the light and dark phases in MKO mice. In addition to spontaneous muscle usage, we challenged control and MKO animals with involuntary physical exercise testing muscle endurance. First, muscle grip strength was tested using an inverted screen. Inverted screen tests for muscle grip strength predominantly measure isometric muscle endurance. Previous analyses showed a decreased performance of global PGC-1α knock-out mice in this type of test (21Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). But because of the various abnormalities in global PGC-1α knockouts, we decided to reassess this in the MKOs. MKO mice showed compromised muscle function compared with the control mice in this assay (Fig. 3C). In the two trials, MKOs were able to hold on for an average of 17 and 16 s, respectively, whereas control mice dropped after 42 and 45 s, respectively (Fig. 3C). Thus, lack of skeletal muscle PGC-1α leads to a 60% reduction in grip strength performance in MKOs. Previously published results of PGC-1α total knock-out animals in the inverted screen test (21Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F.

Muscle endurance with dynamic fiber contractions was assessed by treadmill running to exhaustion, as an indicator of maximal muscle capacity. After acclimatization, mice were run on a 10% slope with a protocol using increasing speed ( supplemental Fig. S2) until the animals were unable to remain on the treadmill despite air puff stimuli and prodding. Control animals ran roughly 7.5 min (28%) longer than MKOs, an average of 26 min and 52 s for the controls versus 19 min and 25 s for the MKOs (Fig. 3D). The difference in running distance was even bigger because of the running protocol with increasing speed (Fig. 3E). Whereas MKOs covered an average distance of 323 meters, control mice ran 536 meters on the average (a difference of 40%). Finally, work and power generated by control animals were also higher than those of MKOs (Fig. 3, F and G). Control mice used energy equivalent to 1007 J whereas the average work of MKOs came to 594 J (a difference of 41%). Finally, the 17.3 milliwatts of power of the control mice are 25% higher than the 13.1 milliwatts of the MKOs. In summary, all the parameters obtained from the treadmill running experiment describing muscle endurance were significantly lower for MKOs compared with control mice. Thus, the decrease in muscle function in MKOs could consistently be shown in different tests assessing voluntary physical activity and isometric and dynamic muscle endurance. Interestingly, PGC-1α total knock-out animals performed even worse than MKOs in treadmill running (21Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). This might reflect additional defects in heart function and the motor neuron system in whole body PGC-1α knock-out mice that also contribute to physical endurance. Basal and Exercise-induced Myopathy in MKOs—Muscle contraction exerts mechanical stress on muscle fibers. Excess stress can lead to muscle damage that is normally offset by muscle regeneration. As described above, MKOs have a diminished capacity for physical movement, both voluntary and forced. In hematoxylin and eosin staining of cross-sections of quadriceps, a higher number of muscle fibers with centrally located nuclei, a hallmark of regenerating muscle fibers, is found in MKOs compared with control mice (Fig. 4A). We thus checked the expression of various markers of muscle damage and regeneration to study the impact of muscle-specific PGC-1α ablation on muscle fiber integrity. Interestingly, we observed a massive induction of Pax7 gene expression in MKOs (Fig. 4B), a molecular marker for satellite cells (23Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). In the MKOs, myogenin expression was not significantly decreased. Future studies will address this discrepancy between the published reciprocal regulation between Pax7 and the other muscle regulatory factors in cell culture (24Olguin H.C. Yang Z. Tapscott S.J. Olwin B.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and our data in vivo. In addition to Pax7, transcript levels of MyHC3, normally only observed in embryonic stages of muscle development, were elevated in MKOs compared with control animals (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggest that muscle fiber regeneration is induced in MKOs by increased recruitment of satellite cells and the transient expression of MyHC3 in newly formed muscle fibers. Elevated markers for cell proliferation and decreased levels of genes involved in growth arrest support this hypothesis ( supplemental Fig. S3). Increased muscle fiber regeneration is often a sign of muscle damage in mice, and muscle damage leads to higher serum creatine kinase levels in the blood leaking from muscle fibers. We therefore measured serum creatine kinase activity in pre- and post-exercise control and MKO animals, respectively. We found a 3-fold increase in serum creatine kinase in sedentary MKOs compared with controls (Fig. 4C). Creatine kinase levels were further elevated by exercise in MKOs (Fig. 4C). To estimate the degree of muscle damage in MKOs, we intraperitoneal injected Evans blue dye into control and MKO animals pre- and post-exercise. Evans blue can penetrate damaged muscle fibers and is visualized by fluorescent microscopy of histological sections (e.g. see Ref. 14Handschin C. Kobayashi Y.M. Chin S. Seale P. Campbell K.P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The increased staining of muscle fibers in pre-exercise MKOs versus control animals (Fig. 4D) indicated that MKOs exhibit low grade muscle damage, even in the basal state. The number of Evans blue-positive muscle fibers was clearly increased in MKOs post-exercise (Fig. 4D). In comparison, control animals have no visible muscle fiber damage after treadmill running (Fig. 4D). Thus, skeletal muscle PGC-1α is required in maintaining muscle fiber integrity in the sedentary state; this is even more so during and following physical exertion. Increased Inflammatory Response in Sedentary and Exercised MKOs—Many different mechanisms could be involved in the muscle damage observed in MKOs. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are well described disease pathologies in human patients, and TNFα has been causally implicated in this process (25Dalakas M.C. Nat. Clin. Pract. Rheumatol. 2006; 2: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We previously noted increased expression of different inflammatory markers in MKO skeletal muscle in a non-exercised state, including elevated mRNA levels for interleukin 6 and TNFα.4 In addition, circulating interleukin 6 levels in the blood were elevated in MKOs compared with controls, but we did not see a significant difference in circulating TNFα levels in the non-exercised context. To investigate whether elevation of TNFα could be involved in the increase in muscle damage post-exercise, we measured gene expression levels and circulating concentrations of TNFα in mice after treadmill running. In MKOs, TNFα gene expression was higher both pre- and post-exercise compared with control mice4 (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, transcript levels of TNFα were massively increased in exercised MKOs compared with pre-exercised MKOs, whereas no change in TNFα expression was observed in control mice before and after physical activity (Fig. 5A). This increase in gene expression was paralleled by a marked rise in circulating TNFα in the blood of MKOs (Fig. 5B). In fact, in sedentary MKOs and sedentary or exercised control animals, circulating TNFα levels were below the detection limit of our assay and we could only detect circulating TNFα in exercised MKOs. Thus, increased cytokine levels, in particular those for TNFα in MKOs, likely contribute to fiber damage by inducing an inflammatory myopathy. Gain-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo established the importance of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle. Unfortunately, the complex phenotype of the whole body knockout of PGC-1α that included hyperactivity confounded, to a great extent, analysis of skeletal muscle structure and function in these animals. In the skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1α knock-out animal model studied here, we now conclusively show that PGC-1α is required for the maintenance of a normal number of oxidative type I and type IIa muscle fibers. Accordingly, PGC-1α MKO mice are not able to match physical performance of control animals. This was shown for voluntary physical activity, forced isometric muscle endurance in grip strength tests, and dynamic muscle endurance in treadmill running. In addition to their distinct functions, PGC-1α and PGC-1β share common protein binding partners and the regulation of certain gene programs in skeletal muscle (4Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 5Lin J. Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that PGC-1β could at least partially compensate for the lack of PGC-1α. However, no compensatory regulation of PGC-1β gene expression in skeletal muscle of MKOs was observed. A surprising finding was that mice with a specific ablation of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle have increased signs of muscle fiber damage and regeneration. Under basal conditions, this damage does not lead to reduced muscle weight ( supplemental Fig. S4A). Despite the protection observed in PGC-1α muscle transgenic animals against denervation-induced muscle atrophy, MKOs show no increased propensity for disuse-mediated muscle atrophy ( supplemental Fig. S4A). Accordingly, expression of atrogenes that control muscle atrophy is not elevated ( supplemental Fig. S4B). Interestingly, the muscle injury in MKOs is dramatically exacerbated by physical activity. Different factors could contribute to the muscle pathology in MKOs. First, these animals have a reduction in mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with muscle damage in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (26Kuznetsov A.V. Winkler K. Wiedemann F.R. von Bossanyi P. Dietzmann K. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 183: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Timmons J.A. Larsson O. Jansson E. Fischer H. Gustafsson T. Greenhaff P.L. Ridden J. Rachman J. Peyrard-Janvid M. Wahlestedt C. Sundberg C.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, reactive oxygen species detoxification is crucially regulated by PGC-1α (28St.-Pierre J. Drori S. Uldry M. Silvaggi J.M. Rhee J. Jager S. Handschin C. Zheng K. Lin J. Yang W. Simon D.K. Bachoo R. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) and the levels of a number of reactive oxygen species detoxification genes are reduced in MKOs, including superoxide dismutase 1, superoxide dismutase 2, adenine nucleotide transporter, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (14Handschin C. Kobayashi Y.M. Chin S. Seale P. Campbell K.P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species cause membrane and protein modifications and have been causally linked to muscle damage (29Disatnik M.H. Dhawan J. Yu Y. Beal M.F. Whirl M.M. Franco A.A. Rando T.A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 161: 77-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that PGC-1α regulates the gene program involved in postsynaptic neuromuscular junction plasticity (14Handschin C. Kobayashi Y.M. Chin S. Seale P. Campbell K.P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). MKOs have a lower number of acetylcholine clusters on muscle fiber membranes (14Handschin C. Kobayashi Y.M. Chin S. Seale P. Campbell K.P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and thus might be insufficiently innervated. Finally, systemic inflammation, acute and chronic, is a strong promoter of skeletal muscle wasting. In MKOs, we observed increased levels of circulating cytokines interleukin 6 and TNFα. In particular, the rise in plasma TNFα levels paralleled the dramatic increase in muscle fiber damage post-exercise. TNFα is known to cause inflammatory myopathies in rodent models and human patients (30Salomonsson S. Lundberg I.E. Autoimmunity. 2006; 39: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Grundtman C. Lundberg I.E. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2006; 8: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis that increased systemic inflammation in MKOs might contribute to the myopathy is supported by other physiological and behavioral abnormalities in these mice. The decrease in body weight and fat mass, reduced physical activity, skeletal muscle damage, increased body temperature and basal metabolic rate, and diminished food intake4 are compatible with symptoms observed in animal models and human patients suffering from chronic inflammation. In summary, our findings both confirm data obtained from gain-of-function experimental models and provide novel, surprising insights into the function of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle. The results highlight the central role for PGC-1α to integrate motor neuron input and regulate gene programs involved in oxidative fiber-type determination and muscle fiber endurance. Furthermore, our data show that PGC-1α is important for maintaining skeletal muscle fiber integrity, especially after physical stress. The observation of inflammatory myopathy and overall signs of chronic inflammation in MKOs open novel avenues in our understanding of these devastating muscle diseases and might result in alternative ways of preventing and treating skeletal muscle dysfunctions.

Here, we characterized the capacity of physiological stimuli (for example, histamine and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate) and inducers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (for example, A23187, thapsigargin and tunicamycin) to release Ca2+ from ER stores, induce mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, and trigger cell death in human cervix and colon carcinoma cell lines. Sustained Ca2+ accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix induced by ER stress triggered signs of proapoptotic mitochondrial alteration, namely permeability transition, dissipation of the electrochemical potential, matrix swelling, relocalization of Bax to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria. In contrast, rapid and transient accumulation of Ca2+ induced by physiological stimuli failed to promote mitochondrial permeability transition and to affect cell viability. The specificity of this apoptosis pathway was validated in cells using a panel of pharmacological agents that chelate Ca2+ (BAPTA-AM) or inhibit inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R; 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate, NADH), the permeability transition pore (cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid), caspases (z-VAD-fmk) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide). Finally, we designed an original cell-free system in which we confronted purified mitochondria and ER vesicles, and identified IP3R, VDAC and the permeability transition pore as key proteins in the ER-triggered proapoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization process."

We report x-ray crystal structures of a resurrected ancestral protein—the ∼450 million-year-old precursor of vertebrate glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. Using structural, phylogenetic, and functional analysis, we identify the specific set of historical mutations that recapitulate the evolution of GR's hormone specificity from an MR-like ancestor. These substitutions repositioned crucial residues to create new receptor-ligand and intraprotein contacts. Strong epistatic interactions occur because one substitution changes the conformational position of another site. “Permissive” mutations—substitutions of no immediate consequence, which stabilize specific elements of the protein and allow it to tolerate subsequent function-switching changes—played a major role in determining GR's evolutionary trajectory."

The effect was observed for at least several weeks after encoding and may be irreversible.

This clock comprises a multicellular genetic network of synchronized oscillators, coupled by intercellular Delta-Notch signaling. How this synchrony is established and how its loss determines the position of segmentation defects in Delta and Notch mutants are unknown. We analyzed the clock's synchrony dynamics by varying strength and timing of Notch coupling in zebra-fish embryos with techniques for quantitative perturbation of gene function. We developed a physical theory based on coupled phase oscillators explaining the observed onset and rescue of segmentation defects, the clock's robustness against developmental noise, and a critical point beyond which synchrony decays. We conclude that synchrony among these genetic oscillators can be established by simultaneous initiation and self-organization and that the segmentation defect position is determined by the difference between coupling strength and noise."

In addition, Orai1 is found to exist both as dimers and oligomers in vivo (24Vig M. Beck A. Billingsley J.M. Lis A. Parvez S. Peinelt C. Koomoa D.L. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Kinet J.P.

However, the domains of Orai1 that account for the STIM1-Orai1 or Orai1-Orai1 interactions remain unknown. Here we explore this field by co-expressing different truncated forms of Orai1 and STIM1, observing their spatial co-localization, and recording reconstituted SOC Ca2+ entry signal and ICRAC current. Solutions and Chemicals—For intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measurements, we used standard extracellular Ringer's solution containing the following (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The CaCl2 was replaced by 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2 in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution. In patch clamp experiments, the standard external solution contained the following (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, 10 mm tetraethylammonium and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The divalent-free solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 10 EDTA, 10 mm tetraethylammonium, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 cesium glutamate, 8 MgCl2, 12 BAPTA, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH). Stock solutions of thapsigargin (TG) were prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 2 mm. External solutions were applied using a gravity-driven perfusion system, and the local solution was completely exchanged in less than 2 s. Fura-2/AM was purchased from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise specified all reagents and chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasmid Construction—pHluorin-STIM1, STIM1-mOrange, Orai1-EGFP, and Orai1-mOrange were constructed as previously described (21Xu P. Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The pH-sensitive fluorescent protein pHluorin was inserted immediately downstream of the predicted signal peptide region of human STIM1 (NM_003156) to produce pHluorin-STIM1. STIM1 tagged with different fluorescent proteins at either terminus exhibited identical spatial distribution, and either chimeric protein reconstituted SOC Ca2+ entry and large CRAC current when co-expressed with Orai1 (Figs. 3 and 5), indicating that they were functionally equivalent. To obtain the Orai1–3×FLAG construct, Oria1 cDNA (NM_032790) was amplified by PCR from human placenta cDNA library (Invitrogen), tagged with 3×FLAG, and ligated into a pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) vector. STIM1-ΔN(Δ23–200), STIM1-ΔC1 (Δ233–685), ΔC2 (Δ425–685), and ΔC3 (Δ672–685) were amplified by PCR from pHluorin-STIM1 and re-ligated into a KpnI- and EcoRI-digested pHluorin-STIM1 vector. Orai1-ΔN(Δ1–90), Orai1-ΔN73 (Δ1–73), Orai1-ΔC(Δ267–301), and Orai1-DΔ (Δ1–90 and Δ267–301) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-N1 plasmid, respectively. The N terminus of Orai1 (1–90) and pHluorin tagged transmembrane domain (266–288) of Sytaxin1A (Stx1A) were amplified from Orai1-EGFP and Stx1A-pHluorin, respectively (26Yang X. Xu P. Xiao Y. Xiong X. Xu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), ligated together in-frame by PCR and inserted into an EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) vector (Orai1-Nt-TM). Similarly, an EGFP fragment was amplified by PCR, fused in-frame with the transmembrane domain of Stx1A, and ligated in a pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) vector (EGFP-TM). All nucleotide sequences of constructs were verified by sequencing.FIGURE 5Orai1 is capable of forming functional CRAC channels without amino acids 1–73 at the cytoplasmic N terminus. A, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Orai1-EGFP and STIM1-mOrange, Orai1-ΔN73, and STIM1-mOrange. Non-transfected cells were used as controls. Cells were pre-loaded with fura-2/AM and stimulated with TG (1 μm) in the Ca2+-free solution to deplete the ER Ca2+ store. Averaged time course of store depletion induced Ca2+ entry in control HEK293 cells (circle, n = 27), cells expressed Orai1-ΔN73 and STIM1-mOrange (right-facing triangle, n = 20) and cells expressed Orai1-EGFP and STIM1-mOrange (square, n = 22).

G and I, the variances of CRAC current from F and H were plotted against mean currents and fitted with a linear function.

Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. One day prior to the experiment, cells were transferred onto round poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Expression levels of pHluorin-tagged STIM1 vectors or EGFP-tagged Orai1 vectors were quantified as the averaged fluorescence intensities obtained from transfected HEK293 cells under wide field illumination, as summarized in supplemental Fig. S1. For imaging experiments, transfected cells were viewed either under a confocal laser scanning microscope FV500 (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) with 60× oil objective lenses (numerical aperture (NA) = 1.40) or under total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) with 100× oil lenses (NA = 1.45). Detail information regarding the construction and application of confocal and TIRFM are described elsewhere (21Xu P. Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy experiments, we only showed the middle focal plane throughout this report unless otherwise specified. All images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Single Cell [Ca2+]i Measurement—Cells were preincubated with 6 μm fura-2/AM at room temperature for 30 min in standard Ringer's solution. [Ca2+]i was measured by a dual-wave-length excitation (340/380 nm) photometry system on an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with polychromatic xenon light source (TILL photonics, Gräfeling, Germany). The emission was collected at 510 ± 5 nm with a photodiode controlled by the TILL photometry system and X-Chart extension of Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the background-corrected fluorescence ratio R. Calibration parameters of Rmin (0.145), Rmax (4.069), and Keff (3.900 μm) were determined previously (28Chen L. Koh D.S. Hille B. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1723-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature using standard whole cell recording configuration. High resolution current recordings were acquired using the EPC-10 (HEKA). After establishment of the whole cell configuration, voltage ramps of 50-ms duration, spanning a range of -100 to +100 mV, were delivered from a holding potential of 20 mV every 2 s over a period of 300–500 s. All voltages were corrected for a liquid-junction potential of 10 mV. Currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at a rate of 20 kHz. Capacitive currents were determined and corrected before each voltage ramp. The amplitude of the current recorded at -80 mV was used to monitor the development of ICRAC current. The maximum CRAC currents at -100 mV were used for statistical analysis. For noise analysis, 300-ms sweeps were acquired at the rate of 20 kHz at a holding potential of -100 mV, followed by a 50-ms ramp from -100 to +100 mV. Data were filtered offline at 1 kHz. The mean current and variant were calculated from a 200-ms segment in each 300-ms sweep. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For transfection-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor tablets from Sigma-Aldrich), and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer. Proteins in the cell lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody according to the standard procedures. Data Analysis—Unless noted otherwise, all current traces were corrected for leak currents. Data analysis was conducted using IGOR Pro 5.01 (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). Averaged results were presented as the mean value ± S.E. with the number of experiments indicated. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test. Asterisks denote statistical significance as compared with control, with a p value less than 0.05 (*) and 0.01 (**). Interrogations of Functions of Different Domains in STIM1— To study the function of different domains of STIM1 in Ca2+ store depletion-induced STIM1 aggregation and interaction with Orai1, we constructed different truncated forms of STIM1 and co-expressed them with wild-type (WT) Orai1. As shown in Fig. 1A, STIM1-ΔN was devoid of the EF hand and SAM domains in the N terminus but retained the signal peptide; STIM1-ΔC1 was lacking the entire cytosolic C terminus, whereas STIM1-ΔC2 lacked the serine-proline-rich region and the polycationic residue region. The STIM1-ΔC3 mutant was truncated such that it lacked most of the polycationic residues in the C terminus. In accord with our previous data (21Xu P. Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), WT pHluorin-STIM1 displayed diffused ER distribution in the resting state; it migrated toward cell periphery and co-localized with Orai1-mOrange on the plasma membrane after store depletion (supplemental Fig. S2). Deletion of the EF-hand and SAM domain in the N terminus of STIM1 led to a spontaneously targeting of STIM1 to the plasma membrane that was independent of store depletion, as shown in the confocal images obtained from the same cell before and after TG (1 μm) pretreatment for at least 5 min (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity profile of STIM1-ΔN and Orai1-mOrange along the line that was imposed across the cell overlapped, indicative of spatial co-localization of these proteins. Consistent with the optical experiment, cells co-expressing WT Orai1 and STIM1-ΔN exhibited a elevated basal [Ca2+]i (supplemental Fig. S3A) and a spontaneously active inward current. The channel was blocked by 10 μm La3+ (supplemental Fig. S3C) and had a current voltage relationship similar to native CRAC channel (supplemental Fig. S3D), indicating that it represented a bona fide CRAC channel. Expressing the pHluorin-tagged ΔC1 mutant in HEK293 cells resulted in a diffuse ER distribution, which failed to aggregate into clusters upon ER Ca2+ store depletion (Fig. 2B). In contrast, STIM1-ΔC2 clusters were found in non-stimulated HEK293 cells, but many were not targeted to the cell periphery, as manifested by the fact that fluorescence intensity profile of STIM1-ΔC2 peaked in the cell interior in Fig. 2C. After store depletion, STIM1-ΔC2 clusters did not migrate to the surface membrane, neither did they co-localize with the WT Orai1 on the surface membrane. In parallel, SOC Ca2+ influx was inhibited in cells co-expressing Orai1-mOrange with either STIM1 mutant (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B), and no CRAC current was detected in these cells, either (supplemental Fig. S8). On the other hand, STIM1-ΔC3 exhibited normal ER distribution in rest condition; upon store depletion, they aggregated and migrated to the cell periphery and co-localized with Orai1-mOrange on the surface membrane, as shown by the overlapped fluorescence intensity profiles of the STIM1-ΔC3 and Orai1-mOrange along the lines that ran across the cell (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the STIM1-ΔC3 mutant was fully capable of reconstituting SOC influx when co-expressed with Oria1 in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Co-expressed STIM1-ΔC3 with Orai1 also produced large CRAC current (Fig. 3A). The I-V relationship of ICRAC current was not altered by expression of the STIM1-ΔC3 mutant (Fig. 3B), and the averaged current density was also similar in cells co-expressing STIM1-ΔC3 and Orai1-mOrange (30 ± 6 pA/picofarad, n = 8), as compared with cells co-expressing pHluorin-STIM1 and Orai1-mOrange (34 ± 5 pA/picofarad, n = 8). However, intracellular perfusion of BAPTA induced slower initiation of ICRAC current in cells co-expressing STIM1-ΔC3 and Orai1 (delay = 62 ± 11 s), as compared with cells co-expressing WT STIM1 and Orai1 (delay = 104 ± 23 s, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). This effect was not due to a difference in the exogenous fusion protein expressed, because overexpressed STIM1-ΔC3 and WT STIM1 were at a similar level (supplemental Fig. S1A). Taken together, these experiments indicate that different regions in STIM1 play different roles in clustering and migration of STIM and its functional interaction with Orai1 upon store depletion. Orai1 Interacts with STIM1 at Its Cytoplasmic C Terminus— Orai1 is reported to functionally and physically interact with STIM1 and Orai1 (24Vig M. Beck A. Billingsley J.M. Lis A. Parvez S. Peinelt C.

Yu Y. Safrina O. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To locate sites in Orai1 that were responsible for this interaction, we truncated Orai1-EGFP of cytoplasmic C terminus (Orai1-ΔC), N terminus (Orai1-ΔN), and both cytoplasmic C and N terminus (Orai1-DΔ). We also made a cytoplasmic N terminus of Orai1 fused to the trans-membrane domain of Syx1A tagged by pHluorin (Orai1-Nt-TM) (Fig. 1B). As a control, we have previously shown that overexpressed STIM1-mOrange in HEK293 cells aggregated into clusters that co-localized with Orai1-EGFP on the surface membrane after store depletion (21Xu P. Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In contrast, as observed using TIRFM in Fig. 4A, Orai1-ΔC on the surface membrane failed to aggregate and co-localize with overexpressed STIM1-mOrange clusters after Ca2+ store depletion by applying another sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump blocker tert-butylhydroquinone (100 μm). Moreover, neither significant store-operated Ca2+ entry (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B) nor CRAC current (supplemental Fig. S9) was observed in cells co-expressing Orai1-ΔC and STIM1-EGFP. In contrast, truncation of the cytoplasmic N terminus of Orai1 did not affect its cellular distribution, because Orai1-ΔN exhibited normal periphery distribution in rest conditions and co-localized with STIM1 clusters upon store depletion (Fig. 4B). Orai1-DΔ, where the double cytoplasmic region was removed, behaved similar to Orai1-ΔC when overexpressed with STIM1 (data not shown), implying that the cytoplasmic C terminus of Orai1 is crucial for its aggregation and co-localization with STIM1. This is further supported by the fact that overexpressed chimeric protein Orai1-Nt-TM, containing the cytoplasmic N terminus of Orai1, was targeted to the plasma membrane but failed to co-localize with STIM1 clusters after store depletion (Fig. 4C). Although Orai1-ΔN responded to store depletion with the same spatial rearrangement as the WT Orai1, it failed to reconstitute either SOC Ca2+ entry (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B) or CRAC current (supplemental Fig. S9) when co-expressed with STIM1, highlighting the essential role of cytoplasmic N terminus in CRAC channel opening. Amino Acids 74–90 in the Cytoplasmic N Terminus of Orai1 Are Required for CRAC Channel Activation—By comparing the amino acid sequence of the human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans Orai families (supplemental Fig. S5), we found that the amino acids from 74 to 90 in the cytoplasmic N terminus of Orai1 were highly conserved among different species. Therefore, we constructed a truncation sparing the conserved cytoplasmic N terminus (Orai1-ΔN73) (Fig. 1B). The amplitude of store-operated Ca2+ entry was increased by 2-fold in HEK293 cells co-expressed with Orai1-ΔN73 and STIM1-mOrange (1.1 ± 0.12 μm, n = 20), compared with non-transfected cells (0.36 ± 0.05 μm, n = 27, p < 0.001), as shown in Fig. 5 (A and B). Intracellular perfusion of high concentrations of BAPTA induced pronounced whole cell current in cells co-expressing Orai1-ΔN73 and STIM1-mOrange (Fig. 5C), which displayed similar CRAC channel characteristics such as an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship (Fig. 5D), an increase in divalent-free current in Ca2+-free bath solution, and first potentiation then inhibition of the current by 50 μm 2-APB (supplemental Fig. S6). However, co-expressing Orai1-ΔN73 and STIM1-mOrange in HEK293 cells only reconstituted ∼50% of the SOC Ca2+ entry, and ∼36% of ICRAC current compared with cells co-expressing STIM1-mOrange and Orai1-EGFP (Fig. 5, C and E). Such reduction of SOC Ca2+ entry and CRAC current is not due to a decreased expression of Orai1-ΔN73 (supplemental Fig. S1B), and Orai1-ΔN73 exhibited normal plasma membrane localization similar to WT Orai1, as examined using TIRFM (data not shown). To further explore the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the variance and averages of whole cell current to infer characteristics of a single CRAC channel. In cells overexpressing STIM1 and Orai1, the variance of CRAC current versus its amplitude could be best fitted with a line with slope of 3.0 ± 0.2 fA (Fig. 5G), which represented single CRAC channel current multiplied by the result of 1 subtracted by the channel opening probability (30Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This value was not different in cells co-transfected with Orai1-ΔN73 and STIM1 (3.0 ± 0.15 fA, Fig. 5I), indicating that single channel conductance might remain unaltered after truncating part of the N terminus of Orai1.

https://openalex.org/W2007796608,"Enzymes are exceptional catalysts that facilitate a wide variety of reactions under mild conditions, achieving high rate-enhancements with excellent chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivities. There is considerable interest in developing new enzymes for the synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals and as tools for molecular biology. Methods have been developed for modifying and improving existing enzymes through screening, selection and directed evolution. However, the design and evolution of truly novel enzymes has relied on extensive knowledge of the mechanism of the reaction. Here we show that genuinely new enzymatic activities can be created de novo without the need for prior mechanistic information by selection from a naive protein library of very high diversity, with product formation as the sole selection criterion. We used messenger RNA display, in which proteins are covalently linked to their encoding mRNA, to select for functional proteins from an in vitro translated protein library of >10(12 )independent sequences without the constraints imposed by any in vivo step. This technique has been used to evolve new peptides and proteins that can bind a specific ligand, from both random-sequence libraries and libraries based on a known protein fold. We now describe the isolation of novel RNA ligases from a library that is based on a zinc finger scaffold, followed by in vitro directed evolution to further optimize these enzymes. The resulting ligases exhibit multiple turnover with rate enhancements of more than two-million-fold."

https://openalex.org/W2026364882,"The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC), which provides one-quarter of the global meridional heat transport, is composed of a number of separate flow components. How changes in the strength of each of those components may affect that of the others has been unclear because of a lack of adequate data. We continuously observed the MOC at 26.5 degrees N for 1 year using end-point measurements of density, bottom pressure, and ocean currents; cable measurements across the Straits of Florida; and wind stress. The different transport components largely compensate for each other, thus confirming the validity of our monitoring approach. The MOC varied over the period of observation by +/-5.7 x 10(6) cubic meters per second, with density-inferred and wind-driven transports contributing equally to it. We find evidence for depth-independent compensation for the wind-driven surface flow."
https://openalex.org/W1968967592,"Cooperative breeding systems are characterized by nonbreeding helpers that assist breeders in offspring care. However, the benefits to offspring of being fed by parents and helpers in cooperatively breeding birds can be difficult to detect. We offer experimental evidence that helper effects can be obscured by an undocumented maternal tactic. In superb fairy-wrens ( Malurus cyaneus ), mothers breeding in the presence of helpers lay smaller eggs of lower nutritional content that produce lighter chicks, as compared with those laying eggs in the absence of helpers. Helpers compensate fully for such reductions in investment and allow mothers to benefit through increased survival to the next breeding season. We suggest that failure to consider maternal egg-investment strategies can lead to underestimation of the force of selection acting on helping in avian cooperative breeders."

Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14–21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later.

In vitro binding of [3H]U69,593 to KOR showed that Kd and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact.

Several reports have shown that agonist occupation of the KOR leads to the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylate cyclase, increase in potassium conductance, decrease in calcium conductance, and mobilization of intracellular calcium (6Piros E.T.

Two other KOR antagonists, guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI) and atrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine (JDTic), were subsequently generated (12Negus S.S. Mello N.K. Linsenmayer D.C.

Reports in rhesus monkeys have shown κ antagonist effects up to 21 days after a single injection of norBNI (14Butelman E.R. Negus S.S. Ai Y. deCosta B.R. Woods J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1269-1276PubMed Google Scholar). A single injection of norBNI in mice maintains continual blockade of KOR even after 3 weeks (17Horan P. Taylor J. Yamamura H.I. Porreca F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). GNTI and JDTic have similar long-lasting effects and produce antagonism for at least 10–14 days (12Negus S.S. Mello N.K. Linsenmayer D.C. Jones R.M. Portoghese P.S. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2002; 163: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Carroll, I., Thomas, J. B., Dyskstra, L. A., Granger, A. L., Allen, R. M., Howard, J. L., Pollard, G. T., Aceto, M. D., and Harris, L. S. (2004) 501, 111–119Google Scholar). These findings are surprising because these antagonists do not covalently bind to KOR (20Smith C.B. Medzihradsky F. Hollingsworth P.J. DeCosta B. Rice K.C. Woods J.H. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 328: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for this long duration of action is not clear. One explanation is that these drugs become physically trapped in the lipid membrane and do not clear easily from the nervous system. A second possibility is that these drugs are biotransformed in vivo to long-lasting metabolites that covalently bind to the receptor. An alternative hypothesis is that NorBNI, GNTI, and JDTic produce their long-lasting effects by acutely uncoupling the KOR signaling complex such that agonists can no longer activate the receptor to stimulate G-protein signaling. To distinguish these mechanisms, we first compared the duration of actions in mice for norBNI, GNTI, and JDTic. Building on these findings, we used receptor protection experiments and looked at both the functional and binding properties of KOR ligands. If transient occupancy of KOR by a readily reversible ligand could protect against receptor inactivation, the long-lasting antagonist must also produce its effects by transiently occupying the same binding site rather than by forming a drug depot in the brain. Using this strategy, we found that the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone and buprenorphine were able to protect KOR signaling. We further found that the long-lasting antagonists activate JNK in a KOR-dependent manner, and we found that that blockade of JNK activation significantly attenuated the long-lasting antagonism. Understanding how κ antagonists produce long-lasting effects has important implications for the ultimate utility of these agents as therapeutic tools. Recent studies have suggested that the antagonists might have antidepressant activity and also be useful in preventing relapse of drug abuse (21McLaughlin J.P. Marton-Popovici M. Chavkin C. J.

In addition, understanding how JNK activation by these drugs disrupts KOR signaling would provide new insight to opioid and GPCR signal transduction events. Chemicals—(–)U50,488, norBNI, and GNTI were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Buprenorphine was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Program (Bethesda, MD), and naloxone was from Sigma. JDTic was provided by Dr. F. I. Carroll (Research Triangle Institute, NC). All other drugs were purchased from Calbiochem. Drugs were dissolved in water or saline (for in vivo experiments) unless otherwise indicated. Animals and Housing—Male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 20–30 g (8–12 weeks old) were used in these experiments. Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free housing unit in the core animal facility at the University of Washington. Housing rooms were illuminated on a 12-h light-dark cycle with lights on at 7 a.m. Food pellets were available ad libitum. All animal procedures were approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with NIH guidelines. Breeding and Genotyping of MOR and KOR Knock-out Mice—Homozygous μ opioid receptor (MOR) and KOR knock-out (–/–) mice were prepared by homologous recombination as described (24Schuller A.G.

Animals were backcrossed for >10 generations with C57Bl/6 mice, and heterozygote breeding pairs were used to make homozygote MOR–/– mice and paired littermate controls for this study.

Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were grown as previously described (26McLaughlin J.P. Xu M. Mackie K. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34631-34640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with l-glutamine and 15 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells transfected with green fluorescent protein tagged KOR-GFP or MOR-GFP were maintained in the above media with an additional 200 μg/ml G418 to maintain selective pressure. Untransfected HEK293 cells for control experiments were grown in the absence of G418. Immunoblotting—KOR-GFP, MOR-GFP, and untransfected HEK293 cells were cultured as described above. Cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 for 18 h before to drug treatment. Cells were treated with U50,488 (10 μm), norBNI (1 μm), anisomycin (100 μm), naloxone (1 μm), GNTI (100 nm), or vehicle control for the appropriate time periods and then immediately lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1:100 phosphatase inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem), and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem). Lysates were sonicated (20 s, 4 °C) and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was stored at –20 °C. For spinal cord and striatal samples, mice were injected intraperitoneally with drug as indicated, tissue was dissected (60 min after final injection), and tissue was homogenized/lysed using a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer in buffer (as above). Total protein concentration was determined using Pierce bicinchronic assay with bovine serum albumin standards before loading 40 μg onto non-denaturing 10% bisacrylamide precast gels (Invitrogen) and running at 140 V for 1.5–2 h. Blots were transferred to nitrocellulose (Whatman, Middlesex, UK) for 1.5–2 h at 30 V. The nitrocellulose was then washed with TBS (5 min), blocked with 5% milk/TBST (60 min), washed with TBST (3 × 5 min), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) rabbit antibody or phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) rabbit antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). After overnight incubation, the blots were washed with TBST (3 × 10 min) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature in anti-rabbit IRDye800 diluted 1:10,000 in a 1:1 mixture of 5% milk/TBST and Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The blots were washed with TBST (3 × 5 min) and TBS (5 min) and then scanned on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The blots were re-probed with rabbit anti-β-actin diluted 1:2500 in 5% milk/TBST (2 h, room temperature) and secondary antibody (as above) to confirm equal protein loading. In Vivo Antinociceptive Testing—The response latency for the mouse to withdraw its tail after being immersed in 52 ± 1°C water was taken as the end point. A cut-off time of 15 s was used to prevent heat-related tissue damage. Radioligand Binding—Whole mouse brains with the cerebellum removed were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, followed by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Three brains were pooled for each independent replicate with the pellet collected as the membrane fraction. Homogenization and centrifugation were repeated twice more to wash the membrane fractions and remove residual ligand present in the preparation. After the final centrifugation step, excess buffer was removed, and the membranes were stored at –80 °C until use. Membranes were resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay. Samples were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with the KOR ligand [3H]U69,543. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm U50,488. GF/B glass fiber filters (Brandel) were preincubated for 90 min at room temperature with Tris buffer, 0.3% polyethyleneimine. After 90 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were placed on ice and collected with the filters with a Brandel 24 well harvester. Filters were washed 3× with cold Tris buffer and counted in 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid. For saturation binding, [3H]U69,543 was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.156 to 20 nm. Radioligand concentrations were confirmed by scintillation count of free ligand. Data Analysis—Immunoblots were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Bioscience, Lincoln, NE). Band intensity of both phospho-p54 and phospho-p46 (JNK1 and -2) was measured together using the Odyssey software, which subtracts background and calculates band density in pixels. Data were normalized to a percentage of control sample band intensity (basal, 100%) and plotted using GraphPad (GraphPad Prism 4.0, San Diego, CA) software. Concentrationresponse curves and saturation binding isotherms were fit using non-linear regression (Prism 4.0), and Scatchard plots were fit using linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 as determined by the Student's t test or ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test where appropriate. NorBNI, GNTI, and JDTic Produce Long-lasting Antagonism for 14–21 Days—Treatment of mice with a single dose of norBNI (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) resulted in significant blockade of U50,488 (KOR agonist)-mediated analgesic responses 24 h through 21 days after initial injection as measured by tail withdrawal assay (Fig. 1, A and B). However, 28 days after injection, residual norBNI effects were absent, with no difference between norBNI and saline-injected groups evident at this time point. This slow rate of recovery of analgesic activity of U50,488 is the same as after treatment of mice with the receptor alkylating drug β-chlornaltrexamine (27McLaughlin J.P. Myers L.C. Zarek P.E. Caron M.G. Leftkowitz R.J. Czyzyk T.A. Pintar J.E. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1810-1818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the results suggest that recovery of response requires new receptor synthesis. Further characterization of other KOR antagonists showed similar long durations of action in the analgesic assay. Single injection of GNTI (10 mg/kg) resulted in sustained and significant KOR antagonism that persisted for 21 days (Fig. 1B). JDTic (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) also showed robust KOR antagonism for 14 days, and its effect reversed only at day 21 (Fig. 1B). Naloxone, a non-selective, competitive opioid receptor antagonist, produced transient KOR antagonism and did not block U50,488 analgesia on day 2 or during the duration of the experiment (Fig. 1B). For comparison, a single injection of the agonist U50,488 (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was also found not to produce long-lasting effects, demonstrating that opioid tolerance did not underlie the long-lasting antagonism by norBNI, JDTic, and GNTI. These results are consistent with prior reports and demonstrate that norBNI, GNTI, and JDTic all have long durations of antagonist activity in mice.FIGURE 1NorBNI, JDTic, and GNTI produce long-lasting antagonism in mice.A, mice were given a single injection of norBNI (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or saline, and tail withdrawal latencies were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” at the specified time points 30 min after an injection of U50,488 (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally).

NorBNI and GNTI had similar time courses for KOR antagonism. JDTic produced significant KOR antagonism for 14 days. Naloxone and U50,488 did not produce long-lasting effects on KOR-mediated analgesic responses.

Mice were pretreated with naloxone (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) (non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist) to block available KOR binding sites before injection of norBNI. If norBNI remained in the brain, then once naloxone cleared the system, residual norBNI would again have access to KOR and cause blockade. Surprisingly, in this experiment naloxone given 15 min before norBNI (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) significantly blocked the reduction in U50,488 response measured on day 8 after norBNI injection (Fig. 2A). To further test this result we next used buprenorphine, which is a mixed acting opioid ligand with partial agonist activity at MOR and competitive antagonist activity at KOR (28Sadee W. Rosenbaum J.S. Herz A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 223: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar, 29Young A.M. Stephens K.R. Hein D.W. Woods J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 229: 118-126PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the potential confounding effects of partial agonist activity at MOR, we assessed the protective effects of buprenorphine in MOR knock-out mice (MOR–/–). Injection of mice with buprenorphine (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 60 min before injection of norBNI (10 mg/kg) significantly protected KOR from norBNI antagonism (day 8) (Fig. 2B). Mice pretreated with buprenorphine before norBNI responded to the U50,488 challenge with the same increase in tail-flick latency as mice not pretreated with norBNI or pretreated with buprenorphine alone. Buprenorphine alone did not produce analgesia in MOR–/– mice and did not produce sustained KOR antagonism measured on day 8. Together these results suggest that the long duration of action of norBNI was not due to the pharmacokinetic properties of norBNI but, instead, by norBNI acting at the receptor to produce changes in KOR functioning. NorBNI Does Not Alter KOR Binding Characteristics—Single injections of norBNI followed by saturation binding experiments 1 week later were performed to assess whether norBNI exposure affected KOR receptor agonist affinity or KOR receptor density. Mice were injected with norBNI (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and brain membranes were prepared on day 8 for radioligand binding. Using the selective agonist [3H]U69,593, we found no significant difference in the total receptor density (Bmax) or the affinity for κ agonist (Kd) between norBNI-treated (Bmax = 21 ± 2 fmol/mg of protein, Kd = 1.65 ± 0.4 nm) and saline-treated (Bmax = 21 ± 1 fmol/mg of protein, Kd = 1.0 ± 0.2 nm) mouse brain membranes taken 7 days after injection of norBNI (Fig. 3A and Table 1). These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that norBNI does not form a covalent bond to the receptor and does not decrease apparent receptor number (20Smith C.B. Medzihradsky F. Hollingsworth P.J. DeCosta B. Rice K.C. Woods J.H. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 328: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar, 30Takemori A.E. Begona Ho Y.B. Neaseth J.S. Portoghese P.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In this experiment mice were pretreated with buprenorphine (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 1 h before injection of norBNI (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and membranes were prepared on day 8 after these initial injections. There was also no significant change in either the Bmax or Kd of [3H]U69,593 (Fig. 3B and Table 1), further supporting the conclusion that the long duration of action of norBNI cannot be attributed to changes in receptor density or affinity. NorBNI Activates c-Jun N-terminal Kinase in a KOR-dependent Manner—Previous studies have shown that norBNI acts as an antagonist for KOR-mediated signal transduction (6Piros E.T. Hales T.G.

For example norBNI has been shown to block the KOR-mediated inhibition of cAMP, activation of inward rectifying potassium channel, and increased ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (6Piros E.T.

While performing pilot MAPK studies in KOR-transfected cells, we were surprised to find that norBNI treatment activated JNK and hypothesized that JNK activation may be involved in its long-lasting effects. In KOR-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells, we found that treatment with U50,488 (1 h, 37 °C) caused a concentration-dependent (EC50 = 1240 ± 180 nm) increase in phospho-JNK activity. Maximal activation of JNK by U50,488 was evident at the 1-h time point, with the response returning to basal levels at 3 h (data not shown). The endogenous κ opioid peptide dynorphin (1 h, 37 °C) also increased phospho-JNK in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 87 ± 13 nm) (Fig. 4, A and C, Table 1), although with a much lower efficacy than U50,488. Unexpectedly, norBNI treatment (1 h, 37 °C) also caused a concentration-dependent increase (EC50 = 158 ± 18 nm) in phospho-JNK in KOR-GFP expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, B and C, Table 1). JDTic also caused a concentration-dependent (EC50 = 5 ± 3 nm) increase in phospho-JNK (Table 1) in KOR-GFP HEK293 cells. The competitive KOR antagonist, buprenorphine, however, did not elicit any JNK response in these cells, suggesting that this effect was characteristic of long acting KOR antagonists (Fig. 4, B and C, Table 1). To confirm that norBNI would produce KOR antagonism under these conditions, we measured U50,488-induced phospho-ERK1/2 activation in KOR-GFP expressing HEK293 cells. In these experiments norBNI treatment completely blocked KOR-dependent (U50,488-treated) phospho-ERK1/2 activation but in the same cells increased phospho-JNK activity (Fig. 5A). In addition, selectivity for KOR-induced phospho-JNK was confirmed by stimulating untransfected HEK293 cells with KOR ligands under the same conditions. NorBNI, JDTic, GNTI, and U50,488 (10 μm, 1 h, 37 °C) did not increase phospho-JNK in untransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B). Anisomycin (100 μm, 15 min, 37 °C), the stress kinase activator, increased phospho-JNK by greater than 2-fold as expected, confirming that JNK signaling is intact in these untransfected HEK293 cells. Additionally, we stimulated MOR-GFP expressing HEK293 cells with norBNI (10 μm, 1 h, 37 °C) (Fig. 5B, inset) and found that there was no effect on phospho-JNK by possible"
https://openalex.org/W2029865335,"Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor, activates p53 by disrupting p53-HDM2 association. In this study, we found that Nutlin-3 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism for Nutlin-3-induced cell death. Like p53, its homolog p73 transactivates proapoptotic genes and induces cell death. Since HDM2, a key negative regulator of p53, also binds to and inhibits p73, we asked whether p73 could mediate Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that Nutlin-3 inhibits endogenous binding between the proapoptotic p73 isoform TAp73alpha and HDM2 in p53-null cells. Dissociation of p73 and HDM2 leads to increased p73 transcriptional activity with upregulation of p73 target genes noxa, puma and p21, as well as enhanced apoptosis. p73 knockdown by siRNA results in rescue of Nutlin-3-treated cells, indicating that Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis is, at least in part, p73 dependent. In addition, Nutlin-3 treatment increases TAp73alpha protein levels with prolongation of p73 half-life. These results provide the first evidence that Nutlin-3 disrupts endogenous p73-HDM2 interaction and enhances the stability and proapoptotic activities of p73 and thus, provides a rationale for the use of Nutlin-3 in the large number of human tumors in which p53 is inactivated."
https://openalex.org/W1998398342,"Because of the long Fermi wavelength of itinerant electrons, the quantum limit of elemental bismuth (unlike most metals) can be attained with a moderate magnetic field. The quantized orbits of electrons shrink with increasing magnetic field. Beyond the quantum limit, the circumference of these orbits becomes shorter than the Fermi wavelength. We studied transport coefficients of a single crystal of bismuth up to 33 tesla, which is deep in this ultraquantum limit. The Nernst coefficient presents three unexpected maxima that are concomitant with quasi-plateaus in the Hall coefficient. The results suggest that this bulk element may host an exotic quantum fluid reminiscent of the one associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect and raise the issue of electron fractionalization in a three-dimensional metal."
https://openalex.org/W2082179591,"Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds the ligand for receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANKL) to prevent association with its receptor RANK and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. OPG has been reported, recently, to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL)-induced tumor cell apoptosis. This raises the possibility that OPG may play a unique role in regulating these two signaling pathways. However, there are little data on the interactions between OPG, RANKL, and TRAIL, and the relative affinity of OPG for these two ligands is unknown. In the present study we examined the ability of OPG to bind native human TRAIL and RANKL under physiological conditions. Native TRAIL was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and shown to induce human myeloma cell apoptosis. OPG inhibited native TRAIL from binding the TRAILR1 at 37 °C in vitro. Similarly, OPG prevented RANKL from binding to RANK. TRAIL also prevented OPG-mediated inhibition of RANKL from binding RANK. The affinity of OPG for native TRAIL and RANKL at 37 °C was determined by plasmon surface resonance analysis. OPG had a binding affinity for TRAIL of 45 nm, whereas the affinity of OPG for RANKL was 23 nm. These data suggest that OPG can bind both RANKL and TRAIL and that the affinity of OPG for these two ligands is of a similar order of magnitude. Furthermore, OPG prevented TRAIL-mediated reductions in cell viability, whereas TRAIL inhibited OPG-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in vitro. This highlights the pivotal role of OPG in regulating the biology of both RANKL and TRAIL.

This process is mediated by the removal of bone by osteoclasts and its subsequent replacement by osteoblasts. Disruptions to the normal, coupled, activity of these cell types leads to skeletal disorders. The activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts is regulated by the concerted actions of specific messengers, including hormones, adhesion molecules, local growth factors, and cytokines. One family of cytokines that plays a central role in regulating osteoclast cell function is the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 2The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor-necrosis factor; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin; DR4 and -5, death receptors 4 and 5; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; TRAILR1, TRAIL receptor 1.2The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor-necrosis factor; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin; DR4 and -5, death receptors 4 and 5; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; TRAILR1, TRAIL receptor 1. superfamily (1Bodmer J.-L. Kim P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Although a number of TNF family members has been shown to regulate osteoclast formation and function, one system has been shown to play a central role. This is the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/ligand for receptor activator of NFκB (RANKL)/receptor activator of NFκB (RANK) pathway (2Blair J.M. Kim H. Siebel M.J. Dunstan C.R. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2006; 3: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Osteoprotegerin was first identified through screening a fetal rat intestinal cDNA library, searching an expressed sequence tag data base, and by direct purification from the supernatant derived from human fibroblasts (3Simonet W.S.

Analysis of the protein sequence identified structural motifs that were similar to those seen in members of the TNF receptor family, and thus OPG was identified as a new member of the TNF receptor family (3Simonet W.S.

However, OPG lacks a transmembrane domain and, unlike the majority of members of this family, is secreted into the extracellular space (7Tomoyashy A. Kim M. Fujise N. Mochizuki S. Yasuda H. Morinaga T. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a ligand for OPG was identified using an expression cloning strategy (8Lacey D.L. Kim E. Tan H.-L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliot R. Colombero A. Elliot G. Scully S. Hsu H. Sullivan J. Hawkins N. Davy E. Capparelli C. Eli A. Qian Y.-X. Kaufman S. Sarosi I. Shalhoub V. Senaldi G. Guo J. Delaney J. Boyle W.J.

The ligand was shown to be identical to two previously described proteins that regulate dendritic cell and mature T-cell survival, the receptor activator of RANKL and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (10Anderson D.M. Kim E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 11Wong B.R. Kim J.

RANKL is expressed as a membrane-bound protein; however, this molecule can be cleaved by a specific protease to produce a soluble form that retains biological activity (12Lum L. Kim B.R. Josien R. Becherer J.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Schlondorff J. Tempst P. Choi Y. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13613-13618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Finally, a cognate receptor that mediates RANKL activity was identified by genomic analysis of a primary osteoclast precursor cell cDNA library (13Hsu H. Kim D. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.-L. Elliot G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.-Z. Elliot R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). This molecule was shown to be identical to the receptor activator of RANK (10Anderson D.M. Kim E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). RANKL has been shown to stimulate osteoclast formation in vitro, whereas, both recombinant and purified native OPG have been shown to inhibit osteoclast formation and activity. Hepatic overexpression of OPG in mice results in osteopetrosis, whereas inactivation of the OPG gene leads to osteoporosis. Furthermore, inactivation of RANKL in mice leads to osteopetrosis. These studies have highlighted the critical nature of this system in regulating normal skeletal biology. Within this system OPG plays a critical role in regulating osteoclast formation and preventing uncontrolled bone resorption.OPG has recently been shown to bind another ligand, the TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) (14Emery J.G. Kim P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). TRAIL (Apo2L) is also a member of the TNF superfamily (1Bodmer J.-L. Kim P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). TRAIL functions as a homotrimer and mediates its biological activity through four TRAIL receptors (15LeBlanc H.N. Kim A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Two of these receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4 or TRAILR1) and death receptor 5 (DR5 or TRAILR2), contain death domain motifs and promote apoptosis. In contrast, the other two receptors, DcR1, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain, and DcR2, which contains only a partial death domain, are unable to induce apoptosis and function as decoy receptors. TRAIL binding to DR4 or DR5 results in signaling through the death-inducing signaling complex and induces apoptosis in tumor cells but appears to lack activity against normal cells. Blocking TRAIL activity in vivo has been shown to promote tumor development and increase liver metastasis, and mice deficient in TRAIL have increased metastasis and tumor growth (16Takeda K. Kim Y.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5586-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These data suggest that one of the normal physiological roles of TRAIL is in immune surveillance. More recently, TRAIL has been shown to prevent OPG from inhibiting RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro (20Zauli G. Kim E. Nicolin V. Melloni E. Celeghini C. Secchiero P. Blood. 2004; 104: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OPG produced by tumor cells or osteoblasts is able to prevent TRAIL-induced apoptosis of tumor cells (21Holen I. Kim P.I. Hamdy F.C. Eaton C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1619-1623PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shipman C.M. Kim P.I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 912-916PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with OPG playing a pivotal role in regulating these two TNF pathways, the RANKL/RANK system and the TRAIL/TRAILR system. However, there are only limited data investigating the binding of OPG to RANKL and TRAIL, and these studies utilize non-native proteins and at non-physiological temperatures. Indeed, binding studies have suggested that the affinity of OPG for RANKL may be as much as 200 times greater than for TRAIL (23Truneh A. Kim S. Silvermn C. Khandekar S. Reddy M.P. Deen K.C. Mclaughlin M.M. Srinivasula S.M. Livi G.P. Marshall L.A. Alnemri E.S. Williams W.V. Doyle M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23319-23325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This has been used to argue that the OPG-TRAIL interaction is of limited biological importance. However, this conclusion is not supported by data generated in complex cell-based systems in vitro (21Holen I. Kim P.I. Hamdy F.C. Eaton C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1619-1623PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shipman C.M. Kim P.I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 912-916PubMed Google Scholar).Thus, the nature of the binding of native OPG with RANKL and TRAIL at physiological temperature is poorly understood, and there are no data directly comparing the binding affinity of OPG for RANKL and TRAIL. Therefore, in the present study we have investigated the ability of OPG to bind to both RANKL and TRAIL and prevent association with their cognate receptors. We have also investigated the ability of TRAIL to prevent OPG from inhibiting RANKL binding RANK and determined the binding affinity of OPG for RANKL and TRAIL under physiological conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strain XL1 Blue MRF: D(mcrA)183 D(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)173 endA1 supE44 Thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lac [F_proAb lacIqZDM15 Tn10 (Tetr)] (Stratagene) was used for cloning, stable propagation, and preparation of plasmid DNA. E. coli BL21 (F, ompT, hsdSB, gal, dcm), an OmpT-negative, protease-deficient strain, was used as a plasmid host for all TRAIL expression experiments (24Studier F.W. Kim B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4788) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin.Cloning of the TRAIL Gene—IMAGE Consortium human TRAIL cDNA clone 5504670 (Geneservice Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used as a source for cloning. The TRAIL gene was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) (25Lundberg K.S. Kim D.D. Adams M.W. Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Mathur E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The forward primer carried an EcoRI restriction site and overlapped the coding sequence for amino acids 114-119. The reverse primer was designed to overlap the sequence coding for amino acids 277-281 and contained a BamHI restriction site. After amplification the PCR product was gel-purified, incubated with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned into the vector pUC18 (26Yanisch-Perron C. Kim J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11424) Google Scholar) under the control of the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible lac promoter. The ligation mixture was electroporated into competent E. coli XL1BlueMRF cells, and transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones using the alkaline-extraction method (27Birnboim H.C. Kim J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9847) Google Scholar) and analyzed for the presence of the TRAIL insert. The representative plasmid was designated pTRAIL1. All other general DNA manipulations were performed as previously described (28Sambrook J. Kim E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar).DNA Sequence Determination—The TRAIL insert in plasmid pTRAIL1 was sequenced using the dye termination method with an ABI Big Dye sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence analysis was performed using MacVector and AssemblyLIGN (International Biotechnologies, Cambridge, UK) software packages.TRAIL Protein Purification—Cells from an overnight 3-ml culture were used to inoculate 400 ml of LB medium. The culture was grown to an A550 nm of 0.5 (mid-log phase). TRAIL expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Incubation was continued for 3 h, and bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl buffer containing lysozyme, sodium deoxycholate, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and a crude lysate was obtained by sonification. The lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was treated with polyethyleneimine to remove DNA. Protein was recovered by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against loading buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6). The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0 to 1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing TRAIL protein were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl buffer, and loaded onto a nickel-chelating HiTrap column (GE Healthcare). The elution was performed using a 1-250 mm linear imidazole gradient. Fractions containing TRAIL were concentrated using a VIVASPIN concentration device (Vivascience), and the protein was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 matrix column (GE Healthcare). A Detoxi-Gel™ AffinityPak™ Pre-packed Column (Pierce) was used to remove bacterial endotoxin.Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Protein fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) using a 12% polyacrylamide separating gel and blotted onto BioTrace™ PVDF membrane (PALL Life Sciences) using a Trans-blot SD semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After staining and drying, the excised bands were used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Unstained membrane was probed by Western blot analysis using an anti-TRAIL antibody (R&D Systems) and detected with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO) and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as a substrate (Sigma).N-terminal Protein Sequence Determination and MALDI-TOF Analysis—N-terminal sequence was determined by Dr. J. N. Keen in the BioMolecular Analysis Facility, School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, UK. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed by the Aberdeen Protein Facility, Department of Medical Sciences, Aberdeen University, UK.Assessment of TRAIL Bioactivity—TRAIL bioactivity was assessed on the human myeloma cell line RPMI-8226 using a colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (30Schneider P. Kim N. Bodmer J.-L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial 2-fold dilutions of TRAIL (200-50 ng/ml in 50 μl), prepared in RPMI 1640 culture media, were added to the wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate. RPMI-8226 human myeloma cells (50 μl of 105/ml) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 20 μl of CellTiter96® AQueous One Solution Reagent containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and phenazine ethosulfate (PES) (Promega, Madison, WI) were added to each well. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured after 2 h. Wells containing cells only in the absence of TRAIL and wells containing medium only were used as controls. The ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis of RPMI-8226 cells was determined by assessing changes in nuclear morphology and using a fluorescence in situ nick translation assay as described previously (22Shipman C.M. Kim P.I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 912-916PubMed Google Scholar).Assessment of OPG-RANKL and OPG-TRAIL Interactions Using a Solid-phase Assay—Measurement of the direct interaction between the RANK, RANKL, OPG, and TRAIL proteins was performed using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. The capacity of OPG to directly inhibit RANKL binding to RANK was investigated using the following approach. RANK (R&D Systems), 50 ng in 0.1 ml of carbonate/bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.0), was bound to 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 2, Dynex) by incubation overnight at 37 °C. Wells were washed with washing buffer (0.005% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) and blocked for 2 h with 2% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were incubated with 0.1 ml of buffer containing 25 ng/ml RANKL (R&D Systems) and increasing concentration of OPG (R&D Systems, range 25-800 ng). Control wells contained RANKL protein only. For comparison, wells containing a constant concentration of RANKL and an increasing concentration of RANK protein (range 25-800 ng per well) were prepared. RANKL bound to RANK was detected with an anti-RANKL antibody (diluted 1:500; 0.1 ml per well) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, the plate was incubated with a secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:500, 0.1 ml per well, DAKO). Wells were incubated with the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), and color was measured at 490 nm.In separate experiments, the capacity of OPG to inhibit TRAIL binding to its receptor R1 was investigated using an identical approach. TRAILR1 (R&D Systems), 50 ng in 0.1 ml of carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, was bound to a microtiter plate. After washing and blocking, wells were incubated with a fixed concentration of TRAIL (0.1 ml of 25 ng/ml) and increasing concentrations of OPG or soluble TRAILR1 (range 25-800 ng per well). The concentration of bound TRAIL was assessed using an anti-TRAIL antibody (R&D Systems).The potential of TRAIL to inhibit OPG from binding to RANKL was investigated using an identical protocol. RANK (50 ng in 0.1 ml) was bound to wells and incubated with a fixed concentration of RANKL and OPG (25 ng each per well) and variable concentrations of TRAIL (range 25-800 ng per well). RANKL bound to RANK was detected with an anti-RANKL antibody. All assays were performed in triplicate.Plasmon Surface Resonance Analysis of OPG-RANKL and OPG-TRAIL Interactions—The affinity of OPG for RANKL and TRAIL was determined using a BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor (BIAcore AB) and a resonance equilibrium method (31Karlsson R. Kim A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). A streptavidin sensor chip, SA5, was conditioned with 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOH. Biotinylated anti-OPG antibody (R&D Systems) was injected over the flow cell until the response reached 1000 response units. OPG (100 nm) was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until 500 response units were immobilized. Increasing concentrations of RANKL or TRAIL (range 1-200 mm) were injected at 5 μl/min for 4 min, and the responses were recorded. The chip surface was regenerated to baseline after each cycle with 5 mm HCl. The resonance signal measured on the reference cell (containing anti-OPG antibody only) was subtracted from the signal measured on the experimental flow cell. All experiments were performed at 20 °C and 37 °C, and all sensograms were corrected for buffer injection. Results were fitted into 1 to 1 binding model using BIAevaluation software 3.1 (BIAcore AB), and equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated.Assessing the Ability of TRAIL to Block OPG-induced Inhibition of Osteoclast Formation—Mouse mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) and seeded onto glass coverslips in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 per well in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 2 h the coverslips were washed and further incubated in medium (0.2 ml per well) containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (25 ng/ml, R&D Systems), and recombinant human RANKL (30 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of OPG (50 ng/ml) or OPG in combination with TRAIL (500 ng/ml). The cells were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C, and osteoclasts were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity using an acid phosphatase kit (Sigma). The number of TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclasts was counted under light microscopy.Statistical Analysis—All data are represented as mean ± S.E. Concentration response relationships were analyzed by analysis of variance with a Scheffe post hoc test.RESULTSSoluble Extracellular Domain of the TRAIL Protein, Expressed in E. coli, Is Biologically Active—An high fidelity PCR-amplified extracellular segment of the TRAIL gene was cloned into a pUC18-based vector under the control of inducible lac promoter. After induction, the bacterial pellet was successfully processed to obtain protein. Following cell lysis, insoluble particles and DNA were removed, and the cell lysate was subjected to cation exchange, affinity, and gel-filtration chromatography to obtain pure soluble TRAIL (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis confirmed that the purified protein reacted with a specific anti-TRAIL antibody (Fig. 1B). The authenticity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid analysis, which showed the sequence Val-Arg-Glu-Arg-Gly-Pro-Gln, and was confirmed to be identical to the published sequence. MALDI-TOF analysis further confirmed the expressed protein to be TRAIL. Biological activity was assessed by measuring the cytotoxic activity of purified TRAIL on the human myeloma cell line RPMI-8226. Increasing concentrations of TRAIL were shown to reduce cell viability (Fig. 2A). At concentrations of 50-100 ng/ml TRAIL cell viability was reduced by >90%. To confirm that the reduction in viability is a consequence of increasing apoptosis, RPMI-8226 cells were treated with TRAIL, and nuclei were examined following staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Nuclei were shown to have condensed chromatin and the presence of apoptotic bodies, both features consistent with apoptosis (Fig. 2B). The in situ nick translation assay confirmed that the TRAIL protein promoted an increase in tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2Cloned TRAIL is biologically active. Recombinant human TRAIL expressed in E. coli reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis in the human myeloma cell line RPMI-8226.

TRAIL receptor was bound to a microtiter plate and incubated with a fixed amount of TRAIL and increasing concentrations of OPG or soluble TRAILR1. An anti-TRAIL antibody was used to establish the amount of bound TRAIL. Soluble TRAILRI inhibited TRAIL from binding immobilized receptor in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.001, Fig. 3A). OPG was also able to dose-dependently inhibit TRAIL from binding to the TRAILR1 at 37 °C (p < 0.005), suggesting that OPG could partially compete with the TRAILR1 for TRAIL (Fig. 3B). The magnitude of inhibition was reduced when compared with soluble TRAILR1; however, inhibition was still seen at concentrations of 25 ng/ml and higher.FIGURE 3OPG prevents TRAIL binding TRAIL receptor R1. Microtiter plates containing bound TRAIL receptor R1 were incubated with samples containing a constant amount of TRAIL (25 ng) and increasing amounts of TRAILR1 (A) or OPG (B). After washing, the plates were incubated with biotinylated anti-TRAIL antibody, and bound antibody was visualized with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and the chromogenic substrate, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride.

Therefore, agents that preserve or restore vascular integrity have important therapeutic implications. In this study, we explored the regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated enhancement of EC barrier function via CD44 isoforms. We observed that HGF promoted c-Met association with CD44v10 and recruitment of c-Met into caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM) containing CD44s (standard form). Treatment of EC with CD44v10-blocking antibodies inhibited HGF-mediated c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met recruitment to CEM. Silencing CD44 expression (small interfering RNA) attenuated HGF-induced recruitment of c-Met, Tiam1 (a Rac1 exchange factor), cortactin (an actin cytoskeletal regulator), and dynamin 2 (a vesicular regulator) to CEM as well as HGF-induced trans-EC electrical resistance. In addition, silencing Tiam1 or dynamin 2 reduced HGF-induced Rac1 activation, cortactin recruitment to CEM, and EC barrier regulation. We observed that both HGF- and high molecular weight hyaluronan (CD44 ligand)-mediated protection from lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability was significantly reduced in CD44 knock-out mice, thus validating these in vitro findings in an in vivo murine model of inflammatory lung injury. Taken together, these results suggest that CD44 is an important regulator of HGF/c-Met-mediated in vitro and in vivo barrier enhancement, a process with essential involvement of Tiam1, Rac1, dynamin 2, and cortactin.

Disruption of this semi-selective cellular barrier is a critical feature of inflammation as well as an important contributing factor to atherosclerosis and tumor angiogenesis (3Dudek S.M.

Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Our prior study indicated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, promotes EC barrier function (5Liu F. Schaphorst K.L. Verin A.D. Jacobs K. Birukova A. Day R.M. Bogatcheva N. Bottaro D.P. Garcia J.G.N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 950-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely defined. The HGF receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, is a disulfide-linked αβ-heterodimer that has been identified previously as a proto-oncogene (6Gao C.F. Vande Woude G.F. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Hammond D.E. Carter S. Clague M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol Immunol. 2004; 286: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar). The 170-kDa c-Met precursor is glycosylated and then cleaved into a 50-kDa extracellular α-chain and a 140-kDa membrane-spanning β-chain. The c-Met protein serves as the high affinity receptor for its natural ligand, HGF (also called scatter factor), a paracrine factor produced by stromal and mesenchymal cells, acting on c-Met-expressing cells, including EC (7Hammond D.E. Carter S. Clague M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol Immunol. 2004; 286: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kermorgant S. Parker P.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activation of the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway, which requires phosphorylation of various specific tyrosine residues on c-Met itself, leads to cellular responses, including increased proliferation, scattering (cell-cell repulsion), increased motility, invasion, and branching morphogenesis (7Hammond D.E. Carter S. Clague M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol Immunol. 2004; 286: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kermorgant S. Parker P.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the cell-surface receptor for hyaluronan, CD44, which we have also shown to serve as a barrier regulatory receptor (9Singleton P.A. Dudek S.M. Ma S.-F. Garcia J.G.N. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the role of CD44 in HGF/c-Met-mediated EC barrier enhancement is completely unexplored. There are multiple CD44 isoforms, which result from extensive alternative exon splicing events (14Lokeshwar V.B. Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol.

Kryworuchko M. Kumar A. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2004; 52: 13-26PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu D. Zhu H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The variable primary amino acid sequence of different CD44 isoforms is further modified by extensive N- and O-glycosylations and glycosaminoglycan additions (17Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu D. Zhu H. Front.

In this study, we extend our earlier work to explore CD44 as an important regulator of HGF/c-Met-mediated EC barrier enhancement both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel findings indicate that HGF/c-Met-mediated, CD44-regulated CEM signaling promotes Tiam1/dynamin 2-dependent Rac1 activation and peripheral recruitment of cortactin, processes essential for EC barrier integrity. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which HGF promotes increased EC barrier function may lead to novel treatments for diseases involving vascular barrier disruption, including inflammation, tumor angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and acute lung injury.

Human lung EC were then transfected with siRNA using siPORT™ Amine (Ambion) as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (∼ 40% confluent) were serum-starved for 1 h, followed by incubation with 3 μm (1.5 μm each siRNA) target siRNA (or scrambled siRNA or no siRNA) for 6 h in serum-free medium. Serum-containing medium was then added (10% serum final concentration) for 42 h before biochemical experiments and/or functional assays were conducted.

After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with either rat anti-CD44 or mouse anti-c-Met antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rat IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence. Measurement of EC Electrical Resistance—EC were grown to confluence in polycarbonate wells containing evaporated gold microelectrodes, and trans-EC electrical resistance (TER) measurements were performed using an electrical cell substrate impedance sensing system obtained from Applied Biophysics as described previously in detail (4Garcia J.G.N.

TER values from each microelectrode were pooled at discrete time points and plotted versus time as the means ± S.E. Rac1 Activation Assay—Rac1 activity assays in human lung EC were performed as described previously (40Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Determination of Complex Formation between Dynamin 2 and Cortactin/Caveolin-1—Solubilized CEM proteins in immunoprecipitation buffer were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-dynamin 2 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels and transfer onto Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with rabbit anti-dynamin 2, mouse anti-cortactin, rabbit anti-caveolin-1, or rabbit anti-Tiam1 antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence. Animal Preparation and Treatment—Male C57BL/6J and CD44 knock-out mice (8–10 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (150 mg/kg) and acetylpromazine (15 mg/kg) according to approved protocols. LPS (2.5 mg/kg) or saline (control) was instilled intratracheally, and 4 h later, HGF (50 μg/kg) or saline control was delivered intravenously through the internal jugular vein. The animals were allowed to recover for 24 h, followed by bronchoalveolar lavage protein analysis and/or lung immunohistochemistry. Murine Lung Immunohistochemistry—To characterize protein expression in mouse lung vascular EC, lungs from C57BL/6J control (untreated) mice were formalin-fixed; 5-μm paraffin sections were obtained and hydrated; and epitope retrieval was performed (DakoCytomation target retrieval solution, pH 6.0). The sections were then histologically evaluated by either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD44 antibody or anti-c-Met or anti-vWF (Factor VIII) antibody and fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor™ 610 for vWF and Alexa Fluor™ 350 for c-Met; Molecular Probes). Negative controls for immunohistochemical analysis were performed by the same method as described above but without primary antibody. Immunofluorescent stained sections were photographed (magnification ×100) using a Leica Axioscope. Determination of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Protein Concentration—Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by an intratracheal injection of 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution, followed by gentle aspiration. The recovered fluid was processed for protein concentration (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) as described previously (41Su X. Wang L. Song Y. Bai C. Intensive Care Med. 2004; 30: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare the means of data from two or more different experimental groups. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Role of CD44 in HGF/c-Met-mediated Human EC Barrier Enhancement—HGF binding to its plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, induces a variety of cell functions (7Hammond D.E. Carter S.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly defined. CD44, a major HA receptor localized in CEM, has been implicated in regulating HGF/c-Met signaling (10van der Voort R. Taher T.E.

Our data indicate that there are two main CD44 isoforms expressed in human pulmonary EC, CD44v10 (∼120 kDa) and CD44s (standard form, ∼85 kDa) (Fig. 1A). In the absence of HGF (control), CD44s, but not CD44v10 or c-Met, was localized to CEM (also termed detergent-resistant membranes or lipid rafts). HGF (25 ng/ml) treatment of human EC induced recruitment of ∼70% of total CD44v10 and ∼55% of total c-Met into CD44s-containing CEM (Fig. 1, B and C).

(2002) Biol. Chem. 383, 577–583). Recently, osmotic stress was found to increase synthesis of bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate ((PP)2-InsP4), a high energy inositol pyrophosphate (Pesesse, X., Choi, K., Zhang, T., and Shears, S. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 43378–43381). Here, we describe the purification from rat brain of a diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase (PPIP5K) that synthesizes (PP)2-InsP4. Partial amino acid sequence, obtained by mass spectrometry, matched the sequence of a 160-kDa rat protein containing a putative ATP-grasp kinase domain. BLAST searches uncovered two human isoforms (PPIP5K1 (160 kDa) and PPIP5K2 (138 kDa)). Recombinant human PPIP5K1, expressed in Escherichia coli, was found to phosphorylate diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP5) to (PP)2-InsP4 (Vmax = 8.3 nmol/mg of protein/min; Km = 0.34 μm). Overexpression in human embryonic kidney cells of either PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 substantially increased levels of (PP)2-InsP4, whereas overexpression of a catalytically dead PPIP5K1D332A mutant had no effect. PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 were more active against PP-InsP5 than InsP6, both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis by confocal immunofluorescence showed PPIP5K1 to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the nucleus. Immunopurification of overexpressed PPIP5K1 from osmotically stressed HEK cells (0.2 m sorbitol; 30 min) revealed a persistent, 3.9 ± 0.4-fold activation when compared with control cells. PPIP5Ks are likely to be important signaling enzymes.

Yet (PP)2-InsP4 is a molecule of particular interest as a signaling entity because, alone among the inositol pyrophosphates, its levels are acutely regulated, for example, by thermal stress (19Choi K. Mollapour E. Shears S.B. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), osmotic shock (21Pesesse X. Choi K. Zhang T. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Thus, there is considerable interest in determining both the molecular nature and the modes of regulation of the enzyme(s) that synthesize (PP)2-InsP4. In the current study, we describe the purification and sequencing of PPIP5K from the rat. We also characterize two human isoforms of PPIP5K. During the final stages of this study, York and colleagues (33Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) described the characterization of a novel InsP6 kinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vip1. The 4/6-PP-InsP5 that is produced from InsP6 by Vip1 regulates the transcriptional activity of a cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex that controls cellular phosphate accumulation (34Lee Y.S. Mulugu S. York J.D. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2007; 316: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Vip1 was shown to additionally phosphorylate PP-InsP5 in vitro, although it was not reported whether this reaction occurs in vivo (33Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that mammalian PPIP5K1 is a homologue of Vip1 that functions as an PP-InsP5 kinase both in vitro and in intact cells. Moreover, we show that this enzyme is acutely activated by osmotic stress. We conclude that PPIP5Ks are important enzymes in signal transduction.

Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a gradient generated from buffer A (1 mm EDTA) and buffer B (2 m NH4H2PO4, pH 3.35, with H3PO4/1 mm EDTA) as follows: 0–10 min, 0% buffer B, 10–11 min, 0–50% buffer B, 11–65 min = 50–64% buffer B. In some experiments, we assayed the extent of kinase activity against [3H]InsP6, [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, PP-[3H]InsP4, or (PP)2-[3H]InsP3, using the kinase assay buffer described above. These reactions were analyzed by Partisphere SAX HPLC (35Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Purification of PP-InsP5 Kinase—All procedures were conducted at 0–4 °C. The starting material was 22 frozen stripped rat brains (Pel-Freeze Biologicals, Rogers, AR). These were homogenized in 80 ml of homogenization buffer comprising 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 4 mm 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, 1 mm DTT, and the following mixture of protease inhibitors: 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1 mg/ml each of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin. A 100,000 × g supernatant was prepared, filtered (0.45 μm), and diluted 1:1 (v/v) with medium A (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, plus protease inhibitor mixture (see above)). This was applied to a 23 × 2.2-cm DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient generated by mixing medium A with medium B (medium A plus 1 m NaCl) as follows: 4 CV, 0% medium B; 7.7 CV, 0–35% medium B; 0.2 CV, 35–100% medium B; 2.5 CV, 100% medium B; 15-ml fractions were collected. The fractions that were saved after the DEAE column were dialyzed twice (2 h each) against medium C (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgSO4), filtered (0.45 μm), and loaded onto a 16.2 × 2.2-cm heparin-agarose column (Sigma). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient generated by mixing medium C with medium D (medium C plus 1 m NaCl) as follows: 2 CV, 0% medium D; 6 CV, 0–35% medium D; 3 CV, 35% medium D; 2 CV, 35–100% medium D; 2 CV, 100% D; 8-ml fractions were collected. The fractions that were saved after the heparin-agarose column were diluted 1:1 with medium E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 15 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl) and loaded onto a 12.5 × 2.2-cm high performance nickel-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min with a gradient generated by mixing medium E with medium F (medium E + 0.5 m NaCl) as follows: 2.5 CV, 0% medium F; 3 CV, 100% medium F; 2 CV, 0% medium F. Next, the column was eluted with a gradient generated by mixing medium E with medium G (medium E plus 0.5 m imidazole, pH 7.8) as follows: 6 CV, 0–20% G, 0.2 CV, 20–100% G, 2 CV, 100% G; 9-ml fractions were collected. The single fraction that was saved after the nickel-Sepharose column was split into six aliquots, each of which was overlaid onto a 10-ml sucrose gradient (5–20% (w/v)), which was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 17 h in a SW 45 Ti rotor (Beckman). The fractions that were saved were dialyzed twice (2 h each) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NaCl) and then concentrated to ∼60 μl, initially using an Amicon Ultra and subsequently using a Microcon (Ultracel YM-10; Amicon). Then, 3 μl of 5% SERVA Blue G dye (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 0.2 m Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0) was added. The sample was split into two aliquots, each of which were loaded onto a blue native-PAGE gel (Invitrogen catalog number BN2001) in a native PAGE buffer system (Invitrogen catalog number BN2002). Then, 0.3-cm gel strips were manually cut from the gel and added directly to the kinase assay described above. The duplicated gel slices were analyzed by mass spectrometry (see below). Mass Spectrometry—Lanes from the native polyacrylamide gel were digested using a Progest robotic digester (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, WI). Minced gel bands were incubated twice for 15 min in 100 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate/50% (v/v) acetonitrile. The gel was then dehydrated by a 20-min incubation in 100 μl of acetonitrile followed by drying under a nitrogen stream. Then, 250 ng of trypsin (Promega) was added followed by an 8-h incubation at 37 °C. The supernatants from the digests was saved. The gel was re-extracted three times: once with 50 μl of water for 20 min and twice with 20-min incubations in 50 μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid/50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Supernatants from each gel fraction were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 35 μl of 0.1% formic acid. NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 1100 nanoLC system on-line with an Agilent XCT Ultra ion trap mass spectrometer with the chip cube interface. Briefly, 20 μl of the peptide digest was loaded onto an Agilent C18 chip (75 μm × 43 mm) followed by a 15-min wash with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) formic acid (buffer A). Peptides were eluted with a gradient generated from a linearly increasing concentration of acetonitrile (in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) as follows: 0–45 min, 5–50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 45–50 min, acetonitrile increased to 95% (v/v), 50–60% acetonitrile maintained at 95%. The mass spectrometer was used in the positive ion, standard enhanced mode and included settings of a mass range from 200 to 2200 m/z, an ionization potential of 2.1 kV, an ion change control smart target (number of ions in the trap prior to scan out) of 100,000 or 200 ms of accumulation, and a 1.0-V fragmentation amplitude. MS/MS data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition format with the six most abundant ions from each MS scan further interrogated by MS/MS. The automated switching for MS/MS required a threshold of 5000 counts. Peak lists were generated from the data obtained from each nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using the data extractor feature of the SpectrumMill software from Agilent. The data extractor settings included limiting the data search to deconvolved ions observed between 300 and 5000 Da and a retention time between 10 min and 60 min. MS scans with the same precursor mass (±1.5 m/z) and retention time within 30 s were merged. Moreover, of the remaining MS/MS spectra, only spectra that contained sequence tag information greater than 2 residues were submitted for data base searching. The resulting extracted data were then searched against the NCBInr data base using the MS/MS Search function in the SpectrumMill software. Search settings included a trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages allowed, a precursor ion mass tolerance of 1.5 Da, a product ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da, variable methionine oxidation, and a minimum matched spectral intensity of 60%. Sequence assignments of MS/MS spectra were manually validated. Plasmid Construction—The IMAGE cDNA clone (ID 6142663; GenBank™ ID BC057395.1) encoding human PPIP5K1 was amplified by PCR using as primers 5′-CACCATGTGGTCATTGACGGCCAGTGAG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCCTAATTTATCTCCTCAGGGACCTCCTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to construct pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO-PPIP5K1, which was subsequently used to construct pDEST527-PPIP5K1 to express recombinant protein in E. coli and also to construct pDEST501-PPIP5K1 and pDEST515-PPIP5K1 to express CFP-PPIP5K1 and FLAG tag PPIP5K1, respectively, in HEK cells. A cDNA encoding a kinase-dead mutant, pDEST515-PPIP5K1D332A, was made using the GenTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). The primers used were 5′-TGGTCATTCCTTTGTGTGTGCTGTCAATGGCTTTAG-3′ and 5′-CACACACAAAGGAATGACCATTGGCACGAAG-3′. The IMAGE cDNA clone (ID 3913521; GenBank ID: BC024591) encoding human PPIP5K2 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CACCATGAGTGAAGCCCCCAGATTCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCATTTCTTT TTCCCAGTGTTTTTTTTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the vectors described above for transfection of FLAG tag PPIP5K2 in mammalian cells. All plasmid sequences were verified using the NIEHS sequencing core. Expression and Purification of PPIP5K1 in E. coli—BL21(DE3)STAR cells harboring pDEST527-PPIP5K1 were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C to A600 nm = 0.6, whereupon 0.25 mm insopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. After 150 min of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 5000 × g; 4 °C) and stored at -80 °C until used. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in three volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, two EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Samples were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1.2-ml TALON Superflow metal affinity column (BD Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After 1 h, the column was washed with 60 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and then eluted with 0.2- and 0.35-ml aliquots of the lysis buffer containing 50 and 300 mm imidazole, respectively. Finally, 30 μl of each fraction was loaded onto each lane of NuPAGE 4–12% precast gel (Invitrogen). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, samples were immunoblotted with His tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen catalog number 70796-4) and visualized with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 in HEK293T Cells—Cells were transfected with 4 μg of the appropriate plasmid (see above) using FuGENE and analyzed 2 days later. For some experiments, cells were harvested and lysed by vortexing for 3 min in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science: catalog number 11873580001; 1 tablet/10 ml lysis buffer). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 × g). Next, 2.5 mg of the cleared lysate was incubated with 50 μl of suspended volume of ANTI-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma: catalog number A2220) pre-equilibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resin was washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 60 μl. Aliquots of this immunopurified enzyme were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotted with FLAG-specific antibody (Sigma, catalog number F1804), and visualized with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For some experiments, intact cells were also radiolabeled with 20 μCi/ml [3H] inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 4 days (with transfection performed on the second day of labeling). [3H]Inositol phosphates were then extracted with perchloric acid, neutralized, and analyzed by Partisphere SAX HPLC as described previously (21Pesesse X. Choi K. Zhang T. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43378-43381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other Materials—PP-[3H]InsP4, PP-[3H]InsP5, and (PP)2-[3H]InsP3 were prepared as described previously (35Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase was prepared as described previously (37Riley A.M.

The Pathway of (PP)2-InsP4 Synthesis—Some previously elusive steps in inositol phosphate synthesis have eventually been discovered to be unexpected additional activities of kinases that had previously been held responsible for different reactions. For example, the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase was discovered to be an additional activity of an enzyme previously designated as the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase (38Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Later, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase activity was eventually found to be catalyzed by an enzyme (inositol polyphosphate multikinase) previously designated an Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 3/6-kinase (39Chang S.-C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether (PP)2-InsP4 might be synthesized from (PP)2-InsP3 (Fig. 1) by phosphorylation of the latter's free 2-OH by the Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase. The recombinant human Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase that was used in these experiments completely phosphorylated [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to [3H]InsP6 (Fig. 2A). However, there was no phosphorylation of (PP)2-[3H]InsP3 or even PP-[3H]InsP4 (Fig. 2, B and C). Another multifunctional enzyme that we considered as a potential candidate for synthesizing (PP)2-InsP4 is inositol polyphosphate multikinase since we have previously shown that it can add a diphosphate group to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (40Zhang T. Caffrey J.J. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, when inositol polyphosphate multikinase was individually incubated either with PP-[3H]InsP5 or with 10 μm of each of the six isomers of PP-InsP5 plus [γ-32P]ATP, no (PP)2-InsP4 was formed (data not shown). In view of the data described above, the most significant route of (PP)2-InsP4 synthesis in mammalian cells would appear to involve phosp"

https://openalex.org/W1967508937,"Ensuring precise DNA replication and chromosome segregation is essential during cell division in order to provide genomic stability and avoid malignant growth. Proteolytic control of cell cycle regulators by the anaphase-promoting complex, activated by Cdh1 (APC(Cdh1)), is responsible for a stable G1 phase after mitotic exit allowing accurate preparation for DNA replication in the following S phase. APC(Cdh1) target proteins are frequently upregulated in tumor cells and the inactivation of human Cdh1 might interfere with genome integrity by target stabilization. Here we show that APC(Cdh1) is required for maintaining genomic integrity in primary human cells. Lentiviral-delivered strong and stable suppression of Cdh1 by RNA interference (RNAi) causes aberrant accumulation of several APC(Cdh1) target proteins, such as cyclin A, B, Aurora A or Plk1, which control accurate and equal distribution of the genetic information to daughter cells. This induces a premature and prolonged S phase, mitotic-entry delay and defects in chromosome separation and cytokinesis. Cell cycle deregulation by stable knockdown of Cdh1 leads to activation of p53/p21 and genomic instability, which is further increased by codepletion of p53. Thus, stabilization of APC(Cdh1) targets may initiate aberrant DNA replication and chromosome separation, and trigger a p53 response by deregulating G1 in primary human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964162087,"Myoferlin and dysferlin are members of the ferlin family of membrane proteins. Recent studies have shown that mutation or genetic disruption of myoferlin or dysferlin promotes muscular dystrophy-related phenotypes in mice, which are the result of impaired plasma membrane integrity. However, no biological functions have been ascribed to myoferlin in non-muscle tissues. Herein, using a proteomic analysis of endothelial cell (EC) caveolae/lipid raft microdomains we identified myoferlin in these domains and show that myoferlin is highly expressed in ECs and vascular tissues. The loss of myoferlin results in lack of proliferation, migration, and nitric oxide (NO) release in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western blotting and surface biotinylation experiments show that loss of myoferlin reduces the expression level and autophosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in native ECs. In a reconstituted cell system, transfection of myoferlin increases VEGFR-2 membrane expression and autophosphorylation in response to VEGF. In vivo, VEGFR-2 levels and VEGF-induced permeability are impaired in myoferlin-deficient mice. Mechanistically, myoferlin forms a complex with dynamin-2 and VEGFR-2, which prevents CBL-dependent VEGFR-2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. These data are the first to report novel biological activities for myoferlin and reveal the role of membrane integrity to VEGF signaling.

Membrane repair after injury is characterized by the regulated fusion of subplasmalemmal vesicles with plasma membranes to reseal a damaged area. The molecular machinery responsible for this basic cellular function is beginning to be elucidated, and experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans have discovered that the fusion of intracellular membranous organelles (akin to endomembranes) to the plasma membrane is regulated by the fer-1 gene (1Achanzar W.E. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Washington N.L. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dysferlin, otoferlin, and myoferlin are homologs of fer-1 in mammals that were initially identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (dysferlin and myoferlin) or the inner ear (otoferlin) (1Achanzar W.E.

They are characterized by multiple C2 domains that are important for binding to calcium, phospholipids, and phosphotyrosine residues and may be regulated by calcium-dependent, protein-protein interactions. By virtue of their localization in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle and their calcium-dependent accumulation at sites of membrane repair, ferlins are implicated in various types of muscular dystrophy attributable to defects in vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane (3Davis D.B.

However, the biological and molecular functions of the ferlin family of proteins in mammals outside of skeletal muscle are virtually unexplored.Recently, by isolating highly purified, caveolae-enriched buoyant membrane microdomains/lipid rafts (CEMs/LRs) 4The abbreviations used are: CEM/LR, caveolae-enriched buoyant membrane microdomains/lipid raft; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; EC, endothelial cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR-2, VEGF receptor-2; MASMC, mouse aortic smooth muscle cell; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interference RNA; bhMyof, bovine-human myoferlin; hMyof, human myoferlin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MAEC, mouse aortic endothelial cell; PLC, phospholipase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; WT, wild type; hNS1, human non-silencing 1.4The abbreviations used are: CEM/LR, caveolae-enriched buoyant membrane microdomains/lipid raft; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; EC, endothelial cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR-2, VEGF receptor-2; MASMC, mouse aortic smooth muscle cell; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interference RNA; bhMyof, bovine-human myoferlin; hMyof, human myoferlin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MAEC, mouse aortic endothelial cell; PLC, phospholipase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; WT, wild type; hNS1, human non-silencing 1. from endothelial cells (ECs) followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we first reported the unexpected identification of Nogo-B (8Acevedo L.

Herein, we report that myoferlin is also highly enriched in CEM/LR microdomains isolated from EC and is highly expressed in blood vessels. RNA silencing combined with functional analysis reveals that myoferlin regulates VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as Flk-1/KDR) stability and signaling. Moreover, myoferlin-deficient mice (myof-/-) demonstrate reduced VEGFR-2 protein levels and VEGF-mediated vascular hyperpermeability. Taken together, these observations identify myoferlin as a regulator of EC functions and suggest that ferlins in general may be necessary for several plasma membrane events such as signaling in specialized cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—EA.hy.926, MASMC, HEK, and BAEC cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone), penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma), and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (EA.hy.926 only, Sigma). HUVECs and MAECs were grown in EGM-2 media (Clonetics).Isolation of CEM/LR and Identification of Myoferlin—CEM/LR preparation from EA.hy.926, BAECs, and HUVECs, and MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry were performed as described (8Acevedo L. Yu J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Miao R.Q. Kim J.E. Fulton D. Tempst P. Strittmatter S.M. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—The myoferlin antibody was provided by Dr. McNally. We used Phospho-PLC as well as phospho- and total ERK-1/2 (Cell Signaling), phospho- and total JNK (BIOSOURCE and Cell Signaling, respectively). Total PLCγ1, VEGFR-2 (Western blot), caveolin-1, EDG1, and B2R were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas HSP90, ubiquitin, and VEGFR-2 (cytometry) antibodies were from BD Biosciences. For pulldown assays, immobilized myoferlin-HA (expressed in HEK cells) was incubated for 2 h with protein extracts solubilized using a β-octoglucopyranoside-based buffer (60 mm, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl) with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) with or without a myoferlin SH3 domain peptide (SGIQGKIPANQLAE). After extensive washing, proteins were blotted using respective antibodies.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed using a PCR-generated probe with the oligonucleotides 5′-GGTCCAGGTCTCTCTCCCAAATAC-3′ and 5′-TTTTCTCCTCCAGCGTCTGCGG-3′ and by using the human myoferlin cDNA cloned in pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or mRNAeasy kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturers' protocols. Between 10 and 20 μg of RNA was loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel and, following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Zeta probe GT, Bio-Rad) overnight in 10× SSC (Invitrogen). After pre-hybridization (ExpressHyb, BD Biosciences) at 68 °C overnight, membranes were incubated with [32P]dCTP-labeled probe (Prime-it II kit, Stratagene) for 2 h and washed according to hybridization solution manufacturer's protocol, and signal was detected by autoradiography (Kodak). Human α-actin cDNA (Invitrogen) or 28 S ribosomal RNA were used as loading controls.Membrane Repair Assay—This experiment was performed on at least six EA.hy.926 per group in triplicate. EA.hy.926 were used because of their relative bulkiness and high membrane content. Following siRNA treatment (72 h) in a glass bottom Petri plate, cells were incubated in DMEM with FM1–43 (25 μm, Molecular Probes) for 5 min. In the meantime, the Petri plate was mounted in a heated Plexiglas chamber (Zeiss) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. Cells were visualized with an Axiovert microscope (Zeiss), and damage was induced to the cell membrane using an argon laser at full power, and 2300 iterations concentrated on a 5-μm × 5-μm section away from the nucleus. An image was captured before damage, and at every 30 s after injury for a total time of 10 min. For every image taken, the increase in fluorescence was measured by using the Zeiss LSM software as followed. Background for each image was equalized and subtracted (resulting in a pre-damage fluorescence value of “0”) by gradually increasing and equalizing the background intensity around the injury site to observe a variation in fluorescence solely at the site of injury.Miles Assay—Myoferlin knock-out (myof-/-) mice were generated as described previously (5Doherty K.R.

F2 generation myof (+/-) mice were bred to yield (-/-) and (+/+) mice used for the following experiments. Under anesthesia, mice (6–10 weeks old) were injected with Evans Blue (30 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich). VEGF (500 ng in 25 μl) or saline was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal skin. After 30 min, mice were euthanized, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and the skin was isolated, the fat was removed with forceps, and skin sections were oven-dried at 55 °C, and weighed. Evans Blue was then extracted from the various skin sections using 250 μl of formamide for 16 h at 55 °C. Evans Blue extravasation was measured spectrophotometrically at 590 nm using a standard curve of Evans Blue in formamide. Total Evans Blue extravasation was expressed as total VEGF-induced extravasation minus saline-induced extravasation.Immunofluorescence Staining—ECs were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated with antibodies as described (9Murata T. Lin M.I. Stan R.V. Bauer P.M. Yu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16631-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). siRNA Treatment—Myoferlin DNA target sequences (Qiagen) were (5′-3′): AACCCTGTCTGGAATGAGATT (bhMyof), AAGGCCTGTGGTCAAAGTTCA (hMyof1), AATGAGGACTGGCTTGATAAATT (hMyof2), and AAGGCCTGTGGTCAAAGTTCA for siRNA #2, as well as their respective scrambled controls, AATTCTCCGAACGTGTGAAGT, AACATGTGGCACATAGCTTGG, and AACTTGTTGCACGGAGCATAG. Bovine myoferlin siRNA DNA targets (Dharmacon) were AATCAGGACTGGCTTGATAAA and AATTATAGAAGACACGAGATA, with their respective controls AAAAATTCAAGGTGTACCGTG and AATAATGTAAGTCAAGCA. For cell transfection, ECs were exposed to siRNA complexed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-Mem-I as described by the manufacturer.Adenovirus Constructs—Dynamin-2 adenoviruses were generated and used as previously described (10Bhattacharya R. Kang-Decker N. Hughes D.A. Mukherjee P. Shah V. McNiven M.A. Mukhopadhyay D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1692-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For 70Z/3-CBL adenovirus, the cDNA (11Duval M. Bedard-Goulet S. Delisle C. Gratton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20091-20097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was subcloned in the Ad5 shuttle vector and amplified by the University of Iowa gene transfer core facility. Each virus was used at a magnitude of infection of 50.Proliferation Assays—BAECs or EA.hy.926 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and treated with siRNA sequences for 24 h. Cells were then synchronized for 48 h in DMEM with no FBS. After synchronization, FBS (10%) and VEGF (10-9 m) were added to the cells for an additional 72 h. Cells were then trypsinized and counted using a Z1 counter (Beckman-Coulter).Apoptosis Assay—We used a caspase-8 activity-based colorimetric assay to determine the level of apoptosis in cells. BAECs were treated for 72 h with siRNA sequences in 100-mm tissue culture plates, and caspase-8 activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems).Migration Assay—We used a 48-well modified Boyden chamber assay (Neuroprobe). BAECs were treated with siRNA for 72 h, trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in DMEM with 1% FBS, and migration was performed as described previously (12Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Quantitative PCR—BAECs were treated for 72 h with siRNA sequences, and RNA was extracted with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed on 5 μg of total RNA (Invitrogen), and quantitative PCR was performed on 2 μl by using the Sybr Green reagent (Invitrogen) and the bovine VEGFR-2 (5′-ACACTGACATGGGCTCCGTTCTTT-3′ and 5′-TCTGGCTGTCCCAGGAAATTCTGT-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-TGAGCTCAACGGGAAGCTCACT-3′ and 5′-TGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACCT-3′) primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plates were read on an iCycler quantitative PCR analyzer (Bio-Rad).Plasmids and Cell Transfection—The human myoferlin cDNA was cloned in pcDNA 3.1 (-) using the NotI and KpnI sites. 3′-End HA-tagged versions of human myoferlin were generated by PCR and verified by sequencing and expression. The human VEGFR-2 cDNA was obtained from Genentech. We used HEK cells (293T) for cell transfection. Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates, and, after reaching 25% confluency, cells were transfected with 2 μg of control or myoferlin plasmid for 6 h with Opti-MEM I and Lipofectamine 2000. Media was replaced with DMEM with 10% FBS for 16 h. Cells were then retransfected with control plasmids or VEGFR-2 plasmids and grown as described above.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—HEK cells were trypsinized, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% normal goat serum for 15 min. Cells were then labeled with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody coupled to phycoerythrin for 1 h (BD Biosciences), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, rinsed, and sorted using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) set on channel FL2. Data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.8.Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of BAECs was performed by using a Sulfo-Link biotinylation kit (Pierce) and the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were boiled in reducing conditions, and Western blot analyses were performed as described.NO Release Measurement—BAECs were treated for 24 h with siRNA sequences and were grown to confluency. After a 1-h pretreatment with MG-132 (2.5 × 10-6 m), cells were stimulated for 30 min with VEGF (10-9 m) or ionomycin (5 × 10-6 m) as described.RESULTSIdentification and Localization of Myoferlin in EC—CEM/LR were isolated by sucrose fractionation from the immortalized human EC line EA.hy.926, proteins were run on a SDS-PAGE gradient gel, and one of the prominent bands characterized by MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometry (8Acevedo L. Yu J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Miao R.Q. Kim J.E. Fulton D. Tempst P. Strittmatter S.M. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was myoferlin. Western blot analysis of CEM/LR fractions confirmed the enrichment of myoferlin in EA.hy.926 membranes extracts (lanes 1–3, supplemental Fig. S1A), in freshly isolated (passage 0) human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1B, respectively). These buoyant membrane fractions were enriched in caveolin-1, the main coat protein of caveolae (lanes 1–6) and lack Golgi/post-Golgi contaminants such as β-coatamer protein (lanes 8–12) as well as markers for bulk plasma membrane such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Fig. 1A). Cholesterol disruption using methyl-β-cyclodextrin on Triton X-100 protein solubility reveals that at least 25%, 30–55%, and 10–30% of total myoferlin resides in cholesterol-rich, methyl-β-cyclodextrin-sensitive CEM/LR in HUVECs, EA.hy.926, and BAECs, respectively (HUVECs shown, supplemental Fig. S1C). Hsp90 and caveolin-1 were used as controls for Triton X-100 solubility and insolubility, respectively. Enrichment of myoferlin in CEM/LR from these cells suggests that myoferlin is a CEM/LR resident protein in ECs.Next, we examined the expression of myoferlin mRNA in vascular cells. Northern blot analysis using a human cDNA probe (human myoferlin nucleotides 2273–3312) and total RNA isolated from the human endothelial cell line EA.hy.926, HUVECs, mouse aortic ECs (MAECs), mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (MASMCs), and BAEC reveals the expression of myoferlin mRNA (8 kb) in all lines investigated (Fig. 1B).To examine the subcellular localization of myoferlin in cells, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. In non-permeabilized COS-7 cells transfected with myoferlin-HA, surface staining of the HA antigen (Fig. 1C) documents the presence of the extracellular C-terminal domain of ferlins (2Washington N.L. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and endogenous myoferlin colocalizes with myoferlin-HA in permeabilized COS-7 cells (Fig. 1D). Whole mount immunostaining of endogenous myoferlin in EC lining intact mouse pulmonary arteries reveals that myoferlin (green channel) localizes in puncta throughout the cells and at intercellular junctions. Collectively, these data identify myoferlin as a protein found on the cell surface of cultured EC and is highly localized at the plasmalemma in EC lining intact blood vessels.EC Deficient in Myoferlin Show Defective Membrane Repair—Because of the importance of dysferlin in mediating membrane repair in damaged skeletal muscle, we studied the importance of myoferlin to membrane resealing following injury to EC using a short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based approach to knock down myoferlin levels. Transfection of primary cultures of BAECs with siRNA duplexes directed against bovine-human myoferlin mRNAs (bhMyof) attenuates myoferlin mRNA expression by up to 92% (Fig. 2A, upper panel) compared with vehicle- and scrambled control siRNA (hNS1). In contrast, transfection of BAECs with an siRNA directed specifically against human myoferlin mRNA (hMyof1, bovine and human RNA display 86% identity at the targeted site) did not result in any reduction in myoferlin expression, confirming both the need for complete homology between the siRNA and the target as well as the specificity of the approach. Both myoferlin siRNAs (bhMyof and hMyof1, 15 and 75 nm) induced dose-dependent decreases in myoferlin expression in HUVECs (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and EA.hy.926 (data not shown) by up to 89% compared with vehicle and hNS1, whereas bhMyof (15 and 75 nm) attenuates myoferlin expression in BAECs by 94% (bottom panel) compared with human-specific myoferlin-, hMyof1-, vehicle-, or hNS1-treated cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2siRNA-mediated myoferlin knockdown disrupts VEGF-induced proliferation and migration. A, scrambled siRNA (hNS1) and sequences containing three mismatches to its target mRNA (hMyof1) had no effect on myoferlin mRNA levels, whereas homologous bhMyof siRNA attenuated myoferlin mRNA levels in BAECs. B, bovine-human myoferlin siRNA sequences (bhMyof) or specific for human myoferlin (hMyof1) block in a specific and dose-dependent fashion myoferlin protein expression in HUVECs and BAECs. Scrambled control (hNS1) had no effect. β-Coatamer protein was used as a loading control. C and D, siRNA against myoferlin blocked VEGF mitogenic effect (10-9 m) in BAECs and HUVECs without interfering with basal proliferation. Data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 6) repeated two times with similar results. *, p < 0.05 compared with control condition (Day 0 or serum-induced proliferation). E, myoferlin knock-down does not influence apoptosis, measured by caspase-8 activity (n = 9). F, VEGF-stimulated chemotaxis is abrogated in BAECs with disrupted myoferlin expression. *, p < 0.05 compared with control treated cells (n = 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The link between myoferlin and membrane repair assay was investigated by directly assessing resealing efficiency after injury in cultured EC by using a technique similar to that used for quantifying calcium entry following laser injury in ECs (13Dubois C. Panicot-Dubois L. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B. Furie B.C. Blood. 2006; 107: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Single EA.hy.926 cells displaying normal or deficient myoferlin expression were incubated with FM1–43, a dye that fluoresces only in a lipidic environment such as biological membranes after injury (14McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and local membrane disruption was achieved by direct laser irradiation. Following initial membrane injury (time 0), a rapid but weak increase in local membrane fluorescence was observed in control, bhNS-, and hNS1 siRNA-treated ECs, followed by a decrease in local fluorescence, suggesting complete resealing (bhNS1 shown, supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). However, in ECs with attenuated myoferlin expression (bhMyof), a more sustained increase in local fluorescent “patches” was observed (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) followed by a delayed phase of FM1–43 uptake, thereby revealing incomplete membrane resealing in these cells. These data document that, similar to dysferlin and fer1, myoferlin regulates membrane resealing after physical damage.VEGF Mitogenic Activity Requires Myoferlin—Because fer-1 is necessary for the motility of spermatozoa in C. elegans (1Achanzar W.E. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Washington N.L. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), basic EC functions, such as proliferation and migration, were examined. Serum-induced proliferation of BAECs and HUVECs (p < 0.05 compared with Day 0) was not affected by pretreatment with non-silencing siRNA (bhNS for BAECs; hNS1–2 for HUVECs) or myoferlin siRNA (bhMyof for BAECs; hMyof1–2 for HUVECs) (48 h, Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, myoferlin silencing (compared with non-silencing siRNA treatment) reduces agonist-stimulated proliferation (VEGF, 10-9 m, p < 0.05 compared with serum-induced proliferation, Fig. 2, C and D) an effect not attributable to increased apoptosis (caspase-8 activity, Fig. 2E). Ceramide (50 μm) was used as a positive control.Because myoferlin silencing inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation, the effects of myoferlin on short term VEGF-mediated biological activity, such as the chemotaxis, was assessed. VEGF addition (for 4 h) to the lower chamber of a modified Boyden apparatus induces an increase in BAEC migration treated with vehicle- and bhNS siRNA, and treatment with myoferlin siRNA abrogates VEGF-driven cell migration (Fig. 2F).Myoferlin Deficiency Disrupts Rapid VEGF-mediated Intracellular Signaling Pathways—Because loss of myoferlin impairs EC mitogenicity and chemotaxis, we examined the effects of myoferlin down-regulation on the VEGF signaling cascade related to proliferation and migration (12Bernatchez P.N.

Allen B.G. Gelinas D.S. Guillemette G. Sirois M.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). VEGF induces time-dependent increases in ERK-1/2, JNK, and PLCγ phosphorylation (Fig. 3A–C, upper panels). Treatment of BAECs with myoferlin siRNA markedly reduced VEGF-mediated changes in phosphorylated ERK-1/2 (Fig. 3A, lower panel) and JNK (Fig. 3B, lower panel) levels compared with vehicle- or hNS1-treated cells, and completely abolished VEGF-induced PLCγ phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Hence, a reduction in myoferlin levels attenuates VEGF-mediated activation of key intracellular signaling cascades.FIGURE 3Myoferlin down-regulation disrupts VEGF intracellular signaling pathways through VEGFR-2 degradation. A–C, stimulation of BAECs with VEGF (10-9 m) resulted in time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 (A, upper panel), JNK (B, upper panel), and PLCγ1(C, upper panel), which was attenuated following pretreatment with myoferlin siRNA (lower panel). Total ERK-1/2, JNK, and PLCγ1 as well asβ-coatamer protein or HSP90 were used as loading controls. D, loss of myoferlin results in loss of VEGFR-2 expression and autophosphorylation in response to VEGF. BAECs were treated with siRNA sequences and stimulated for 7.5 min with VEGF (10-9 m), and isolated proteins were blotted for total VEGFR-2 and phospho-tyrosine residues. E, multiple bovine or human myoferlin siRNA sequences block VEGFR-2 expression in BAECs and HUVECs by up to 85 and 71%, respectively. Respective scrambled sequences had no effect. F, surface biotinylation confirms the loss of surface expression of VEGFR-2 following myoferlin knock-down.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Myoferlin Deficiency Leads to a Loss of VEGFR-2 Protein Expression—Next, we investigated the expression and autophosphorylation pattern of VEGFR-2, the primary tyrosine kinase receptor responsible for a majority of VEGF functions in EC (12Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of total VEGFR-2 in control BAECs confirmed previous reports that VEGFR-2 exists as a doublet, with the higher molecular weight form being the predominant species (Fig. 3D, top panel labeled VEGFR-2). Pretreatment of ECs with bhMyof siRNA sequence caused a loss of VEGFR-2 protein (76–84% reduction) compared with vehicle- and hNS1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3D). The effect of myoferlin down-regulation on VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was even more robust, inhibiting VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 by up to 92% compared with vehicle- and hNS1-treated cells (Fig. 3D, p-VEGFR-2). Moreover, two additional siRNA sequences specific for bovine myoferlin (bMyof1 and -2) blocked VEGFR-2 expression by 62 and 85% (Fig. 3E, upper panel) compared with their scrambled contro"
https://openalex.org/W2075675471,"Bim is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that is induced and contributes to neuron death in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation. Past work has revealed that Bim is downstream of multiple independent transcriptional pathways in neurons, including those culminating in activation of the c-Jun, FoxO, and Myb transcription factors. This study addresses the issue of whether the three signaling pathways are redundant with respect to Bim induction or whether they act cooperatively. Examination of the proximal Bim promoter reveals binding sites for FoxO, Mybs, and, as shown here, c-Jun. We find that mutation of any one of these types of sites abolishes induction of a Bim promoter-driven reporter in response to NGF deprivation. Moreover, down-regulation of either c-Jun, FoxOs, or Mybs by short hairpin RNAs blocks induction of Bim promoter-reporter activity triggered by withdrawal of NGF. This was the case for reporters driven by either the proximal promoter or a promoter that also includes additional regulatory elements in the first intron of the Bim gene. Such short hairpin RNAs also suppressed the induction of endogenous Bim protein. These findings thus indicate that the Bim promoter acts as a coincidence detector that optimally responds to the simultaneous activation of three different pro-apoptotic transcriptional pathways. Such a mechanism provides a “fail-safe” that prevents neurons from dying by accidental activation of any single pathway. It also permits neurons to utilize individual pathways such as JNK signaling for other purposes without risk of demise.

Such a mechanism provides a “fail-safe” that prevents neurons from dying by accidental activation of any single pathway. It also permits neurons to utilize individual pathways such as JNK signaling for other purposes without risk of demise. The molecular mechanisms by which neurons die when deprived of trophic support are only partially understood. In many such cases there is evidence that neurons require transcription-dependent events in order to die (1Martin D.P. Schmidt R.E. DiStefano P.S. Lowry O.H. Carter J.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. J.

These are the “JNK-c-Jun” pathway that includes activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and phosphorylation/activation of the transcription factor c-Jun (3Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); the “cell cycle” pathway that includes events associated with the cell cycle in mitotic cells such as activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), phosphorylation of retinoblastoma family members, and induction of the transcription factors B- and C-myb (4Greene L.A. Liu D.X. Troy C.M. Biswas S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and the “FoxO” pathway in which FoxO family transcription factors move from cytoplasm to nucleus as a consequence of reduced phosphorylation resulting from shut down of the kinase AKT (5Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). nerve growth factor Bcl2 homology Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death c-Jun N-terminal kinase cyclin-dependent kinase E2 promoter binding factor Forkhead transcription factor O chromatin immunoprecipitation green fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA. An important question about these transcriptional pathways is whether they target different cell death genes or whether they share the same targets. At least in one case, a shared target has been recognized, the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death or Bcl-2-like protein 11). Bim is a BH3-only member of the Bcl2 family that is induced in response to NGF deprivation and that participates in the ensuing death process (6Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 7Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Several types of evidence have shown it to be a transcriptional target of the JNK/c-Jun pathway in neuronal cells. For instance, dominant-negative c-Jun and a chemical inhibitor of the JNK pathway reduce Bim induction evoked by NGF withdrawal in sympathetic neurons and neuronal PC12 cells (6Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 8Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bim induction after NGF withdrawal is reduced in sympathetic neurons of mice carrying a mutant c-Jun gene that lacks activating Ser-63/Ser-73 phosphorylation sites (10Besirli C.G. Wagner E.F. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise for the FoxO pathway, Gilley et al. (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of FoxO transcription factors can induce Bim (as well as Bim-dependent apoptotic death) in sympathetic neurons and that FoxO3a can directly bind and activate the Bim promoter. Moreover, mutation of the FoxO binding sites abolished activation of the promoter in response to NGF withdrawal. We recently reported that Bim is also a direct target of a cell cycle pathway in which NGF deprivation leads to activation of Cdk4, phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family member p130 and consequent loss of p130-E2F4 complexes, de-repression of the transcription factors B- and C-Myb, and induction of Bim (4Greene L.A. Liu D.X. Troy C.M. Biswas S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J.

In addition, we identified two Myb binding sites in the promoter region of the Bim gene that are required for Bim induction in response to activation of the cell cycle pathway and NGF deprivation (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chemical inhibition of Cdks or shRNA-mediated depletion of Cdk4 or Mybs also abolished NGF withdrawal-promoted Bim induction. Identification of Bim as a common target of three different transcriptional pathways in turn raises the question of whether such regulation occurs independently and in a redundant fashion or whether this occurs by a cooperative or additive mechanism. The answer to this issue has been unclear. Overexpression of activators of each of the pathways can promote neuron death, whereas independent blockade of any one of the pathways is sufficient to suppress neuron death in full or in part. This finding also raises the question of why multiple pathways are involved in the death process and in Bim regulation. In the findings presented here, we have addressed these issues and find that maximal induction of Bim in response to NGF deprivation requires simultaneous occupancy of the Bim promoter by Mybs, c-Jun, and FoxOs. Such findings thus indicate that the Bim promoter functions as a coincidence detector that is maximally driven only when all three death pathways are activated. Such a mechanism provides a fail-safe for prevention of accidental neuron death and permits neurons to employ single pathways such as JNK signaling for other purposes.

Human recombinant NGF was a kind gift from Genentech. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously (13Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). Neuronal differentiation was induced with NGF (100 ng/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% horse serum. For NGF deprivation, cultures pretreated with NGF for 7 days were washed with NGF-free medium twice and anti-NGF antibody (1:100) was added. Control cells were washed with serum-free medium and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplied with NGF without serum. Neonatal rat superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons were cultured as previously described (14Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Bim Promoter-Reporter Constructs—The Bim promoter-reporter constructs BimP-luc and Bim-luc(Mybm) have been described earlier (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The BimP-luc construct is driven by the rat proximal Bim promoter at position -2774/+154 (relative to the predicted transcription start site in the highly homologous mouse Bim gene (15Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It contains 2928 bp of DNA extending 5′ from within exon 1 and includes bp 1 to 2611 of the 5.2-kb intron-containing Bim-luc reporter that has been reported previously (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The other mutant Bim promoter-reporters were generated by deletion of consensus sequences for binding sites or by incorporating mutations into the binding sites by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were verified by sequencing. The Bim-luc(AP1m) was generated using oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTCTACCGTCAGCGGCAACTTGGATTCACAGAGACTTCG-3′ and 5′-CGAAGTCTCTGTGAATCCAAGTTGCCGCTGACGGTAGAGATC-3′. The Bim-luc(FoxOm) was generated using oligonucleotides 5′-CAAGTCACTAGGGTACCCACGCCGGGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCCCGGCGTGGGTACCCTAGTGACTTG-3′. The intron-1-containing Bim-luc reporter (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan Ham, University College London. Plasmids—The construct encoding human c-Jun was a kind gift from Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). FLAG-tagged rat c-Jun was generated by reverse transcription PCR of PC12 cell cDNA. The primers for the amplification were 5′-CTCGAGAACCATGGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACAAAATGACTGCAAAGATGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-AAACGTTTGCAACTGCTGCG-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified, cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and verified by sequencing. Myc-FoxO3a was a kind gift from Dr. D. Accili (Columbia University). Transfections—DNA was prepared with plasmid maxi kits (Qiagen). For reporter assays, neuronal PC12 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of Renilla vector, and 0.5 μg of control plasmid or plasmid expressing c-Jun, shRNA-c-Jun, shRNA-FoxO, or shRNA-Cdk4 in 500 μl of serum-free medium/well in 24-well dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. 6 h later, medium with Lipofectamine 2000 was replaced with fresh complete medium. 293 cells were transfected as previously described (17Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed using a kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following exceptions. 5-10 × 106 PC12 cells were used after treatment ± NGF for each sample. Rabbit polyclonal c-Jun antibody was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The primers used for PCR amplification of the rat Bim promoter were 5′-TGCCACCAAAGATCTCTACC-3′ and 5′-GCATTTCCTCACAGAGTTGG-3′. PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were then analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Preparation of shRNA—Cdk4 shRNA and B-Myb shRNA were described previously (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two c-Jun shRNAs were prepared in the pSIREN vector by using BD™ Knock-out RNAi systems according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) based on the sequences: 5′-ATGGGCACATCACCACTACA-3′ and 5′-AACCTCAGCAACTTCAACCC-3′ (sequence from Ref. 18Hettinger K. Vikhanskaya F. Poh M.K. Lee M.K. de Belle I. Zhang J.T. Reddy S.A. Sabapathy K. Cell Death Diff. 2007; 14: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FoxO shRNA was prepared in the pSIREN vector by using BD™ Knock-out RNAi systems according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) based on the sequence 5′-AAGGATAAGGGCGACAGCAAC-3′ (19Hribal M.L. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Shutter J.R. Accili D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). shRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 at a final level of 0.5 μg/24-well culture. Western Immunoblotting—Neuronal PC12 cells were lysed and protein was analyzed by Western immunoblotting as described previously (9Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Neuronal PC12 cells were transfected as described above with appropriate constructs of shRNA. 48 h later, cells were subjected to NGF withdrawal for 18 h and then immunostained as described by Angelastro et al. (20Angelastro J.M. Ignatova T.N. Kukekov V.G. Steindler D.A. Stengren G.B. Mendelsohn C. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4590-4600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After three washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 3% non-immune goat serum for 2 h. The cultures were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-Bim (1:500; Stressgen) antibody, rabbit c-Jun antibody (1:500) or rabbit FKHRL1 (FoxO3a) antibody (1:50) in 3% nonimmune goat serum overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary labeling with goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 568 or 488; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Luciferase Assay—Neuronal PC12 cells were transfected as described above with the appropriate luciferase reporter and pcDNA-LacZ/pCMS-EGFP with or without other DNAs. 24 or 48 h later, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, triturated off the plates, and pelleted in microcentrifuge tubes. Cell pellets were lysed in buffer provided in the Promega luciferase system. Dual luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activities were obtained by normalizing the luciferase activity against Renilla luciferase activity. Data are presented in the text and figures as mean ± S.E. (n = 3-6). Statistics—The statistical significance of differences between means was evaluated by Student's t test and was performed as unpaired, two-tailed distribution of arrays and presented as p values. c-Jun Activates a Bim Promoter-Reporter via an AP1 Site, and Occupancy of the Endogenous Promoter by c-Jun Increases in Response to NGF Deprivation—Although there is abundant evidence that JNK signaling and c-Jun contribute to Bim induction as well as neuron death evoked by NGF deprivation (6Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 8Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it has not been clear whether c-Jun is directly involved in Bim regulation. Examination of the proximal rat Bim promoter (-2774/+155) that has been employed in past studies of Bim regulation (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed a single putative AP1 (c-Jun binding) site that matches the previously described AP1 consensus sequence TGACTCA (21Shiozawa T. Miyamoto T. Kashima H. Nakayama K. Nikaido T. Konishi I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8603-8610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) at position -2447/-2441 relative to the transcription start site. A luciferase reporter driven by this promoter showed significant activation when co-expressed with c-Jun in neuronal (NGF-treated) PC12 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, there was no activation when c-Jun was co-expressed with a reporter in which the AP1 site was mutated to CAACTTG (mutated bases are underlined) (Fig. 1B). We used neuronal PC12 cells for this and subsequent assays because these undergo apoptotic death in response to NGF withdrawal and appear to do so by mechanisms similar to sympathetic neurons (3Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These observations thus indicate that c-Jun can activate the Bim promoter and that the identified AP1 site is required for Bim induction by c-Jun. To determine whether c-Jun actually occupies the endogenous Bim promoter in living cells and whether such occupancy is enhanced in response to NGF withdrawal, we performed ChIP assays. Accordingly, neuronal PC12 cells were maintained with or without NGF for 24 h and cross-linked chromatin was subjected to ChIP with anti-c-Jun, followed by PCR amplification of a unique portion of the Bim promoter containing the identified AP1 site. The identity of the PCR product as the predicted portion of the Bim promoter was verified by sequencing. Fig. 1C shows that occupancy of the Bim promoter by c-Jun was detected only after NGF deprivation. There was no detectable signal from a control without antiserum, and analysis of the input for the ChIP confirmed comparable levels of starting material. These findings thus indicate that NGF deprivation increases occupancy of the endogenous Bim promoter by c-Jun. Binding Sites in the Bim Promoter for c-Jun, Mybs, and FoxOs All Are Required to Induce Bim Promoter-Reporter Activity in Response to NGF Deprivation—We previously reported that the proximal Bim promoter contains binding sites for Mybs and that B- and C-Myb are induced upon NGF withdrawal by a mechanism reliant on activation of Cdk4 and consequent gene derepression (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, our findings indicated that there is increased occupancy of the Bim promoter by C-Myb in response to NGF deprivation and that Myb binding sites are required for activation of a Bim promoter-reporter by co-expressed Mybs (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Liu D.X. Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Gilley et al. (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) also identified binding sites for FoxO in a Bim promoter and found that these mediate activation of a promoter-reporter construct by the co-expressed FoxO family member FoxO3a. The proximal Bim promoter that we have employed contains one of the two FoxO binding sites identified by Gilley et al. (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) that were reported to be sufficient to promote reporter activation. Moreover, a similar proximal human Bim promoter has been shown to be activated by paclitaxel and requires the same FoxO binding site for activation (24Sunters A. Fernandez de Mattos S. Stahl M. Brosens J.J. Zoumpoulidou G. Saunders C.A. Coffer P.J. Medema R.H. Coombes R.C. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49795-49805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). A comparable proximal mouse Bim promoter has also been shown to be induced by E2F1 (25Hershko T. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8627-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As described above, the proximal promoter also possesses a binding site for c-Jun that mediates activation of a promoter-reporter by this transcription factor. Given these findings, we wished to determine whether Bim expression is independently and redundantly regulated by each of the transcription factors in response to NGF withdrawal or whether they act in some type of cooperative fashion. To achieve this, we generated mutant Bim promoters lacking binding sites for either c-Jun, FoxOs, or Mybs and compared their responses to NGF deprivation with that of the wild-type promoter-reporter. As we previously reported, 18 h of NGF withdrawal elicited an approximate 3-fold elevation in activity of the wild-type reporter (Fig. 2A), whereas loss of the Myb sites resulted in complete loss of responsiveness (Fig. 2B). Significantly, mutation of either the AP1 site or the FoxO binding site (see also Ref. 16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) also fully suppressed activation of the reporter by NGF deprivation (Fig. 2, C and D). These findings thus suggest that induction of Bim in response to NGF withdrawal requires occupation of the Bim promoter by all three of the transcription factors in question. shRNAs Targeted to c-Jun or FoxOs Block Induction of the Proximal Bim Promoter to NGF Deprivation—As an additional means to further examine the roles of the multiple transcription factors in regulating Bim expression after NGF withdrawal, we turned to shRNAs to suppress their expression. We have already shown that shRNA targeted to Mybs or to their upstream regulator Cdk4 fully blocks activation of our Bim promoter-reporter in response to NGF deprivation (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To knock down c-Jun and FoxOs we employed constructs that have been either previously reported to target these transcription factors or that we designed and tested ourselves. shcJun targets c-Jun exclusively (18Hettinger K. Vikhanskaya F. Poh M.K. Lee M.K. de Belle I. Zhang J.T. Reddy S.A. Sabapathy K. Cell Death Diff. 2007; 14: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). shFoxO targets FoxO1a and FoxO3a and possibly targets FoxO6 (19Hribal M.L. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Shutter J.R. Accili D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have also used a second c-Jun shRNA (see “Experimental Procedures” for target sequence) and a second FoxO shRNA that has been reported to be unique to FoxO3a (26Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science (N. Y.). 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), although this targets a very similar area of the gene as our other FoxO shRNA. These constructs substantially disrupt expression of the corresponding endogenously and exogenously expressed genes (Fig. 3 and data not shown). As we observed with shRNA directed to Mybs (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), co-transfection with shRNAs directed toward c-Jun or FoxOs (but not to a control shRNA) each abolished the response of the Bim promoter-reporter to NGF withdrawal (Fig. 4A). Such findings thus confirm the interpretation that all three transcription factors are required for Bim induction after NGF deprivation.FIGURE 4shRNAs targeted to either c-Jun, B-myb, or FoxOs block induction of Bim promoter activity in response to NGF deprivation. Neuronal PC12 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the proximal Bim-luc promoter-reporter (A) or Bim-luc promoter-reporter containing the proximal promoter, exon 1, the first intron, and exon 2 of the rat Bim gene (B) and 0.1 μg of the Renilla luciferase expression construct pRL-CMV with 0.5 μg of either empty control shRNA or indicated shRNA constructs. The cultures were maintained for 48 h and then deprived of NGF for 18 h, after which luciferase assays were performed. Data were normalized as in Fig. 1A and are mean ± S.E. of three-four experiments. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences from control value for cultures maintained with NGF: panel A, **, p < 0.01; panel B,*, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Knock Down of c-Jun, FoxOs, or Mybs Suppresses Induction of an Intron-1-containing Bim Promoter-Reporter to NGF Withdrawal—In addition to the proximal Bim promoter used in the above experiments, another has been described that also contains non-coding regions of exons 1 and 2 and the first intron of the rat Bim gene (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It was found that the first intron contains additional regulatory sequences that respond to NGF deprivation and that include a FoxO binding site (16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 27Gilley J. Ham J. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Examination of this intron also reveals putative binding sites for Mybs. 3S. C. Biswas, unpublished findings. To assess whether our observations with the proximal promoter-reporter also hold for the more extended regulatory region, we made use of a reporter driven by the more extensive intron-containing sequence. To assure that regulation by each of the transcription factors was inhibited irrespective of potential binding sites, we again turned to shRNAs to impair their expression in reporter assays. As for the proximal Bim promoter-reporter construct, knock down of either c-Jun, FoxOs, B-Myb, or Cdk4 (which is upstream of Mybs) repressed activation of the extended Bim promoter-reporter in response to NGF deprivation (Fig. 4B). Knock Down of FoxOs and c-Jun Blocks the Induction of Endogenous Bim in Response to NGF Withdrawal—The above-described promoter-reporter assays support a model in which simultaneous activation of c-Jun, FoxOs, and Mybs is required for Bim induction after NGF withdrawal. We next wished to extend these observations to determine whether all three transcription factors are essential for induction of endogenous Bim protein. Neuronal PC12 cells were transfected with shRNAs targeted to either a control protein (firefly luciferase) or to one of the transcription factors and then assessed by immunocytochemistry for Bim expression with or without removal of NGF for 1 day. We previously used this approach to show that knock down of either Mybs or Cdk4 blocks up-regulation of Bim after NGF deprivation (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, transfection with shRNAs directed against c-Jun or FoxOs also suppressed up-regulation of endogenous Bim in PC12 cells deprived of NGF (Fig. 5). Quantification (Fig. 5B) showed that the effects of knocking down c-Jun and FoxOs were similar to one another as well as to that of knocking down Mybs (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lastly, to confirm whether our findings were also applicable to primary neurons, we repeated the above experiment with cultures of newborn rat sympathetic neurons. As in the case of neuronal PC12 cells, knock down of either c-Jun or FoxOs was sufficient to fully repress induction of endogenous Bim protein after NGF deprivation (Fig. 6). The pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim is induced and participates in neuronal death brought about by NGF deprivation (6Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 7Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Three different apoptotic transcriptional pathways have been implicated in regulation of Bim protein expression under such circumstances. These are the JNK/c-Jun, AKT/FoxO, and cell cycle (Cdk4/E2F/Myb) pathways. The involvement of multiple pathways has raised the questions of whether these act redundantly and are each sufficient for Bim induction or whether each pathway is necessary, but not sufficient, for this action. Although a number of studies support involvement of JNK/c-Jun signaling in Bim induction after NGF deprivation, it was unclear whether this was due to direct interaction of c-Jun with the Bim promoter. We identified an AP1 binding site in the Bim promoter and found that NGF deprivation leads to enhanced occupancy of the endogenous Bim promoter by endogenous c-Jun. This finding complements prior observations that the Bim promoter contains binding sites for Mybs and for FoxO and that the occupancy of these sites is enhanced by NGF deprivation. Thus, there are binding sites on the Bim promoter for the transcription factors that are activated as an end result of each pathway, and each shows elevated occupancy after NGF withdrawal. To test the hypothesis that activation of all three pathways is required for optimal Bim induction by NGF withdrawal, we examined expression of both Bim promoter-driven luciferase reporters and of endogenous Bim. We found that in contrast to an intact wild-type construct, Bim promoter-reporters separately mutated to abolish binding sites for either Mybs, FoxOs, or c-Jun failed to show induction in response to NGF deprivation. Similar results were achieved with the wild-type promoter-reporter when we individually knocked down expression of any of the three transcription factors with shRNAs. Comparable findings were made using a Bim promoter-reporter that contained additional sequence, including the first intron of the rat Bim gene (which possesses additional regulatory sites). Finally, shRNAs to the individual transcription factors each suppressed induction of endogenous Bim in NGF-deprived cells. Our findings support a model in which the Bim promoter acts as a coincidence detector that does not yield induction of the gene unless all three transcriptional pathways (JNK/c-Jun, AKT/FoxO, and Cdk4/E2F/Myb) are activated in response to NGF deprivation. That is, induction does not occur unless the promoter is simultaneously occupied by c-Jun, FoxOs, and Mybs. Although it is possible to induce Bim by overexpression of individual transcription factors (11Biswas S.C. Liu D.X. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8349-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), our findings indicate that this does not happen under physiologic conditions. What purpose might be served by a mechanism requiring three different signaling pathways to drive Bim expression and death? One might be as part of a fail-safe system to ensure that neurons do not accidentally commit suicide by launching any single pathway. Additionally, requiring all three pathways would permit neurons to use each separately for other physiologic functions. For example, JNK signaling appears to play required roles in neurite outgrowth and synaptic remodeling as well as in neuronal repair (28Waetzig V. Zhao Y. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2006; 80: 84-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and c-Jun is an immediate early gene for NGF signaling that appears to be necessary for neuronal differentiation (29Eriksson M. Taskinen M. Leppa S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that c-Myb is expressed in healthy rat brain neurons (30Shin D.H. Lee H.W. Jeon G.S. Lee H.Y. Lee K.H. Cho S.S. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, such a mechanism would permit selective responses to different apoptotic stimuli. For instance, although neuron death evoked by DNA damage requires Myb induction (23Liu D.X. Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in this case Bim is not required for neuron death and alternative signaling pathways appear to cooperate with Mybs to cause apoptosis 4S. C. Biswas and L. A. Greene, unpublished observations. (31Wyttenbach A. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the present study has focused on NGF deprivation, the same mechanism could pertain to other paradigms of neuron death involving Bim induction. For example, Bim is elevated in entorhinal neurons of Alzheimer disease patients and in culture is both induced by β amyloid and required for death evoked by this peptide (32Biswas S.C. Shi Y. Vonsattel J.P. Leung C.L. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This induction correlates with activation of the cell cycle pathway in Alzheimer disease neurons and requires activation of this pathway in cellular Alzheimer disease models (32Biswas S.C. Shi Y. Vonsattel J.P. Leung C.L. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Death under such circumstances also requires activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway (33Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Connors T.J. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 157-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that JNK activity is required for β amyloid-promoted Bim induction (34Yao M. Nguyen T.V. Pike C.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that intraneuronal expression of β amyloid represses AKT signaling (35Magrane J. Rosen K.M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Gouras G.K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10960-10969Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that there is reduced hippocampal phospho-AKT in transgenic mice that overexpress β amyloid (36Abbott J.J. Howlett D.R. Francis P.T. Williams R.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; (Epub ahead of print, Feb. 8, 2007)PubMed Google Scholar). Such actions would favor nuclear translocation of FoxOs. Thus, it may well be that all three of the pathways considered here are active and required for Bim induction in Alzheimer models as well as in Alzheimer disease itself.

In contrast, our study with RNase I shows that DsbA is a sufficient catalyst for correct disulfide formation in vivo and in vitro. DsbA is therefore more specific than generally assumed. Further, we show that the redox potential of the periplasm depends on the presence of glutathione and the Dsb proteins to maintain it at–165 mV. We determined the influence of this redox potential on the folding of RNase I. Under the more oxidizing conditions of dsb– strains, DsbC becomes necessary to correct non-native disulfides, but it cannot substitute for DsbA. Altogether, DsbA folds a protein with a nonconsecutive disulfide as long as no incorrect disulfides are formed. One of the last unsolved problems of molecular biology is how the sequential amino acid information leads to a functional protein. Correct disulfide formation within a protein is hereby essential.

Altogether, DsbA folds a protein with a nonconsecutive disulfide as long as no incorrect disulfides are formed. Disulfide bond formation is an essential step in the folding of many proteins. Anfinsen et al. (1Anfinsen C.B. Kim E. Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) have stated that “From chemical and physical studies of reformed enzyme, it may be concluded that the information for correct pairing of half-cystine residues in disulfide linkage, and for the assumption of the native secondary and tertiary structures, is contained in the amino acid sequence itself”. The reformed enzyme is bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, a protein with four disulfides (three between nonconsecutive cysteines and one between consecutive). However, the rate of in vitro disulfide bond formation was much slower than the rates observed in living cells, and the yield of active enzyme was low (much of the protein containing the incorrect disulfide bonds). The explanation for the fast in vivo rates is resolved with the discovery that an enzyme is required to catalyze efficient disulfide bond formation (2Peek J.A. Kim R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Kamitani S. Kim Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 4Bardwell J.C. Kim K. Beckwith J.

Chem. 1966; 241: 1562-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). PDI is present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of four thioredoxin-like domains. This essential enzyme has the ability to catalyze both the oxidation of new disulfides and the isomerization of existing disulfides (6Freedman R.B. Kim P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic protein DsbA is the catalyst of disulfide formation (4Bardwell J.C. Kim K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 7Messens J. Kim J.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). DsbA, however, is not a very specific oxidant and can introduce non-native disulfide bonds, which need to be corrected. To correct these non-native disulfides, the cell uses two protein disulfide isomerases, DsbC (8Missiakas D. Kim C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Shevchik V.E. Kim G. Robert-Baudouy J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and DsbG (10Bessette P.H. Kim J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol.

The structural and enzymatic properties of both enzymes and their recycling by the inner membrane protein DsbD are reported in a recent review (7Messens J. Kim J.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Today, the native substrates of DsbG are not known. Most of the substrates in the study of oxidative protein folding in E. coli are eukaryotic in origin (12Rietsch A. Kim P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Sun X.X. Kim C.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the periplasm of E. coli, there are more than 300 proteins with at least two cysteines, suggesting that they are potential physiological substrates for DsbA (15Hiniker A. Kim J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 516-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). DsbA can properly fold the vast majority of these proteins. However, some of these proteins, like the peptidoglycan amidase MepA and the phytase AppA contain multiple disulfides, some of which are formed between cysteines in nonconsecutive positions (16Lim D. Kim S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Marcyjaniak M. Kim S.G. Sabala I. Bochtler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43982-43989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Work on AppA and MepA suggests that the formation of these nonconsecutive disulfides is dependent on DsbC (18Hiniker A. Kim J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Berkmen M. Kim D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have determined the structure of another DsbC substrate (18Hiniker A. Kim J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the periplasmic ribonuclease (RNase I) (20Padmanabhan S. Kim K. Chu C.Y. Lim R.W. Lim L.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We show that RNase I contains four disulfides, three consecutive and one non-consecutive and is therefore a physiologically relevant model protein to study oxidative protein folding in E. coli. Through studies of wild type and disulfide mutants of RNase I as substrates for the Dsb oxidoreductases, we show that a protein with a nonconsecutive disulfide may in vivo as well as in vitro fold to its proper structure with DsbA alone and that the dependence on DsbC is linked to the redox state of the environment. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—RNase I disulfide mutants are constructed. Wild type DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, RNase I 2The abbreviations used are: RNase I, ribonuclease I; ruRNase I, reduced and unfolded RNase I; scRNase I, scrambled RNase I; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid., and the RNase I mutants are expressed and purified. The details can be found in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures” data. Reduced and Unfolded RNase I (ruRNase I)—RNase I (∼10 mg/ml) was reduced and unfolded in a buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.7, 50 mm NaCl, 6 m GdnHCl, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. To remove the excess of GdnHCl and dithiothreitol, the mixture was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.7, 0.6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 15 °C. The dialysis buffer was argon-flushed for 30 min. All 8 cysteines were found to react with Ellman reagent indicating that all were reduced (21Wright S.K. Kim R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Scrambled RNase I (scRNase I)—To induce the formation of incorrect disulfides in ruRNase I (scrambled RNase I), the sample of ruRNase I was incubated with 50 μm CuCl2 and 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 25 °C. Excess of CuCl2 and H2O2 were removed by a final dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 0.6 m GdnHCl, and 50 mm NaCl. In Vitro Folding—RNase I was refolded by mixing ruRNase I or scRNase I with Dsb protein (DsbA and/or DsbC and/or DsbG) in folding buffer solution to obtain a final concentration of 5 μm RNase I and 20 μm Dsb protein. The folding mixture was incubated for 3 min at 15 °C. All buffer solutions were argon-flushed for 15 min. Details about the folding buffer solution preparation are in the supplemental data. RNase I Activity Assay—The RNA hydrolysis activity was measured in a methylene blue RNase I assay (22Greiner-Stoeffele T. Kim M. Hahn U. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The absorbance change was followed in function of time at 659 nm. The measured RNase activities are the initial velocities determined on the first 10% of the progress curves. A linear response was observed for RNase I concentrations between 9 and 36 nm. More details can be found in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures” data. Dsb-refolded RNase I for Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy and Crystallization—After 3-min refolding at 15 °C, the reaction was stopped by injecting the sample on a Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0. As a control for spontaneous folding in redox buffer solution, reduced and unfolded RNase I in the absence of Dsb proteins was injected. RNase I eluted with 1 m NaCl in the same buffer solution. His-tagged Dsb proteins were eluted with 1 m imidazole in the same buffer solution. The RNase activity of the flow-through, the 1 m NaCl elution fraction, and the imidazole fraction were measured. No RNase activity was detected in the flow-through of the column. Spontaneous folding of ruRNase yielded 10% of wild type activity, and DsbA-catalyzed folding yielded 83% of wild type activity. RNase I wild type, ruRNase I, scRNase I, DsbA-refolded ruR-Nase I, DsbA/C-refolded scRNase I were dialyzed against 50 mm boric acid, pH 8.0, 100 mm KF buffer solution for CD spectroscopy or against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 20 mm NaCl for crystallization. Samples for crystallization were concentrated to 8 and 9.5 mg/ml. Samples for CD were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml, and for each sample 10 scans were recorded between 200 and 250 nm in a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Crystal Structure Determination—Crystals of DsbA-refolded RNase I were grown in hanging drop vapor diffusion method under the conditions as described (20Padmanabhan S. Kim K. Chu C.Y. Lim R.W. Lim L.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). X-ray data were collected at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) beamline X12 at the DESY synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). The crystals were first soaked for 1 min in a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 m Mes, pH 6.1, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2 and 28% PEG3350 and subsequently flash-frozen in the cryostream. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (23Otwinowski Z. Kim W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The structure was refined using Crystallography and NMR System software 1.0 (24Brunger A.T. Kim P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Messens and R. Loris, unpublished data. In the initial stages of refinement a slow cool protocol was alternated with the refinement of individual atomic B-factors. When the structure was near completion, the slow cool protocol was abandoned in favor of restrained positional refinement.

Open table in a new tab Periplasmic Extract Preparation—The isogenic strains containing the mutants dsbA::kan, dsbC::cm, dsbG::kan, gshA::kan, CydD::kan, and the double mutant strains dsbA::kan/dsbD::cm, dsbC::cm/dsbG::kan were introduced by P1 transduction into MC1000 wild type E. coli. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium with their specific antibiotic(s). This pre-culture was diluted 100 times in a chemical defined M63 medium (25Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar), except that the casaminoacids only contained isoleucine and leucine. The culture was grown at 37 °C until it reached an A600 of 1.0. After the determination of the exact volume and cell density, cells were harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g in JLA-8.1, 15 min) at 4 °C. The equivalent of the pellet obtained from a 300-ml culture with an A600 nm of 1 was resuspended in 1-ml buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, and 2.5 mm EDTA. The sample was left for 30 min on ice and subsequently diluted five times with H2O containing 1 mm gadolinium chloride to block cytoplasmic leakage (26Ewis H.E. Kim C.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After another 15 min on ice, the supernatant of a 3500 × g × 30-min centrifuge run was 0.22 μ filtered and argon-flushed for 15 min. Redox Potential of the Periplasm—The redox potential in the periplasm of wild type E. coli MC1000 and in the dsb– strains was measured at a sample temperature of 23 °C with a WTW Sentox ORP Ag/AgCl electrode. The electrode was calibrated with redox calibration solution (Schott Instruments) and corrected for E°Ag/AgCl = 220 mV according to Emeasured(Ag/AgCl)– E°Ag/AgCl = EAg/AgCl. The chemical redox potential (EAg/AgCl) at [H+] = 1 m was correlated to a biochemical redox potential at pH 7. Therefore, the EAg/AgCl values were corrected to pH 7 with–59 mV/pH unit to obtain E′Ag/AgCl. Starting from a stock of 50 mm GSH and 50 mm GSSG in a buffer solution of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 4% sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm gadolinium chloride and based on the Nernst equation with E°′GSH =–240 mV, a glutathione redox series was prepared with a calculated redox potential (E′GSH(cal)) ranging from–100 to –170 mV. After 15-min argon flushing, the redox potential of the glutathione series (E′GSH(Ag/AgCl)) was measured. The linear correlation between E′GSH(Ag/AgCl) and E′GSH(cal) was used to obtain the respective biochemical glutathione redox potentials of the periplasmic fractions (E′). All Disulfides of RNase I Are Essential for Optimal RNA Hydrolysis—We recently solved the crystal structure of E. coli RNase I at 1.4 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 2PQX).3 This structure shows an RNase T2-fold including three consecutive and one nonconsecutive disulfides (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal (1SS), the nonconsecutive (2SS), and the C-terminal disulfides (4SS) of RNase I are structurally conserved (Fig. 1B). All four disulfides must be correctly formed for RNase I to function properly. We mutated the disulfide bonds one by one by replacing the respective cysteines by alanines and measured RNA hydrolysis spectrophotometrically with methylene blue intercalating RNA as a substrate (22Greiner-Stoeffele T. Kim M. Hahn U. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Cys25-Cys39 disulfide is located within α-helix 1 between the β1 and β2 strands (Fig. 1A). After we mutated this disulfide, the RNA hydrolysis activity dropped 10-fold relative to wild type. Residues between Cys25 and Cys39 (Fig. 1A, orange) might be important for the correct positioning of the RNA substrate by base binding. A possible candidate residue is Phe24, which is also found on this position in the structure of Nicotiona alata SF11-RNase (27Ida K. Kim S. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Yamashita E. Newbigin E. Clarke A.E. Sakiyama F. Sato M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The next disulfide is between the nonconsecutive cysteines Cys80 and Cys136 at the C-terminal end of the α-helix 6, which bears the conserved catalytic residues Glu129, Lys132, and His133. Removing this disulfide fully repressed the expression of the C80A/C136A double mutant. Here, the exposure of conserved hydrophobic residues located on the N-terminal site of α-helix 7 (Fig. 1A, green) and on α-helix 6 (Fig. 1A, blue) might result in the formation of aggregates or the misfolded protein might be proteolytically degraded. Removing the consecutive Cys97-Cys124 disulfide located on the N-terminal site of α-helix 6 reduced the RNA hydrolysis activity to 10% of wild type. As such, the consecutive Cys97-Cys124 and the nonconsecutive Cys80-Cys136 disulfides, located on both sites of the α-helix 6 (Fig. 1A, blue), are essential for positioning the side chains of the residues of the active site and of the conserved hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1A). Less important for RNA hydrolysis is the conserved Cys197-Cys234 disulfide. Mutating this disulfide reduced the activity to 86% of wild type. The fact that RNase I is an endogenous enzyme that depends on the formation of a nonconsecutive disulfide for correct folding makes it a nice model to compare the ability of Dsb proteins to catalyze the formation of a nonconsecutive disulfide in vitro and in vivo. In Vitro, DsbA Alone Folds a Protein with a Nonconsecutive Disulfide—Despite the presence of a nonconsecutive disulfide, DsbA on its own refolds reduced, unfolded RNase I. We have studied the specific role of DsbA, DsbC, and DsbG in the folding of reduced, unfolded RNase I (ruRNase I) and evaluated activity and structure (Fig. 2, A and B). The work of Haber and Anfinsen (28Haber E. Kim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 422-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on bovine pancreatic RNase A shows spontaneous folding and disulfide formation by molecular oxygen. Therefore, to discriminate between noncatalyzed, spontaneous folding and Dsb-catalyzed folding of recombinant RNase I, we performed experiments within 3 min at 15 °C, pH 7.2. Under these conditions, in glutathione redox buffer solution, the yield of noncatalyzed refolded RNase I was less than 10% in all the assays. RNase I was correctly refolded by DsbA, as shown by using kinetics and CD spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, the crystal structure of DsbA-refolded RNase I (Table 1) turned out to be identical to the in vivo folded protein (root mean square deviation of 0.16 Å for 233 Cα atoms) (Fig. 1A) univocally proving that DsbA can correctly refold a protein with a nonconsecutive disulfide. Remarkably, the refolding by DsbC results in about the same amount of functional RNase I as refolding by DsbA. DsbC can function as an oxidase in vitro; this result agrees with the observation of Zapun et al. (14Zapun A. Kim D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We then prepared scRNase I in the presence of CuCl2 and H2O2, i.e. RNase I with incorrect disulfides (29Hiniker A. Kim J.F. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33785-33791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). No free cysteines were detected with Ellman reagent (21Wright S.K. Kim R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and scRNase I had completely lost its activity. DsbA was essentially unable to refold scRNase I, and only with the help of the isomerase activity of DsbC could RNase I regain its activity and structure (Fig. 2, A and B). DsbC seems to play an essential role in the handling of incorrect disulfides, which may form in a more oxidizing environment. On the other hand, DsbG, which has been shown to have significant isomerase activity (10Bessette P.H. Kim J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), does not catalyze the refolding of scrambled or reduced-unfolded RNase I. DsbA and DsbC Work in Concert—We studied the influence of the redox potential on the Dsb-catalyzed refolding of RNase I. The redox potential influenced the in vitro refolding of ruRNase I very little (Fig. 2C). Between –120 and –170 mV, the efficiency of refolding of ruRNase I by DsbA and DsbC alone was found within the same range. The highest yield of refolded ruRNase I was obtained under the condition where DsbA was combined with DsbC and this over the whole redox potential range tested (Fig. 3B). As such, DsbA and DsbC seem to work in concert to increase the efficiency of the refolding of ruRNase I. We performed a similar experiment with DsbC on scRNase I (data not shown). Also, the refolding by DsbC was found to be redox independent. In Vitro, DsbC operates on scRNase I and on ruRNase I over a broad redox potential range, but the refolding efficiency is higher when DsbC and DsbA are combined. In Vivo, DsbA Is Essential to Catalyze RNase I Folding—To check the Dsb-dependence for the folding of RNase I in vivo, single and double knock-out strains of the different dsb genes were constructed. To probe for structural integrity of RNase I, RNA hydrolysis activity in periplasmic fractions was used (Fig. 3A). Periplasmic fractions were prepared with osmotic shocks in the presence of 1 mm gadolinium chloride to block cytoplasmic leakage (26Ewis H.E. Kim C.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the EDTA concentration was increased to 2 mm, as the only EDTA-insensitive RNase from E. coli is RNase I (30Zaniewski R. Kim E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11651-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removing DsbG has no significant effect on the RNase I activity, suggesting that this oxidoreductase is not involved in the folding of RNase I. The exact in vivo role of DsbG in E. coli is still unclear (7Messens J. Kim J.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Also removing DsbD shows hardly any decrease of the RNase I activity. In the absence of DsbD, DsbC is unlikely to function as an isomerase because DsbC is not recycled, indicating that DsbA and/or oxidized DsbC are the main folding catalysts involved. Oxidized DsbC can be excluded as a possible folding catalyst because a dsbA–/dsbD– double mutant strain showed no activity. This leaves us with DsbA as the possible folding catalyst. In a dsbA– strain, no RNase activity was detected, confirming the dependence of this protein on DsbA and suggesting that DsbC cannot substitute for DsbA. In a dsbC– strain the activity drops 2-fold relative to wild type, indicating that DsbA can reasonably well catalyze the formation of the required nonconsecutive disulfide, even in a more oxidizing (vide infra) complex periplasmic environment. dsb– Strains Have a More Oxidizing Periplasm—The redox potential of the periplasm is not known. According to our knowledge, this is the first time that the redox potential of the periplasm of E. coli is determined. The redox potential is pH-dependent as soon as protons are involved. In the wild type dsb– strains, the pH was found to be around 6.6 ± 0.3 (n = 20), which is also the optimal pH for RNase I catalysis. The measured redox potential was correlated to a glutathione biochemical redox potential at pH 7 (see “Experimental Procedures”). For each condition at least 10 replicates were measured. The redox potential of the periplasm of E. coli was found to be –165 ± 10 mV (n = 15) (Fig. 3B). Removing DsbC shifts the redox balance to a more oxidizing condition. Unexpectedly, removing DsbA also increases the redox potential of the periplasm to a more oxidizing environment (from –165 mV to –147 mV) (Fig. 3B). For comparison, 30 mV is about the difference in redox potential observed between a differentiated and an apoptotic cell (31Schafer F.Q. Kim G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar). As in the dsbC–/dsbG– (–142 mV) and dsbA–/dsbD– (–133 mV) strains, the more Dsb proteins are removed, the more oxidizing the periplasm becomes. Altogether, our data suggest that Dsb proteins are therefore part of the redox balance of the periplasm. These results question whether the decreased activity of RNase I in a dsbC– strain is only because of the absence of the isomerase activity of DsbC. A novel possible explanation is that a higher redox potential in a dsbC– strain will lead to the formation of non-native disulfides. These non-native disulfides cannot be corrected by DsbA, which explains a decreased activity (Fig. 3, A and B). This new interpretation fits well with the fact that no activity is detected in a dsbC–/dsbG– strain, where the redox potential is high and is in agreement with our in vitro results. Glutathione and the Dsb Proteins Determine the Redox Balance of the Periplasm—We determined whether glutathione could play the role of a redox buffer in the periplasm, as it does in the cytoplasm. Removing one of the gene products required for the synthesis of glutathione (gshA–) or the recently identified glutathione transporter (CydD–) (32Pittman M.S. Kim H.C. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32254-32261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) increases the redox potential of the periplasm to –125 mV. Our results suggest that glutathione does play the role of a redox balance in the periplasm. However, it has no effect on RNase I activity (Fig. 3). As such, the formation of correct disulfides in RNase I is clearly kinetically driven by DsbA and DsbC and not by its redox environment. The cell seems to have evolved to a DsbA-DsbC cooperating system balanced by the presence of GSH/GSSG and the Dsb proteins. Removing one of the redox components has consequences on the redox potential. Oxidative Protein Folding Revisited—One of the established folding ideas is that there exists a correlation between the disulfide pattern and the DsbC-dependence. Proteins that contain nonconsecutive disulfides depend on DsbC for proper folding, whereas proteins with consecutive disulfides show no dependence on DsbC (12Rietsch A. Kim P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Hiniker A. Kim J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Berkmen M. Kim D. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

Our results on RNase I are surprising and in apparent contradiction with this view. Hiniker and Bardwell (18Hiniker A. Kim J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported that dsbC– strains show no RNase I activity and as such concluded DsbC-dependence of RNase I. However, in contrast to their results, we clearly observe RNase I activity in a dsbC– strain, what makes that DsbA is reasonably good in folding a protein with a nonconsecutive disulfide in a more oxidizing environment. The discrepancy is likely to originate from a different technique used to measure RNase activity in vivo. Berkmen et al. (19Berkmen M. Kim D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11387-11394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) obtained the same results as ours for phytase AppA, a nonconsecutive disulfide containing enzyme of E. coli. Also here, AppA refolds partially in a dsbC– strain and shows almost base-line activity in a dsbA– strain. However, the in vitro capability of DsbA to refold AppA was not studied, and the redox potential during the folding was not taken into account. They conclude that the nonconsecutive disulfide bond of AppA renders it dependent on DsbC. Our data show that there is another way to interpret these results. The observed decrease of AppA activity in a dsbC– strain could be because of the increase of the redox potential causing the formation of incorrect disulfides. For RNase I, the combination of the folding catalysts DsbA with DsbC results as well in vivo as in vitro in the highest folding efficiency even in a more oxidizing environment. On the other hand, DsbC on its own does not catalyze the folding of RNase I in vivo, whereas in vitro it was found to be as good as DsbA. This discrepancy emphasizes the difference in chemical environment between the complex environment of the periplasm and a buffer solution with glutathione. Mimicking an in vivo periplasm with the correct redox buffer solution at equilibrium in the presence of its Dsb proteins seems to be only part of the folding story. Living cells are not at equilibrium but are maintained at a steady state. In fact, a cell at true equilibrium is a dead cell. Therefore, the rates of the biochemical reactions coupled between DsbA and DsbB, and between DsbC and DsbD, and with all other compounds further down-stream might be more relevant for proper folding than the equilibrium constants. New in the oxidative folding interpretation of the in vivo results is the fact that until now nobody has ever taken the effect of redox potentials in dsb– strains into account. In a dsbC– strain, the redox potential increases, and in this more oxidizing environment, incorrect disulfides might be introduced. Especially under this condition, the protein would benefit from the presence of DsbC to correct non-native disulfides. As such, for future interpretations of results obtained in dsb– strains, the redox potential change of the periplasm should be systematically taken into account. By using dsb– strains from E. coli in combination with RNase I mutants, we showed in vitro and in vivo that although the presence of a nonconsecutive disulfide, RNase I folds to its native structure in the presence of DsbA alone, what makes DsbA more specific than previously assumed. Only in a more oxidizing environment when incorrect disulfide bonds are formed, the role of DsbC as an isomerase is essential. As such, the established oxidative folding idea that proteins with non-consecutive disulfides require DsbC has to be treated in a more subtle way or case-by-case.

https://openalex.org/W1983272393,"The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a docking protein of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor and of the insulin receptor. IRS-1 sends a strong mitogenic, anti-apoptotic signal and plays an important role in cell transformation and cancer. IRS-1 translocates to nuclei of cells, where it increases the activity of the rDNA, c-myc and cyclin D1 promoters. We show, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, occupancy by IRS-1 of the same promoters. Both promoter activation and promoter occupancy are IGF-1-dependent. In cells that respond to IGF-1 but in which IRS-1 does not translocate to nuclei, promoter occupancy is absent and promoter activation is absent or much reduced. Transcriptional activation of c-myc and cyclin D1 promoters by nuclear IRS-1 does not occur with a mutant, inactive IRS-1 protein (deletion of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, PTB) and does not require PI3-kinase activity. Taken together, these results indicate a novel mechanism by which nuclear IRS-1 activates cell cycle genes."

The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned from the genomic library of the bacterium using probes derived from the NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. An open reading frame of 409 amino acids was identified, and the sequence had 32% identity with that of β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltrasferase in Photobacterium damselae JT0160. DNA fragments that encoded the full-length protein and a protein that lacked the sequence between the 2nd and 24th residues at the NH2 terminus were amplified by polymerase chain reactions and cloned into an expression vector. The full-length and truncated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, producing active enzymes of 0.25 and 305 milliunits, respectively, per milliliter of the medium in the lysate of E. coli. The truncated enzyme was much more soluble without detergent than the full-length enzyme. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of N-acetylneuraminic acid from CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid to disaccharides, such as lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, with low apparent Km and to monosaccharides, such as α-methyl-galactopyranoside and β-methyl-galactopyranoside, with much lower apparent Km. Thus, this sialyltransferase is unique and should be very useful for achieving high productivity in E. coli with a wide substrate range."

Kolawole T. Eur. J. Radiol. 1998; 29: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ossification could enlarge the spinal canal and compresses the spinal cord, resulting in serious neurological damages. Epidemiology has shown that high incidence rate of OLF occurs in thoracic spine (2Ben Hamouda K. Jemel H. Haouet S. Khaldi M. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 99: 157-161PubMed Google Scholar). It has been documented that obesity represents a risk factor for thoracic ossification of ligament flavum (TOLF), particularly in Asian people (3Vasudevan A. Knuckey N.W. J. Clin. Neurosci. 2002; 9: 311-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, hereditary obese rats, Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats, are prone to OLF (4Okano T. Ishidou Y. Kato M. Imamura T. Yonemori K. Origuchi N. Matsunaga S. Yoshida H. ten Dijke P. Sakou T. J. Orthop. Res. 1997; 15: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A common feature of obese people is hyperleptinemia (5Shirakura Y. Sugiyama T. Tanaka H. Taguchi T. Kawai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Leptin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine, can stimulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of various cell lines, such as the embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2, human NHOst cells, and human osteoblastic cells (6Hess R. Pino A.M. Rios S. Fernandez M. Rodriguez J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Iwamoto I. Fujino T. Douchi T. Gynecol. Endocrinol. 2004; 19: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the osteogenic effect of leptin in TOLF is not totally understood. Leptin exerts its biological activity through binding to its receptors, which belong to cytokine receptor superfamily. Different leptin receptor isoforms exist, including a long form (ObRb) and a short form (ObRa) (8Aleffi S. Petrai I. Bertolani C. Parola M. Colombatto S. Novo E. Vizzutti F. Anania F.A. Milani S. Rombouts K. Laffi G. Pinzani M. Marra F. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that leptin activates cytokine-like signal transduction via the long form receptor. Upon leptin stimulation, intracellular Janus tyrosine kinases are activated via transphosphorylation and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the long form leptin receptor and on signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (9Zhang F. Chen Y. Heiman M. Dimarchi R. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 71: 345-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. We report here that STAT3 signaling pathway was involved in the osteogenic differentiation of TOLF cells in response to leptin. The p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators SRC-1, but not GRIP1 and AIB1, interacted with STAT3. We showed that STAT3, SRC-1, and Runx2 are components of the transcription complex recruited to the Runx2 target gene promoters to regulate the target gene transcription. Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal anti-ob-receptor, polyclonal anti-ERK1/2, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-osteocalcin, and anti-Runx2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-STAT3 and anti-phospho-STAT3 Tyr705 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Recombinant human leptin was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PD98059, SP600125, and AG490 were obtained from Promega and Calbiochem and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) before use. Clinical Diagnosis and Spinal Ligament Samples—The diagnosis of TOLF or non-TOLF (i.e. other thoracic diseases) was confirmed by x-ray, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the whole spine preoperatively to avoid any other non-thoracic OLF patients. The clinical diagnoses and the spinal ligament tissues used in this study are shown in Table 1. Ligaments were aseptically harvested from patients during surgery and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Surrounding tissue was carefully removed under a dissecting microscope. In all cases the ligaments were extirpated carefully from nonossified sites to avoid any possible contamination of osteogenic cells. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Health Science Center.TABLE 1Tissue samples used in the study, showing clinical diagnosis, patient's sex and age, and tissue derived TT, thoracic trauma; ST, spinal tuberculosis; TSS, thoracolumber spinal stenosis; TF, thoracic fibroneuroma; M, male; F, female; BMI, body mass index.TOLFNon-TOLFCodeDiagnosisSex/ageTissueBMICodeDiagnosisSex/ageTissueBMIO-1aMean obesityTOLFM/51TLF25.6N-1TTM/46TLF23.7O-2TOLFM/52TLF23.1N-2STM/48TLF23.2O-3aMean obesityTOLFM/60TLF25.3N-3TTM/47TLF23.4O-4aMean obesityTOLFM/68TLF25.7N-4aMean obesityTTM/56TLF25.3O-5TOLFM/69TLF23.3N-5TSSM/57TLF22.8O-6aMean obesityTOLFF/48TLF26.2N-6TTF/43TLF23.5O-7aMean obesityTOLFF/53TLF25.5N-7aMean obesityTTF/57TLF25.2O-8aMean obesityTOLFF/64TLF26.1N-8aMean obesityTTF/65TLF25.1O-9aMean obesityTOLFF/65TLF25.8N-9TFF/66TLF23.4O-10aMean obesityTOLFF/66TLF25.1N-10TTF/73TLF23.1a Mean obesity Open table in a new tab Cell Cultures—Collected ligaments were minced into about 0.5-mm3 pieces and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline then plated in 6-cm culture dishes and maintained in DMEM medium (10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells derived from explants were removed from the dish with 0.02% EDTA, 0.05% trypsin for passage. The first and third passage cells were used in the following studies (10Specchia N. Pagnotta A. Gigante A. Logroscino G. Toesca A. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Colorimetric 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cell proliferation was measured by MTT dye reduction assay. Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates overnight and exposed to the leptin at different concentrations for different times. The cells then were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. After removal of MTT, 150 μl of Me2SO were added to the cells, and the plates were shaken at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (7Iwamoto I. Fujino T. Douchi T. Gynecol. Endocrinol. 2004; 19: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mineralization Assay—Cells from TOLF patients (TOLF cells) and non-TOLF patients (non-TOLF cells) were plated at 40,000 cells/well in 6-well dishes and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. On confluence, designated day 0, cells were exposed to leptin medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 ng/ml leptin. Medium was replaced for every 3 to 4 days. Samples were processed at 4 weeks, and alizarin red assay (Sigma) was performed to determine mineralization. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and water and fixed with ice-cold 100% ethanol for 60 min at 4 °C. Fixed cultures were incubated with 1% alizarin red for 30 min and washed with distilled water for several times. Extracellular matrix mineral-bound stain was photographed under microscopy (11Huitema L.F. Vaandrager A.B. van Weeren P.R. Barneveld A. Helms J.B. van de Lest C.H. Calcif.

Semiquantitative PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cell monolayers using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen), and any potential DNA contamination was removed by RNase-free DNase treatment. mRNA expression of various genes was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Primer sets used for amplification were: osteocalcin, 5′-AGGGCAGCGAGGTAGTGA-3′ (forward), 5′-CCTGAAAGCCGATGTGGT-3′ (reverse); ALP, 5′-CTGATGTGGAGTATGA-3′ (forward), 5′-TGTATCTCGGTTTGAA-3′ (reverse); β-actin 5′-TTAGTTGCGTTACACCCTTTC-3′ (forward), 5′-GCTGT CACCT TCACC GTTC-3′ (reverse); ObRb, 5′-TCACCCAGTGATTACAAGCT-3′ (forward), 5′-CTGGAGAACTCTGATGTCCG-3′ (reverse). For quantification of gene expression, all products were assayed in the exponential phase of the amplification curve, and the PCR cycles were determined for each primer pair. Amplified products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization. Visualized PCR product bands were detected by AlphaImager 2200 (Alpha Innotech). All products were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. For real-time PCR, PCR reactions were performed in triplicates using the SYBR® Green Master Mix (ABI, Warrington, UK) and the ABI 7300 Real Time PCR system. Transcript levels were normalized to β-actin levels. ALP Assays—The ALP activity was measured after rinsing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), then solubilized in Tris/glycine/Triton buffer (pH 8.5, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and sonicated on ice. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. One hundred microliters of freshly prepared p-nitrophenyl-phosphate substrate (1.5 mg/ml) was added to 200 μl of the supernatant and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For the generation of a standard curve, serial dilutions of a p-nitrophenol standard solution were prepared, and 100 μl of each concentration was included in each tube. The enzymatic reaction was terminated with the addition of 0.3 ml of ice-cold NaOH (0.1 m) solution. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. Concentrations of protein were determined with a Bradford protein assay using BSA as standard. Results are expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol/μg of cellular protein/min (12Ciancaglini P. Simao A.M.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase and renilla activities were measured using dual luciferase kit (Promega). The firefly luciferase data for each sample were normalized based on transfection efficiency measured by renilla luciferase activity. Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were precleaned with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 30 min followed by pelleting the beads. Anti-Runx2 antibody was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected after the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Precipitates were suspended in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged, and resuspended in 0.5 m Tris-buffered saline (pH 6.8), containing 2% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% phenol blue. The protein samples were then denatured at 95 °C for 4 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transblotted to Hybond/ECL nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated with an appropriately diluted primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG. Signals were visualized with diaminobenzidine on LAS3000 Lumi-Imager (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP Re-immunoprecipitation (Re-ChIP) Assay—ChIP experiments were performed according to the method described elsewhere (14Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J.

The presence of the target gene promoter sequences in both the input DNA and the recovered DNA immunocomplexes were detected by real-time PCR using DNA as template for real-time PCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences for specific promoter regions (within -500 to +100 regions, corresponding to the transcription start sites of genes) are shown below. The data obtained were normalized to the corresponding DNA input control. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: for osteocalcin: forward, 5′-CGGGCAGTCTGATTGTGGC-3′ (position -261), and reverse, 5′-CTCATGGTGTCTCGGTGGC-3′ (position +23); control sequence, forward, 5′-AAAGTGGTGGTGACAAAGGC-3′ (position -3368), and reverse, 5′-TGAGTGGCGATAGTGGAGC-3′ (position -3234). The Re-ChIP assays were performed as described earlier (15Zhang H. Yi X. Sun X. Yin N. Shi B. Wu H. Wang D. Wu G. Shang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated complexes obtained by ChIP were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 20 times with sonication buffer and subjected to the ChIP procedure. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by analysis of variance, and the Student-Newman-Kleuss method was used to estimate the level of significance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Leptin on Proliferation and Osteogenic Differentiation of TOLF and Non-TOLF Cells—As stated above, hyperleptinemia is a risk factor for TOLF; to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying leptin-stimulated TOLF, we first examined the effect of leptin on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of TOLF and non-TOLF cells. In these experiments TOLF and non-TOLF cells were treated with various concentrations of leptin for different periods of time. The effect of leptin treatment on cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT methodologies, and cell osteogenic differentiation was assessed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, ALP assay, and mineralization assay. As shown in Fig. 1, real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that whereas leptin stimulated the proliferation of a breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, it had no significant effect on the proliferation of either TOLF cells or non-TOLF cells (Fig. 1A). However, leptin treatment resulted in a significant increase in mRNA expression of ALP and osteocalcin in TOLF cells but not in non-TOLF cells, and the effect was both dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 1, B–E). In agreement with the real-time RT-PCR experiments, ALP activity assay and Western blotting demonstrated that both the activity of ALP and the protein expression of osteocalcin were elevated in response to leptin stimulation in TOLF cells but not in non-TOLF cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, mineralization assays showed that whereas in the absence of leptin treatment, both TOLF cells and non-TOLF cells exhibited a fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped appearance and none of these cells manifested mineralization, under leptin stimulation the cell matrix began to mineralize, and crystals appeared at 4 weeks in 8 of 10 TOLF cell cultures, whereas no mineralization was observed in all 10 non-TOLF cell cultures (Fig. 2C). Collectively, all these experiments indicated that whereas leptin had no appreciable effect on the proliferation of both TOLF cells and non-TOLF cells, it stimulated osteogenic differentiation of TOLF cells but not non-TOLF cells.FIGURE 2Effects of leptin on osteocalcin proteins expression and ALP activity in TOLF and non-TOLF cells. Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptin for different periods of time (0–7 days), and cellular proteins were extracted for osteocalcin protein detection (A) and ALP activity measurement (B). Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. from 8 samples, and the asterisks indicate statistical significance (p < 0.05). Controls were cells maintained under resting state (0 days). C, comparison of TOLF and non-TOLF cells for the ability to form mineralized nodules. Cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After cultures reached confluence, cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 ng/ml leptin for the indicated periods of time (0–4 weeks) and then stained with alizarin red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Molecular Events Involved in Leptin-stimulated Osteogenesis in TOLF Cells—To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the osteogenic effect of leptin, we first examined the expression of leptin receptors in TOLF cells and non-TOLF cells. These cells were grown in normal media for 72 h and harvested for total protein and total RNA extraction. The expression of leptin receptor messengers and proteins was examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, similar expression levels of the mRNA and the protein of leptin receptor were detected in TOLF cells as well as in non-TOLF cells. As stated before, leptin is believed to exert its biological function through binding to its receptors, which in turn transduce the signal through the activation of STAT3, ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways (20Hegyi K. Fulop K. Kovacs K. Toth S. Falus A. Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Sweeney G. Cell .Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined the status of STAT3, ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation in response to leptin treatment in TOLF cells. Cellular proteins were extracted from TOLF cells that were exposed to leptin for various periods of time and were then immunoblotted with antibodies against phospho-STAT3, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38. These experiments showed that, whereas the total expression levels of STAT3, ERK1/2, and JNK were unchanged over the time of leptin treatment, the phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and JNK was stimulated by leptin (Fig. 3B). However, leptin treatment did not affect both the expression and the phosphorylation of p38 in TOLF cells, although leptin was capable of stimulating p38 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and T47-D in our experimental system (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these experiments indicated the osteogenic effect of leptin in TOLF cells could be mediated via STAT3, ERK1/2, and/or JNK signaling pathways. STAT3 Signaling Pathway Is Critically Involved in Leptin-induced Osteogenic Differentiation of TOLF Cells—To investigate whether activation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and JNK signaling pathways was indeed linked to the osteogenic effect of leptin in TOLF cells, we used selective inhibitors to block STAT3, ERK1/2, or JNK phosphorylation, respectively, and detected the expression of osteocalcin, a marker for cellular osteogenic differentiation, by real-time RT-PCR under the treatment of leptin. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of TOLF cells with Janus tyrosine kinase/STAT3 phosphorylation-selective inhibitor AG490 selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 protein. Analogously, treatment of TOLF cells with ERK1/2 phosphorylation-selective inhibitor PD98059 and JNK phosphorylation-selective inhibitor SP600125 selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK, respectively. Measurement of osteocalcin expression indicated that blocking phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK had only marginal effects on osteocalcin expression, whereas blocking STAT3 phosphorylation resulted in a significant reduction of leptin-induced osteocalcin expression (Fig. 4B), suggesting that STAT3 signaling pathway is the major mediator for the osteogenic effect of leptin in TOLF cells. Transactivation of Osteocalcin by STAT3 in TOLF Cells under Leptin Treatment—STAT3 is a cytoplasmic protein, which once phosphorylated is translocated into the nucleus where it regulates gene expression through interacting with cofactors (22Lo H.W.

Runx2 is a key transcriptional factor in cell osteogenic differentiation. Activated Runx2 transactivates the transcription of its target gene such as osteocalcin (23Zaidi S.K. Sullivan A.J. Medina R. Ito Y. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which in turn promotes cellular osteogenic differentiation (24Paredes R. Arriagada G. Cruzat F. Villagra A. Olate J. Zaidi K. van Wijnen A. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8847-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The observation that osteocalcin expression was increased by leptin treatment in TOLF cells (Fig. 1, C and E) suggests that leptin-activated STAT3 could be functionally linked to Runx2 in these cells. To investigate a functional interaction between STAT3 and Runx2 in transactivating Runx2 target genes, thus in mediating the osteogenic effect of leptin, we first examined if STAT3 could interact with Runx2 in the nucleus of TOLF cells under leptin stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with nuclear extractions of TOLF cells treated with leptin using STAT3 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with antibodies against Runx2. As shown in Fig. 5A, a physical interaction between STAT3 and Runx2 was detected in the nucleus of TOLF cells upon the stimulation of leptin treatment, providing a basis for a functional interaction between STAT3 and Runx2. STAT3 activates gene transcription through recruitment of coactivators that modify the chromatin architecture (25Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A.

Previous studies have shown that the p160 family coactivators, SRC-1, GRIP1, and AIB1, although originally identified as cofactors involved in nuclear receptor-mediated gene transcription, also participate in gene transcriptional activation mediated by other transcription factors, including STATs (29Arimura A. vn Peer M.

To investigate whether the p160 family coactivators are also implicated in the osteogenic activity of leptin, transient transfection experiments were performed to examine the enhancement of Runx2 target gene transcription by p160 coactivators. In these experiments osteocalcin gene promoter-driven luciferase (pOC-LUC) (13Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. Van Wijnen A.J.

As shown in Fig. 5B, the experiments indicated that SRC-1, but not GRIP1 or AIB1, was able to enhance the expression of the luciferase gene. This discrepancy was not a result of the coactivator protein abundance because the expression levels of SRC-1, GRIP1, and AIB1 in these cells were similar (Fig. 5C) and the enhanced expression of endogenou"

In this study, the mechanism whereby H ferritin regulates cSHMT expression was determined. cSHMT translation is shown to be regulated by an H ferritin-responsive internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located within the cSHMT mRNA 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). The cSHMT 5′-UTR exhibited IRES activity during in vitro translation of bicistronic mRNA templates, and in MCF-7 and HeLa cells transfected with bicistronic mRNAs. IRES activity was depressed in H ferritin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and elevated in cells expressing the H ferritin cDNA. H ferritin was shown to interact with the mRNA-binding protein CUGBP1, a protein known to interact with the α and β subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2. Small interference RNA-mediated depletion of CUGBP1 decreased IRES activity from bicistronic templates that included the cSHMT 3′-UTR in the bicistronic construct. The identification of this H ferritin-responsive IRES represents a mechanism that accounts for previous observations that H ferritin regulates folate metabolism.

The identification of this H ferritin-responsive IRES represents a mechanism that accounts for previous observations that H ferritin regulates folate metabolism. The term “folates” refers to a family of enzyme cofactors that carry and chemically activate single carbons at three different oxidation states and function in a metabolic network known as folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (1Christensen K.E. MacKenzie R.E. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Folate is required for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (see Fig. 1). Methionine can be adenosylated to form S-adenosylmethionine, which is a cofactor and primary methyl donor for numerous methylation reactions, including DNA, RNA, protein, lipid, and neurotransmitter methylation (2Finkelstein J.D. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S40-S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruptions within this metabolic network are common and result from nutrient deficiencies and/or penetrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (3Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62 (discussion S13): S3-S12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Impairments in one-carbon metabolism alter gene expression and genome stability and are associated with numerous pathologies and developmental anomalies, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neural tube defects (3Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62 (discussion S13): S3-S12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biomarkers of impaired folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism include elevated uracil content in DNA, hypomethylated DNA, and elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine and homocysteine.

Previous studies have demonstrated that cSHMT enzyme levels respond to changes in heavy chain ferritin (H ferritin) expression but not light chain ferritin expression (5Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transfection of the H ferritin cDNA in cultured cells markedly elevates cSHMT enzyme levels without affecting mRNA levels, leading to more efficient de novo thymidylate biosynthesis and impaired homocysteine remethylation (4Herbig K.

H ferritin is a subunit of the iron storage protein ferritin, which is a spherical and multimeric protein that is composed of 24 heavy chain and light chain subunits. The relative ratio of heavy chain and light chain polypeptides within a ferritin heteropolymer varies by tissue type (6Andrews S.C. Arosio P. Bottke W. Briat J.F. von Darl M. Harrison P.M. Laulhere J.P. Levi S. Lobreaux S. Yewdall S.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). H ferritin possesses ferroxidase activity; the active site binds and oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is subsequently stored in the core of the ferritin molecule. In this manner, H ferritin prevents the formation of reactive oxygen species resulting from Fe2+ oxidation through the Fenton reaction. Light chain ferritin does not exhibit ferroxidase activity but is thought to aid in iron mineralization (7Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). H ferritin is an essential gene in mice; H ferritin-null embryos do not survive past embryonic day 9.5 (8Ferreira C. Bucchini D. Martin M.E. Levi S. Arosio P. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The human cSHMT mRNA has two alternatively spliced forms of its 5′-UTR that are encoded by exons 1–3 (9Liu X. Reig B. Nasrallah I.M. Stover P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11523-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Exon 2, which encodes an Alu J SINE insertion in reverse orientation (10Xing J. Hedges D.J. Han K. Wang H. Cordaux R. Batzer M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is alternatively spliced in a cell-specific manner (11Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cSHMT heteronuclear RNA is spliced to yield a full-length 332-nucleotide 5′-UTR (AluUTR), which has ∼62% GC content and includes exon 2, and a shorter 193-nucleotide 5′-UTR (UTR) that lacks exon 2 and has ∼71% GC content (11Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The high GC content and extensive secondary structure of the 5′-UTR indicates the potential for translational regulation of cSHMT expression. Translation can be regulated by the sequence and structure of the 5′-UTR of mRNAs (12Pickering B.M. Willis A.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic mRNAs contain 7-methylguanosine 5′ cap structures (m7Gp) that serves as the docking site for the initiation factor eIF4F and the 43 S ribosomal subunit. The 43 S ribosomal subunit scans through the 5′-UTR of the mRNA and unwinds secondary structure using the helicase activity of eIF4A until it reaches an AUG start codon where the 60 S subunit joins the complex to initiate translation (13Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Depending on the length and secondary structure of the 5′-UTR, scanning may impede cap-mediated translation (14Jackson R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). External stress such as nutrient deprivation and heat-shock can impair cap-initiated translation (15Lopez-Lastra M. Rivas A. Barria M.I. Biol. Res. 2005; 38: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Translation initiation can occur in a cap-independent manner by recruitment of the 43 S ribosomal subunit to internal sequences within the 5′-UTR. This process is mediated by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) trans-acting factors that bind to IRESs (16Komar A.A. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that indicates cSHMT translation is regulated by a H ferritin-responsive IRES. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Restriction/modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Stratagene, Ambion, or Promega. Sheep anti-human cSHMT and sheep anti-human H ferritin antibodies were described previously (5Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol.

Cell Culture and Reagents—Human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured with α-minimal essential medium (α-minimal essential medium, HyClone Laboratories) supplemented with 11% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—The human H ferritin cDNA lacking the 5′- and 3′-UTRs was generated by PCR using reverse-transcribed MCF-7 cell total RNA as a template and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(±) (Invitrogen) using standard procedures as described previously (5Oppenheim E.W.

Briefly, the forward primer was 5′ TA GGATCC ATG ACG ACC GCG TCC; the underlined sequence is a BamHI site to aid in cloning into the vector. The reverse primer was 5′ TA CGGCCG TTA GCT TTC ATT ATC, with the underlined sequence being a NotI site. The H ferritin/pcDNA3.1 linear DNA (∼4 μg) was transfected in 70–80% confluent MCF-7 cells using FuGENE transfectamine from Roche Applied Science, following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) for 24 h, then one 100-mm plate of transfected cells was trypsinized and passaged into ten, 100-mm plates and placed in DMEM with 1 mg/ml Geneticin, following Invitrogen's suggested protocol for selection of H ferritin/pcDNA3.1-expressing cells. The resulting individual clones were then selected and passaged into 6-well cell culture cluster plates and maintained in DMEM with 800 μg/ml Geneticin. A Me2SO stock and cell pellet for each clone was collected for Western analysis for the expression of H ferritin, cSHMT, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Cotman C.W. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, London1994: 45-53Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed at 100 °C for 10 min in buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8). Cellular proteins (40–120 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10–12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred at 4 °C to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, membranes were incubated with primary antiserum for 15 h at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1–3 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using the horseradish peroxidase SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). For cSHMT detection, affinity-purified sheep anti-human cSHMT antibody was diluted 1:20,000, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG-HRP (Pierce) was diluted 1:5,000. For H ferritin detection, affinity-purified sheep anti-human H ferritin antibody was diluted 1:500, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG-HRP (Pierce) was diluted 1:5,000. For CUGBP1 detection, mouse monoclonal anti-human CUGBP1 antibody was diluted 1:500, and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Pierce) was diluted 1:5,000. Mouse anti-human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Novus) was used at a 1:100,000 dilution. The protein bands were quantified using ChemiImager 4400 from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). Yeast-two Hybrid Assay—The human H ferritin cDNA was amplified and cloned into the pGBK plasmid using the following primers: 5′-TAGGATCCATGACGACCGCGTCC-3′ and 5′-TAGTCGACTTAGCTTTCATTATC-3′. The BamHI and SalI sites are shown in bold. The pGBK-H ferritin vector was transformed into yeast strain AH109, and stable clones were maintained in Trp-dropout medium. Y187 yeast cells with a pretransformed HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) were mated to the pGBK-H ferritin-AH109 cells following the Clontech Matchmaker protocol. After a 24-h mating, cells were plated on His-, Ade-, Leu-, and Trp-dropout medium containing X-α-galactose, and positive colonies were isolated after a 4 day incubation at 30 °C. DNA from positive clones was isolated and sequenced at the Cornell BioResource Center. Clones were validated against negative controls according to the Matchmaker protocol. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were lysed in M-PER buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. Extracts (150 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads to remove nonspecific matrix-binding proteins. The precleared extracts were incubated with 5 μg of either mouse anti-human CUGBP1 or mouse anti-HA antibodies overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. The beads were collected and washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS was added to the beads, and the sample was heated at 100 °C to release bound proteins from the beads. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Generation of Bicistronic Constructs—Bicistronic constructs were generated in the pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega). The base construct contained (in the 5′ to 3′ direction) the Renilla luciferase cDNA (containing three tandem stop codons 3′ of the open reading frame) cloned into the HindIII site, the cSHMT 5′-UTR cloned into the HindIII and NcoI sites and firefly luciferase cDNA cloned into the NcoI and XbaI sites of the vector. The Renilla luciferase cDNA containing the three tandem stop codons was amplified using the following primers: 5′-TATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGCTTGATGACTTCGAAAG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTATTATTATTGTTCATTTTTG-3′. The HindIII sites are in shown in bold, the T7 promoter is in italics, and the three stop codons are underlined (reverse primer). The human cSHMT 5′-UTR, AluUTR (332 nucleotides), and the alternatively spliced variant UTR lacking exon 2 (193 bp) have been described previously (9Liu X. Reig B. Nasrallah I.M. Stover P.J.

The BiP IRES (a gift from Peter Sarnow) was subcloned into this vector replacing the cSHMT 5′-UTR cloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites. The reverse complement of the cSHMT 5′-UTR (rcUTR) was cloned into the base bicistronic construct using the HindIII and NcoI sites such that the reverse complement of the UTR was located between the two reporter genes. The mouse cSHMT 5′-UTR was subcloned into the bicistronic construct, using the primers 5′-TAAAGCTTGGCGATCCACTTGC-3′ and 5′-TACCATGGTGCACTGGTTCAGAG-3′. For the construction of a truncated UTR that lacked 30 nucleotides from the 3′-end, the reverse primer used was 5′-CCATGGTCCGTCCTACGCCG-3′ (NcoI site in bold (the forward primer was the same as for the full-length UTR)). The truncated UTR was subcloned into the bicistronic construct, replacing the UTR. For constructs containing the cSHMT UTR at the 5′-end of the Renilla open reading frame, the cSHMT 5′-UTR was cloned using the primers 5′-TAGCTAGCGCCTGGCGCGCAG and 5′-TAAAGCTTCATTGCACTGGTTCGAAG-3′, which contain NheI and HindIII sites in bold, respectively. The cSHMT 3′-UTR (635 nucleotides) was amplified (sequence 3′ of the stop codon to the consensus AAUAAA poly(A) site) from reverse transcribed total RNA isolated from MCF-7 cells (IScript kit, Bio-Rad) by PCR using the following primers: 5′-TACCCGGGAGGAGCGGGCCCACTCTG-3′ and 5′-TACCCGGGCTGGTTGATTCTCACACC-3′. The SmaI sites are in bold. All constructs were sequenced verified. Generation and Purification of Bicistronic mRNA—DNA templates (2 μg) were linearized with EcoRI and purified using the PCR clean-up column (Roche Applied Science). The template was transcribed using either the T7 or SP6 Megascript (Ambion) kit for use in in vitro translation assays (5 mm cap analog was added to reactions according to the manufacturer's instructions), or the T7 or SP6 mMessage mMachine (Ambion) kit for use in mRNA transfections (which includes 4 mm cap analog in the reaction mix). The crude mRNA was treated with DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C and precipitated overnight in 2 m LiCl at -80 °C. All RNA procedures were conducted under RNase-free conditions, and all mRNA was stored with RNase inhibitor (Promega). The mRNA was further purified with oligo(dT) beads (MicrofastTrac 2.0, Invitrogen) before use to ensure that only full-length Poly(A) RNA served as templates. For preparation of radiolabeled mRNA for in vitro translation experiments, 50 μCi of α-32P-labeled rUTP (800 Ci/mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was included in in vitro transcription assays. The assays were then carried out as described above. The mRNA purity was verified by electrophoresis. In Vitro Translation Assays—All experiments were performed at a final mRNA concentration of 2 nm (∼5 ng/μl) to ensure that the translation system was below saturation. The mRNA templates were heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature prior to their addition to the reaction mixture to allow uniform secondary structures to form. Translation reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 12.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, amino acid mixture (1 mm each), 1 mm MgOAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ng of yeast tRNA, and 35 mm KCl (Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system kit, Promega) were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with the bicistronic mRNA templates. All enzyme/mRNA incubations contained RNase inhibitor (Promega). The translation reaction mixtures were quenched on ice, and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Glo kit from Promega. The activities were read on a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems). mRNA Transfections—Bicistronic mRNAs were transfected into HeLa, MCF-7, or MEF cells grown to 90–95% confluence in 6-well plates. Transfections were carried out using 2.5 μg of capped mRNA, 500 μl of Opti-Mem I (Invitrogen), and 5 μl of DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen) per well. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the transfection solution was removed, α-minimal essential medium (1 ml) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 16 h under standard culture conditions. Translation from the bicistronic constructs was quantified by measuring luciferase activity using the Dual-Glo kit from Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were recorded using a Veritas Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). To inhibit cap-mediated translation, rampamycin dissolved in ethanol was added to the cells 4 h before transfection to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. An equal volume of carrier (ethanol) was added to control samples. siRNA Transfection—The CUGBP1 siRNA was purchased from Qiagen's pre-designed HP siRNA library (Hs_CUGBP1_2 HP siRNA (sense: r(GGA ACU CUU CGA ACA GUA U)dTdT; antisense: r(AUA CUG UUC GAA GAG UUC C)dCdG)). Ambion silencer negative control siRNA (cat. no. 4611) served as a control for all siRNA transfections. The transfections were performed using HiPerFect siRNA transfection reagent (Qiagen). HeLa cells were plated to 20% confluence in 6-well plates the day of transfection. 5 nm of either CUGBP1 or control siRNA was added to each well with the HiPerFect reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated with siRNA for 48 h under normal culture conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2). After incubation, cells were either lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis to determine knockdown efficiency or used in mRNA transfection experiments as described above. The Human cSHMT 5′-UTR Exhibits IRES Activity—The contribution of the cSHMT 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR to the regulation of cSHMT translation was investigated by generating a series of bicistronic mRNAs that served as templates for in vitro translation reactions (Table 1). The base bicistronic template contained a 5′-capped (7-methylguanosine analog) Renilla luciferase (Rluc) open reading frame (ORF) that terminated with three tandem, in-frame stop codons (TAA). The cSHMT 5′-UTR (UTR or AluUTR) was placed at the 3′-end of the Rluc ORF and 5′ of the firefly luciferase (FFluc) ORF, which was followed by a 30-nucleotide poly(A) tail (Table 1, template 1). From this mRNA template, translation initiation of the Rluc ORF occurs through cap-mediated binding of the eIF4F complex and recruitment of the ribosome. Translation of the FFluc ORF could potentially occur through three independent mechanisms: 1) mRNA degradation resulting in the formation of a monocistronic FFluc template; 2) failure of the ribosome to dissociate from the template at one of the three tandem termination codons located 3′ of the Rluc ORF, otherwise known as translation re-initiation; or 3) cap-independent recruitment of the ribosome by the cSHMT 5′-UTR serving as an IRES. To negate the role of mRNA degradation in FFluc translation, all bicistronic mRNAs were labeled with [α-32P]rUTP, and the integrity of the transcript was verified by gel electrophoresis prior to and following all in vitro translation reactions; no evidence for mRNA splicing or degradation was observed for any of the templates ( supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 1Detection of IRES activity using bicistronic constructs Each bicistronic construct contained Renilla luciferase cDNA (Rluc) with a cap analog at the 5′ end and three sequential in-frame stop codons at the 3′ end. The cSHMT 5′-UTR (or modifications thereof) or a known IRES (BiP) was inserted 3′ of the Rluc gene. The firefly luciferase gene (FFluc) is the second cistron in the RNA and was placed 3′ of the IRES elements. Some constructs contained the cSHMT 3′-UTR located 3′ of the FFluc ORF. IRES activity is expressed as the ratio of total firefly luciferase activity over total Renilla luciferase activity (FFluc/Rluc). All mRNA transfections were performed in MCF-7 cells. All values are the average of at least five measurements, and variation is expressed as mean ± S.D. The ability of the cSHMT 5′-UTR to function as an IRES was investigated during in vitro translation reactions and in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells using bicistronic mRNA templates. The base bicistronic template (Table 1, template 1) yielded both Rluc and FFluc activity in in vitro translation reactions and in transfected cells, thereby providing evidence that the cSHMT 5′-UTR exhibits IRES activity, which is expressed in Table 1 as the FFluc/Rluc ratio. Because others have shown that IRES function is orientation-dependent (19Bieleski L. Talbot S.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a template containing the reverse complement of the cSHMT 5′-UTR (rcUTR) was generated (Table 1, template 3). Upon transfection in MCF-7 cells, rcUTR (template 3) yielded 3% of the IRES activity observed from the UTR (template 1), providing evidence that the FFluc activity generated from template 1 did not result from re-initiation of translation and that the cSHMT UTR is an IRES. In in vitro translation reactions, rcUTR IRES activity was 2% of that generated from template 1. Neither the UTR nor the rcUTR contained AUG initiation codons, ruling out the possibility of premature translation initiation within the 5′-UTR. These initial findings provide evidence that the cSHMT 5′-UTR contains IRES activity that cannot be explained by mRNA degradation of the bicistronic template ( supplemental Fig. S1) or ribosomal re-initiation (Table 1, template 3). The alternatively spliced cSHMT UTR lacking exon 2 (template 1) exhibited 2-fold greater activity than the full-length AluUTR (template 2) in both in vitro translation reactions and in transfected cells. Deletion of 30 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the cSHMT 5′-UTR (truncated UTR) (Table 1, template 4) immediately proximal to the AUG codon decreased IRES activity by ∼75% in in vitro reactions; similar results were observed upon deletion of sequences from the 5′-end of the cSHMT 5′-UTR, indicating that the entire UTR is required for maximal IRES activity (data not shown). The mouse cSHMT 5′-UTR (mUTR) was placed within the bicistronic construct to determine if the IRES activity associated with the human cSHMT UTR is species specific (Table 1, template 5). The mUTR exhibited only 27% of the IRES activity observed for the human 5′-UTR in in vitro translation reactions, indicating that the mUTR is not as efficient as the human cSHMT IRES. The mUTR is 210 nucleotides long with 54% GC-content; the human 5′-UTR has 71% GC content. The mouse and human 5′-UTRs share only 42% sequence identity, and the mouse UTR does not contain a SINE element, nor is it alternatively spliced like the human cSHMT 5′-UTR. The cSHMT mRNA contains a 3′-UTR of 635 nucleotides. IRES activity has been shown to be influenced by 3′-UTR sequences (20Koh D.C. Wong S.M. Liu D.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20565-20573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Bradrick S.S. Walters R.W. Gromeier M.

RNA Biol. 2005; 2: 112-120Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or provide favorable contacts with the translation initiation machinery to enhance translation initiation (23Wilkie G.S. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Modification of template 1 by placement of the cSHMT 3′-UTR at the 3′ of the FFluc ORF (Table 1, template 6) increased the IRES activity by at least 2-fold compared with IRES activity generated from the UTR alone (template 1) in both in vitro reactions and in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells, indicating that the cSHMT 3′-UTR stimulates IRES activity. Inclusion of the cSHMT 3′-UTR in the template containing the rcUTR (Table 1, template 7) did not stimulate IRES activity. Strength of the cSHMT IRES—The efficiency of cSHMT IRES-mediated translation initiation relative to cap-mediated translation initiation was investigated.

To transport urea, UT-A1 must be present in the plasma membrane. The purpose of this study was to screen for UT-A1-interacting proteins and to study the interactions of one of the identified potential binding partners with UT-A1. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library with the UT-A1 intracellular loop (residues 409–594) as bait, we identified snapin, a ubiquitously expressed SNARE-associated protein, as a novel UT-A1 binding partner. Deletion analysis indicated that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (H2) of snapin is required for UT-A1 interaction. Snapin binds to the intracellular loop of UT-A1 but not to the N- or C-terminal fragments. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments and co-immunoprecipitation studies verified that snapin interacts with native UT-A1, SNAP23, and syntaxin-4 (t-SNARE partners), indicating that UT-A1 participates with the SNARE machinery in rat kidney inner medulla. Confocal microscopic analysis of immunofluorescent UT-A1 and snapin showed co-localization in both the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane. When we co-injected UT-A1 with snapin cRNA in Xenopus oocytes, urea influx was significantly increased. In the absence of snapin, the influx was decreased when UT-A1 was combined with t-SNARE components syntaxin-4 and SNAP23. We conclude that UT-A1 may be linked to the SNARE machinery via snapin and that this interaction may be functionally and physiologically important for urea transport.

In mammals, urea transporters play an integral role in the urinary-concentrating mechanism and hence in mediating transepithelial urea movement across the cell membrane of the terminal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) 2The abbreviations used are: IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FSK, forskolin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming units; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; v-SNARE, vesicle SNARE; t-SNARE, target SNARE; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2; SNAP25, 25kDa synaptosome-associated protein; PKA, protein kinase A; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; Ad, adenovirus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FSK, forskolin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming units; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; v-SNARE, vesicle SNARE; t-SNARE, target SNARE; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2; SNAP25, 25kDa synaptosome-associated protein; PKA, protein kinase A; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; Ad, adenovirus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein. in kidney nephrons. In the past few years, significant knowledge has been gained about the physiological role and regulation of urea transporters, which have now been cloned from many species (1Bagnasco S.M. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 450: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At least three subfamilies have been reported, two of them are mammalian-specific (renal tubular-type UT-A and erythrocyte vascular-type UT-B), and the third is a fish-specific (renal proximal tubular-type UT-C) urea transporter (1Bagnasco S.M. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 450: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Mistry A.C. Chen G. Kato A. Nag K. Sands J.M. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F455-F465Google Scholar, 3Sands J.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2004; 13: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The UT-A transporter is encoded by the Slc14 A2 gene and includes six protein and nine cDNA isoforms (1Bagnasco S.M. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 450: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). UT-A1 is the largest protein isoform and is expressed in the apical plasma membrane of the IMCD (3Sands J.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2004; 13: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Arginine vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone) is the key hormonal regulator of UT-A1 transport activity in vivo. Vasopressin increases urea transport by stimulating UT-A1 accumulation in the plasma membrane and by increasing UT-A1 phosphorylation (4Klein J.D. Fröhlich O. Blount M.A. Martin C.F. Smith T.D. Sands J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2680-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). UT-A1 accumulation in the plasma membrane is a key step for the regulation of urea transport, but the mechanisms by which UT-A1 is delivered to the plasma membrane are less clearly defined. Several SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor)-mediated accessory proteins have been implicated in the vesicular trafficking of several proteins (5Chou J.L.

SNARE proteins are expressed in collecting duct principal cells, including those in the IMCD, and localize with aquaporin-2-bearing vesicles (10Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In particular, syntaxin 4 is present in the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells (11Mandon B. Nielsen S. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F718-F730PubMed Google Scholar). SNAP23 has also been found in collecting duct principal cells both in the apical plasma membrane and in aquaporin-2-bearing vesicles (12Inoue T. Nielsen S. Mandon B. Terris J. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F752-F760PubMed Google Scholar). SNAP23 interacts with syntaxin 4 and VAMP2 (13Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) in SNARE complexes. Thus, several SNARE proteins are present in the same kidney cells as those that express UT-A1 and UT-A3. Membrane trafficking or fusion is dependent on the SNARE family of proteins, which are implicated as the conserved core protein machinery for all intracellular membrane fusion events from yeast to humans (14Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). This fusion machinery consists of integral membrane proteins on the vesicle (v-SNAREs) and on the target (t-SNAREs) membranes that are thought to form a stable core complex in the process of vesicle docking. The mammalian v-SNARE family consists of nine members, with vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) being the dominant isoform in the brain (14Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 15Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar). The t-SNARE machinery has a more complex composition, with two or three components being required in different membrane-trafficking pathways (16Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 17Wendler F. Tooze S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The syntaxin family of t-SNAREs consists of at least 12 gene products in animal cells that are localized to compartments throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways, indicating that these proteins mediate various membrane-trafficking pathways (16Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The three additional t-SNAREs, SNAP25 (25kDa synaptosome-associated protein) (18Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), SNAP23 (13Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and SNAP29 (19Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), interact with syntaxin isoforms through combinatorial principles that are not yet fully understood. The SNARE complexes generally consist of four coiled-coil domains contributed by SNAREs residing in the t-SNAREs and v-SNAREs. Recent experiments have shown that only matching combinations of v- and t-SNAREs lead to successful fusion (20McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), indicating that SNAREs not only mechanistically accomplish membrane fusion but also contribute to the specificity of this process. The membrane fusion event is regulated by several accessory proteins that bind to individual SNAREs and/or channel and transporter proteins. One such protein is snapin, a SNARE-associated protein (15 kDa) that was previously characterized as a binding partner of SNAP25 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although it was originally described as a brain-specific, integral membrane protein (23Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it was subsequently found to be ubiquitously expressed. It is able to associate with membranes and interact with SNAP23 (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a ubiquitous paralog of SNAP25. Snapin interacts with the assembled SNARE core complex as well as isolated SNAP25 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The role of snapin as a modulatory protein in exocytosis may be controlled by second messenger pathways. It was suggested that cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of snapin at Ser-50 enhances its interaction with SNAP25 (24Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, snapin was shown to have a broad tissue distribution and to be expressed in both cytoplasmic and peripheral membrane-associated fractions (7Rüder C. Reimer T. Gado-Martinez I. Hermosilla R. Engelsberg A. Nehring R. Dorken B. Rehm A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence indicated that snapin also interacts with SNAP23, suggesting that snapin might have a general role in SNARE-mediated fusion events (22Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The protein has attracted wide interest because it increases binding of synaptotagmin to SNAREs, which is further enhanced upon phosphorylation of snapin (24Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified snapin as a UT-A1-binding protein using yeast two-hybrid genetic screening of a human kidney cDNA library. We then analyzed the interaction between UT-A1 and snapin in vitro and in vivo in rat kidney inner medulla and in UT-A1-MDCK cells. GST pulldown experiments demonstrate that snapin interacts with native UT-A1 and t-SNARE partners (SNAP23 and syntaxin-4) indicating UT-A1 participation in a SNARE complex in the IMCD. We also demonstrate a functional link between snapin and UT-A1 with t-SNARE in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. We conclude that UT-A1 may be linked to the SNARE-mediated fusion machinery indirectly, most likely by interacting with snapin, and that this interaction may be important functionally for urea transport. Antibodies—We used our rabbit polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of the rat renal urea transporter UT-A1 (25Klein J.D. Price S.R. Bailey J.L. Jacobs J.D. Sands J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F949-F953PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-snapin antibody was purchased from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal anti-syntaxin 3, mouse monoclonal anti-actin, anti-GST and anti-His6 antibodies, and nonspecific rabbit serum (as control) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal anti-syntaxin 4, anti-Myc, and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SNAP-23 and VAMP2 were the kind gifts of Dr. Mark Knepper (Laboratory of Kidney and Electrolyte metabolism, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health (NIH)). Plasmid Construction—Three intracellular fragments of human UT-A1, 1) N-terminal fragment, N-UT (residues 1–126), 2) long loop, L-UT (residues 409–594), and 3) C-terminal fragment, C-UT (residues 873–920), were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGBKT7 bait vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for yeast two-hybrid assay. The full-length human snapin cDNA was isolated from a human kidney cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech). The coding region (411 bp) of human snapin was amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primer pairs and subcloned into the multiple cloning sites of oocyte expression vector pGH19 and various other expression vectors (e.g. pGEX-4T-snapin, pRSET-A-snapin, pEGEFP-snapin, pDsRed-Monomer-snapin, pShuttle-CMV-snapin, and pAdEasy-snapin). Full-length syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 were cloned into the oocyte expression vector pGH19. Snapin deletion variants and SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 were constructed in the pGEX vectors, and snapin-S50D and -S50A mutants, syntaxin 4, SNAP-23, and VAMP2 were amplified and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Z. H. Sheng, NIH). The insert sequences and reading frames were verified by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments and cDNA Library Screen—Yeast two-hybrid genetic screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4-based two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The loopbait plasmid, pGBKT7-L-UT, was sequentially transformed into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109, and the resulting yeast transformant was allowed to mate with S. cerevisiae strain Y187 pretransformed with the human kidney cDNA library fused to the pACT2 vector containing GAL4 activation domain. The resulting diploid cells were selected on SD plates lacking tryptophan (-Trp), leucine (-Leu), histidine (-His), and adenine (-Ade) in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (Glycosynth) selection and incubated for 1 week at 30 °C. Yeast two-hybrid assays aimed at testing specific interaction pairs were carried out by double transformation of haploid S. cerevisiae strain AH109. The positive blue phenotype colonies were picked up, and the prey plasmids containing library cDNA inserts were rescued and confirmed by retransformation into fresh yeast cells with our various constructed baits or control baits. The prey plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing and analyzed by BLAST search. In Vitro Protein Expression and Binding Assays—The various bait genes in pGBKT7 were tagged with c-Myc and contained T7 promoters. The target-gene, snapin, in pACT2, was obtained from cDNA library screening and was tagged with HA. [35S]Methionine-labeled recombinant fusion proteins were generated by using the TnT®-T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). To generate [35S]Met-labeled bait and target proteins, the reactions were carried out separately in 50-μl volumes. 1 μg of plasmid DNA (each) and 10 μCi/μl 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the TnT reaction mix, incubated at 30 °C in a water bath for 90 min, and terminated by placing on ice. For binding assays, in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled baits and library proteins (10 μl each) were combined with gentle mixing and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The recombinant protein complexes were next incubated with anti-Myc antibody or anti-HA antibody, respectively, for an additional 1 h, followed by addition of 4 μl of protein-A-Sepharose beads (BD Biosciences) to the reaction tube and incubation at 4 °C for an additional 2 h with gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were extensively washed, and the proteins were resolved on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After protein fixation, the gels were incubated with NAMP100 (Amersham Biosciences, UK) for 30 min to enhance the signal of 35S-labeled proteins. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For the interaction between HA-snapin and native UT-A1 proteins, recombinant in vitro translated 35S-labeled HA-snapin (4 μg) was first immobilized on protein-A beads (4 μl) as described above and then incubated with the rat kidney IMCD tissue lysate, solubilized in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton-X, 1% protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma), for 4 h at 4 °C. The snapin-bound protein complexes were extensively washed with binding buffer and resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-UT-A1 antibody (1:6000 dilution) and anti-snapin (1:5000 dilution), respectively. The amount of membrane-bound 35S-labeled snapin was detected by autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfection—The UT-A1-MDCK cells, which express UT-A1 by functional assay and Western blot analysis, were generated as described previously (26Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The UT-A1-MDCK and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. UT-A1-MDCK cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-N3-snapin, pDsRed-Monomer-N1-snapin, pcDNA3-snapin, or pQE32-His6-snapin using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus (Ad-snapin) and Infection in UT-A1-MDCK Cells—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed using the Ad-Easy-1 system through multiple rounds of subcloning of PCR products or of restriction endonuclease fragments. Full-length snapin was first cloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector, and the resultant plasmid was linearized by digesting with restriction endonuclease PmeI, and subsequently cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with an adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombination was confirmed by multiple restriction endonuclease analyses. Finally, the recombinant adenoviral vectors were linearized with PacI and used to infect HEK-AD293 cells (Stratagene). Recombinant adenoviruses typically are generated within 7–10 days. Following large scale infection of human embryonic kidney HEK-AD293 cells cultures, Ad-snapin was purified with two consecutive CsCl ultracentrifugation steps and dialysis, then titrated using Adeno-X™ rapid titer kit (Clontech). Usually, titers of ∼0.6 × 109 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml were obtained. UT-A1-MDCK cells were grown to 90% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as above. For infection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium containing various concentrations of 10–60 pfu/cell for 2–6 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and further cultured in fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C for 18–20 h to allow transgene expression of recombinant protein. Ad-GFP was used as a control adenovirus. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Adenovirus-infected snapin overexpressing UT-A1-MDCK cells were washed with cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and then scraped into 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were homogenized with a glass Teflon homogenizer (10 strokes at 900 rpm) and lysed by passing the extract through a 25-gauge needle five times. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and the supernatants were solubilized in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the resultant supernatant was used to immunoprecipitate with indicated various antibodies (anti-snapin, anti-UT-A1, or rabbit IgG) at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous mixing. Protein-A beads were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. Subsequently, the antibody-protein complexes were immobilized on protein-A beads and washed five times with binding buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and separated on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, bound proteins were identified by immunoblotting. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and Pulldown Assays—The full-length open reading frame encoding snapin was cloned into GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-2 and then expressed in E. coli BL21-Codon plus-(DE3) (Stratagene) cells, followed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, essentially as described previously (2Mistry A.C. Chen G. Kato A. Nag K. Sands J.M. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F455-F465Google Scholar). Bacterial pellets were sonicated and lysed in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). GST-snapin fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed five times with binding buffer. Quantity and quality of GST-fusion protein was checked by Bradford protein assay or by SDS-PAGE analysis using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Rat kidney inner medulla tissue (300 μg) was homogenized in the lysis/binding buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 with a glass Teflon homogenizer (12 strokes at 900 rpm), sheared by passing the extract through a 25-gauge needle (5 times), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were resuspended in the same binding buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 under gyration overnight and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was incubated with the immobilized GST-snapin resin. After extensive washing, the bound protein complexes were resolved on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were probed with the indicated antibodies. Functional Analysis in X. laevis Oocytes—Functional characterization of UT-A1 with SNARE proteins was determined by measuring urea uptake in Xenopus laevis oocytes using the urea uptake procedure described previously (2Mistry A.C. Chen G. Kato A. Nag K. Sands J.M. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F455-F465Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length coding region of UT-A1, snapin, syntaxin-4, and SNAP23 were subcloned into oocyte expression vector pGH19. After linearization, cRNAs were synthesized by T7 polymerase using mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and injected into collagenase-treated oocytes (2 ng/oocyte). Stage V–VI oocytes were used for cRNA injection, obtained from two to three animals for each experimental series. Two nanograms of each cRNA in 23 nl of water were injected into each oocyte. Control oocytes were injected with a similar volume (23 nl) of water. Injected oocytes were maintained in OR3 medium for 2–3 days at 18 °C. Four days later, healthy oocytes were selected for urea influx measurements. For the urea uptake assay, oocytes were preincubated with 1 ml of uptake solution (200 mm mannitol, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES buffer, 5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Cells were then moved to incubate at different time points with 2 μCi of [14C]urea/ml and 1 mm cold urea in uptake solution. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold uptake solution containing 1 mm cold urea. Each individual cell was dissolved in 10% SDS, followed by scintillation counting. Results shown in the bar graphs represent means ± S.D. for 12–18 oocytes in each group. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired t-tests, and differences were judged significant when p < 0.05. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—A 0.41-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the complete coding region of the snapin cDNA was subcloned into pDsRed Monomer N1 and named pDsRed-snapin. UT-A1-MDCK cells (0.7–0.9 × 106) were plated on 35-mm plates and transiently cotransfected with 1.5 μg of pDsRed-snapin or pDsRed Monomer N1 vector using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent. Cells were grown on Transwell filters to confluence. Before immunostaining, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 10–15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS three times, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 min at 25 °C (27Chen G. Fröhlich O. Yang Y. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27436-27442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with primary antibody, anti-UT-A1 (C-terminal), diluted 1:4000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with blocking buffer several times to remove unbound antibody and then incubated with secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma), diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer for an additional 1 h. To remove unbound secondary antibody, cells were washed three more times with blocking buffer and one time with deionized water. The cells were mounted between slide and coverslip using Vectashield mounting media and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with a confocal laser-scanner unit CSU10 (Yokogawa Electronic, Tokyo, Japan). Images were obtained with a high resolution digital charge-coupled device camera (C4742-95, Hamamatsu Photonics) and processed by using a Zeiss LSM5 image software browser (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.). The brightness and contrast of the final images were adjusted with Photoshop (Adobe Systems).

https://openalex.org/W1974745017,"Cryptophytes, unicellular algae, evolved by secondary endosymbiosis and contain plastids surrounded by four membranes. In contrast to cyanobacteria and red algae, their phycobiliproteins do not assemble into phycobilisomes and are located within the thylakoid lumen instead of the stroma. We identified two gene families encoding phycoerythrin α and light-harvesting complex proteins from an expressed sequence tag library of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta. The proteins bear a bipartite topogenic signal responsible for the transport of nuclear encoded proteins via the ER into the plastid. Analysis of the phycoerythrin α sequences revealed that more than half of them carry an additional, third topogenic signal comprising a twin arginine motif, which is indicative of Tat (twin arginine transport)-specific targeting signals. We performed import studies with several derivatives of one member using a diatom transformation system, as well as intact chloroplasts and thylakoid vesicles isolated from pea. We demonstrated the different targeting properties of each individual part of the tripartite leader and show that phycoerythrin α is transported across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid lumen and protease-protected. Furthermore, we showed that thylakoid transport of phycoerythrin α takes place by the Tat pathway even if the 36 amino acid long bipartite topogenic signal precedes the actual twin arginine signal. This is the first experimental evidence of a protein being targeted across five biological membranes.

This is the first experimental evidence of a protein being targeted across five biological membranes. Cryptophytes are an unusual group of flagellate algae common in marine and fresh water. Whereas plant plastids derive from endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium, cryptophytes acquired their plastid by engulfing and stably integrating a red algal cell, leading to a eukaryote-eukaryote chimera (1Bhattacharya D. Yoon H.S. Hackett J.D. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 2Cavalier-Smith T. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In cryptophytes, the eukaryotic endosymbiont is remarkably reduced, but, unlike most other secondarily evolved algae, the endosymbiont nucleus persists in a highly vestigial form (3Hjorth E. Hadfi K. Gould S.B. Kawach O. Sommer M.S. Zauner S. Maier U.G. Endocytobios. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 459-468Google Scholar). The plastid is located within the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PE, phycoerythrin; EST, expressed sequence tag; BTS, bipartite topogenic signal; LHCP, light-harvesting apoproteins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tat, twin arginine transport. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PE, phycoerythrin; EST, expressed sequence tag; BTS, bipartite topogenic signal; LHCP, light-harvesting apoproteins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tat, twin arginine transport. and four membranes separate the cytosol from the stroma: (i) the ER membrane, (ii) the periplastidial membrane, the former cytoplasm membrane of the red alga, (iii) the outer plastid envelope membrane, and (iv) the inner plastid envelope membrane (Fig. 5). Between the outer and inner membrane pair, remnants of the cytosol and the nucleus of the red alga endosymbiont are still present and are referred to as the periplastidial compartment and nucleomorph, respectively. Together with the thylakoid membrane system that is located within the plastid stroma, this makes five distinct membranes separating the thylakoid lumen from the host cytosol (Fig. 5), barriers that have to be dealt with by all nuclear-encoded plastid proteins with a thylakoid destination.FIGURE 5Current working model of phycoerythrin transport, processing and assembly in cryptophytes. Nuclear-encoded phycoerythrin α subunit (PEα) crosses the first of the five membranes in a cotranslational manner via the Sec-complex. The rough ER (rER) surrounding the endosymbiont is also known as the chloroplast ER (cER, in blue). After removal of the signal peptide (SP) by the signal peptide peptidase (SiPP), the second topogenic signal, the transit peptide (TP), mediates the transport of the protein across the following three membranes. In the periplastidial membrane (PPM, the former red algal cytoplasma membrane), a recently described ER-associated degradation-like machinery (ERAD-like) might serve as the translocase. While for the outer plastid envelope membrane (OEM) no translocase has yet been identified in cryptophytes, transport across the inner envelope membrane (IEM) of the plastid probably involves those TIC components, for which genes have been identified in both the nucleus and the nucleomorph. Within the stroma, assembly of the nuclear-encoded PEα, the plastid encoded PEβ and the chromophores is assumed to take place, involving the CpeZ lyase. Finally, the entire PE-heterotetramer is translocated by the Tat translocase across the thylakoid membrane (TM), making use of the tat topogenic signal of one single PEα subunit, which is cleaved after translocation by a thylakoid processing peptidase (tPP) releasing the mature complex into the thylakoid lumen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One further peculiarity of cryptophytes is their unusual thylakoid ultrastructure. Electron microscopic analyses of the thylakoid lumen have shown that this compartment is filled with electron dense material in cryptophytes. It was suggested that this material might represent photosynthetic pigments located on the lumenal, rather than the stromal, side of the thylakoid membrane (4Wehrmeyer W. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1970; 71: 367-383Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Dodge J.D. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1969; 69: 266-280Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This makes the cryptophytes phycobilin-based antenna system very different from others such as that of red algae, glaucophytes and cyanobacteria. In these organisms the light-harvesting pigments such as phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, or allophycocyanin, are arranged into so-called phycobilisomes, which are associated to the thylakoid membrane from the stromal or cytosolic side (9MacColl R. Guard-Friar D. Phycobiliproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton1987Google Scholar). The unusual localization of phycobiliproteins was confirmed by immunolocalizing studies of phycoerythrin (PE) in Rhodomonas lens (6Ludwig M. Gibbs S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that in cryptophytes phycobiliproteins are located inside the thylakoid lumen and not arranged into phycobilisomes. Sequencing the plastid genome of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta supported the latter observation, as no genes-encoding linker proteins, which are common in plastid genomes of rhodophytes, are expressed in the plastid (7Douglas S.E. Penny S.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the lack of a topogenic signal in the phycoerythrin β subunit, encoded by the plastid cpeB gene, stands in contrast to the observed localization of the molecule (7Douglas S.E. Penny S.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 8Reith M. Douglas S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate this phenomenon, focusing on the transport across five membranes into the thylakoid lumen of cryptophytes, we screened our EST data base of G. theta and identified two separate gene families: one encoding the canonical light-harvesting apoproteins (LHCP) and one, the α subunits of phycoerythrin (PEα). All genes encode preproteins containing a bipartite topogenic signal (BTS), composed of an N-terminal signal peptide for co-translational import into the ER lumen via the Sec61 complex, followed by a transit peptide-like region mediating transport across the remaining three membranes into the plastid stroma (10Gould S.B. Sommer M.S. Hadfi K. Zauner S. Kroth P.G. Maier U.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Wastl J. Maier U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23194-23198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, more than half of the PEα subunits carried a twin pair of arginine residues, followed by a hydrophobic stretch, between the transit peptide and mature protein region. We have examined the organellar localization of one member of the PEα family using in vitro import assays and in vivo localization with different GFP fusion constructs. Our results demonstrate that the PEα subunit is transported into the thylakoid lumen and that the twin arginine translocase (Tat) catalyzes this transport. This is the first example in which experimental proof demonstrates transport of proteins across five biological membranes within one cell and the processing of the precursor protein three times during the translocation. cDNA Library of G. theta—A cDNA library of G. theta CCMP327, was generated from three liters of culture (1-5 × 109 cells/ml) harvested at three different time points every 8 h (one liter, respectively), starting 1 h before the light was turned on (12 h day/night cycle). The cells were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and packed in dry ice for shipping. The cDNA library was generated by the Vertis Biotechnology AG (Freising, Germany). The normalized and 5′ full-length enriched cDNA library was ligated via the EcoRI and NotI restriction site into the pExCell plasmid and supplied as a λ-ExCell phagemid library by the company. GFP Fusion Constructs and Analysis—Two different GFP-fusion constructs were generated for the analysis of the subcellular localization in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In the first construct only the signal peptide encoding region of the PEα was fused to the GFP gene using the oligomers PhySP-5′: GAATTCATGCTCCGTGCTACCGTCGCTGCCGCCGTCGTTGCCTCCGCCGCTGCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCG and GFP-3′: CTAAGCTTACCTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC for amplification of the complete fusion construct. The second construct included both, signal and transit peptide encoding region, using PhycoBTS-5′: AAGAATTCATGCTCCGTGCTACCGTCGCTGCCG and PhycoBTS-3′: CCATGGACTCGGCCTGCATGGCGACGCC oligomers for amplification of the topogenic signal. In case of the SP-GFP fusion construct the vector pKS-eGFP (Kroth Lab, Konstanz Germany) was used as a template for standard PCR. Oligonucleotides introduced a 5′ EcoRI and 3′ HindIII restriction site for cloning the fragment into pPhaT1. For the second construct a standard PCR reaction was performed using genomic DNA from G. theta CCMP327 as a template. Oligonucleotides introduced a 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NcoI restriction site and PCR-products were digested with EcoRI and NcoI, the plasmid pPhaT1 with EcoRI and HindIII and the GFP-encoding fragment with NcoI and HindIII. All fragments were ligated and subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli MRF in a single step. Fidelity of amplification and cloning was checked via sequencing of the construct. Diatom transformations were performed as described previously by Apt et al. (12Apt K.E. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Grossman A.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 572-579PubMed Google Scholar). For ER staining of wild-typ cells, 1 ml of dense grown culture was incubated for 15 min with 0.5 μm ER-Tracker™ Green BODIPY® FL glibenclamide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies). Cells were washed once with PBS and analyzed directly. Analysis of the diatoms was performed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope Leica TCS SP2 at room temperature in f/2 culture medium, using a PL APO 63x/1.32-0.60 oil Ph3 CS objective. GFP, ER-Tracker™ Green BODIPY® FL glibenclamide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies) and chlorophyll fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, filtered with beam splitter TD 488/543/633 and detected by two different photomultiplier tubes with a bandwidth of 500-520 and 625-720 nm for GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence, respectively. Image processing was done using the LCS Lite software from Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) and Adobe Photoshop. Import Constructs—For analyzing the import of the PEα subunit into thylakoids and chloroplasts, four constructs were made. Three different 5′-oligonucleotides (PhyThy-5′: 5′-AAGAATTCATGCTCCGTGCTACCGTCGCTGCCG-3′, PhyThyTP-5′:5′-AAGAATTCATGTTCAGCCCAGCCCCCCAGATGGG-3′ and PhyThyRR-5′: AAGAATTCATGTCTGTCTCCCGCCGTGAGATCGTCC) of which the latter two introduced new translation starts in order to delete the signal peptide in the second and the whole bipartite topogenic signal in the third construct, were used together with one 3′ oligonucleotide (PhyThy-3′: TTTCTAGATTACTTGCTGTATCCGACGTCGCGG) for PCR amplification using total DNA of G. theta as template. Amplification products were purified from preparative 1% agarose gels, digested with EcoRI/XbaI and cloned into the pBAT plasmid (13Annweiler A. Hipskind R.A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that was digested the same way. Import Analysis—Isolation of chloroplasts and thylakoids from pea and subsequent protein transport experiments with radiolabeled precursor proteins in the presence and absence of competitor proteins followed the protocols described in Marques et al. (14Marques J.P. Dudeck I. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Hou et al. (15Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klösgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cloning of Nuclear-encoded Plastid Proteins of G. theta—Our EST data base from G. theta was the source for our analyses, in which we identified ESTs encoding proteins belonging to the two distinct light-harvesting machineries present in cryptophytes. We detected 139 ESTs assembling into 17 independent contigs encoding LHCP proteins, which are found also in land plant chloroplasts. Another 206 ESTs assembled into 14 contigs encoding PEα subunits, the second system capable of transferring excitation energy to the photosystems chlorophyll. This is peculiar, because in red algae phycobiliproteins are encoded by a very small gene family (16Matsuzaki M. Misumi O. Shin I.T. Maruyama S. Takahara M. Miyagishima S.Y. Mori T. Nishida K.

Alignment of ESTs encoding PEα sequences identified two groups with respect to the predicted targeting signals, because only nine of the entries encode for preproteins that are specified by an additional twin arginine motif (Fig. 1) that is indicative for transport by the ΔpH-dependent Tat pathway across the thylakoid membrane (17Müller M. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a recent publication on the cryptophyte Rhodomonas CS24, a similar finding was reported (18Broughton M.J. Howe C.J. Hiller R.G. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 369: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): six PEα-encoding genes were described of which three apparently show a similar tripartite topogenic signal arrangement as the nine PEα proteins identified of G. theta described above. A clear sorting into PEα1 and PEα2 subunits, as shown for Rhodomonas CS24, was not possible for the PEα sequences from G. theta, because the protein sequences are too divergent (Fig. 1). However, taking the twin arginine motif as the discriminating signal, the nine ESTs with tripartite signals may be homologous to the PEα1 of Rhodomonas CS24, whereas the five entries with a bipartite signal may have a similar history (see below) as PEα2 from Rhodomonas CS24. To examine the localization of PEα within plastids in detail, we have performed in vivo and in vitro import experiments using a diatom transformation system and intact chloroplasts and thylakoid vesicles isolated from pea, respectively. Because a transformation system for cryptophytes is lacking, we chose an existing protocol for the transformation of a phylogenetic sister group, the diatom P. tricornutum. It has been shown to serve as an excellent substitution when analyzing the topogenic signals of cryptophytes (10Gould S.B. Sommer M.S. Hadfi K. Zauner S. Kroth P.G. Maier U.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Gould S.B. Sommer M.S. Kroth P.G. Gile G.H. Keeling P.J. Maier U.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006; 23: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the analysis, various derivatives of one arbitrarily chosen member of the PEα cDNAs (see Fig. 1, cpeA13) were generated by in vitro mutagenesis and cloned into suitable vectors. Two constructs were generated for the in vivo localization of GFP fusion proteins in the diatom. In the first one, only the sequence encoding the first 16 amino acids, representing the signal peptide (SP-GFP) was fused to the GFP gene, whereas in the second construct the first 29 amino acids preceding the RR motif, representing the BTS (BTS-GFP), were used. For the in vitro analyses, three clones were generated, which encoded either (i) the full-length PEα (PEαC) predicted to harbor a tripartite topogenic signal for transport across all five membranes, (ii) a deletion derivative (PEαTP) lacking the ER-targeting signal peptide at the N terminus, or (iii) a deletion derivative (PEαRR) lacking both the N-terminal ER-targeting signal and the transit peptide. In this case, only the putative Tat-specific thylakoid transport signal is present at the N terminus of the mature PEα protein. All three proteins were generated in radiolabeled form by in vitro transcription and subsequent in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. In Vivo Localization in the Diatom P. tricornutum—Analyzing the targeting properties of the first two of the three N-terminal topogenic signals of PEα revealed the same results as with similar constructs from recent reports (10Gould S.B.

The signal peptide alone targets GFP to the ER, which is distributed throughout the diatom cell (Fig. 2, panel c), as confirmed by the staining of the cells with ER-Tracker Green® (Fig. 2, panel d). This is in line with earlier results obtained from targeting GFP to the diatom ER with different signal peptides (10Gould S.B. Sommer M.S. Hadfi K. Zauner S. Kroth P.G. Maier U.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Gould S.B. Sommer M.S. Kroth P.G. Gile G.H. Keeling P.J. Maier U.G. Mol. Biol.

The BTS-GFP construct with the additional 13 amino acids FSPAPQMGLRGVA reassembling the transit peptide, then leads to import of GFP into the plastid, i.e. across four membranes, as shown by the colocalization with the chlorophyll autofluorescence (Fig. 2, lane b). Import of PEα into Intact Chloroplasts Isolated from Pea—Incubation of the three PEα precursor proteins with intact pea chloroplasts under import conditions showed that both, PEαC and PEαTP, were efficiently imported into the plastids and processed by organellar peptidases to a protein of ∼12 kDa (Fig. 3A), which corresponds well to the size expected for mature PEα. These putative mature PEα proteins are protected by the plastid membranes against externally added protease, which proves that both proteins were internalized into the organelles. Thus, irrespective of the presence or absence of an additional ER-targeting signal peptide at the N terminus, the chloroplast transit peptide of PEα from G. theta is capable of mediating transport of the protein into chloroplasts from higher plants. This strongly suggests that the transport information of chloroplast transit peptides was conserved during secondary endosymbiosis, demonstrated also for other chromalveolates (11Wastl J. Maier U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23194-23198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21DeRocher A. Hagen C.B. Froehlich J.E. Feagin J.E. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3969-3977PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nassoury N. Cappadocia M. Morse D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, PEαRR, which lacks both the ER-targeting signal peptide and the chloroplast-targeting transit peptide, was apparently not imported since no processing product corresponding in size to the mature polypeptide could be detected (Fig. 3A). This is in line with the assumption that the putative thylakoid-targeting transport signal of PEα is not sufficient for organelle import. However, it should be noted that this truncated precursor protein showed significant association with the isolated chloroplasts and was even protected to some extent against proteolysis, although proteolysis of the translation product in the absence of organelles led to complete degradation under these conditions (Fig. 3B). It remains unclear, whether this association is caused by binding of the protein to the import machinery of the chloroplast envelope or whether it is the result of unspecific interactions between the targeting signal and the lipid bilayer. Localization of PEα within Chloroplasts—Fractionation of the chloroplasts after import of PEαC and PEαTP showed that in both instances the presumed mature protein of ∼12 kDa is found exclusively in the thylakoid fraction, where it is resistant to protease added from the stromal side to the vesicles (Fig. 3A). The same import behavior is observed for authentic precursors of thylakoid lumen proteins of higher plants, like the 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen evolving complex associated with photosystem II (OEC 23), which was analyzed in parallel (Fig. 3C). This clearly demonstrates that PEα was translocated across the membrane into the thylakoid lumen, which is in line with the recent in silico analysis of Broughton et al. (18Broughton M.J. Howe C.J. Hiller R.G. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 369: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) who described indications for a localization of PEα in the thylakoid lumen of Rhodomonas CS24. In addition to the mature proteins in the thylakoid lumen, polypeptides of ∼13 kDa are found in the stromal fractions of the import assays analyzing PEαC and PEαTP (Fig. 3A). They might represent stromal intermediates in which the chloroplast-targeting transit peptides have been removed, while the thylakoid targeting transport signals are still present. However, the size difference of only ∼1 kDa to the mature protein argues against such a transport intermediate, because the thylakoid targeting Tat-signal comprises at least 24 residues (Fig. 1). Furthermore, because a polypeptide of similar size is sometimes found also in the stromal fraction of the import assay analyzing PEαRR (Fig. 3A), which is not imported into chloroplasts, they might instead represent distinct degradation products that artificially appear only in the presence of organelles (Fig. 3B). Anyhow, they are not the result of partial insertion of the proteins into the chloroplast envelope membranes, because envelope proteins are found in both, the stroma and the thylakoid fraction, upon lysis of the organelles (Fig. 3D). To examine thylakoid transport of PEα in an independent approach, in vitro transport experiments were additionally performed with isolated thylakoid vesicles from pea. In these experiments, all three derivatives of PEα were successfully imported into the thylakoid vesicles where they were processed to the presumed mature polypeptide of ∼12 kDa (Fig. 4A). These processing products were resistant against externally added protease proving that they had been fully translocated across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. Thus, neither the bipartite topogenic signal of the full-length precursor protein nor the residual chloroplast targeting transit peptide present at the N terminus of the PEαTP derivative seem to impair the transport of the protein across the thylakoid membrane. This appears surprising at first glance but similar observations have been described already earlier (23Fincher V. McCaffery M. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is further support for the recently proposed model that after direct loop insertion of the Tat substrate into the lipid bilayer with both, the N and C terminus, exposed to the stroma, the C-terminally located passenger protein is translocated across the thylakoid membrane, while the N terminus of the precursor protein remains on the stromal side of the membrane (15Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klösgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) until the thylakoid targeting transport signal is proteolytically removed (24Frielingsdorf S. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24455-24462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It should be noted though, that it cannot formally be ruled out that the substrates that were actually recognized by the thylakoidal protein transport machinery in the assays analyzing PEαC and PEαTP were not the respective precursor proteins but instead N-terminally truncated polypeptides that are the result of translation initiation at position 23 of the amino acid sequence of the PEα precursor. A second methionine residue is present at this position (Fig. 1, cpeA13) that could give rise to a polypeptide with a calculated mass of 14.8 kDa, which corresponds well to the translation products of ∼15 kDa observed in the translation assays of PEαC and PEαTP (Figs. 3 and 4). In the translation assay of the PEαRR derivative no such product is found, in line with the fact that the corresponding methionine codon is not present in the respective clone (data not shown). Irrespective of the actual size of the N-terminal extension in the various PEα derivatives, thylakoid transport was presumably mediated in all instances by the RR signal peptide. In order to examine if this thylakoid transport signal is indeed a Tat-specific transport signal, as suggested by the twin arginine motif, thylakoid transport experiments were performed in the presence of competitive amounts of the OEC 23 precursor protein. This protein is exclusively transported by the ΔpH-dependent Tat pathway across the thylakoid membrane (25Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mould R.M. Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17286-17289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and it was frequently used in such competition experiments (15Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klösgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Berghöfer J. Klösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Molik S. Karnauchov I.

Raising the concentration of competitor in the assays gradually decreases the thylakoid transport of each of the three PEα derivatives (Fig. 4B), which unequivocally proves that they are translocated by the Tat pathway across the thylakoid membrane. Red algae, glaucophytes, and cyanobacteria use phycobilisomes as a light-harvesting complex. These are composed of different phycobiliproteins and linker proteins, which together assemble into a higher order structure ("
https://openalex.org/W2021847616,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal is implicated in not only cell proliferation, but cell migration and morphological changes. Several different Rho family GTPases downstream of the Ras/ERK pathway are postulated to mediate the latter functions. However, none have been recognized to be directly coupled to FGF receptors (FGFRs). We have previously reported that EphA4 and FGFRs hetero-oligomerize through their cytoplasmic domains, trans-activate each other, and transduce a signal for cell proliferation through a docking protein, FRS2α (Yokote, H., Fujita, K., Jing, X., Sawada, T., Liang, S., Yao, L., Yan, X., Zhang, Y., Schlessinger, J., and Sakaguchi, K. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 18866-18871). Here, we have found that ephexin1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases, constitutes another downstream component of the receptor complex. Ephexin1 directly binds to the kinase domain of FGFR mainly through its DH and PH domains. The binding appears to become weaker and limited to the DH domain when FGFRs become activated. FGFR-mediated phosphorylation of ephexin1 enhances the guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward RhoA without affecting the activity to Rac1 or Cdc42. The FGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation includes, but is not limited to, the residue (Tyr-87) phosphorylated by Src family kinase, which is known to be activated following EphA4 activation. The Tyr-to-Asp mutations that mimic the tyrosine phosphorylation in some of the putative FGFR-mediated phosphorylation sites increase the nucleotide exchange activity for RhoA without changing the activity for Rac1 or Cdc42. From these results, we conclude that ephexin1 is located immediately downstream of the EphA4-FGFR complex and the function is altered by the FGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple sites.

Currently, FGFs comprise a structurally related family of 22 molecules (FGF 1-23). The FGF ligands and the four signaling FGF receptors (FGFRs), including their alternatively spliced variants, are expressed in specific spatial and temporal patterns during the embryonic development. FGFRs contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and two intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The extracellular domain contains two or three immunoglobulin-like domains. Alternative mRNA splicing of the C-terminal portion of the third immunoglobulin-like domain creates several isoforms of FGFRs with unique ligand-binding properties. Once an FGF ligand is bound, the receptor dimerizes and phosphorylates intramolecular tyrosine residues, triggering initiation of FGFR signal transduction (1Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G.

We have recently reported that EphA4 and FGFRs form a complex through their cytoplasmic interactions and trans-activate each other (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L. Yan X.

EphA4 is a member of the Eph receptor family, the largest class of receptor tyrosine kinases with 13 members. Eph receptor family can be divided into two subfamilies (EphA and EphB) based on their structural properties and ligand binding preferences. The Ephs and their ligands, ephrins, are broadly expressed throughout the developing embryo, including the nervous system. The best characterized role of Eph signaling involves the guidance of axons during neural development. The control of axon guidance by Eph receptors is likely mediated by controlling cytoskeletal function through regulation of the Rho family GTPases: RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (4Penzes P. Beeser A.

Differentiation. 2002; 70: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ephexin1, a Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho family GTPases, was identified to couple EphA receptor activation to modulation of Rho family GTPase signaling. Ephexin1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system during development and is enriched in the neuronal growth cones (7Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Studies in ephexin1 knock-out mice show that ephexin1 is required for axonal outgrowth as well as for growth cone repulsion or collapse (8Sahin M. Greer P.L. Lin M.Z. Poucher H. Eberhart J. Schmidt S. Wright T.M. Shamah S.M. O'Connell S. Cowan C.W. Hu L. Goldberg J.L. Debant A. Corfas G. Krull C.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2005; 46: 191-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the absence of ephrin stimulation, ephexin1 activates RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, thus leading to a balanced GTPase activation that promotes axonal outgrowth. In contrast, stimulation of Ephs by ephrin induces Src family kinases (SFK)-dependent phosphorylation of ephexin1 on an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine (Tyr-87). This tyrosine phosphorylation of ephexin1 enhances the ephexin1's GDP/GTP exchange activity specifically toward RhoA relative to Rac1 and Cdc42, thereby changing the local balance of Rho GTPases activity within cells, leading to actin cytoskeletal changes that result in growth cone collapse (8Sahin M. Greer P.L. Lin M.Z. Poucher H. Eberhart J. Schmidt S. Wright T.M. Shamah S.M. O'Connell S. Cowan C.W. Hu L. Goldberg J.L. Debant A. Corfas G. Krull C.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2005; 46: 191-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As ephexin1 activates Rho-family GTPases that are implicated in both attraction and repulsion, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of ephexin1 might be controlled through interactions with additional proteins. Ephexin1 may function in combination with other factors to stimulate Rac1 or Cdc42, whereas in a complex with active Eph receptors it preferentially activates RhoA (9Schmucker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 701-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a physical interaction between ephexin1 and FGFRs. When ephexin1 was co-expressed with FGFRs in HEK293T cells, ephexin1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FGFRs and became tyrosine-phosphorylated by the activated receptors. In vitro binding studies using a series of deletion mutants of ephexin1 revealed that ephexin1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of activated FGFR2 mainly through its DH domain. Similar binding studies using a series of FGFR2 deletion mutants showed that the second kinase domain of FGFR2 is the preferential binding site for ephexin1. We further examined the FGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites of ephexin1 through screening ephexin1 mutants that carry Tyr-to-Phe changes in several different loci. FGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of exphexin1 appears to include multiple tyrosine residues. These results suggest that FGFRs are involved in the regulation of ephexin1 activity, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones. Reagents—The following are the antibodies used in the current study: mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, clone 4G10 (Upstate); rabbit anti-FGFR2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-phospho-Src family (Tyr416) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-c-Src (SRC2) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-18). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against ephexin1 was raised against the N-terminal region of ephexin1 (1-373 amino acids) in our laboratory. Unless indicated otherwise, all other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM, Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio) supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Rat L6 myoblasts were maintained in the same condition. PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (Sigma) containing 10% horse serum (Amersham Biosciences) and 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin. For morphological examination, culture plates were treated with 2 μg/ml fibronectin at 37 °C for 1 h, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before plating cells. For treatment with growth factors and other chemicals, HEK293T cells, 48 h after transfection, were serum-deprived for 5 h and then incubated with SU5402 or PP2 (Calbiochem) at indicated concentrations for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 prior to FGF2 stimulation. L6 cells stably expressing FGFR2 and/or ephexin1 were kept in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for more than 16 h for serum starvation and incubated with FGF2 or kinase inhibitors. Ephrin-A1-Fc was used after oligomerization as described previously (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L. Yan X. Zhang Y. Schlessinger J. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18866-18871Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The wild type (WT) and mutants of EphA4 and FGFRs were constructed as reported (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L. Yan X. Zhang Y. Schlessinger J. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18866-18871Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA of mouse ephexin1 was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from a mouse brain as template. They were subsequently subcloned into pCR®-BluntII-Topo® vector (Invitrogen). Ephexin1 mutants were prepared by applying the recombinant PCR method or site-directed mutagenesis using WT constructs as templates and a pair of appropriate mutation primers. cDNAs for Rho family GTPases were derived from the constructs previously reported (10Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The sequences of all of the PCR-amplified DNAs were confirmed by sequencing after cloning into a pCR-BluntII-TOPO cloning vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For eukaryotic transient expression, all of the DNA constructs were incorporated into a pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector, into which a Myc, FLAG, or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-encoding sequence was integrated at the 3′ side in-frame with the coding sequences of the incorporated cDNAs. For bacterial expression, the full-length and mutant cDNAs were incorporated into a pMalC2 vector (New England Biolabs), which produces a protein N-terminally fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP), into a pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences) expression vector that produces a protein N-terminally fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST), or a pBAD/His vector (Invitrogen) or a pTrcHisA (Invitrogen), which produces a protein fused with an Xpress epitope and six His residues at the N terminus. The sequences for various deletion mutants and point mutants are as follows (refer to the maps in Figs. 6 and 7): ephexin1 of the far N-terminal region (N-GEF, amino acids 67-186); the N-terminal DH domain (N-DH, amino acids 187-276); the C-terminal DH domain (C-DH, amino acids 277-366); the DH plus PH domains (DH-PH, amino acids 326-446); the PH domain (PH, amino acids 400-506); the PH plus SH3 domains (PH-SH3, amino acids 447-551); the SH3 domain (SH3, amino acids 525-581); and the SH3 domain plus the far C terminus region (SH3-CT, amino acids 552-620); FGFR2 (ΔK1) region (amino acids 580-821), FGFR2 (juxtamembrane-kinase1 (JM-K1)) region (amino acids 400-579); FGFR2 (JM-K2) region (amino acids 400-708); FGFR2 (K2-C-terminal (K2-tga)) region (amino acids 709-821), C-terminal (CT) region (amino acids 757-821); FGFR3 (JM-K1) (amino acids 392-572); FGFR3 (JM-K2) (amino acids 392-693); FGFR3 (ΔK1) (amino acids 565-800); FGFR3 (K2-tga) (amino acids 694-800); and FGFR3 (CT) (amino acids 743-800).FIGURE 7Mapping of the interaction domains between FGFR3 and ephexin1 in an in vitro binding assay. A, the ephexin1 interaction region in FGFR3. The binding of ephexin1 (DH plus PH domains) to MBP-fused FGFR3 deletion mutants was examined as described in Fig. 6A. B, the FGFR3 binding region in ephexin1. The binding of FGFR3(WT), FGFR3(KD) (N540K), and a kinase-active (KA) (K650E) mutant of FGFR3 to the deletion mutants of ephexin1 was examined as described in Fig. 6B. The major binding region to FGFR3(WT) and FGFR3(KD) is marked by clear rectangles, and the binding region to FGFR3(KA) is marked by a dark rectangle. One-fortieth of the amount of the recombinant peptides used for the binding study was fractionated using a separate gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to show that the peptides were used in a similar amount. Stained bands of different molecular masses were put in alignment for easy comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The M series of the point mutants of ephexin1 were synthesized by changing tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. These mutants are named as ephexin1(M1) (Y87F and Y90F), ephexin1(M2) (Y198F and Y199F), ephexin1(M3) (Y263F and Y265F), ephexin1(M4) (Y273F and Y276F), ephexin1(M5) (Y283F and 287F), ephexin1(M6) (Y428F), ephexin1(M7) (Y447F), ephexin1(M8) (Y489F), and ephexin1(M9) (Y533F) (see Fig. 8A). The A series of the point mutants of ephexin1 were synthesized by changing tyrosine residues to aspartic acid (see Fig. 8A). All the ephexin1 point mutants were generated by mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers containing the desired mutations. The WT and the point mutants of ephexin1 were subcloned into the pMXs-IG vector for recombinant retroviral production as described below, or into the pcDNA3.1 vector for transient transfection. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Fusion proteins were expressed in TOP10 bacteria and purified by amylose or glutathione affinity column chromatography for MBP-fused or GST-fused proteins, respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. For preparation of His6-tagged recombinant proteins, the proteins expressed in TOP10 bacteria were purified using the BD-Talon cobalt-based affinity chromatography resin (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Eluted fractions were collected and dialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES and 50 mm NaCl that was kept at pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined using the SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining utilizing bovine serum albumin as a standard. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—To determine the interaction between the ephexin1 deletion mutants and the FGFR cytoplasmic domain in vitro, 2 μg of MBP-tagged ephexin1 deletion mutants were preloaded to amylose agarose at 4 °C for 60 min. The Xpress-tagged FGFR cytoplasmic domain was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Finally beads were washed three times with a wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl), suspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated using 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and immunoblotted with an anti-Xpress antibody. In the binding assay between the DH plus PH domains of ephexin1 and the deletion mutants of the FGFR cytoplasmic domain, ephexin1 and FGFR molecules were tagged with Xpress and MBP, respectively. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Transient transfection with the various expression constructs was carried out using FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized with the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The lysis buffer contained 50 mm HEPES buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A). In some experiments, cell lysates (15-50 μg) were fractionated directly using SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an antibody. In other experiments cell lysates (150-400 μg) were used for immunoprecipitation with an appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by adding protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with an antibody. Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In some cases, membranes were stripped and re-probed with different antibodies. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Samples were prepared from L6 cells as follows. L6 cells stably expressing ephexin1-HA were serum-deprived as described above, treated with 100 ng/ml FGF2 for 1 h, and solubilized in a lysis buffer. The lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. In vitro guanine nucleotide exchange assays were performed as described elsewhere (10Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T.

GST-fused small GTPase proteins (GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, and GST-Cdc42) were synthesized as recombinant proteins in bacteria using the same method as for FGFR and ephexin1 as describe above. The small GTPase proteins were first loaded with [3H]GDP for 30 min at 30 °C in a loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA). MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 25 mm, and the mixture was placed on ice. To start an exchange assay, 20 μg of cell lysate and 3 μg of [3H]GDP-bound small GTPase were incubated in a 150-μl final volume of exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP) at 30 °C. At the indicated time points, the reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold termination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) and kept on the ice. Samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and washed three times with the termination buffer, then dissolved in 10 ml of Filtron-X scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics). Radioactivity of bound [3H]GDP was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. For data presentation, the amount of [3H]GDP retained on the filter at 0 time point was taken as 1. Retroviral Vector Construction—For making cells stably co-expressing ephexin1 with FGFR2 or EphA4, their cDNAs were subcloned into pMXs-IG vector (obtained from T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Tokyo) linked to EGFP through the internal ribosomal entry site sequence (12Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Virus was produced as described previously (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L.

The transduced cells were identified easily by visualization of the EGFP fluorescence. FGF Receptor Is Involved in the Phosphorylation of Ephexin1—Ephexin1 is known to bind to EphA4, and the function of the GEF becomes modulated by EphA4 through SFK-mediated phosphorylation (7Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6248-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that the ephexin1 binds to EphA4 and is phosphorylated in an EphA4 dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). Because we have recently reported that EphA4 and FGFR interact with and cross-phosphorylate each other (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L. Yan X. Zhang Y. Schlessinger J. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18866-18871Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we initiated studies to investigate the function of FGFR in regulating the ephexin1 function. When EphA4 was overexpressed and stimulated by its ligand, ephrin-A1, ephexin1 was phosphorylated over the basal level. Addition of SU5402, an FGFR kinase inhibitor, inhibited the phosphorylation levels of both the overexpressed EphA4 and the endogenous FGFR2 and reduced the level of ephexin1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). SU5402 did not affect the phosphorylation levels of SFK at Tyr-416, which is regarded as the critical phosphorylation site for SFK activation. These findings suggest that FGFR might also be involved in the regulation of ephexin1 by tyrosine phosphorylation and that the EphA4-mediated ephexin1 phosphorylation by SFK (8Sahin M. Greer P.L. Lin M.Z. Poucher H. Eberhart J. Schmidt S. Wright T.M. Shamah S.M. O'Connell S. Cowan C.W. Hu L. Goldberg J.L. Debant A. Corfas G. Krull C.E. Greenberg M.E.

To evaluate the interaction of four members of FGFRs with ephexin1, we overexpressed both molecules in HEK293T cells and examined their binding and ephexin1 phosphorylation using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Ephexin1 bound to all the four FGFRs, whereas it was phosphorylated only by the activated FGFRs (FGFR1 and FGFR2) with FGFR2 having the highest phosphorylation effect on ephexin1. Furthermore, the overexpressed FGFR2 phosphorylated the exogenous ephexin1 in an FGFR2 dose-dependent manner. The phosphorylated portion of ephexin1 that was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous EphA4 was almost undetectable, whereas non-phosphorylated ephexin1 was clearly co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FGFR2 is the driving force of ephexin1 phosphorylation in the presence of FGFR2, EphA4, and ephexin1. When FGFR2 was overexpressed in L6 cells, which barely express intrinsic FGFRs (3Yokote H. Fujita K. Jing X. Sawada T. Liang S. Yao L. Yan X. Zhang Y. Schlessinger J. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Therefore, we used the time point between 30 and 60 min for evaluation of the ligand-mediated ephexin1 phosphorylation.FIGURE 3Tyrosine phosphorylation of ephexin1 in L6 cells after FGF2 stimulation. A, interaction of ephexin1 with FGFR2 in L6 cells. Expression levels of FGFR2 (upper panel) and ephexin1-HA (bottom panel) were shown in L6 cells stably expressing exogenous FGFR2 or/and ephexin1. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR2 antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (middle panel). B, time course of ephexin1 phosphorylation following treatment of L6 cells stably expressing both FGFR2 and ephexin1 with FGF2 (100 ng/ml).

SU5402 effectively inhibited phosphorylation of FGFR2, and almost completely suppressed phosphorylation of ephexin1 at concentrations as low as 5 μm. SFK phosphorylation at Tyr-416 was not altered (Fig. 4A). Because SFK is reported to be involved in the phosphorylation of ephexin1 when stimulated by ephrin (8Sahin M. Greer P.L. Lin M.Z. Poucher H.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6248-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we used an SFK inhibitor PP2 and its non-functional control chemical PP3 in place of SU5402 to study the effect of SFK in the FGFR2-mediated phosphorylation of ephexin1. SFK phosphorylation was slightly inhibited by PP2 at 2.5 μm or higher concentrations. PP2 barely inhibited the phosphorylation of ephexin1 at concentrations up to 2.5 μm, whereas 2.5 μm PP2 clearly inhibited phosphorylation of FGFR2 and PP2 at 5 μm further inhibited phosphorylation of both FGFR2 and ephexin1 (Fig. 4B). PP2 at 10 μm inhibited phosphorylation of overexpressed FGFR2 (without FGF2 stimulation) and completely suppressed phosphorylation of ephexin1 in HEK293T cells, whereas the phosphorylation level of SFK Tyr-416 was only slightly reduced (Fig. 4C). Taken together, FGFR2 phosphorylates ephexin1 independently of SFK activation, which is reported to be required for the effect of EphA4 on ephexin1 (8Sahin M. Greer P.L. Lin M.Z. Poucher H.

In the present study, we find that nicotine blocks only 75% of 125I-epibatidine binding to rat brain membranes, whereas ligands specific for serotonin type 3 receptors (5-HT3Rs) block the remaining 25%. 125I-Epibatidine binds with a high affinity to native 5-HT3Rs of N1E-115 cells and to receptors composed of only 5-HT3A subunits expressed in HEK cells. In these cells, serotonin, the 5-HT3R-specific antagonist MDL72222, and the 5-HT3R agonist chlorophenylbiguanide readily competed with 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs. Nicotine was a poor competitor for 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs. However, the noncompetitive nAChR antagonist mecamylamine acted as a potent competitive inhibitor of 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs. Epibatidine inhibited serotonin-induced currents mediated by endogenous 5-HT3Rs in neuroblastoma cell lines and 5-HT3ARs expressed in HEK cells in a competitive manner. Our results demonstrate that 5-HT3Rs are previously uncharacterized high affinity epibatidine binding sites in the brain and indicate that epibatidine and mecamylamine act as 5-HT3R antagonists. Previous studies that depended on epibatidine and mecamylamine as nAChR-specific ligands, in particular studies of analgesic properties of epibatidine, may need to be reinterpreted with respect to the potential role of 5-HT3Rs.

(2001) 226, 1024–1030Google Scholar), whereas in normal rats, activation of 5-HT3Rs decreases arterial pressure (40Ferreira H.S. Silva E.C. Cointeiro C. Oliveira E. Faustino T.N. Fregoneze J.B.

In this study, using a combination of neuroblastoma cell lines, heterologous expression of 5-HT3ARs, and rat brain preparations, we show that epibatidine binds with high affinity to 5-HT3Rs. In addition, both epibatidine and mecamylamine function as antagonists when bound to 5-HT3Rs. Thus, 5-HT3Rs may participate in physiological effects previously thought to be nAChR-specific. Cell Lines and Transfection—The human kidney epithelial cell line tsA201 (HEK cells) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Hemagglutinin epitope-tagged mouse 5HT3A was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector using standard methodology. HEK cells were transiently transfected with the subunit cDNA constructs using a calcium phosphate protocol (53Eertmoed A. Vajello Y.F. Green W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 293: 564-585Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some experiments, for comparison with mouse 5-HT3A receptors, HEK cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the human 5-HT3A receptor subunit. Mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Mouse neuroblastoma NB41A3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes (Fisher) for use in electrophysiological experiments. All medium was supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Rat Brain Membranes—Membranes were prepared as described previously (54Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adult rats were decapitated, and the entire brain was dissected and placed in ice-cold 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, chymostatin, pepstatin, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and leupeptin at 10 μg/ml). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. The brain tissue was minced and homogenized in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were taken through one more cycle of homogenization and centrifugation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3 plus protease inhibitors and frozen at –80 °C until needed. Ligand Binding Studies—Unlabeled epibatidine in phosphate-buffered saline was added to 125I-epibatidine (2200 Ci/mmol) or [3H]epibatidine (47.3 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a total epibatidine concentration of 1.7 and 10 μm, respectively. Equilibrium binding to whole cell membrane fractions was measured by incubating at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline with increasing amounts of radiolabeled epibatidine on a table top rotator for 20 min. For competitive binding experiments, cells were preincubated with different serotonergic or nicotinic ligands at the specified concentrations, followed by the addition of 50 nm 125I-epibatidine. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm epibatidine, 100 μm MDL72222 or by performing binding on cells transfected with empty vector. Samples were washed three times rapidly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in a Brandel apparatus. 125I- and [3H]epibatidine counts were measured in a Wallac 1470 automatic γ counter and a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter, respectively. Equilibrium binding constants were calculated based on the least squares equation, amount of ligand bound = Bmax × [ligand]/KD + [ligand]. Competition binding curves were generated with the least squared fit to the Hill equation, fraction of maximum = 1/(1 + IC50/[ligand])n, where n represents the Hill coefficient. IC50 values were converted to KI values using the equation, KI = IC50/1 + ([epibatidine]/KD). The KD for epibatidine used to calculate KI values for nicotine and MDL72222 in Fig. 1 was 8 pm (55Gnadisch D. London E.D. Terry P. Hill G.R. Mukhin A.G. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and 27 nm (see Fig. 2A), respectively.FIGURE 2Saturation and competition binding of serotonergic and nicotinic ligands to 5-HT3Rs.

The electrode solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Cells were voltage-clamped at an electrode potential of –60 mV. 5-HT3 receptors were activated by locally applying agonists to the cell by pressure (10 p.s.i.) ejection (Picospritzer II; General Valve Corp.) from modified patch pipettes. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with extracellular solution (5 ml/min). Experiments took place at 20–22 °C. Currents were monitored using an Axopatch 200B, low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 KHz using a Digidata 1320A interface, and acquired using pCLAMP8 software (all from Axon Instruments) onto the hard drive of a personal computer for off-line analysis. The peak amplitudes of agonist-activated currents were measured using pCLAMP8 software. Concentration-response relationships were fitted with modified logistic functions to determine EC50, IC50, and Hill slope values, as described previously (56Adodra S. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). High Affinity Epibatidine Binding in Rat Brain to Sites Other than nAChRs—When relatively high concentrations of 125I-epibatidine (50 nm) were used to measure binding to membranes prepared from rat brain homogenates, a component of the 125I-epibatidine binding was insensitive to nicotine competition (Fig. 1A). Although nicotine blocked 75% of the binding to rat brain membranes, 25% of the binding remained intact even at nicotine concentrations as high as 1 mm. Nicotine blocked 125I-epibatidine binding with a KI of 2 nm, which was derived from the fit of the Hill equation to the data in Fig. 1A. The KI value for nicotine is similar to other measurements using epibatidine binding to rat brain synaptosomal membranes (55Gnadisch D. London E.D. Terry P. Hill G.R. Mukhin A.G. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and rat cerebral cortex (57Davila-Garcia M.I. Musachio J.L. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 25% of the 125I-epibatidine binding is to sites other than nAChRs. Since epibatidine has been shown to block serotonin-induced currents mediated by 5-HT3ARs in oocytes (51Gurley D.A. Lanthorn T.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and nAChRs and 5-HT3Rs share a high degree of sequence similarity (16Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), we tested the effects 5-HT3R-specific ligands on 125I-epibatidine binding to rat brain fractions. As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing concentrations of the 5-HT3R-specific antagonist, MDL72222, blocked 25% of the 125I-epibatidine binding in experiments parallel to those in Fig. 1A using the rat brain membranes. We obtained similar data using a 5-HT3R-specific agonist, chlorophenylbiguanide (CPBG) (data not shown). The effects of nicotine and the 5-HT3R-specific ligands were additive, as shown in Fig. 1C. Preincubation of the rat brain membranes with saturating concentrations of either nicotine and MDL72222 or nicotine and CPBG blocked all specific 125I-epibatidine binding to the membrane. These results indicate that 125I-epibatidine binds to two distinct subpopulations of receptors in rat brain: 1) a nicotine-sensitive subpopulation consisting of nAChRs and 2) a nicotine-insensitive subpopulation consisting of 5-HT3Rs. Epibatidine Binding to Native and Heterologous 5-HT3Rs—To further test whether there are 125I-epibatidine binding sites on 5-HT3Rs, we performed binding assays on preparations in which native and heterologously expressed 5-HT3Rs were present in the absence of any significant nAChR expression. To study native 5-HT3Rs, we used undifferentiated mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells. These cells express endogenous 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits (58Reeves D.C. Lummis C.R. BMC Neurosci. 2006; 710.1186/1471-2202-7-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but little to no nicotinic receptors (59Oortgiesen M. van Kleef R.G. Vijverberg H.P. Brain Res. 1997; 747: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Consistent with an absence of nAChR high affinity sites, we detected no specific binding to membranes from undifferentiated N1E-115 cells at 125I-epibatidine concentrations of 0.5 nm. At higher concentrations, we observed an increasing level of specific, high affinity 125I-epibatidine binding to the neuroblastoma cell 5-HT3Rs with an estimated KD of 27 ± 6 nm (Fig. 2A). We obtained similar results (an estimated KD of 22 ± 5 nm) with [3H]epibatidine binding to neuroblastoma cell 5-HT3Rs (Fig. 2A). Serotonin, MDL72222, and CPBG were highly potent inhibitors of 125I-epibatidine binding to N1E-115 cell membranes as compared with nicotine in competition binding experiments (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, mecamylamine, a noncompetitive antagonist of different nAChRs, blocked 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs. The relative potency in competing for 125I-epibatidine binding sites in N1E-115 cell membranes was MDL72222 > epibatidine > 5-HT = CPBG > mecamylamine ⋙ nicotine (Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition of 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs by various serotonergic and nicotinic ligandsN1E-115 cellsMouse 5-HT3ARs in HEK cellsKIHill coefficientKIHill coefficientmmEpibatidine2.2 ± 0.5 × 10-60.66 ± 0.055.0 ± 1.0 × 10-70.38 ± 0.03Mecamylamine2.2 ± 0.6 × 10-50.53 ± 0.052.0 ± 0.2 × 10-60.93 ± 0.07Serotonin5.4 ± 1.2 × 10-60.38 ± 0.035.3 ± 1.4 × 10-60.53 ± 0.06MDL722223.0 ± 0.8 × 10-70.44 ± 0.051.2 ± 0.2 × 10-60.45 ± 0.06CPBG5.6 ± 1.0 × 10-60.70 ± 0.109.7 ± 1.4 × 10-60.64 ± 0.05Nicotine2.0 ± 0.3 × 10-40.47 ± 0.052.7 ± 1.4 × 10-40.34 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab 5-HT3Rs native to neuroblastoma cells have functional properties similar to those of homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (60Stewart A. Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Safa P. Hales T.G. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To compare 5-HT3Rs of neuroblastoma cells with those of known composition, we performed experiments on membranes from HEK cells expressing mouse 5-HT3A subunits. As shown in Fig. 2C, 5-HT3ARs bound 125I-epibatidine with a KD of 14 ± 4 nm, which is approximately half of the KD observed for native receptors in N1E-115 cells. Competition binding experiments were also performed on membranes from HEK cells expressing 5-HT3ARs. The relative potency in competing for 125I-epibatidine binding sites from the HEK cell membranes was epibatidine > MDL72222 > 5-HT = mecamylamine > CPBG ⋙ nicotine (Table 1). The Action of Epibatidine on 5-HT3R Function—Previous studies have shown that some nicotinic receptor agonists, including epibatidine, inhibit serotonin-induced currents in oocytes expressing 5-HT3ARs (51Gurley D.A. Lanthorn T.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 52Machu T.K. Hamilton M.E. Frye T.F. Shanklin C.L. Harris M.C. Sun H. Tenner T.E. Soti F.S. Kem W.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 1112-1119PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of epibatidine on 5-HT3R function in cells expressing native and recombinant 5-HT3 receptors. N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells express endogenous functional 5-HT3Rs (61Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Dempster J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 5-HT (30 μm) activated inward currents recorded from N1E-115 cells voltage-clamped at –60 mV. Application of epibatidine to the recording chamber caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of 5-HT-evoked currents (Fig. 3A) with an IC50 of 3.3 ± 0.3 μm (Table 2). Epibatidine had a similar potency (IC50 = 4.7 ± 0.5 μm) as an inhibitor of 5-HT-evoked currents recorded from NB41A3 mouse neuroblastoma cells, which expresses native 5-HT3Rs with properties similar to those of homomeric 5-HT3ARs (60Stewart A. Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Safa P. Hales T.G. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of epibatidine on recombinant mouse 5-HT3ARs expressed in HEK cells. Epibatidine inhibited 5-HT-evoked currents with an IC50 of 4.1 ± 0.3 μm (Table 2). 5-HT elicited a concentration-dependent activation of current mediated by recombinant 5-HT3ARs with an EC50 of 5.7 ± 0.7 μm (Fig. 3B). In the presence of epibatidine (30 μm), this response is shifted to the right (EC50 = 10.1 ± 0.3 μm) without altering the maximum current amplitude, indicating that epibatidine is a competitive antagonist at 5-HT3Rs (Fig. 3B).TABLE 2Inhibition by epibatidine of 5-HT-evoked currentsIC50Hill coefficientμm5-HT3Rs in neuroblastoma cells N1E-1153.3 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.2 NB41A34.7 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.1Ectopic 5-HT3ARs in HEK cells Mouse 5-HT3A4.1 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.1 Human 5-HT3A7.6 ± 0.71.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab d-Tubocurarine, a plant alkaloid that inhibits nAChR function, also inhibits 5-HT3Rs (50Hope A.G. Belelli D. Mair I.D. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The potency of d-tubocurarine as an antagonist of 5-HT3R-mediated currents is highly species-dependent. Human 5-HT3ARs are >1000 times less sensitive to inhibition by d-tubocurarine than are rodent 5-HT3ARs. Therefore, we examined whether the antagonist potency of epibatidine also varies between mouse and human 5-HT3ARs. 5-HT (30 μm)-activated currents recorded from HEK cells expressing recombinant human 5-HT3ARs were inhibited by epibatidine with an IC50 of 7.6 ± 0.7 μm (n = 5), a value that is only slightly higher than the IC50 of epibatidine as an inhibitor of mouse 5-HT3ARs (Table 2). Since mecamylamine displaces binding of epibatidine to 5-HT3Rs (Fig. 2B and Table 1), we examined whether the nAChR antagonist affects 5-HT-activated currents mediated by recombinant 5-HT3ARs. Mecamylamine (10 μm) caused a 30 ± 4% (n = 4) inhibition of 5-HT-activated currents mediated by human 5-HT3ARs. In this study, we identify high affinity 125I-epibatidine binding sites in the brain with the pharmacological characteristics of 5-HT3Rs. These sites are distinctly serotonergic, since the 5-HT3R agonist (CPBG) and antagonist (MDL72222) effectively block 125I-epibatidine binding, whereas nicotine is ineffective at blocking binding. Nicotine is also a poor competitor against 125I-epibatidine binding to 5-HT3AR homomers expressed heterologously in HEK cells and endogenous 5-HT3Rs expressed by N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells. In these cells, epibatidine blocks serotonin-induced currents in a competitive manner with IC50 values similar to that observed for the inhibition of recombinant 5-HT3R-mediated currents in oocytes (51Gurley D.A. Lanthorn T.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to being an agonist at nAChRs, we conclude that epibatidine is a competitive antagonist of 5-HT3Rs. The affinity of epibatidine for 5-HT3R sites is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for nAChR subtypes that bind epibatidine with high affinity. Epibatidine binds to these nAChRs with KD values in the 10–100 pm range (57Davila-Garcia M.I. Musachio J.L. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 62Parker S.L. Fu Y. McAllen K. Luo J. McIntosh J.M. Lindstrom J.M. Sharp B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 63Whiteaker P. Jimenez M. McIntosh J.M. Collins A.C. Marks M.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This variability might arise from ligand depletion during binding studies that can result in underestimation of the affinity of epibatidine for nAChRs. In studies that avoided ligand depletion, epibatidine binds to a single population of brain nAChRs with KD values in the 1–8 pm range (4Houghtling R.A. Davila-Garcia M.I. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 280-287PubMed Google Scholar, 55Gnadisch D. London E.D. Terry P. Hill G.R. Mukhin A.G. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because of its extremely high affinity for nAChRs, virtually all studies measuring equilibrium binding have used epibatidine concentrations less than 1 nm, which would result in little, if any, binding to 5-HT3Rs. Thus, the failure to observe epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs in earlier studies is most likely due to the relatively low concentrations of radiolabeled epibatidine used to measure binding to nAChRs. When epibatidine concentrations much higher than 1 nm were used in radiolabeled epibatidine binding studies, a second population of binding sites with lower affinity for epibatidine was observed (4Houghtling R.A. Davila-Garcia M.I. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 280-287PubMed Google Scholar, 64McCallum S.E. Collins A.C. Paylor R. Marks M.J. Psychopharmacology. 2006; 184: 314-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 65Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Collins A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the works of Marks et al. (65Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Collins A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), using nAChR subunit null mice, at least some of the lower affinity epibatidine sites consist of nAChRs. However, data presented in this study suggest that a portion of the lower affinity sites may also consist of 5-HT3Rs. Our results are consistent with earlier studies that have established significant pharmacological crossover between 5-HT3Rs and nAChRs. For example, the nAChR antagonist, d-tubocurarine, and 5-HT3R-specific antagonists, such as MDL72222 and GR65630, bind to 5-HT3Rs with comparable affinities. Furthermore, d-tubocurarine blocks 5-HT3R-mediated currents (49Lummis S.C. Kilpatrick G.J. Martin I.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 189: 22-27Google Scholar, 50Hope A.G. Belelli D. Mair I.D. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar actions are observed for the nAChR channel blockers, chlorpromazine and QX222 (48Sepulveda M.I. Baker J. Lummis S.C. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other studies also show that tropisetron, which is a selective 5-HT3R antagonist, binds with high affinity and is a potent partial agonist at the α7 nAChR (66Macor J.E. Gurley D.A. Lanthorn T.H. Loch J. Mack R.A. Mullen G. Tran O. Wright N. Gordon C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 44: 319-321Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the α7 agonist, PSAB-OFP, acts as a potent agonist at 5-HT3Rs (67Broad L.M. Felthouse C. Zwart R. McPhie G.I. Pearson K.H.

Relevant to our results, the nAChR agonists, anabaseine and epibatidine, are shown to block serotonin-activated currents in oocytes expressing 5-HT3ARs with IC50 values of 14 and 8 μm, respectively (51Gurley D.A. Lanthorn T.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 52Machu T.K. Hamilton M.E. Frye T.F. Shanklin C.L. Harris M.C. Sun H. Tenner T.E. Soti F.S. Kem W.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 1112-1119PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that epibatidine effectively blocks rodent 5-HT3R-mediated currents in a competitive manner with IC50 values of 3.3 and 4.1 μm in neuroblastoma cells and HEK cells, respectively. The mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of epibatidine have not been fully characterized. The concentrations of epibatidine required for analgesia are in the micromolar range (27Cucchiaro G. Chaijale N. Commons G. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

These concentrations are similar to the concentrations that we found antagonize 5-HT3Rs and are orders of magnitude higher than what is needed to saturate the high affinity binding site on nAChRs but in line with the epibatidine concentrations that activate nAChRs. As an agonist, epibatidine (10–100 nm) increases neurotransmitter release from hippocampal slice preparations (70Sullivan J.P. Decker M.W. Brioni J.D. Donnelly-Roberts D.L. Anderson D.J. Bannon A.W.

Using heterologous expression of α4β2 nAChRs, Buisson et al. found a similar dose dependence for epibatidine as an nAChR agonist (74Buisson B. Vallejo Y.F. Green W.N. Bertrand D. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further evidence that agonist activity of epibatidine underlies its physiological role is that the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine blocks both the functional activity and antinociceptive effects of epibatidine (2Badio B. Daly J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 563-569PubMed Google Scholar, 10Radek R.J. Curzon P. Decker M.W. Brain Res. Bul. 2004; 64: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Damaj M.I.

However, the fact that mecamylamine has pronociceptive properties (12Rashid M.H. Furue H. Yoshimura M. Ueda H. Pain. 2006; 125: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and our data showing that mecamylamine competes with the epibatidine binding to 5-HT3Rs (Table 1) indicate that the previous findings with mecamylamine are also consistent with these ligands interacting with 5-HT3R sites. Our findings that epibatidine binds with high affinity to and antagonizes 5-HT3Rs raise questions about where epibatidine elicits its physiological actions and indicate that 5-HT3Rs should be considered as a potential target. We are most grateful to Dr. Paul Vezna for supplying the rat brains used in this study."

Among these, cortical granule exocytosis and compensatory endocytosis provide effective models to study membrane trafficking. This study documents an important role for myosin1e in cortical granule exocytosis. Myosin1e is expressed at the earliest stage that cortical granule exocytosis can be detected in oocytes. Prior to exocytosis, myosin1e relocates to the surface of cortical granules. Overexpression of myosin1e augments the kinetics of cortical granule exocytosis, whereas tail-derived fragments of myosin1e inhibit this secretory event (but not constitutive exocytosis). Finally, intracellular injection of myosin1e antibody inhibits cortical granule exocytosis. Further experiments identified cysteine string proteins as interacting partners for myosin1e. As constituents of the membrane of cortical granules, cysteine string proteins are also essential for cortical granule exocytosis. Future investigation of the link between myosin1e and cysteine string proteins should help to clarify basic mechanisms of regulated exocytosis.

A recent analysis concluded that the eukaryotic myosin superfamily includes 37 discrete types of myosins that are distinguished by the auxiliary domains linked to the ATP/actin-binding core of these motor proteins (1Richards T.A. Cavalier-Smith T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although the role of vertebrate, skeletal muscle myosins is well established, the specific function of the majority of the non-muscle, unconventional myosins remains unclear. To investigate the role of individual myosins in dynamic cellular events, we initiated studies using immature oocytes and eggs of Xenopus laevis (2Weber K.L. Sokac A.M. Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Bement W.M. Nature. 2005; 431: 325-329Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev.

(i) They harbor mRNA encoding a variety of unconventional myosins (3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev.

(iii) The large size and relative ease of manipulation of these cells facilitate biochemical and ultrastructural studies, as well as dynamic imaging experiments.

Because a second type 1 myosin, myosin 1e (Myo1e; see ref. 10Gillespie P.G. Albanesi J.P. Bahler M. Bement W.M. Berg J.S. Burgess D.R. Brurnside B. Cheney R.E. Corey D.P. Coudrier E. de Lanerolle P.

Myo1e, like other myosins-1, has an NH2-terminal actin and ATP-binding motor domain, followed by a central calmodulin-binding IQ domain and a COOH-terminal tail. The tail is composed of a basic MyTH1 (Myosin Tail Homology 1) domain that binds anionic phospholipids, and a glycine-proline-rich MyTH2 region of unknown function (11Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the tails of myosins 1e and 1f include a COOH-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that presumably is involved in protein-protein interactions (12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 13Cesarini G. Panni S. Nardelli G. Castagnoli L.

Here we show that Xenopus Myo1e rapidly relocates to the surface of cortical granules in response to stimuli that trigger exocytosis. We also demonstrate that disruption of Myo1e function leads to a suppression of cortical granule exocytosis. We also show that Myo1e binds to cysteine string protein (csp), an established component of cortical granules (14Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that is associated with secretory organelles in many other systems, including neurons (15Buchner E. Gundersen C.B.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results directly link this type 1 myosin to the control of regulated exocytosis and suggest that Myo1e functions at least in part via interaction with csp. Isolation and Culturing of Oocytes—Stage II–VI oocytes (17Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) of X. laevis were isolated from fragments of ovary by treatment (2–4 h at ∼22 °C) in a solution containing collagenase (3–5 mg ml-1) and then in a potassium phosphate solution (which facilitates the removal of the follicle cell layer) followed by culturing in Barths solution (in mm: NaCl, 88; KCl, 1; NaHCO3, 2.4; Hepes, 15; CaNO3, 0.3; CaCl2, 0.41; MgSO4, 0.82 with enro-floxacin at 10 μg/ml) as described (18Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for Fig. 1, all experiments used stage V–VI oocytes. Affinity Purification of Myo1e Antibody—Rabbit antisera were produced against the deduced NH2-terminal peptide (MGSKERYHWQTQNVRQSGVDDC, where the C residue was for conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) or the deduced COOH-terminal peptide (CGWWQGRIRGREGLFPGNYVEKI, again the C residue was used to conjugate the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) of Xenopus Myo1e. Myo1e antibody was affinity-purified by individually conjugating these peptides to Sulfolink resin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antiserum was adsorbed to the peptide affinity resin followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, in mm: NaCl, 150, KCl, 5, NaHPO4, KHPO4) until the A280 of the wash solution was <0.05. Bound antibody was eluted using 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.9), and the pH was neutralized using Tris base. Samples were concentrated to >1 mg ml-1 and stored in 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Identical procedures were used to obtain affinity-purified antibody targeting the COOH-terminal peptide of Xenopus myosin 1d (the peptide immunogen was CKINQSQPQFTKNRAGFTLSVPAN).

This homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at ∼700 × g, and samples of the supernatant and pellet were retained for immunoblot analysis. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and samples of the supernatant and pellet were recovered for immunoblot analysis as described below. Generation of Myo1e Constructs for Oocyte Expression—The full-length cDNA for Xenopus Myo1e (GenBank™ accession number BC046842) was subcloned into the Xenopus transcription vector pCS2+ with or without enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) upstream of the construct, as described before (19Sokac A.M. Co C. Taunton J. Bement W.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Truncations of the full-length Myo1e included the head (residues 1–661), IQT (residues 662–1094), tail (residues 716–1094), and SH3 (residues 999–1094). Plasmid DNAs were linearized using NotI, and RNA was transcribed using the SP6 mMessage Machine (Ambion). After LiCl precipitation, the RNA was adjusted to ∼1 mg ml-1 and oocytes were injected with 40–50 nl of the RNA solution and cultured 1–3 days prior to secretion assays or dynamic imaging. Measurement of Cortical Granule Exocytosis—Details of this assay are in Ref. 18Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, single oocytes are incubated in 10–15 μl of solution containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 20 or 50 nm. After 30 min (or 20 min in Fig. 7), this solution was recovered and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie staining. The released cortical granule lectin (typically, 1–1.5 μg per oocyte; see Ref. 18Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was detected principally as a broad band between 35 and 50 kDa. Where indicated, each oocyte was extracted for immunoblot analysis of Myo1e or Myo1e constructs as described for csp in Ref. 20Smith G.B. Hirano A. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Biol.

For Fig. 6, oocytes were injected ∼4 h prior to the secretion assay with 0.5 mg of a mixture of the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal Myo1e antibodies or with an equivalent amount of bovine IgG (Sigma). Densitometry (three-dimensional; Eastman Kodak Co.) was used both to quantify the amount of released lectin and to compare the expression of immunoreactive Myo1e species in the oocytes. Results are given as the mean ± S.E., and statistical analyses used the Student's t test.FIGURE 6Injection of oocytes with Myo1e antibody inhibits cortical granule exocytosis.

Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber J. Udenfriend S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with or without mRNA for Myo1e-IQT. After 2 days, individual oocytes were placed in tubes with 20–40 μl of Barths solution. After incubation for another 2–3 days, alkaline phosphatase activity was measured (as in Ref. 21Tate S.S. Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber J. Udenfriend S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) both in the medium surrounding the oocyte and in oocyte extracts. Constitutive secretion of the alkaline phosphatase was normalized to the total enzyme present (secreted enzyme plus enzyme in the cell extract) and expressed as a percentage. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Immunoblot Analysis of Oocytes—Oocytes were fixed (at 22 °C) in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde in buffer A (0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)). After 1 h, Triton X-100 was added to 0.5%, and the cells were left in this solution for 2–3 h. Following three washes with buffer A, the oocytes were cut in half and blocked (15–30 min) using 10% goat serum in buffer A. Primary antibody was diluted in the block solution (5 μg ml-1 of affinity-purified Myo1e antibody targeting the COOH end or a 1:1000 dilution of Csp antiserum) along with 5 μg ml-1 rhodamine-conjugated Dolichos bifluros lectin (Vector Laboratories; this lectin binds to the cortical granule lectin of the oocyte; see Ref. 19Sokac A.M. Co C. Taunton J. Bement W.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After 12–16 h in primary antibody (at 4 °C), the oocytes were washed with buffer A (for 2–3 h) and incubated for 2 h with Alexa-488 secondary antibody (from Molecular Probes; 2 μg ml-1 in block solution) followed by washing with buffer A (for 12–16 h at 4 °C). Frozen sections (10–15 μm) were cut, and epifluorescence images were obtained using an Olympus BX60 microscope with ×10 (0.40 na) or ×40 (0.85 na) objective lenses and an Olympus C-2020Z digital camera. Confocal images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained using a Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a ×100, 1.3 na Pan-Neofluar objective and using 495 nm excitation (with a 505–550 bandpass filter) for the Alexa Fluor and 543 nm excitation (with a 560 nm long pass filter) for rhodamine. Immunoblot analyses of detergent extracts of oocytes were performed as described previously (20Smith G.B. Hirano A. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32669-32675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using either 0.2 μg ml-1 Myo1e antibody (described above) or Csp antibody (at 0.2–0.5 μg ml-1; as described in Ref. 22Poage R.E.

Hedrick, University of California, Davis). The extract of Xenopus brain that served as a control in Fig. 1 was prepared by homogenizing whole frog brain in 0.3 m sucrose and centrifuging 10 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant from this centrifugation was dispersed using concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer and used for immunoblot analysis. Dynamic Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—Experiments were performed as described previously (3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with mRNA encoding eGFP-Myo1e (∼50 ng), and the next day a single oocyte was mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M microscope (with Bio-Rad 1024 × 1024 lasersharp confocal software using a numerical aperture 1.4, ×63 objective lens) in a solution containing 0.1 mg ml-1 wheat germ agglutinin (to suppress cortical flow), the extracellular marker, neutral, Texas Red dextran (0.1 mm; 3,000 kDa; Molecular Probes), and 50 nm PMA. The time-lapse images were collected at 2-s intervals from a single optical plane immediately beneath the plasma membrane. Movies were assembled and analyzed using Volocity (Improvision). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Extracts were prepared by homogenizing oocytes in 10 volumes of buffer A (with 190 Triton X-100) and centrifuging for 1 min at 15,000 × g. The lipid at the top of the extract was removed, and the centrifugation and lipid aspiration steps were repeated (2–3 times) to obtain a lipid-free solution. Extract equivalent to 20–25 oocytes was incubated at 4 °C for 12–16 h with 5–7 μg of Myo1e antibody (and either no antibody or Myo 1d antibody as a control) or 5 μl of csp antibody (prepared as in Ref. 22Poage R.E. Meriney S.L. Gundersen C.B. Umbach J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) followed by 1 h with 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The agarose beads were washed three times with buffer A and suspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described in Ref. 20Smith G.B. Hirano A. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. J.

Attempts to determine whether calmodulin co-immunoprecipitates with Myo1e were hampered by the lack of a suitable calmodulin antibody. Pulldown Experiments—Full-length Xenopus Csp was fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the recombinant fusion protein was harvested from bacterial lysates by binding to amylose resin as described in the supplier's instructions (New England Biolabs). The equivalent of ∼0.1 mg of MBP-Csp or MBP alone (bound to the amylose resin) was incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C with an oocyte extract prepared as for the immunoprecipitations (above). Alternatively, full-length Myo1e (or Myo1c) was translated in a wheat germ extract (Promega), and 20 μl of the in vitro translation reaction was diluted into 180 μl of buffer A (without Triton X-100) and incubated 12–16 h at 4 °C with ∼0.1 mg of MBP-csp or MBP alone. The resins were washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A and suspended in sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Myo1c was detected using the M2 monoclonal antibody (23Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Evidence that Myo1e is expressed in Xenopus oocytes was initially obtained by affinity-purifying antibody against the deduced NH2- or COOH-terminal peptides of Xenopus Myo1e and using these antibodies for immunoblot analysis of oocyte extracts. The data reveal (Fig. 1) that Myo1e is detectable not only in fully grown stage VI oocytes (staged according to Ref. 17Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) but in every stage examined (stage II–VI and eggs). The increased expression of Myo1e in later stage oocytes largely parallels the expression of two other proteins: the Csp (a protein associated principally with the membrane of cortical granules in these cells; see Ref. 14Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the major cargo protein of cortical granules, cortical granule lectin (24Nishihara T. Wyrick R.E. Working P.K. Chen Y.H. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6013-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Chang B.Y. Peavy T.R. Wardip N.J. Hedrick J.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 2004; 137: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, cgl). Concurrently, both Myo1e and Csp are detectably expressed in Xenopus brain, whereas cortical granule lectin is not (Fig. 1). As a counterpoint to the Myo1e results, we observed that even though oocytes contain mRNA for myosins 1d and 1f (3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), they do not detectably express either of these myosins, as judged by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Although type 1 myosins are predominantly globular proteins with no predicted transmembrane segments, their primary structure includes the MyTH1 domain, a region that binds to anionic phospholipids and is important for the association of these proteins with membranes (11Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in determining the relative distribution of Myo1e between cytosolic and membrane compartments in the oocyte. As a first step, we used subcellular fractionation. Previous work (14Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that when oocytes were gently disrupted in an isosmotic solution, both the plasma membrane and cortical granules (along with pigment granules and yolk platelets) sedimented during a low g centrifugation. By subjecting oocytes to this fractionation scheme, we found >90% of the endogenous Myo1e in the low speed supernatant (Fig. 2A). At the same time, all of the detectable β-tubulin was in the low speed supernatant, whereas ∼90% of the csp was in the low speed pellet (Fig. 2). After ultracentrifugation of the low speed supernatant, the Myo1e remained in the high speed supernatant (as did the tubulin; Fig. 2A; we did not probe for csp after the ultracentrifugation). These results indicate that >90% of the Myo1e in oocytes resides in a soluble (cytosolic) compartment, whereas <10% associates with the structures that sediment at low g forces. To extend the subcellular fractionation results, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the distribution of Myo1e in stage VI oocytes. The image in Fig. 2B, panel H, reveals that at low magnification most of the immunoreactive Myo1e is detected in the cortical rim of the oocyte, where it yields a diffuse staining along with scattered brighter puncta. This cortical distribution of Myo1e immunoreactivity is similar to what is observed both for Csp (Fig. 2B, panel D) (14Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and cortical granule lectin (which is detected using fluorescent D. biflorus lectin; Fig. 2B, panel A). At higher magnification (Fig. 2B, panel B), the labeling for cortical granule lectin reveals a prominent band of fluorescence that extends less than 10 μm into the interior of the oocyte and shows greatest intensity close to the plasma membrane. At the same magnification, Csp immunostaining also appears strongest in the region closest to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, panel E). However, in contrast to the lectin signal (Fig. 2B, panel B), the Csp immunostaining extends at least 20 μm beneath the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, panel E). This trend is further accentuated for the Myo1e immunostaining, which appears as a diffuse layer extending ∼50 μm into the oocyte (Fig. 2B, panel I). When visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy, the staining for cortical granule lectin in an en face view reveals a cluster of spherical structures (∼0.5–2 μm diameter) that correspond to cortical granules (Fig. 2B, panel C). In a similar en face view, Csp immunostaining is evident as a ring around many of the cortical granules (Fig. 2B, panels F and G). However, unlike Csp, Myo1e immunostaining does not encapsulate the granules (Fig. 2B, panels J and K). Instead, Myo1e immunofluorescence appears as bright puncta in the cytosolic spaces around the granules (Fig. 2B, panels J and K). Collectively, these results indicate that Myo1e is localized in the vicinity of cortical granules but that it does not significantly associate with these structures in resting oocytes. To investigate whether Myo1e exhibits dynamic behavior during cortical granule exocytosis, we monitored the distribution of eGFP-Myo1e using time-lapse confocal microscopy. In this approach, exocytosis is triggered (by the application of PMA) in the presence of extracellular Texas Red dextran. Following exocytosis, the extracellular dextran diffuses into the lumen of the fused granules, and by focusing in a single optical plane ∼1 μm beneath the plasma membrane, the entry of the dextran produces red fluorescent disks (3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Sokac A.M. Co C. Taunton J. Bement W.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, eGFP-myo1e was detected at the plasma membrane of oocytes prior to the triggering of exocytosis (data not shown), but it was not associated with any other structures in the cortex of the cell (Fig. 3A, 00.00). However, following the induction of cortical granule exocytosis, eGFP-Myo1e prominently encircled the cortical granules that had undergone exocytosis, as judged by the disc of fluorescent red dextran that was present in the same focal plane (Fig. 3A, 01:10). Quantitative analysis revealed that >98% (175 of 178) of the cortical granules that underwent exocytosis had an associated ring of eGFP-Myo1e. This result strongly suggests that Myo1e participates in events that are linked to cortical granule exocytosis or the ensuing compensatory endocytosis. Remarkably, the live imaging also revealed that in the presence of PMA, eGFP-myo1e often localized to circular compartments that lacked dextran but were of the correct dimension and in the proper location to be cortical granules (Fig. 3A, 01:10). The simplest explanation of this observation is that the eGFP-myo1e relocalizes to the surface of cortical granules prior to (or during) exocytosis. Further analysis of time-lapse images confirmed this interpretation. As shown (Fig. 3B and supplemental movie 1), eGFP-myo1e forms annular structures well in advance of the appearance of the disks of red dextran. Quantification of the recruitment time of eGFP-myo1e relative to dextran incorporation revealed that the formation of rings of eGFP-myo1e preceded the appearance of the red dextran by 8.6 ± 0.65 s (mean ± S.E.; n = 178). To ascertain whether Myo1e has a role in cortical granule exocytosis, we first evaluated the impact on this process of overexpression of the IQT region of Myo1e (see schematic in Fig. 4C). This approach relies on the fact that similar deletion constructs exert a dominant negative impact on events mediated by other myosins (3Sokac A.M. Schietroma C. Gundersen C.B. Bement W.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Raposo G. Cordonnier M.N. Tenza D. Menichi B. Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Representative results (Fig. 4A) indicate that cortical granule exocytosis is largely abolished in cells that express the IQT region of Myo1e-IQT (note that the immunoblot signal for Myo1e-IQT exceeds by >10-fold the signal for endogenous Myo1e in these cells; Fig. 4A). Overall, in n = 25 oocytes in which Myo1e-IQT expression exceeded the endogenous level of Myo1e by 12.9 ± 1.2-fold, the mean"
https://openalex.org/W2067851861,"The Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours (ESFT) are small round cell tumours characterized by the non-random EWS–ETS gene rearrangements. We have previously demonstrated that ESFT are highly sensitive to fenretinide-induced death, effected in part through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathway. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the sensitivity of ESFT cells to fenretinide-induced cell death is decreased following downregulation of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-Fli1; siRNA targeting EWS-Fli1 attenuated fenretinide-induced cell death in cell lines expressing EWS-Fli1, but not EWS-ERG. This decrease in cell death was independent of the level of ROS produced following exposure to fenretinide, but was effected through EWS-Fli1-dependent modulation of p38MAPK activity. Furthermore, inhibition of p38MAPK activity and knockdown of EWS-Fli1 reduced fenretinide-induced mitochondrial permeabilization, cytochrome c release, caspase and PARP cleavage, consistent with the hypothesis that p38MAPK is critical for activation of the death cascade by fenretinide in ESFT cells. These data demonstrate that expression of EWS–Fli1 enhances fenretinide-induced cell death in ESFT and that this is effected at least in part through modulation of p38MAPK activity."
https://openalex.org/W2096051275,"The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene has been implicated as an early barrier to the growth and progression of incipient solid tumors. Here, we show that germ-line nullizygosity for the mouse Atm gene significantly increases the proliferative index, net growth rate and multiplicity of intestinal adenomas in two distinct models of familial colon cancer: Apc(Min/+) and Apc(1638N/+). These effects of Atm deficiency are quantitatively different from deficiency for either of the genomic stability genes Bloom's syndrome helicase or DNA ligase 4, and the effect of Atm loss on tumor multiplicity is largely independent of the effect of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the loss of heterozygosity rates at the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) locus are unaffected by Atm loss. Taken together, these data implicate the Atm gene product as a barrier to dysplastic growth in the early stages of intestinal tumor progression, independent of its effects on genomic stability."
