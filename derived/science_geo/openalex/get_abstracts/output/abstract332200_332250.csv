https://openalex.org/W2076745781,"Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) has been identified as the major volatile sulfur compound in 628 samples of surface seawater representing most of the major oceanic ecozones. In at least three respects, its vertical distribution, its local patchiness, and its distribution in oceanic ecozones, the concentration of DMS in the sea exhibits a pattern similar to that of primary production. The global weightedaverage concentration of DMS in surface seawater is 102 nanograms of sulfur (DMS) per liter, corresponding to a global sea-to-air flux of 39 x 10(12) grams of sulfur per year. When the biogenic sulfur contributions from the land surface are added, the biogenic sulfur gas flux is approximately equal to the anthropogenic flux of sulfur dioxide. The DMS concentration in air over the equatorial Pacific varies diurnally between 120 and 200 nanograms of sulfur (DMS) per cubic meter, in agreement with the predictions of photochemical models. The estimated source flux of DMS from the oceans to the marine atmosphere is in agreement with independently obtained estimates of the removal fluxes of DMS and its oxidation products from the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2085693693,"Halimedatrial, a structurally unprecedented diterpenoid trialdehyde, has been identified as the major secondary metabolite in six species of the calcareous reef-building alga Halimeda. In laboratory bioassays, halimedatrial is toxic toward reef fishes, significantly reduces feeding in herbivorous fishes, and has cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. The widespread occurrence of halimedatrial and its potent biological activities suggest that this metabolite represents a chemical defense adaptation in this pantropical marine alga."

The early growth of the ovary in plants treated with gibberellin corresponds closely with growth after pollination and fertilization; the amounts of diffusible auxin are not significantly different over a period of 22 days."
https://openalex.org/W2165466731,"The triplets of nucleotides which apparently specify the detailed structure of proteins fall into a regular pattern: the 64 combinations of four nucleotides taken three at a time, are resolved into 32 pairs. The second member of each pair is identical with the first, except that in one position a purine is replaced by the other purine or a pyrimidine by the other pyrimidine. Almost all of the reported triplets fit into this pattern, and from it one can predict which amino acids will be found to correspond to the remaining 19 unidentified triplets. This pattern accounts for several of the observations concerning regularities in the data, partially determines the order of the nucleotides in each triplet, and suggests a structural basis for transfer RNA specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2040053505,"The resistivity of elemental ytterbium at room temperature rises, by a factor of 11, to a maximum at a pressure of 40 kilobars; a further increase in pressure causes a polymorphic transition; the new phase has a resistivity 80 percent of that of the metal at 1 atmosphere. In the temperature-pressure diagram, the phase boundary has a negative slope. The phase boundary, determined from -190 degrees to 360 degrees C, is a straight line that may be extrapolated nearly to the known alpha-beta transition at 1 atmosphere. Between the transition pressure and 20 kbar, the lowest pressure at which the measurements were made, ytterbium behaved as a semiconductor. The temperature coefficient of resistance is negative; at constant pressure, the resistivity shows the exponential temperature dependence characteristic of a semiconductor. The parameter in the expontial would correspond to an energy gap 0.015 ev at 20 kbar, an increase with pressure to a maximum of 0.080 ev at 37 kbar, and then a decrease to 0.05 ev at 45 kbar."
https://openalex.org/W2067910079,"If crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) are presented with food or threat stimuli, or both, their feeding behavior and escape from threat by tail flips show flexible patterns of interaction. If they are engaged in eating large, relatively immovable pieces of food, escape is inhibited, whereas if small pieces of food are being eaten, the probability of escape is enhanced. If escape occurs during a feeding bout, large pieces of food are usually released, but small ones are not. These observations suggest that the neural circuitry responsible for coordination of behavior in invertebrates may not be as simple as usually assumed."

Yet there are thriving populations belonging to the Rotifera, Nematoda, Tardigrada, and Turbellaria."
https://openalex.org/W1983854926,"N-Dimethylaminomaleamic acid decomposes in aqueous solution by intramolecular reaction of the ciscarboxy group with the substituted carbamyl group. The reaction follows pseudo first-order kinetics and shows a dependence on pH. This compound retards plant growth probably because 1,1-dimethylhydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazinium hydrogen maleate are products of its decomposition. Under similar conditions N-dimethylaminosuccinamic acid was stable."
https://openalex.org/W1984051651,"Engineers and physiologists working together in experimental and theoretical studies predict that the application of system analysis to biological processes will increase understanding of these processes and broaden the base of system theory. Richard W. Jones, professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, and John S. Gray, professor of physiology at Northwestern's Medical School, discuss these developments. Their articles are adapted from addresses delivered in Chicago in November 1962 at the 15th Annual Conference on Engineering in Medicine and Biology."

The possible influence of the frequent use of arsenicals on arthropod populations is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1981715439,"This article discusses the federal government's $2.3 billion a year business enriching uranium for nuclear power plants which is heading toward a major crisis. Due to miscalculations by the Department of Energy, it is caught with billions of dollars of construction in progress just as projected demand for enriched uranium is decreasing. At the center of the controversy is the Gas Centrifuge Plant at Portsmouth, Ohio - estimated to cost $10 billion dollars. A review of how DOE got into this situation and how they plan to solve it is presented."
