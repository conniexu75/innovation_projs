https://openalex.org/W2024424485,"The ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was metabolically engineered to broaden its range of fermentable substrates to include the pentose sugar xylose. Two operons encoding xylose assimilation and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes were constructed and transformed into Z. mobilis in order to generate a strain that grew on xylose and efficiently fermented it to ethanol. Thus, anaerobic fermentation of a pentose sugar to ethanol was achieved through a combination of the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Furthermore, this strain efficiently fermented both glucose and xylose, which is essential for economical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1976840019,"Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) RNA replication in pea cotyledonary tissues was restricted largely to a zone of cells close to the infection front. In situ hybridization probes representing nine genes from two pathways of metabolism failed to detect RNA transcripts within this zone, although transcripts were found in similar amounts in tissues on either side of the zone. Thus, in common with some animal viruses, PSbMV transiently suppresses the expression of host genes. Host protein accumulation was also affected. These observations provide insights into virus-plant interactions and symptom expression."
https://openalex.org/W2014522903,"Theories about the evolution of sex and the effects of inbreeding depend on knowledge of the mutation rate and dominance level of deleterious alleles affecting total fitness. In two species of largely self-fertilizing annual plants, minimal estimates of such mutation rates were found to be 0.24 to 0.87 per sporophyte genome per generation, but confidence intervals exceeded 1.0 in each of the four populations. Dominance levels were near zero in one species and intermediate (0.28 to 0.35) in the other. These results suggest that the detrimental effects of inbreeding are a result of new partially recessive mutations rather than overdominance."

Preliminary analysis indicates that the magnitudes of the fractional differences in the principal moments of inertia of Venus are no larger than 10(-4), given that the effects of gravity-field harmonics higher than the second are negligible. Additional analysis is needed to determine the influence of the higher order harmonics on this bound. Four distinct temperature inversions exist at altitudes of 56, 58, 61, and 63 kilometers. The X-band signal was much more rapidly attenuated than the S-band signal and disappeared completely at 52-kilometer altitude. The nightside ionosphere consists of two layers having a peak density of 10(4) electrons per cubic centimeter at altitudes of 140 and 120 kilometers. The dayside ionosphere has a peak density of 3 X 10(5) electrons per cubic centimeter at an altitude of 145 kilometers. The electron number density observed at higher altitudes was ten times less than that observed by Mariner 5, and no strong evidence for a well-defined plasmapause was found."

Atmospheric flow is symmetrical between north and south hemispheres. The equatorial motions are zonal (east-west) at approxiimnately 100 meters per second, consistent with the previously inferred 4-day retrograde rotation. Angular velocity increases with latitude. The subsolar region, and the region downwind from it, show evidence of large-scale convection that persists in spite of the main zonal motion. Dynamical interaction between the zonal motion and the relatively stationary region of convection is evidenced by bowlike waves."

Results from a preliminary analysis of a limted data set are summarized in this report, which is restricted primarily to Venus encounter. A detached bow shock wave that develops as the super Alfvénic solar wind interacts with the Venusian atmosphere has been observed. However, the unique coincidence of trajectory position and interplanetary field orientation at the time of bow shock crossing led to a very disturbed shock profile with considerably enhanced upstream magnetic fluctuations. At present it is not possible to ascertain the nature and characteristics of the obstacle responsible for deflecting the solar wind flow. Far downstream disturbances associated with the solar wind wake have been observed."

An observed reduction in the flux of electrons with energies greater than 100 electron volts is interpreted as evidence for some direct interaction with the exosphere.

Indiscriminate use of SFE will increase the gap between first-rate and second-rate institutions—first-rate institutions will continue to attract more demanding students, a fact that will be reflected in SFE's, whereas second-rate institutions, in an effort to maintain levels of enrollment, may tend to formulate SFE's that emphasize popularity and mediocrity of education.

Unusually quiet solar conditions and improved instrumentation made it possible to search for much lower fluxes of protons and electrons in similar energy regions as compared to earlier Mariner missions to Venus-that is, lower by a factor of 10(2) for protons and 10(3) for electrons.

The exquisite solid-state structural characterizations of W(CH3)6 and Re(CH3)6 reported recently by Valerie Pfennig and Konrad Seppelt (Reports, [2 Feb., p. 626][2]) challenge our understanding of the forces controlling molecular structures. For metal complexes containing only alkyl or hydride ligands, the existence of structures that appear to violate valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) conventions is particularly intriguing. Application of the simple concept of orbital hybridization, first espoused by Linus Pauling 65 years ago ([1][3]) and recently revised by us ([2][4]), results in (i) the prediction of the observed C 3v -distorted trigonal prismatic geometry for W(CH3)6 and (ii) a robust model for rationalizing the shapes of homoleptic methyl compounds.

Transition metals form covalent, two-electron bonds with hydride and alkyl ligands. For complexes with a valence orbital electron count of 12 or fewer electrons [such as the 12-electron W(CH3)6], we have shown that the hybridization of the metal center can be described as sd n −1, where n is the number of bonds plus lone pairs. Thus, W(CH3)6 exhibits sd5 hybridization at the metal center. The shapes of sd5 hybrids are such that orthogonality of hybrid orbital pairs occurs at angles of 63° and 117°. Four arrangements of the six ligands, two that have C 3v and two that have C 5v point group symmetry, are consistent with these angular preferences. For WH6, ab initio computations suggest that all four of these structures are distinct minima of roughly equivalent energy. One might expect the intermethyl steric effects of W(CH3)6 to favor the most open ( C 3v ) geometry and to distort the bond angles to larger values. Using a valence bond theory-based molecular mechanics method (VALBOND), we computed ([2][4]) a C 3v equilibrium geometry for W(CH3)6 (Fig. [1][1]). This structure exemplifies the essential attributes of the crystallographic structure, despite using only generic, rule-based parameters. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a low energy motion corresponding to movement of the metal atom along the C 3 axis with a maximum of approximately 3.0 kilocalories per mole at the trigonal prismatic D 3h geometry. Our computational results are consistent with the gas-phase electron-diffraction data of Haaland and co-workers ([3][5]), the x-ray crystallographic results of Pfennig and Seppelt, and ab initio results recently communicated to us by M. Kaupp ([4][6]).

Response : It is a pleasant surprise to learn that, with a simple model, the shape of the W(CH3)6 molecule [and also qualitatively that of Re(CH3)6] can be precisely predicted and that a similar model can predict an ab initio result ([1][3]). For skeptics, it may be stressed that these predictions were published ([2][4]) or submitted ([1][3]) before our Science paper appeared and that neither of the two scientists had previous knowledge about our crystallographic work.

I apologize to Landis for overlooking his recent theoretical publication on this subject ([2][4]).

Fink's editorial “Bureaucrats save lives” ([1 Mar., p. 1213][1]) is that, in 1977, National Science Foundation (NSF) administrator Herman Lewis found a way to circumvent the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recombinant DNA guidelines' prohibition on doing certain cloning experiments in yeast. Fink writes that he and his co-workers were able to do the experiments literally years before they would have been able to otherwise, which accelerated research leading to the ultimate development of a much improved, second-generation hepatitis B vaccine (of which I was one of the Food and Drug Administration reviewers).

Other U.S. researchers who lacked a governmental good Samaritan were stymied for years by regressive, unnecessarily restrictive federal regulatory policies, delaying all manner of important research. Using the Lewis anecdote as an example of the exception that proves the rule, Fink could have observed that bad science makes bad policy, and bad policy has real-world impacts.

While scientifically oriented institutions like NIH and NSF may, indeed, have “a legion of gifted public servants who possess invaluable knowledge and experience gained at the forefront of science,” there are precious few at the regulatory agencies, and their policies often reflect it.

Thomas H. Stix et al . take issue with the present course of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) initiative (Letters, 16 Feb., p. 891). ITER is a fusion research facility based on the highly successful “tokamak” approach to plasma confinement, now being designed under an international agreement executed in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States.

ITER seeks to achieve, for the first time ever in controlled fusion research, a self-heated “burning” deuterium-tritium plasma. Plasma burn has been widely endorsed as a critically important and appropriate next step for fusion.

Stix et al . question combining this step with three other “giant steps”: large size, long pulse, and superconducting magnets. The size of the ITER plasma is dictated by the requirement to provide sufficient energy confinement to reach the burning state; this is determined from size-scaling relationships derived from experiments on tokamaks with plasma volumes spanning two orders of magnitude; the largest of these tokamaks already operate at plasma densities and temperatures similar to those expected in ITER. Confinement in a tokamak is determined primarily by the magnitude of the plasma current: ITER's plasma current is about four times larger than that in the Joint European Torus. The step in pulse length is derived from the additional physics requirement to sustain the burn over times long compared with those characteristic of the evolution of plasma profiles. The step from copper to superconducting magnets has been found to be the most practical way of achieving the required pulse lengths. Superconducting magnets have already been used in tokamaks, including one of the size of Princeton's successful Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor. The long pulse and the superconducting magnets are also essential for ITER to advance fusion engineering objectives. The engineering features of ITER are generic to any fusion reactor; in ITER, they can be tested together in an integrated facility, made possible only by international partnership.

Stix et al . also question the capability of the ITER design to achieve its stated technical objectives. Recognizing the need for broad technical consensus, a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed which, on a continuing basis, reports to the ruling ITER Council on the adequacy of the ITER design and its physics basis. The TAC's 16 members are drawn equally from all four partners, but they serve as individuals, independent of both the design team and their respective governmental agencies. Last July, the TAC completed a review of the “Interim Design” and, with unanimity, concluded that the design can fully meet ITER's mission and technical objectives.

# {#article-title-2}

The letters from Stix et al ., Ernesto Mazzucato, and William E. Parkins (16 Feb., p. 891) have two common themes, namely, that we should postpone or even cancel the ITER project and that we do not know how to make an attractive fusion reactor.

Stix et al . and Mazzucato correctly note the tremendous progress that has been made in fusion research and that we are in a period where our expectations of continued progress are high. This is used as an argument to suggest that a commitment to the construction of ITER be postponed. I would argue just the opposite. We need to build on our excellent progress and take advantage of the unique opportunity offered by participation in ITER to move forward with fusion science and energy development. Projects like ITER are always faced with the idealistic argument that we should wait for better results. Such logic would have postponed most major undertakings that have lead to significant scientific and technological progress.

The letters raise valid technical issues (including improved plasma confinement, control of disruptions, and engineering and materials development). These issues have been clearly recognized by fusion researchers, in general, and ITER, in particular. They are being responsibly addressed in the ITER research and development and base program activities.

I studied calculus for an entire year in college, but without really understanding it. Proving all the theorems constituted a considerable portion of the course, but I memorized the proofs. I felt then and feel now that proofs are irrelevant to the great majority of us who use calculus as a tool. In using it in physical chemistry class, I suddenly experienced an epiphany. The entire topic of calculus became clear in the course of understanding partial derivatives of thermodynamic functions; and in that one second, I learned more than I had ever learned in an entire year of calculus. If calculus were taught as a useful tool rather than as a theoretical discipline, I believe more students would learn it, understand it, and enjoy it. I have taken this same approach to my own teaching, particularly of enzyme kinetics. I find that the traditional way of teaching theory first reaches maybe 10% of students, while teaching the methodology first and then teaching the theory reaches 80 to 90% of students.

I encourage the reformers to continue, particularly in eliminating irrelevant proofs.
