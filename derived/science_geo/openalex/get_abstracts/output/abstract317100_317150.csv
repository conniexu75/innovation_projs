https://openalex.org/W2048081857,"Extensive chemical, spectrophotometric, and x-ray structural studies have shown that trivalent rhenium is strongly homophilic-that is, it tends to form bonds to other Re(111) atoms-and it forms at least three different series of [ReX(4)](n)(n-) complexes. The mononuclear, square complex, [ReBr(4)](-), adds two water molecules to give trans-[ReBr(4)(H(2)O)(2)](-). The binuclear complexes [Re(2)Cl(8)](2-) and [Re(2)Br(8)](2-) have strong Re-Re bonds, unsupported by halide bridges. The trinuclear species, [Re(3)X(12)](3-) or Re(3)X(9)L(3), contain the triangular Re(3)X(9) clusters. Use of ReCI(3) appears always to lead directly to products containing Re(3)Cl(9); this unit exists in ReCl(3) itself and does not appear to be kinetically labile. The [Re(2)X(8)](2-) ions are obtained by reduction of ReO(4)(-) in aqueous HCl or HBr. Salts of [ReBr(4)(H(2)O)(2)](-) can be obtained directly from solutions of ReBr(3) in HBr along with numerous other compounds, some containing trinuclear clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2035311134,Hydrographic observations and measurements of the concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have suggested that the formation of Greenland Sea Deep Water (GSDW) slowed down considerably during the 1980s. Such a decrease is related to weakened convection in the Greenland Sea and thus could have significant impact on the properties of the waters flowing over the Scotland-Iceland-Greenland ridge system into the deep Atlantic. Study of the variability of GSDW formation is relevant for understanding the impact of the circulation in the European Polar seas on regional and global deep water characteristics. New long-term multitracer observations from the Greenland Sea show that GSDW formation indeed was greatly reduced during the 1980s. A box model of deepwater formation and exchange in the European Polar seas tuned by the tracer data indicates that the reduction rate of GSDW formation was about 80 percent and that the start date of the reduction was between 1978 and 1982.

Polynuclear A1 species are more toxic than mononuclear species, but they have not been considered to be significant in the environment. Aluminum-27 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of forested spodosol soil horizon samples show the presence of polynuclear A1O(4)A1(12)(OH)(24)(H(2)O)(12)(7+). The AlO(4)A1(12)(OH)(24)(H(2)O)(12)(7+) species accounted for 30 percent of the aqueous A1 observable by NMR, and this could make a significant contribution to the toxicity of the A1 in these soils."

The source of the one or more earthquakes responsible was almost certainly in or near the Wabash Valley. The largest event is interpreted to have occurred between 7500 and 1500 years ago on the basis of archeological, pedological, and stratigraphic relations."
https://openalex.org/W2047922715,"Climate models with enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations have projected temperature increases of 2 degrees to 4 degrees C, winter precipitation increases of up to 15 percent, and summer precipitation decreases of 5 to 10 percent in the central United States by the year 2030. An analysis of the climate record over the past 95 years for this region was undertaken in order to evaluate these projections. Results indicate that temperature has increased and precipitation decreased both during winter and summer, and that the ratio of winter-to-summer precipitation has decreased. The signs of some trends are consistent with the projections whereas others are not, but none of the changes is statistically significant except for maximum and minimum temperatures, which were not among the parameters predicted by the models. Statistical models indicate that the greenhouse winter and summer precipitation signal could have been masked by natural climate variability, whereas the increase in the ratio of winter-to-summer precipitation and the higher rates of temperature change probably should have already been detected. If the models are correct it will likely take at least another 40 years before statistically significant precipitation changes are detected and another decade or two to detect the projected changes of temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2083987859,"Electromagnetic phenomena occurring in the strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are currently of great interest in high-energy astrophysics. Observations of rotation rate changes and cyclotron lines in pulsars and γ-ray bursts indicate that surface magnetic fields of neutron stars often exceed 1012 gauss. In fields this strong, where electrons behave much as if they were in bound atomic states, familiar processes undergo profound changes, and exotic processes become important. Strong magnetic fields affect the physics in several fundamental ways: Energies perpendicular to the field are quantized, transverse momentum is not conserved, and electron-positron spin is important. Neutron stars therefore provide a unique laboratory for the study of physics in extremely high fields that cannot be generated on Earth."

The Rayleigh ratios of benzene, carbon tetrachloride, and normal octane are exactly those predicted from published data for ratios at shorter wavelengths and from the inverse fourth power of wavelength dependence of scattering."
https://openalex.org/W1984519052,"The problems that arise in global temperature caused by the greenhouse gases are very troublesome for all of the 21 American water-resource regions. Five warning signals of vulnerability of water supplies to climate changes are the ratio of consumption and storage to supply, the ratio of vulnerability to runoff, dependence on hydroelectric power, and overdrawing of ground water. The leverage of climate upon future water resources is generally known, but the lack of the needed predictions of climate at hand or in the very near future frustrates the determination of future water resources. It is predicted that 10 to 50 years will pass before a concensus is reached about predictions of regional precipitation and runoff, and this lack of imminent prediction of water supplies (related to climate changes) necessitates the immediate need for coping with present variability to prepare for climate changes. Conservation and diversification also constitute practical precautions for water shortages. Thus the need for more accurate forecasting for a single season is of paramount importance."
