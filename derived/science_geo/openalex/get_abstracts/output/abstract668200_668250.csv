https://openalex.org/W3126546961,"All coronaviruses known to have recently emerged as human pathogens probably originated in bats1. Here we use a single experimental platform based on immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue (hereafter, human lung-only mice (LoM)) to demonstrate the efficient in vivo replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as two endogenous SARS-like bat coronaviruses that show potential for emergence as human pathogens. Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats contain endogenous coronaviruses that are capable of direct transmission to humans. Our detailed analysis of in vivo infection with SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue from LoM showed a predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type-2 pneumocytes that are present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a therapeutic and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that therapeutic and prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801—an oral broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is currently in phase II/III clinical trials—markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, and thus has considerable potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Human and bat coronaviruses replicate efficiently in immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue, and treatment or prophylaxis using EIDD-2801 in this model suggests that this oral antiviral agent may be effective in preventing COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3128040373,"Correlational evidence in humans suggests that selective difficulties hearing in noisy, social settings may reflect premature auditory nerve degeneration. Here, we induced primary cochlear neural degeneration (CND) in adult mice and found direct behavioral evidence for selective detection deficits in background noise. To identify central determinants for this perceptual disorder, we tracked daily changes in ensembles of layer 2/3 auditory cortex parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons with chronic two-photon calcium imaging. CND induced distinct forms of plasticity in cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons that culminated in net hyperactivity, increased neural gain, and reduced adaptation to background noise. Ensemble activity measured while mice detected targets in noise could accurately decode whether individual behavioral trials were hits or misses. After CND, random surges of hypercorrelated cortical activity occurring just before target onset reliably predicted impending detection failures, revealing a source of internal cortical noise underlying perceptual difficulties in external noise."

It is becoming difficult to select a suitable robot for specific applications and requirements due to the availability of several types with different specifications of robots in the market. Best-worst method is a useful, highly consistent and reliable method to derive weights of criteria and it is worthy to integrate it with the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method that is more applicable and needs fewer number of calculations as compared to other methods. An example is presented to show the validity and usability of the proposed methodology. Comparison of ranking results matches with the well-known distance-based approach, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) methods showing the robustness of the best-worst EDAS hybrid method. Sensitivity analysis performed using eighty to one ratio shows that the proposed hybrid MCDM methodology is more stable and reliable."
https://openalex.org/W3128911698,"According to the ‘novel weapons hypothesis’, invasive success depends on harmful plant biochemicals, including allelopathic antimicrobial roots exudate that directly inhibit plant growth and soil microbial activity. However, the combination of direct and soil-mediated impacts of invasive plants via allelopathy remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed the allelopathic effects of an invasive plant species ( Rhus typhina ) on a cultivated plant ( Tagetes erecta ), soil properties and microbial communities. We grew T . erecta on soil samples at increasing concentrations of R . typhina root extracts and measured both plant growth and soil physiological profile with community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) using Biolog Eco-plates incubation. We found that R . typhina root extracts inhibit both plant growth and soil microbial activity. Plant height, Root length, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and AWCD were significantly decreased with increasing root extract concentration, and plant above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and total biomass (TB) were significantly decreased at 10 mg·mL -1 of root extracts. In particular, root extracts significantly reduced the carbon source utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers, but enhanced phenolic acid. Redundancy analysis shows that soil pH, TN, SOC and EC were the major driving factors of soil microbial activity. Our results indicate that strong allelopathic impact of root extracts on plant growth and soil microbial activity by mimicking roots exudate, providing novel insights into the role of plant–soil microbe interactions in mediating invasion success."
https://openalex.org/W3128559822,"Introduction Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The prevalence of dyslipidemia is not known among Ethiopian adults. The prevalence is expected to rise due to the socio-economic development accompanied by lifestyle changes. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of dyslipidemia and associated risk factors among adult residents of Mekelle City. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 321 randomly selected subjects. Data were collected on sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the participants using the WHO STEPS survey instrument. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24.0. Student’s t-test and Pearson’s Chi-square test were used to assessing the interrelationship between each factor and outcome variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify risk factors associated with dyslipidemia. All statistical significance was considered at p ≤0.05. Results The prevalence of dyslipidemia in this study was 66.7%. The prevalence of high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglyceride, elevated total cholesterol, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 49.5%, 40.2%, 30.8%, and 16.5%, respectively. Being above 64 years (aOR: 2.196, 95% CI: 1.183–4.078) and 40–64 years old (aOR: 2.196, 95% CI: 1.183–4.078), overweight (aOR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.314–4.756) and obesity (aOR: 15.489, 95% CI: 3.525–68.070), walking &lt;150 minutes per week (aOR: 1.722, 95% CI: 1.004–2.953), raised fasting blood glucose (FBG) (aOR: 4.804, 95% CI: 1.925–11.988), and medium socio-economic status (aOR: 2.017, 95% CI: 1.044–3.899) were identified as significant predictors of dyslipidemia. Conclusions The finding of this study indicated that the prevalence of dyslipidemia is unacceptably high among adult residents of Mekelle City, which underlines an urgent need for early detection and public health interventions through the integrated involvement of public, governmental, and non-governmental organizations."
https://openalex.org/W3126399116,"DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes, and altered DNA methylation pattern is a general hallmark of cancer. However, DNA methylome in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is still a mystery due to the lack of proper analytical techniques. We introduced an efficient workflow, LCM-µWGBS, which can efficiently profile the DNA methylation of microdissected CTC samples. LCM-µWGBS combines the laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based CTC capture method and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in very small CTC population (µWGBS) to gain insight into the DNA methylation landscape of CTCs. We herein profiled the DNA methylome of CTCs from lung cancer patients. Deriving from a comprehensive analysis of CTC methylome, a unique ""CTC DNA methylation signature"" that is distinct from primary lung cancer tissues was identified. Further analysis showed that promoter hypermethylation of epithelial genes is a hallmark of stable epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Moreover, it has been suggested that CTCs are endowed with a stemness-related feature during dissemination and metastasis. This work constitutes a unique DNA methylation analysis of CTCs at single base-pair resolution, which might facilitate to propose noninvasive CTC DNA methylation biomarkers contributing to clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3128179650,"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play pivotal roles in tissue maintenance and regeneration. Their origins, however, remain incompletely understood. Here we identify rare LNGFR+ cells in human fetal and regenerative bone marrow that co-express endothelial and stromal markers. This endothelial subpopulation displays transcriptional reprogramming consistent with endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and can generate multipotent stromal cells that reconstitute the bone marrow (BM) niche upon transplantation. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing in mice confirm robust and sustained contributions of EndoMT to bone precursor and hematopoietic niche pools. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is overexpressed in subsets of EndoMT cells and drives this conversion process through ST2 receptor signaling. These data reveal generation of tissue-forming BMSCs from mouse and human endothelial cells and may be instructive for approaches to human tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3129160532,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a key component of many scientific literature mining tasks, such as information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering; however, many modern approaches require large amounts of labeled training data in order to be effective. This severely limits the effectiveness of NER models in applications where expert annotations are difficult and expensive to obtain. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of transfer learning and semi-supervised self-training to improve the performance of NER models in biomedical settings with very limited labeled data (250-2000 labeled samples). We first pre-train a BiLSTM-CRF and a BERT model on a very large general biomedical NER corpus such as MedMentions or Semantic Medline, and then we fine-tune the model on a more specific target NER task that has very limited training data; finally, we apply semi-supervised self-training using unlabeled data to further boost model performance. We show that in NER tasks that focus on common biomedical entity types such as those in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), combining transfer learning with self-training enables a NER model such as a BiLSTM-CRF or BERT to obtain similar performance with the same model trained on 3x-8x the amount of labeled data. We further show that our approach can also boost performance in a low-resource application where entities types are more rare and not specifically covered in UMLS."
https://openalex.org/W3127723980,"Background During the catastrophic situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of the health care workers (HCWs) is the most crucial, and their absenteeism, whether due to inability or unwillingness, becomes a major concern for the national health system. Hence, the present study aimed to determine the willingness and its associated factors to work during the COVID-19 pandemic among the physicians of Bangladesh. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April 21 to May 10, 2020, using an online survey among the Bangladeshi physicians living in the country. Both univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of the willingness of the physicians to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results More than 69% physicians reported that they were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.9% reported that they were not willing, while 21.4% of participants were not sure about their willingness. Younger age, having experience of treating patients during previous pandemics, working in the emergency departments and high self-reported compliance to the recommended PPE were important predictors of being willing to work during COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for family and risk of transmitting the infection to family members were most commonly reported as major barriers of working during the pandemic (30%) followed by having comorbidities (25%), lack of adequate safety measures (25%), fear of being infected (12.2%), not involved in clinical practice (12.5%) etc. Conclusions Though the majority of the physicians were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, sufficient supply of PPE, support to maintain recommended quarantine and isolation policy after risky hospital duty along with adequate and effective training can increase their willingness to continue their sacred duty during this crucial pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3128385595,"Aneuploidy is a hallmark of genomic instability that leads to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. CDC20, Bub1, and Bub3 form the mitosis checkpoint complex (MCC) that binds the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial factor of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), to ensure the bi-directional attachment and proper segregation of all sister chromosomes. However, just how MCC is regulated to ensure normal mitosis during cellular division remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that LNC CRYBG3, an ionizing radiation-inducible long noncoding RNA, directly binds with Bub3 and interrupts its interaction with CDC20 to result in aneuploidy. The 261-317 (S3) residual of the LNC CRYBG3 sequence is critical for its interaction with Bub3 protein. Overexpression of LNC CRYBG3 leads to aneuploidy and promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung cancer cells, implying that LNC CRYBG3 is a novel oncogene. These findings provide a novel mechanistic basis for the pathogenesis of NSCLC after exposure to ionizing radiation as well as a potential target for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of an often fatal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3128635199,"Fluid milk and its derivatives are important dietary ingredients that contribute to daily nutrient intake of the modern Homo sapiens. To produce milk that is healthier for human consumption, the present study evaluated the effect of adding soybean oil and linseed oil in the diet of lactating cows. The fatty acid profile of milk, milk composition, and the blood parameters of cows were evaluated. Eighteen Holstein cows were distributed in a replicated Latin square design and distributed according to the following treatments: 1) Control (CC): traditional dairy cow diet, without addition of oil; 2) Soybean oil (SO): 2.5% addition of soybean oil to the traditional diet, as a source of omega-6; 3) Linseed oil (LO): 2.5% addition of linseed oil in the diet as a source of omega-3. Milk production was not affected, but oil supplementation decreased feed intake by 1.93 kg/cow/day. The milk fat percentage was significantly lower when cows were supplemented with vegetable oil (3.37, 2.75 and 2.89% for CC, SO and LO, respectively). However, both soybean and linseed oils decreased the concentration of saturated fatty acids (66.89, 56.52 and 56.60 g/100g for CC, SO and LO respectively), increased the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in milk (33.05, 43.39, and 43.35 g/100g for CC, SO and LO respectively) and decreased the ratio between saturated/unsaturated fatty acids (2.12, 1.34, and 1.36 for CC, SO and LO respectively). Furthermore, SO and LO increased significantly the concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids (29.58, 39.55 and 39.47 g/100g for CC, SO and LO respectively), though it did not significantly alter the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat (3.57, 3.93 and 3.98 g/100g for CC, SO and LO respectively). Supplementation with LO enhanced the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids on milk (0.32, 0.36, and 1.02 for CC, SO and LO respectively). Blood variables aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, urea, albumin, creatinine and total proteins were not altered. On the other hand, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL were greater in the group supplemented with vegetable oils. Supplementation with vegetable oils reduced the dry matter intake of cows, the fat content of milk, and improved saturated/unsaturated fatty acid ratio of milk fat. Compared to the SO treatment, animals fed LO produced milk with greater content of omega-3, and a more desirable omega-6/omega-3 ratio on a human nutrition perspective. Thus, the inclusion of SO and LO in the diet of lactating dairy cows makes the milk fatty acid profile nutritionally healthier for the human consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3127060800,"Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a fundamental parameter for hydrological studies and irrigation management. The Penman-Monteith method is the standard to estimate ETo and requires several meteorological elements. In developing countries, the number of weather stations is insufficient. Thus, free products of remote sensing with evapotranspiration information must be used for this purpose. In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate monthly ETo from potential evapotranspiration (PET) made available by MOD16 product. In this study, the monthly ETo estimated by Penman-Monteith method was considered as the standard. For this, data from 265 weather station of the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), spread all over the Brazilian territory, were acquired for the period from 2000 to 2014 (15 years). For these months, monthly PET values from MOD16 product for all Brazil were also downloaded. By using machine learning algorithms and information from WorldClim as covariates, ETo was estimated through images from the MOD16 product. To perform the modeling of ETo, eight regression algorithms were tested: multiple linear regression; random forest; cubist; partial least squares; principal components regression; adaptive forward-backward greedy; generalized boosted regression and generalized linear model by likelihood-based boosting. Data from 2000 to 2012 (13 years) were used for training and data of 2013 and 2014 (2 years) were used to test the models. The PET made available by the MOD16 product showed higher values than those of ETo for different periods and climatic regions of Brazil. However, the MOD16 product showed good correlation with ETo, indicating that it can be used in ETo estimation. All models of machine learning were effective in improving the performance of the metrics evaluated. Cubist was the model that presented the best metrics for r 2 (0.91), NSE (0.90) and nRMSE (8.54%) and should be preferred for ETo prediction. MOD16 product is recommended to be used to predict monthly ETo, which opens possibilities for its use in several other studies."
https://openalex.org/W3128095403,"Visual working memory (WM) storage is largely independent between the left and right visual hemifields/cerebral hemispheres, yet somehow WM feels seamless. We studied how WM is integrated across hemifields by recording neural activity bilaterally from lateral prefrontal cortex. An instructed saccade during the WM delay shifted the remembered location from one hemifield to the other. Before the shift, spike rates and oscillatory power showed clear signatures of memory laterality. After the shift, the lateralization inverted, consistent with transfer of the memory trace from one hemisphere to the other. Transferred traces initially used different neural ensembles from feedforward-induced ones, but they converged at the end of the delay. Around the time of transfer, synchrony between the two prefrontal hemispheres peaked in theta and beta frequencies, with a directionality consistent with memory trace transfer. This illustrates how dynamics between the two cortical hemispheres can stitch together WM traces across visual hemifields."
https://openalex.org/W3127917475,"Objective Mercury and other toxic metals have been suggested to be involved in thyroid disorders, but the distribution and prevalence of mercury in the human thyroid gland is not known. We therefore used two elemental bio-imaging techniques to look at the distribution of mercury and other toxic metals in the thyroid glands of people over a wide range of ages. Materials and methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue blocks were obtained from 115 people aged 1–104 years old, with varied clinicopathological conditions, who had thyroid samples removed during forensic/coronial autopsies. Seven-micron sections from these tissue blocks were used to detect intracellular inorganic mercury using autometallography. The presence of mercury was confirmed using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry which can detect multiple elements. Results Mercury was found on autometallography in the thyroid follicular cells of 4% of people aged 1–29 years, 9% aged 30–59 years, and 38% aged 60–104 years. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of mercury in samples staining with autometallography, and detected cadmium, lead, iron, nickel and silver in selected samples. Conclusions The proportion of people with mercury in their thyroid follicular cells increases with age, until it is present in over one-third of people aged 60 years and over. Other toxic metals in thyroid cells could enhance mercury toxicity. Mercury can trigger genotoxicity, autoimmune reactions, and oxidative damage, which raises the possibility that mercury could play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancers, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W3039588869,"Modeling and simulating movement of vehicles in established transportation infrastructures, especially in large urban road networks is an important task. It helps with understanding and handling traffic problems, optimizing traffic regulations and adapting the traffic management in real time for unexpected disaster events. A mathematically rigorous stochastic model that can be used for traffic analysis was proposed earlier by other researchers which is based on an interplay between graph and Markov chain theories. This model provides a transition probability matrix which describes the traffic's dynamic with its unique stationary distribution of the vehicles on the road network. In this paper, a new parametrization is presented for this model by introducing the concept of two-dimensional stationary distribution which can handle the traffic's dynamic together with the vehicles' distribution. In addition, the weighted least squares estimation method is applied for estimating this new parameter matrix using trajectory data. In a case study, we apply our method on the Taxi Trajectory Prediction dataset and road network data from the OpenStreetMap project, both available publicly. To test our approach, we have implemented the proposed model in software. We have run simulations in medium and large scales and both the model and estimation procedure, based on artificial and real datasets, have been proved satisfactory. In a real application, we have unfolded a stationary distribution on the map graph of Porto, based on the dataset. The approach described here combines techniques whose use together to analyze traffic on large road networks has not previously been reported."
https://openalex.org/W3127607770,"Microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a biological process inducing biomineralization of CaCO 3 . This can be used to form a solid, concrete-like material. To be able to use MICP successfully to produce solid materials, it is important to understand the formation process of the material in detail. It is well known that crystallization surfaces can influence the precipitation process. Therefore, we present in this contribution a systematic study investigating the influence of calcite seeds on the MICP process. We focus on the changes in the pH and changes of the optical density (OD) signal measured with absorption spectroscopy to analyze the precipitation process. Furthermore, optical microscopy was used to visualize the precipitation processes in the sample and connect them to changes in the pH and OD. We show, that there is a significant difference in the pH evolution between samples with and without calcite seeds present and that the shape of the pH evolution and the changes in OD can give detailed information about the mineral precipitation and transformations. In the presented experiments we show, that amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) can also precipitate in the presence of initial calcite seeds and this can have implications for consolidated MICP materials."
https://openalex.org/W3128592400,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial communication process mediated by both native and non-native small-molecule quorum sensing modulators (QSMs), many of which have been synthesized to disrupt QS pathways. While structure-activity relationships have been developed to relate QSM structure to the activation or inhibition of QS receptors, less is known about the transport mechanisms that enable QSMs to cross the lipid membrane and access intracellular receptors. In this study, we used atomistic MD simulations and an implicit solvent model, called COSMOmic, to analyze the partitioning and translocation of QSMs across lipid bilayers. We performed umbrella sampling at atomistic resolution to calculate partitioning and translocation free energies for a set of naturally occurring QSMs, then used COSMOmic to screen the water-membrane partition and translocation free energies for 50 native and non-native QSMs that target LasR, one of the LuxR family of quorum-sensing receptors. This screening procedure revealed the influence of systematic changes to head and tail group structures on membrane partitioning and translocation free energies at a significantly reduced computational cost compared to atomistic MD simulations. Comparisons with previously determined QSM activities suggest that QSMs that are least likely to partition into the bilayer are also less active. This work thus demonstrates the ability of the computational protocol to interrogate QSM-bilayer interactions which may help guide the design of new QSMs with engineered membrane interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3127064799,"Reduced peak expiratory flow is a common physiological change in older individuals and age is an important predictor for sarcopenia. We analyzed nationwide survey data to determine the relationship between peak expiratory flow rate and sarcopenia in older Indonesians. Community-dwelling Indonesian individuals aged ≥60 years (n = 2422; mean age = 67.21 y) from the fifth-wave data of the Indonesian Family Life Survey was selected. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on handgrip strength, gait speed, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass measurements. Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) were categorized according to their percentage of predicted flow rates as &lt;50%, 50% to 80%, and &gt;80%. Confounders previously determined to be associated with sarcopenia occurrence were included. Sarcopenia prevalence was 50.25%. After adjustment for confounders, PEFRs of &lt;50% and 50% to 80% were associated with an increased sarcopenia risk (odds ratio = 5.22 and 1.88, respectively) compared with PEFRs of &gt;80%. Poor lung function was independently associated with sarcopenia occurrence. Future studies should explore the usefulness of PEFR as a risk factor of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W3127213567,"In this work, molecular diversity of two hypersaline microbial mats was compared by Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing of environmental DNA from the mats. Brava and Tebenquiche are lakes in the Salar de Atacama, Chile, where microbial communities are growing in extreme conditions, including high salinity, high solar irradiance, and high levels of toxic metals and metaloids. Evaporation creates hypersaline conditions in these lakes and mineral precipitation is a characteristic geomicrobiological feature of these benthic ecosystems. The mat from Brava was more rich and diverse, with a higher number of different taxa and with species more evenly distributed. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant, including ~75% of total sequences. At the genus level, the most abundant sequences were affilitated to anoxygenic phototropic and cyanobacterial genera. In Tebenquiche mats, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes covered ~70% of the sequences, and 13% of the sequences were affiliated to Salinibacter genus, thus addressing the lower diversity. Regardless of the differences at the taxonomic level, functionally the two mats were similar. Thus, similar roles could be fulfilled by different organisms. Carbon fixation through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway was well represented in these datasets, and also in other mats from Andean lakes. In spite of presenting less taxonomic diversity, Tebenquiche mats showed increased abundance and variety of rhodopsin genes. Comparison with other metagenomes allowed identifying xantorhodopsins as hallmark genes not only from Brava and Tebenquiche mats, but also for other mats developing at high altitudes in similar environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3128963661,"Cellulose fibers (C 40 and C 80 ) were extracted from khat ( Catha edulis ) waste (KW) with chlorine-free process using 40% formic acid/40% acetic acid (C 40 ), and 80% formic acid/80% acetic acid (C 80 ) at the pretreatment stage, followed by further delignification and bleaching stages. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs 40 and CNCs 80 ) were then isolated from C 40 and C 80 with sulfuric acid hydrolysis, respectively. Thus, the current study aims to isolate cellulose fibers and CNCs from KW as alternative source. The KW, cellulose fibers, and CNCs were investigated for yield, chemical composition, functionality, crystallinity, morphology, and thermal stability. CNCs were also evaluated for colloidal stability, particle size, and their influence on in vitro diclofenac sodium release from gel formulations preliminarily. The FTIR spectra analysis showed the removal of most hemicellulose and lignin from the cellulose fibers. The XRD results indicated that chemical pretreatments and acid hydrolysis significantly increased the crystallinity of cellulose fibers and CNCs. The cellulose fibers and CNCs exhibited Cellulose I β crystalline lattice. TEM analysis revealed formation of needle-shaped nanoscale rods (length: 101.55–162.96 nm; aspect ratio: 12.84–22.73). The hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of the CNC S ranged from 222.8–362.8 nm; 0.297–0.461, and -45.7 to -75.3 mV, respectively. CNCs 40 exhibited superior properties to CNCs 80 in terms of aspect ratio, and colloidal and thermal stability. Gel formulations containing high proportion of CNCs sustained diclofenac sodium release (&lt; 50%/cm 2 ) over 12 h. This study suggests that cellulose fibers and nanocrystals can be successfully obtained from abundant and unexploited source, KW for value-added industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W3128008260,"Large-scale atmospheric conditions in the Northeast Pacific Ocean affect both the freshwater environment in the Columbia River Basin and marine conditions along the coasts of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, resulting in correlated conditions in the two environments. For migrating species, such as salmonids that move through multiple habitats, these correlations can amplify the impact of good or poor physical conditions on growth and survival, as movements among habitats may not alleviate effects of anomalous conditions. Unfortunately, identifying the mechanistic drivers of salmon survival in space and time is hindered by these cross-habitat correlations. To address this issue, we modeled the marine survival of Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon with multiple indices of the marine environment and an explicit treatment of the effect of arrival timing from freshwater to the ocean, and found that both habitats contribute to marine survival rates. We show how this particular carryover effect of freshwater conditions on marine survival varies by year and rearing type (hatchery or wild), with a larger effect for wild fish. As environmental conditions change, incorporating effects from both freshwater and marine habitats into salmon survival models will become more important, and has the additional benefit of highlighting how management actions that affect arrival timing may improve marine survival."
https://openalex.org/W3128610319,"Abstract Cutaneous melanoma tumors are heterogeneous and show diverse responses to treatment. Identification of robust molecular biomarkers for classifying melanoma tumors into clinically distinct and homogenous subtypes is crucial for improving the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In this study, we present a classification of melanoma tumors into four subtypes with different survival profiles based on three distinct gene expression signatures: keratin, immune, and melanogenesis. The melanogenesis expression pattern includes several genes that are characteristic of the melanosome organelle and correlates with worse survival, suggesting the involvement of melanosomes in melanoma aggression. We experimentally validated the secretion of melanosomes into surrounding tissues by melanoma tumors, which potentially affects the lethality of metastasis. We propose a simple molecular decision tree classifier for predicting a tumor’s subtype based on representative genes from the three identified signatures. Key predictor genes were experimentally validated on melanoma samples taken from patients with varying survival outcomes. Our three-pattern approach for classifying melanoma tumors can contribute to advancing the understanding of melanoma variability and promote accurate diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3126743268,"In recent years, Sporosarcina pasteurii (S . pasteurii) has become one of the most popular bacteria in microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Various applications have been developed based on the efficient urease that can induce the precipitation of calcium carbonate. However, the metabolic mechanism related to biomineralization of S . pasteurii has not been clearly elucidated. The process of bacterial culture and biomineralization consumes a large amount of urea or ammonium salts, which are usually used as agricultural fertilizers, not to mention probable environmental pollutions caused by the excessive use of these raw materials. Therefore, it is urgent to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen utilization and metabolism of S . pasteurii . In this paper, we compared the growth and gene expression of S . pasteurii under three different culture conditions through transcriptome analyses. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that both ammonium and urea were direct nitrogen sources of S . pasteurii , and the bacteria could not grow normally in the absence of ammonium or urea. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to reveal the nitrogen utilization mechanism of S . pasteurii through transcriptome methods. Furthermore, the presence of ammonium might promote the synthesis of intracellular ATP and enhance the motility of the bacteria. There should be an ATP synthesis mechanism associated with urea hydrolysis catalyzed by urease in S . pasteurii ."

Both malnutrition and LBW affect early childhood development with long term consequences that may vary in their degree depending on the geographical setting. This study evaluates growth, nutritional status and mortality of infants from Lambaréné and Fougamou in Gabon from a birth cohort of a malaria in pregnancy clinical trial (NCT00811421). Method A prospective longitudinal birth cohort conducted between 2009 and 2012, included infants that were followed up from birth until their first-year anniversary. The exposure of interest was low birth weight and the outcomes explored were growth represented by weight gain, the nutritional status including stunting, wasting and underweight, and the mortality. Scheduled follow-up visits were at one, nine and 12 months of age. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between low birth weight and growth and nutritional outcomes, and cox regression was used for mortality. Result A total of 907 live-born infants were included in the analysis. The prevalence of LBW was 13% (115). At one month of life, out of 743 infants 10% and 4% presented with stunting and underweight, respectively, while these proportions increased at 12 months of life to 17% and 21%, respectively, out of 530 infants. The proportion of infants with wasting remained constant at 7% throughout the follow-up period. Stunting and underweight were associated with LBW, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.6, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.4–4.9 and aOR: 4.5, 95%CI: 2.5–8.1, respectively. Preterm birth was associated with stunting, aOR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.2–6.3 and underweight, aOR: 5.4, 95%CI: 1.7–16.1 at one month of life. Infants with LBW were at higher hazard of death during the first year of life, adjusted hazard ratio 4.6, 95%CI: 1.2–17.0. Conclusion Low birthweight infants in Gabon are at higher risks of growth and nutritional deficits and mortality during the first year of life. Tailored interventions aiming at preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes including LBW, early detection and appropriate management of growth, and nutritional deficits in infants are necessary in Gabon."

Physical activity is essential in the management of both diseases, necessitating targeted interventions in these groups. This study analysed physical inactivity (defined as not taking part in leisure-time physical activity) in over 100,000 adults in Germany considering their body mass index and the presence of diabetes. Furthermore, the relationship between specific socio-demographic factors with physical inactivity was investigated, particularly focussing diabetic and obese people, to refine the identification of risk-groups for targeted interventions on physical activity promotion. Methods Data from 13 population-based health surveys conducted in Germany from 1997 to 2018 were used. The relevant variables extracted from these datasets were merged and employed in the analyses. We included data from 129,886 individuals in the BMI analyses and 58,311 individuals in the diabetes analyses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the importance of six socio-demographic variables (age, sex/gender, education, income, employment, and migration) for the risk of physical inactivity. Results Obese and diabetic people reported a higher prevalence of physical inactivity than those who were not affected. Logistic regression analyses revealed advanced age, low education level, and low household income as risk factors for physical inactivity in all groups. A two-sided migration background and unemployment also indicated a higher probability of physical inactivity. Conclusion Similar socio-demographic barriers appear to be important determinants of physical inactivity, regardless of BMI status or the presence of diabetes. However, physical activity promoting interventions in obese and diabetic adults should consider the specific disease-related characteristics of these groups. A special need for target group specific physical activity programmes in adults from ethnic minorities or of advanced age was further identified."
https://openalex.org/W3128674573,"Consoling touch is a powerful form of social support that has been repeatedly demonstrated to reduce the experience of physical pain. However, it remains unknown whether touch reduces emotional pain in the same way that it reduces physical pain. The present research sought to understand how handholding with a romantic partner shapes experiences of emotional pain and comfort during emotional recollection, as well as how it shapes lasting emotional pain associated with emotional experiences. Participants recalled emotionally painful memories or neutral memories with their partners, while holding their partner’s hand or holding a squeeze-ball. They additionally completed a follow-up survey to report how much emotional pain they associated with the emotional experiences after recalling them in the lab with their partners. Although consoling touch did not reduce emotional pain during the task, consoling touch increased feelings of comfort. Moreover, participants later recalled emotional memories that were paired with touch as being less emotionally painful than those that were not paired with touch. These findings suggest that touch does not decrease the immediate experience of emotional pain and may instead support adaptive processing of emotional experiences over time."
https://openalex.org/W3126728218,"Dall’s sheep ( Ovis dalli dalli ) are endemic to alpine areas of sub-Arctic and Arctic northwest America and are an ungulate species of high economic and cultural importance. Populations have historically experienced large fluctuations in size, and studies have linked population declines to decreased productivity as a consequence of late-spring snow cover. However, it is not known how the seasonality of snow accumulation and characteristics such as depth and density may affect Dall’s sheep productivity. We examined relationships between snow and climate conditions and summer lamb production in Wrangell-St Elias National Park and Preserve, Alaska over a 37-year study period. To produce covariates pertaining to the quality of the snowpack, a spatially-explicit snow evolution model was forced with meteorological data from a gridded climate re-analysis from 1980 to 2017 and calibrated with ground-based snow surveys and validated by snow depth data from remote cameras. The best calibrated model produced an RMSE of 0.08 m (bias 0.06 m) for snow depth compared to the remote camera data. Observed lamb-to-ewe ratios from 19 summers of survey data were regressed against seasonally aggregated modelled snow and climate properties from the preceding snow season. We found that a multiple regression model of fall snow depth and fall air temperature explained 41% of the variance in lamb-to-ewe ratios (R 2 = .41, F(2,38) = 14.89, p&lt;0.001), with decreased lamb production following deep snow conditions and colder fall temperatures. Our results suggest the early establishment and persistence of challenging snow conditions is more important than snow conditions immediately prior to and during lambing. These findings may help wildlife managers to better anticipate Dall’s sheep recruitment dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3127423040,"Background The health of individuals is not only the absence of disease checked medically, but also encompasses social and psychological aspects. Any departure from the state of physiological, psychological, or social well-being was affected by different factors. However, all contributory factors were not equally responsible for affecting disease. This study was undertaken as a search for the relative effects of sociocultural and individual behavioral factors contributing to acute and chronic gastritis patients visiting Saint Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC). Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out on 364 patients visited SPHMMC in the study. Primary data were collected through an interview schedule tool with an exit approach by validating questions pertaining to sociocultural and individual behavioral factors. The status of gastritis was measured as whether patients had Helicobacter Pylori infection, signs and symptoms indicated gastritis that occurred, and persisted for less than a month, greater than a month, or none of the signs and symptoms. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were used to identify the predictors of gastritis severity. P-value ≤ 0.05 was declared as an indicator of statistically significant. Results The prevalence of gastritis in the study area was 78.8%. Specifically, 48.9% and 29.9% had acute and chronic gastritis, respectively. The study found that low income and taking medicinal drugs was slightly significantly contributed to higher gastritis status; however, being younger age was slightly significantly contributed to lower gastritis status. Furthermore, the results indicated that eating spiced foods (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.508; 95% CI: 1.046, 2.174), lack of physical exercise regularly (AOR = 1.780; 95% CI: 1.001, 3.168), stress (AOR = 2.168; 95% CI: 1.379, 3.4066), and substance use (AOR = 1.478; 95% CI: 1.093, 1.999) were significantly contributed to higher gastritis status. Conclusions The findings suggested that women should take enough rest and sleep well, men refrain from involvement in any risky behaviors, young people and those who earn low income per month should equip with knowledge and understanding on how to practice good health behaviors, eating foods on time, avoiding eating spiced food frequently, doing physical exercise regularly, and taking medicinal drugs according to physician advice are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3128415177,"We reported that bisphenol AF (BPAF) works as an agonist for estrogen receptor (ER) ERα but as an antagonist for ERβ. Similar results were observed for bisphenol E analogs (BPE-X) such as BPE-F, BPE-Cl, and BPE-Br, each consisting of a series of a tri-halogenated methyl group CX 3 in the central alkyl moiety. It was demonstrated that the electrostatic halogen bond based on the dispersion force of halogen atoms is a major driving force in the activities of bifunctional ERα-agonist and ERβ-antagonist. Since the chlorine atoms present in bisphenol C (BPC) exist in a π-π conjugated system due to the presence of an adjacent C = C double bond, we intended to prove that BPC is also a bifunctional ERα-agonist and ERβ-antagonist exhibiting greatly enhanced agonist/antagonist activities. BPC was evaluated for its ability to activate ERα and ERβ in the luciferase reporter gene assay using HeLa cells. With high receptor-binding ability to both ERs, BPC was found to be fully active for ERα but inactive for ERβ. BPC’s definite antagonist activity in ERβ was revealed by its inhibitory activity against 17β-estradiol. Thus, BPC is a bifunctional ERα-agonist and ERβ-antagonist. These agonist/antagonist activities were discovered to be extremely high among series of halogen-containing bisphenol compounds. This comparative structure-activity study revealed that the ascending order of ERα-agonist and ERβ-antagonist activities was BPE-F ≪ BPE-Cl ≲ BPAF &lt; BPE-Br ≪ BPC. The highly intensified receptor interaction of BPC is attributable to the presence of an n-π-π-n conjugation system mediated through the &gt;C = CCl 2 double bond."
https://openalex.org/W3126570553,"In order to solve the problem of low accuracy of traditional construction project risk prediction, a project risk prediction model based on EW-FAHP and 1D-CNN(One Dimensional Convolution Neural Network) is proposed. Firstly, the risk evaluation index value of construction project is selected by literature analysis method, and the comprehensive weight of risk index is obtained by combining entropy weight method (EW) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). The risk weight is input into the 1D-CNN model for training and learning, and the prediction values of construction period risk and cost risk are output to realize the risk prediction. The experimental results show that the average absolute error of the construction period risk and cost risk of the risk prediction model proposed in this paper is below 0.1%, which can meet the risk prediction of construction projects with high accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3127501738,"The objective of this experimental study was to develop and evaluate a three-dimensionally printed custom surgical guide system for performing bipolar coxofemoral osteochondral allograft transplantation in dogs. Five cadaver dogs, weighing 20–38 kg were used in the study. Custom surgical guides were designed and three-dimensionally printed to facilitate accurate execution of a surgical plan for bipolar coxofemoral osteochondral allograft transplantation. Guide-assisted technique was compared to freehand technique in each cadaver. Surgical time was recorded and postoperative computed tomography and three-dimensional segmentation was performed. Femoral version and inclination angles, femoral neck length, and gap present at the femoral and acetabular donor-recipient interface was compared between the virtual surgical plan and postoperative outcome for both techniques. One-tailed paired t-test ( P &lt; .05) was used for statistical analysis. When compared to free-hand preparation, mean donor femoral preparation time was 10 minutes longer and mean recipient preparation time was 2 minutes longer when using guides (p = 0.011 and p = 0.001, respectively). No difference in acetabular preparation time was noted between groups. Gap volume at the acetabular and femoral donor-recipient interface was not different between groups. Mean difference between the planned and postoperative version angle was 6.2° lower for the guide group when compared to the freehand group (p = 0.025). Mean femoral neck length was 2 mm closer to the plan when using guides than when performing surgery freehand (p = 0.037). Accuracy for femoral angle of inclination was not different between groups. Custom surgical guides warrants consideration in developing bipolar coxofemoral osteochondral allograft transplantation as an alternative surgical technique for managing hip disorders in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3128124341,"Background The collection and analysis of alert logs are necessary for hospital administrators to understand the types and distribution of alert categories within the organization and reduce alert fatigue. However, this is not readily available in most homegrown Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems. Objective To present a novel method that can collect alert information from a homegrown CPOE system (at an academic medical center in Taiwan) and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the number of alerts triggered and alert characteristics. Methods An alert log collector was developed using the Golang programming language and was implemented to collect all triggered interruptive alerts from a homegrown CPOE system of a 726-bed academic medical center from November 2017 to June 2018. Two physicians categorized the alerts from the log collector as either clinical or non-clinical (administrative). Results Overall, 1,625,341 interruptive alerts were collected and classified into 1,474 different categories based on message content. The sum of the top 20, 50, and 100 categories of most frequently triggered alerts accounted for approximately 80, 90 and 97 percent of the total triggered alerts, respectively. Among alerts from the 100 most frequently triggered categories, 1,266,818 (80.2%) were administrative and 312,593 (19.8%) were clinical alerts. Conclusion We have successfully developed an alert log collector that can serve as an extended function to retrieve alerts from a homegrown CPOE system. The insight generated from the present study could also potentially bring value to hospital system designers and hospital administrators when redesigning their CPOE system."

Its effectiveness and safety among women with obstructed labour is not known. Objective To determine the effect and safety of a single-dose preoperative infusion of sodium bicarbonate on maternal and fetal blood lactate and clinical outcomes among women with obstructed labour (OL) in Mbale hospital. Methods We conducted a double blind, randomised controlled trial from July 2018 to September 2019. The participants were women with OL at term (≥37 weeks gestation), carrying a singleton pregnancy with no other obstetric emergency, medical comorbidity or laboratory derangements. Intervention A total of 477 women with OL were randomized to receive 50ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (238 women) or 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (239 women). In both the intervention and controls arms, each participant was preoperatively given a single dose intravenous bolus. Every participant received 1.5 L of normal saline in one hour as part of standard preoperative care. Outcome measures Our primary outcome was the mean difference in maternal venous blood lactate at one hour between the two arms. The secondary outcomes were umbilical cord blood lactate levels at birth, neonatal sepsis and early neonatal death upto 7 days postnatal, as well as the side effects of sodium bicarbonate, primary postpartum hemorrhage, maternal sepsis and mortality at 14 days postpartum. Results The median maternal venous lactate was 6.4 (IQR 3.3–12.3) in the intervention and 7.5 (IQR 4.0–15.8) in the control group, with a statistically non-significant median difference of 1.2 mmol/L; p-value = 0.087. Vargha and Delaney effect size was 0.46 (95% CI 0.40–0.51) implying very little if any effect at all. Conclusion The 4.2g of preoperative intravenous sodium bicarbonate was safe but made little or no difference on blood lactate levels. Trial registration PACTR201805003364421 ."
https://openalex.org/W3129003245,"Objective Pediatric providers play an important role in parental and youth smoking cessation. The goal of this study was to understand smoking cessation attitudes of parents and the behaviors, confidence and self-efficacy of pediatricians related to providing smoking cessation counseling to parents and youth. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted in a convenience sample of families (n = 1,549) and pediatric primary care clinicians (n = 95) in Connecticut using surveys and focus groups from April, 2016 to January, 2017. Results The smoking rate (cigarettes or electronic cigarettes) among all households surveyed was 21%. Interest in quitting smoking was high (71%) and did not differ based on smoking amount, duration, type of community of residence (urban, rural, etc), or race/ethnicity. For example, compared to participants who smoked for &lt;10 years, those who smoked ≥20 years had a similar interest in quitting (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.85–1.48). Ninety percent of clinicians surveyed asked parents about their smoking behavior at least annually but 36% offered no smoking cessation counseling services or referral. Clinicians almost always reported counseling youth about the dangers of nicotine and tobacco use (99%), were more confident about counseling youth than parents (p&lt;0.01) and reported low self-efficacy about smoking cessation and prevention counseling of parents and youth. Ninety-three percent of clinicians opined that electronic cigarettes were equally or more dangerous than cigarettes but 34% never counseled youth about the dangers of electronic cigarettes. Conclusions Clinicians frequently screen parents about their smoking behaviors, but rarely provide smoking cessation counseling and express low confidence in this activity. Clinicians are more confident counseling youth than parents. Clinicians also recognize the dangers of electronic cigarettes, yet they infrequently counsel youth about these dangers."

Past-month insomnia symptoms were assessed by the item, ""Difficulty falling or staying asleep?,"" with the following response options: ""I do not have this symptom"" or ""I have this symptom and…"" ""it doesn't bother me,"" ""it bothers me a little,"" ""it bothers me,"" ""it bothers me a lot."" Circulating levels of the monocyte activation marker soluble CD14 (sCD14), inflammatory marker interleukin-6 (IL-6), and coagulation marker D-dimer were determined from blood specimens. Demographic- and fully-adjusted (CVD risk factors, potential confounders, HIV-related factors) regression models were constructed, with log-transformed biomarker variables as the outcomes. We present the exponentiated regression coefficient (exp[b]) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).We observed no significant associations between insomnia symptoms and sCD14 or IL-6. For D-dimer, veterans in the ""Bothers a Lot"" group had, on average, 17% higher D-dimer than veterans in the ""No Difficulty Falling or Staying Asleep"" group in the demographic-adjusted model (exp[b] = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.01-1.37, p = .04). This association was nonsignificant in the fully-adjusted model (exp[b] = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.94-1.26, p = .27).We observed little evidence of relationships between insomnia symptoms and markers of biological mechanisms of HIV-CVD.

Loss-of-function mutations of RET have been shown to be associated with Hirschsprung disease and Down's syndrome (HSCR-DS) in humans.

The cerebellum, which is required for coordinate performance, consists of layered structures with several cell types. The external germinal layer (EGL) is located in the outermost layer containing dividing granule cell progenitors (GCPs). After mitosis, granule cells (GCs) inwardly migrate along glial fibers of Bergmann glia from the EGL and then penetrate through the layer of Purkinje cells (PCs) to form the internal granular layer (IGL), where GCs eventually maturate (9Wechsler-Reya R. Scott M.P. The developmental biology of brain tumors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 385-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Proliferation and differentiation of GCPs continue and the thickness of the EGL gradually decreases until ∼3 weeks of age after birth (9Wechsler-Reya R. Scott M.P. The developmental biology of brain tumors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 385-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Analyses of cerebellar granule cell development have shown that proliferation and migration of GCPs require mutual communication to PCs and can be facilitated by several mitogenic factors (9Wechsler-Reya R.

At present, however, there is limited evidence indicating a correlation between phosphorylation of c-Ret/c-RET and postnatal development of the cerebellum. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), which affects one in 5000 births, is a congenital disorder of the ENS with an aganglionic megacolon, impaired development of the kidneys, and deafness. Most cases are thought to be multigenic and multifactorial (12Moore S.W. Johnson A.G. Hirschsprung's disease: Genetic and functional associations of Down's and Waardenburg syndromes.Semin. Pediatr.

On the other hand, a small-scale study showed that 14 patients diagnosed with DS-associated HSCR had mutations in c-RET, suggesting the possibility that c-RET is one of the major causal genes for HSCR-DS (14Moore S.W.

The aim of this study was to determine whether cerebellar hypoplasia occurs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice with HSCR. Our results demonstrated for the first time that impaired phosphorylation of c-Ret in PCs causes severe cerebellar hypoplasia in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice with impaired development of GCs. c-Ret protein was constantly detectable in PCs until postnatal day (P) 15, while phosphorylated Y1062 in c-Ret was detectable in PCs after P8 and gradually increased until P15 in wild-type (WT) mice, several days before WT mice had complete cerebellar development (Fig. 1, A and B). The number of Y1062-phosphorylated PCs was undetectably small in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice even on P14 compared with that in WT mice on P14 (Fig. 1, C and D). We next analyzed the coordinate performance of c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were ataxic with impaired performance on the rotarod and a waddling gait pattern on P21 (Fig. 1, E–G). Eight- and 18-day-old c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice showed impaired morphology of the cerebellum with less thickness of the molecular layer than that in WT mice, whereas the morphology of the cerebellum in WT mice and that in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were comparable on P2.5 (Fig. 2, A and B). Eighteen-day-old c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice showed a higher density of GCPs in the EGL than that in WT mice, while the density of GCPs in the EGL in WT mice and that in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were comparable on P2.5 (Fig. 2, C and D). c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice showed a decreased number of GABA A receptor alpha 6 (GABRA6)-positive matured granule cells (GCs) compared with that in WT mice on P13 (Fig. 2, G and H). On the other hand, WT mice and c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice showed comparable numbers of PCs on P21 (Fig. 2, E and F, upper graph), while the diameters of somas of PCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were smaller than those in WT mice (Fig. 2F, lower graph) and PCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice showed impaired electrophysiological parameters (Fig. S2) and dendritic outgrowth (Fig. 2E). The number of PAX6-positive GCPs in the EGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was more than that in WT mice on P11 (Fig. 2, I and J). The number of Ki67-positive GCPs in the EGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was less than that in WT mice on P8 (Fig. 2, K and L). Next, glial fibers of Bergmann glia, which are essential for normal migration of GCs, in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were determined to investigate the reason why c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice had immature GCs. The number of BLBP-positive glial fibers in the EGL was significantly decreased in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice on P15 compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B). The expression of BLBP transcripts was significantly decreased in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice compared with that in littermate WT mice at P17 (Fig. S3). In a previous study, the cerebellar hypoplasia of DS mice was shown to have impaired development of GCs caused by decreased Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-mediated signaling activity (20Roper R.J. Baxter L.L. Saran N.G. Klinedinst D.K. Beachy P.A. Reeves R.H. Defective cerebellar response to mitogenic Hedgehog signaling in Down's syndrome mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our results and the results of the previous study encouraged us to analyze the involvement of Shh in c-Ret-mediated cerebellar hypoplasia. Shh levels in the EGL were decreased in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice on P15 compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 3, C and D), while Shh mRNA levels were comparable in WT mice and c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice (Fig. 3E). Immuno-electron microscopy further showed a decreased number of Shh-positive particles in the EGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 3, F and G, upper graph). In contrast, the number of Shh-positive particles in the somas of PCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was larger than that in WT mice (Fig. 3, F and G, lower graph). In a previous study, axonal trafficking of Shh with synaptic vesicles 2 (SV2) was shown, and it was also shown that mutant Shh caused decreased secretion as well as impaired trafficking in primary neurons (21Beug S.T. Parks R.J. McBride H.M. Wallace V.A. Processing-dependent trafficking of Sonic hedgehog to the regulated secretory pathway in neurons.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice had decreased expression of SV2 and less colocalization of Shh with SV2 in the EGL than those in WT mice (Fig. S4). We tried to rescue the cerebellar hypoplasia in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice with subcutaneous injection of SAG, a smoothened agonist (20Roper R.J. Baxter L.L. Saran N.G. Klinedinst D.K. Beachy P.A. Reeves R.H. Defective cerebellar response to mitogenic Hedgehog signaling in Down's syndrome mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in order to verify the involvement of Shh in the ataxic phenotype and the decreased number of matured GCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. The ataxic phenotype in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was partially rescued by SAG (Fig. 4A). Decreased numbers of BLBP-positive glial fibers and GABRA6-positive mature GCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were significantly rescued in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice treated with SAG (Fig. 4, B–D). We finally crossed c-Ret-KIYF/+-mice and Patched1 knockout mice to examine whether c-Ret-mediated cerebellar hypoplasia is rescued by decreased expression of Patched1, a receptor for Shh, and a negative regulator for Shh-mediating signaling (22Ingham P.W. Taylor A.M. Nakano Y. Role of the Drosophila patched gene in positional signalling.Nature. 1991; 353: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Goodrich L.V. Milenković L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Altered neural cell fates and medulloblastoma in mouse patched mutants.Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The ataxic phenotype and the decreased numbers of BLBP-positive glial fibers and matured GCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were also rescued in c-Ret-KIYF/YF;Patched1-KO(+/−)-mice (Fig. 4, A–D). On the other hand, the c-Ret-mediated megacolon phenotype of HSCR was not rescued by reduced expression of Patched1 at least in this experimental condition (Fig. S5), although we have not examined the effect of SAG on HSCR. This study demonstrated for the first time that impaired phosphorylation of Y1062 in c-Ret caused cerebellar hypoplasia in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice, although the sample sizes in this study were limited. Impaired development of GCs was shown to be involved in cerebellar hypoplasia in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice at P18. In contrast, the numbers of GCPs were comparable in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice and WT mice on P2.5. Our results also demonstrated that Y1062-phosphorylation in c-Ret of PCs was undetectable on P5 but gradually increased after P8 at least until P15. Thus, these results suggest that GCs even in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice developed normally at least until P2.5, when Y1062-phoshorylation in c-Ret of PCs from WT mice was undetectable, but that GCPs were accumulated in the EGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice on P8-18, when the level of Y1062-phoshorylation in c-Ret of PCs from WT mice was high. In previous studies in vitro, Y1062-phosphorylation in c-Ret was shown to be crucial for neurite outgrowth (24Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W.

In this study, c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice at P18 showed decreased soma size and shorter outgrowth of neurites in PCs than those in WT mice, suggesting that impaired phosphorylation of Y1062 in c-Ret caused impaired morphology in PCs. Our results partially correspond to the results of previous studies showing decreased soma size of dorsal root ganglion neurons in Ret-floxed;Wnt1-Cre mice (27Luo W. Wickramasinghe S.R. Savitt J.M.

Also, our results are similar to the results of a study showing impairment of cerebellar motor learning in mice with tissue-specific deletion of c-Ret in molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellum (30Sergaki M.C.

Thus, this study suggests that c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice have phenotypes of HSCR-DS including cerebellar hypoplasia. Our results showed impairment of BLBP-positive glial fibers of Bergmann glia, which are known to be required for migration of GCs, in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. We also determined the expression of BLBP transcripts in the cerebellum in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice, since the expression of BLBP is known to be crucial for the development of glial fibers of Bergmann glia (31Vohra B.P. Tsuji K. Nagashimada M. Uesaka T. Wind D. Fu M. Armon J. Enomoto H. Heuckeroth R.O. Differential gene expression and functional analysis implicate novel mechanisms in entericnervous system precursor migration and neuritogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2006; 298: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The BLBP level was decreased in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice compared with that in littermate WT mice. The finding is similar to the results of a previous study showing decreased expression of BLBP transcripts (also called Fabp7) in the ENS in Ret-knockout mice at embryonic day 14 (32Feng L. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP): A novel signaling system in the developing mammalian CNS.Neuron. 1994; 12: 895-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In a previous study, impaired migration of GCs was shown to cause immature formation of parallel fiber-PC synapses in cerebellar hypoplasia (29Iizuka A. Matsuzaki Y. Konno A. Hirai H. Plasticity of the developmentally arrested staggerer cerebellum in response to exogenous RORα.Brain Struct. Funct. 2016; 221: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest the possibility that impaired development of glial fibers by decreased expression of BLBP resulted in the formation of immature synapses due to impaired migration of GCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. Our results and the results of a previous study (11Colucci-D'Amato G.L. D'Alessio A. Filliatreau G. Florio T. Di Giamberardino L. Chiappetta G. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Presence of physiologically stimulated RET in adult rat brain: Induction of RET expression during nerve regeneration.Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1081-1086PubMed Google Scholar) showed that c-Ret is expressed in PCs but not in GCs or Bergmann glia from 14-day-old WT mice. Therefore, our results raised the possibility that decreased phosphorylation of c-Ret Y1062 in PCs causes impaired cross talk via a soluble factor among PCs, Bergman glia, and GCs, resulting in cerebellar hypoplasia. In this study, we focused on the involvement of the mitogenic factor Shh, since previous studies showed that (i) Shh induced the expression of BLBP (33Ju B. Chen W. Spitsbergen J.M. Lu J. Vogel P. Peters J.L. Wang Y.D. Orr B.A. Wu J. Henson H.E. Jia S. Parupalli C. Taylor M.R. Activation of Sonic hedgehog signaling in neural progenitor cells promotes gliomadevelopment in the zebrafish optic pathway.Oncogenesis. 2014; 3: e96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and (ii) Shh secreted from PCs is one of the key factors for cerebellar development by facilitating expansion of glial fibers of Bergmann glia (34Cheng F.Y. Fleming J.T. Chiang C. Bergmann glial Sonic hedgehog signaling activity is required for proper cerebellar cortical expansion and architecture.Dev. Biol. 2018; 440: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and migration of GCs along glial fibers (35Dahmane N. Ruiz i Altaba A. Sonic hedgehog regulates the growth and patterning of the cerebellum.Development. 1999; 126: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wallace V.A. Purkinje-cell-derived Sonic hedgehog regulates granule neuron precursor cell proliferation in the developing mouse cerebellum.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 445-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and proliferating GCPs (35Dahmane N. Ruiz i Altaba A. Sonic hedgehog regulates the growth and patterning of the cerebellum.Development. 1999; 126: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice at P8 had a decreased number of Ki67-positive GPCs in the EGL compared with that in WT mice, suggesting that proliferation of GCPs in the EGL was also affected in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. Thus, our results suggest the possibilities that migration and proliferation of GCPs are impaired in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. There is also the possibility that the impaired Shh from PCs affects the final maturation of GCs after migration, since it seems that the cell number of GCs in the IGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was comparable to that in WT mice, although the expression level of GABRA6 in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice was less than that in WT mice. In a previous study, the expression level of GABRA6 in cerebellar GCs was shown to be regulated by nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins (37Wang W. Stock R.E. Gronostajski R.M. Wong Y.W. Schachner M. Kilpatrick D.L. A role for nuclear factor I in the intrinsic control of cerebellar granule neuron gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53491-53497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Shh has been shown to increase the expression of NFI in dental mesenchyme (38Huang X. Xu X. Bringas J.,P. Hung Y.P. Chai Y. Smad4-Shh-Nfic signaling cascade-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal interaction is crucial in regulating tooth root development.J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1167-1178PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that impaired Shh from PCs decreases the expression of GABRA6 via NFI in GCs in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. GABRA6 has been shown to play an important role for mediating tonic conductance via a voltage-independent K+ conductance in mature GCs in the cerebellum (39Brickley S.G. Revilla V. Cull-Candy S.G. Wisden W. Farrant M. Adaptive regulation of neuronal excitability by a voltage-independent potassium conductance.Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that cerebellar hypoplasia in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice involves impaired function of GCs. Our results demonstrated that Shh-positive vesicles in the EGL in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were decreased compared with those in WT mice. In contrast, Shh-positive vesicles in the somas of PCs in in c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice were increased compared with those in WT mice, although the transcriptional levels of Shh in the cerebellum were comparable in WT mice and c-Ret-KIYF/YF-mice. Our results are partially similar to the results of a study showing impaired development of GCs with decreased activity of Shh-mediated signaling in DS mice (20Roper R.J. Baxter L.L. Saran N.G.

https://openalex.org/W3127319746,"Megacolon is one of the main late complications of Chagas disease, affecting approximately 10% of symptomatic patients. However, studies are needed to understand the mechanisms involved in the progression of this condition. During infection by Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ), an inflammatory profile sets in that is involved in neural death, and this destruction is known to be essential for megacolon progression. One of the proteins related to the maintenance of intestinal neurons is the type 2 bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2). Intestinal BMP2 homeostasis is directly involved in the maintenance of organ function. Thus, the aim of this study was to correlate the production of intestinal BMP2 with immunopathological changes in C57Bl/6 mice infected with the T . cruzi Y strain in the acute and chronic phases. The mice were infected with 1000 blood trypomastigote forms. After euthanasia, the colon was collected, divided into two fragments, and a half was used for histological analysis and the other half for BMP2, IFNγ, TNF-α, and IL-10 quantification. The infection induced increased intestinal IFNγ and BMP2 production during the acute phase as well as an increase in the inflammatory infiltrate. In contrast, a decreased number of neurons in the myenteric plexus were observed during this phase. Collagen deposition increased gradually throughout the infection, as demonstrated in the chronic phase. Additionally, a BMP2 increase during the acute phase was positively correlated with intestinal IFNγ. In the same analyzed period, BMP2 and IFNγ showed negative correlations with the number of neurons in the myenteric plexus. As the first report of BMP2 alteration after infection by T . cruzi , we suggest that this imbalance is not only related to neuronal damage but may also represent a new route for maintaining the intestinal proinflammatory profile during the acute phase."
https://openalex.org/W3128868367,"In 2014, best-practice recommendations to treat and control lameness in sheep in the UK were consolidated into a national program, the Five-Point Plan (5PP). As recent evidence suggests that only the minority of sheep farmers are implementing all management practices listed in the 5PP, qualitative investigation is vital to ensure future promotion is aligned with psychological and contextual factors affecting farmers’ decision-making. This qualitative study sought to explore farmers’ attitudes and the factors affecting uptake of best-practice measures listed in the 5PP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2019 with 12 sheep farmers from England and Wales. In accordance with Thematic Analysis and the principles of Grounded Theory, data collection and analysis were performed iteratively. Two overarching themes, delineated by subthemes, emerged during analysis; (1) Barriers to adoption of 5PP measures and (2) Motivation to adopt 5PP measures. Various farmer-centric factors and physical resources were identified as key barriers or obstacles that limited farmers’ ability to implement 5PP measures outright, or restricted their ability to make changes to facilitate future adoption. Conversely, internal and external influences were identified to increase farmers’ willingness and motivation to implement practices listed on the 5PP. Heterogeneity in farmer perceptions, attitudes, experiences and circumstances identified in this study highlights the difficulty in promoting a one-size-fits-all lameness control plan, where a unique combination of intrinsic factors, social influences, and physical restrictions affect implementation. Future initiatives should focus on removing barriers by changing farmers’ perceptions and mindset towards lameness control, and building farmers’ confidence in their ability to implement practices. Furthermore, farmers’ social licence to farm and their desire to improve their reputation within society, presents an important opportunity to further engage farmers in implementing control practices. Increasing peer-to-peer knowledge transfer opportunities and effective farmer-veterinarian communication and rapport could help establish 5PP measures as normative behaviours."

The study views the question of whether that global regularity is independent of different spatial distributions of cities. For that purpose, a typical Zipfian rank-size distribution of cities is generated with random numbers. This distribution is then cast into different settings of spatial coordinates. For the estimation, the variables rank and size are supplemented by spatial spillover effects in a standard spatial econometric approach. Results suggest that distance and contiguity effects matter. This finding is further corroborated by three country analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3126825471,"Considering the current changes in dietary patterns and the increasing prevalence of excess weight throughout the world, several studies have reported insulin resistance, which is a key driver of many chronic diseases, to be an important public health problem in all age groups. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the prevalence and independent predictors of insulin resistance in Brazilian adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic, representative sample of Brazilian adolescents (n = 37,023) who participated in the Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents. Data were collected on demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics as well as antioxidant micronutrient intake (vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and selenium). Insulin resistance was determined using the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and classified based on the 75th percentile of the sample distribution. Insulin resistance was detected in 27% of the adolescents and was more prevalent among those aged 12 to 14 years (PR: 1.26 [95%CI: 1.13;1.41]), those residing in the southern and south-eastern regions of the country (PR: 1.47 [95%CI: 1.27;1.70]), those who were physically inactive (PR: 1.12 [95%CI: 1.02;1.23]), and those did not consume alcohol (PR: 1.50 [95%CI: 1.13;1.99]). The prevalence of insulin resistance was 2.5-fold higher among individuals with severe obesity (PR: 2.49 [95%CI: 2.07;3.00]). Waist circumference indicative of cardiovascular risk and high serum triglyceride levels increased the likelihood of insulin resistance (PR: 1.37 [95%CI: 1.19;1.59] and 1.60 [95%CI: 1.45;1.78], respectively). The prevalence of the outcome was higher among adolescents in the lower quartiles of vitamin E intake (p&lt;0.05). In the present study, the prevalence of insulin resistance was high among Brazilian adolescents and we identified sociodemographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary predictors of this outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3127421308,"Bark beetles attack their hosts at uniform intervals to avoid intraspecific competition in the phloem. Bark texture and phloem thickness also affect bark beetle attacks, and the bark characteristics are not spatially homogeneous; therefore, the distribution patterns of entry holes can demonstrate an aggregated distribution. Polygraphus proximus Blandford (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) is a non-aggressive phloephagous bark beetle that feeds on Far Eastern firs. They have caused mass mortality in Russia and Japan. However, the distribution pattern of entry holes of P . proximus and spatial relationships with bark characteristics have not been studied. Thus, we investigated the distribution pattern of entry holes of P . proximus . The distribution of entry holes was significantly uniform in most cases. As the attack density increased, an aggregated distribution pattern within a short distance (&lt; 4.0 cm) was observed. The rough bark had a significantly higher number of entry holes than the remaining bark. The distribution pattern of entry holes demonstrated a significantly aggregated spatial association with rough bark. Finally, rough bark around knots had significantly thicker phloem than the remaining barks. These suggest that P . proximus may preferentially attack rough bark to reproduce in the thicker phloem under a rough bark surface."
https://openalex.org/W3128609932,"A discrete model is proposed for settling of an arbitrary-shaped particle onto a flat surface under the gravitational field. In this method, the particle dynamics is calculated such that (a) the particle does not create an overlap with the wall and (b) reaches a realistic equilibrium state, which are not guaranteed in the conventional discrete element methods that add a repulsive force (torque) based on the amount of overlap between the particle and the wall. Instead, upon the detection of collision, the particle’s kinematics is modified depending on the type of contact, i.e., point, line, and surface types, by assuming the contact point/line as the instantaneous center/line of rotation for calculating the rigid body dynamics. Two different stability conditions are implemented by comparing the location of the projection of the center of mass on the wall along gravity direction against the contact points to identify the equilibrium (stable) state on the wall for particles with multiple contact points. A variety of simulations are presented, including smooth surface particles (ellipsoids), regular particles with sharp edges (cylinders and pyramids) and irregular-shaped particles, to show that the method can provide the analytically-known equilibrium state."

Methods Between February 2015 and June 2015, MSM living with HIV and referred to the day-care hospital were offered to perform an anal self-sampling for cytologic and virologic evaluation. A self-sampling kit was provided, and a tutorial video was shown. A subset of participants had a proctology appointment after they did the self-sampling, and thus had a clinical examination and an anal swab sampling performed by the proctologist, using the same sampling material. Results Anal self-sampling was offered to 103 patients, and 100 accepted. Sixty-three samples were interpretable, of which 36 (57%) were normal and 27 (43%) showed abnormal results. Virologic analysis was performed for 60 (95%) interpretable samples: 50/60 (83%) of them were positive for HPV. Among HPV-carrier patients, 42/50 (84%) were infected with at least one HR-HPV. Twenty patients had a proctologist consultation. All clinician-performed samples were interpretable and 14 (70%) self-samples were interpretable. Conclusions This study highlights the acceptable accuracy of self-sampling screening method among MSM living with HIV and try out its acceptability and feasibility as a secondary prevention device. Although it cannot replace a proctologist consultation for high risk patients, self-sampling should be studied further as one of the ways of screening for anal cancer among low-risk outpatients."
https://openalex.org/W3127629825,"This study aimed to investigate the influence of the task type on the relative electromyography (EMG) activity of biceps femoris long head (BFlh) to semitendinosus (ST) muscles, and of proximal to distal regions during isometric leg-curl (LC) and hip-extension (HE). Twenty male volunteers performed isometric LC with the knee flexed to 30° (LC30) and 90° (LC90), as well as isometric HE with the knee extended (HE0) and flexed to 90° (HE90), at 40% and 100% maximal voluntary contraction (MVIC). Hip position was neutral in all conditions. EMG activity was recorded from the proximal and distal region of the BFlh and ST muscles. BFlh/ST was calculated from the raw root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes. The RMS of 40% MVIC was normalized using MVIC data and the proximal/distal (P/D) ratio of normalized EMG (NEMG) was calculated. The BFlh/ST ratio was higher in HE0 than in LC90 during MVIC and 40% MVIC (p&lt;0.05), and was higher in HE90 than in LC90 (p&lt;0.05) during 40% MVIC at the proximal region, whereas no difference was observed between HE0 and LC30. There was no inter-task difference in BFlh/ST ratio in the distal region. Furthermore, the P/D ratio was higher in LC90 than in LC30 and HE0 (p&lt;0.05) in BFlh and ST muscles, and was higher in HE90 than in LC30 and HE0 (p&lt;0.05) in BFlh during 40% MVIC. However, there was no difference in P/D ratio between LC30 and LC90, and HE0 and HE90. This showed that there was no task-dependent difference in the EMG activity of the BFlh muscle relative to the ST muscle between prone hip extension and prone knee flexion when the knee joint was set at an equivalent angle. Similarly, there was no task-dependent difference in the NEMG of the proximal region relative to the distal region in BFlh and ST muscles during 40% MVIC."
https://openalex.org/W3128824798,"Introduction Our institution implemented a preoperative protocol to identify high-risk cases for which power morcellation should be avoided. Material and methods In this retrospective cohort study, an institutional protocol requiring preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging and serum Lactate Dehydrogenase levels was implemented. Chart review was performed including all women who underwent intra-abdominal surgery for symptomatic fibroids from 4/23/2013 to 4/23/2015. Results A total of 1,085 women were included, 479 before and 606 after implementation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging / Lactate Dehydrogenase protocol. The pre-protocol group had more post-menopausal women (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.022) and women using tamoxifen (2% vs. 0%, p = 0.022) than those in the post-protocol group, but baseline patient characteristics were otherwise similar between groups. Incidence of malignant pathological diagnoses did not change significantly over the time period in relation to protocol implementation. The rate of open surgery for both hysterectomy and myomectomy remained the same in the year preceding and the year following initiation of the protocol (open hysterectomy rate was 19% vs. 16% in pre- and post-protocol groups, respectively, P = 0.463, and open myomectomy rate was 10% vs. 9% rates in pre- and post-protocol groups, respectively, P = 0.776). There was a significant decrease in the use of power morcellation (66% in pre- and 50% in post-protocol cohorts, p&lt;0.001) and an increased use of containment bags (1% in pre- and 19% in post-protocol cohort). When analyzing the subset of women who had abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging / and Lactate Dehydrogenase results, abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging results alone resulted in higher rates of open approach (65% for abnormal vs. 35% for normal). Similarly, a combination of abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Lactate Dehydrogenase tests resulted in higher rates of open approach (70% for abnormal and 17% for normal). Abnormal Lactate Dehydrogenase results alone did not influence route. Conclusions Rates of MIS procedures were decreased for women with abnormal preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging results. False positive results appear to be one of the main drivers for the use of an open surgical route."
https://openalex.org/W3126699231,"Cooperation is crucial to overcome some of the most pressing social challenges of our times, such as the spreading of infectious diseases, corruption and environmental conservation. Yet, how cooperation emerges and persists is still a puzzle for social scientists. Since human cooperation is individually costly, cooperative attitudes should have been eliminated by natural selection in favour of selfishness. Yet, cooperation is common in human societies, so there must be some features which make it evolutionarily advantageous. Using a cognitive inspired model of human cooperation, recent work Realpe-Gómez (2018) has reported signatures of criticality in human cooperative groups. Theoretical evidence suggests that being poised at a critical point provides evolutionary advantages to groups by enhancing responsiveness of these systems to external attacks. After showing that signatures of criticality can be detected in human cooperative groups composed by Moody Conditional Cooperators, in this work we show that being poised close to a turning point enhances the fitness and make individuals more resistant to invasions by free riders."
https://openalex.org/W3128709657,"Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive retinal and central nervous system deterioration during infancy. This lysosomal storage disorder results from a deficiency in the Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1) enzyme—a lysosomal hydrolase which cleaves fatty acid chains such as palmitate from lipid-modified proteins. In the absence of PPT1 activity, these proteins fail to be degraded, leading to the accumulation of autofluorescence storage material in the lysosome. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to INCL pathology remain poorly understood. A role for oxidative stress has been postulated, yet little evidence has been reported to support this possibility. Here we present a comprehensive cellular characterization of human PPT1-deficient fibroblast cells harboring Met1Ile and Tyr247His compound heterozygous mutations. We detected autofluorescence storage material and observed distinct organellar abnormalities of the lysosomal and mitochondrial structures, which supported previous postulations about the role of ER, mitochondria and oxidative stress in INCL. An increase in the number of lysosomal structures was found in INCL patient fibroblasts, which suggested an upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis, and an association with endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The mitochondrial network also displayed abnormal spherical punctate morphology instead of normal elongated tubules with extensive branching, supporting the involvement of mitochondrial and oxidative stress in INCL cell death. Autofluorescence accumulation and lysosomal pathologies can be mitigated in the presence of conditioned wild type media suggesting that a partial restoration via passive introduction of the enzyme into the cellular environment may be possible. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that human INCL fibroblasts have a heightened susceptibility to exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death, which suggested an elevated basal level of endogenous ROS in the mutant cell. Collectively, these findings support the role of intracellular organellar networks in INCL pathology, possibly due to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3128818628,"The expression levels of CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk) and Crk-like (CrkL) are elevated in many human cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM), and are believed to contribute to poor prognosis. Although Crk and CrkL have been proposed as therapeutic targets in these tumors, the lack of a reliable, quantitative assay to measure Crk and CrkL activity has hindered development of inhibitors. Here, we knocked down Crk, CrkL, or both using siRNAs in a human GBM cell line, U-118MG, to determine the respective, quantitative contributions of Crk and CrkL to cellular phenotypes. The combined use of specific and potent Crk and CrkL siRNAs induced effective knockdown of CrkII, CrkI, and CrkL. Whereas Crk knockdown did not affect cell morphology, proliferation, adhesion, or invasion, CrkL knockdown caused shrinkage of cells and inhibition of cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion. Crk/CrkL double knockdown resulted in more pronounced morphological alterations and more robust inhibition of proliferation, adhesion, and invasion. Furthermore, Crk/CrkL double knockdown completely blocked cell migration, and this effect was rescued by transient overexpression of CrkL but not of Crk. Quantification of protein levels indicated that CrkL is expressed more abundantly than CrkII and CrkI in U-118MG cells. These results demonstrate both the predominant role of CrkL and the essential overlapping functions of Crk and CrkL in U-118MG cells. Furthermore, our study indicates that migration of U-118MG cells depends entirely on Crk and CrkL. Thus, impedance-based, real-time measurement of tumor cell migration represents a robust assay for monitoring Crk and CrkL activities.

Standard therapy for GBM is surgical removal of the tumor, followed by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. The success of this approach depends primarily on how completely the tumor is surgically resected, in part because effective chemotherapy is not available. However, complete resection of GBM is challenging because the tumor is heterogeneous and highly infiltrative (2Snuderl M. Fazlollahi L. Le L.P. Nitta M. Zhelyazkova B.H. Davidson C.J. Akhavanfard S.

Although it is well known that Crk and CrkL are structurally and functionally similar, the majority of studies address the role of either Crk or CrkL individually in knockdown or overexpression experiments in cancer cell models, in gene expression analyses of cancer tissues, and in outcome analyses of patient survival. Thus, the scientific literature has created an enigma; it appears that Crk and CrkL are important in several cancers, but it is unclear whether a single one of these genes is the culprit or both in combination. This uncertainty is compounded by the fact that most knockdown studies, targeting either Crk or CrkL alone, did not investigate the possibility of cross-regulation. Therefore, the siRNAs or shRNAs used in these studies may not have specifically inhibited either Crk or CrkL, because of their high level of sequence similarity, as they may have also affected expression of the paralog. Similarly, a study in which shRNAs were used to reduce expression of CrkII, CrkI, and CrkL simultaneously did not ascertain whether the phenotypes observed required knockdown of Crk and CrkL in combination or just one of the genes alone (12Fathers K.E.

Crk adaptor proteins act as key signaling integrators for breast tumorigenesis.Breast Cancer Res. 2012; 14: R74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, Franke et al. (42Franke F.C. Slusarenko B.O. Engleitner T. Johannes W. Laschinger M. Rad R. Nitsche U. Janssen K.P.

Cancer. 2020; 147: 1715-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), using individual and double knockout cells, demonstrated that Crk and CrkL both contribute to migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Previously, we reported that Crk and CrkL play essential overlapping roles in many biological processes, including neuronal migration, neuromuscular synapse formation, podocyte morphogenesis, T cell migration into sites of inflammation, lens fiber cell elongation, and natural killer cell expansion and differentiation during mouse cytomegalovirus infection (45Park T.J.

In addition, we induced knockout of Crk and CrkL in cultured fibroblasts using the Cre-loxP recombination and demonstrated that Crk and CrkL play essential overlapping roles in cell structure, motility, and growth (51Park T.J. Curran T. Essential roles of Crk and CrkL in fibroblast structure and motility.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5121-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 52Park T. Koptyra M. Curran T.

These studies indicate that a more systematic and comprehensive analysis is required to untwine the individual or collective contributions of Crk and CrkL to tumor cell biology. This concern prompted us to compare single and double knockdown of Crk and CrkL in a GBM cell line using a systematic and quantitative approach to address effects on cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that CrkL, which is more abundantly expressed than CrkII and CrkI, plays a more prominent role than Crk and that Crk and CrkL play essential overlapping roles in cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and proliferation in the GBM cell line investigated. Our study supports the use of impedance-based real-time measurement of cell migration as a quantitative assay for monitoring activities of Crk and CrkL. Previously, we achieved a rapid and efficient transfection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with synthetic mRNA (synRNA) using the Neon electroporation system (52Park T. Koptyra M. Curran T. Fibroblast growth requires CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk) and Crk-like (CrkL).J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26273-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We applied this method to transfect the GBM cell line U-118MG. When U-118MG cells were electroporated with synthetic green fluorescent protein mRNA (synGFP), many cells showed strong green fluorescence (Fig. S1A). The viability of cells was indirectly assessed by the initial measurement of the WST-1 signal. Upon electroporation, viabilities were not different among cells electroporated without and with synGFP (Fig. S1B; 208 ± 14 for none and 199 ± 8 for synGFP). The growth rates over 2 days were also not affected significantly by the electroporation of cells with synGFP (Fig. S1C). The results suggest that RNA can be efficiently introduced to U-118MG cells by electroporation using the Neon system without any noticeable nonspecific changes in cell viability and proliferation. To find siRNAs that induce efficient and specific knockdown of Crk, we transfected U-118MG cells with four different siRNAs targeting the SH2 or SH3 domains of the human CRK gene (Fig. 1A). Then, we examined the level of Crk and CrkL proteins produced at 3 days posttransfection (DPT). Crk siRNAs 7, 9, and 10 reduced expression levels of CrkII and CrkI by more than 70% without affecting CrkL expression (Fig. 1, B and C). Crk siRNA 10 was the most effective at reducing CrkII and CrkI levels (83.2 ± 2.9% and 92.6 ± 0.2%, respectively). On the other hand, Crk siRNA 8 reduced the CrkI and CrkII expression by 42.0 ± 4.4% and 44.8 ± 8.8%, respectively. Although Crk siRNAs 7 and 9 reduced CrkI and CrkII expression by similar amounts, only Crk siRNA 7 decreased the phospho-p130Cas level significantly, suggesting that the inhibition of p130Cas phosphorylation by Crk siRNA 7 might not be caused by the reduction of CrkII and CrkI. We also examined the effect of gene knockdown on cell morphology. Whereas Crk siRNAs 7 and 8 caused visible morphological alterations, Crk siRNAs 9 and 10 did not cause apparent morphological alterations (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the morphological alterations caused by Crk siRNAs 7 and 8 may not be mediated by the reduction in the CrkI and CrkII levels. Interestingly, CrkI expression was decreased by Crk siRNA 9, although CrkI lacks the target site for the siRNA. It is unclear whether there is any feedback regulation of CrkI and CrkII at the mRNA and protein levels. We selected Crk siRNA 10 for future studies because it was the most potent siRNA among those tested without affecting the phospho-p130Cas level and the cell morphology. We t"

Using light at longer (near-infrared) or shorter (X-ray) wavelengths enables the detection of superficial tissue bruising and density defects, respectively; however, it does not enable the optical absorption and scattering properties of sub-dermal tissue to be quantified. This paper applies visible and near-infrared interactance spectroscopy to detect internal necrosis in sweetpotatoes and develops a Zemax scattering simulation that models the measured optical signatures for both healthy and necrotic tissue. This study demonstrates that interactance spectroscopy can detect the unique near-infrared optical signatures of necrotic tissues in sweetpotatoes down to a depth of approximately 5±0.5 mm. We anticipate that light scattering measurement methods will represent a significant improvement over the current destructive analysis methods used to assay for internal defects in sweetpotatoes."
https://openalex.org/W3129080243,"Chilling stress generates significant inhibition of normal growth and development of cotton plants and lead to severe reduction of fiber quality and yield. Currently, little is known for the molecular mechanism of brown-fiber cotton (BFC) to respond to chilling stress. Herein, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based comparative analysis of leaves under 4°C treatment in two different-tolerant BFC cultivars, chilling-sensitive (CS) XC20 and chilling-tolerant (CT) Z1612, was performed to investigate the response mechanism. A total of 72650 unigenes were identified with eight commonly used databases. Venn diagram analysis identified 1194 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with significant up-regulation in all comparison groups. Furthermore, enrichment analyses of COG and KEGG, as well as qRT-PCR validation, indicated that 279 genes were discovered as up-regulated DEGs (UDEGs) with constant significant increased expression in CT cultivar Z1612 groups at the dimensions of both each comparison group and treatment time, locating in the enriched pathways of signal transduction, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and cell component. Moreover, the comprehensive analyses of gene expression, physiological index and intracellular metabolite detections, and ascorbate antioxidative metabolism measurement validated the functional contributions of these identified candidate genes and pathways to chilling stress. Together, this study for the first time report the candidate key genes and metabolic pathways responding to chilling stress in BFC, and provide the effective reference for understanding the regulatory mechanism of low temperature adaptation in cotton."
