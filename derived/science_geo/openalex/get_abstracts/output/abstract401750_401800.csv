https://openalex.org/W1986009297,"The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX participate in chromatin remodeling at telomeres and other genomic sites. Because inactivating mutations of these genes are common in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), we examined the telomere status of these tumors. We found that 61% of PanNETs displayed abnormal telomeres that are characteristic of a telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanism termed ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). All of the PanNETs exhibiting these abnormal telomeres had ATRX or DAXX mutations or loss of nuclear ATRX or DAXX protein. ATRX mutations also correlate with abnormal telomeres in tumors of the central nervous system. These data suggest that an alternative telomere maintenance function may operate in human tumors with alterations in the ATRX or DAXX genes."

https://openalex.org/W2069090835,"Interactions between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are involved in a number of reward-processing and addictive behaviours, but our understanding of the precise role of each of these brain areas has been limited by the inability to manipulate pathways selectively during behaviour. Stuber et al. use optogenetic technologies, in which light selectively activates or inhibits genetically-defined neuronal subpopulations, to reveal an unexpected role for the BLA — a brain region usually associated with aversive behaviours. The BLA is shown to be important for processing both positive and negative effects, but glutamatergic pathways between the BLA and NAc are specifically associated with reward-seeking behaviours. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence1,2,3,4,5,21,22,23. The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours4,6,7,24,25, but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W2026751327,"Rett's syndrome (RTT) is an X-chromosome-linked autism spectrum disorder caused by loss of function of the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although MeCP2 is expressed in most tissues, loss of MeCP2 expression results primarily in neurological symptoms. Earlier studies suggested the idea that RTT is due exclusively to loss of MeCP2 function in neurons. Although defective neurons clearly underlie the aberrant behaviours, we and others showed recently that the loss of MECP2 from glia negatively influences neurons in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Here we show that in globally MeCP2-deficient mice, re-expression of Mecp2 preferentially in astrocytes significantly improved locomotion and anxiety levels, restored respiratory abnormalities to a normal pattern, and greatly prolonged lifespan compared to globally null mice. Furthermore, restoration of MeCP2 in the mutant astrocytes exerted a non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons in vivo, restoring normal dendritic morphology and increasing levels of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1. Our study shows that glia, like neurons, are integral components of the neuropathology of RTT, and supports the targeting of glia as a strategy for improving the associated symptoms."

We demonstrate the knotting of microscopic topological defect lines in chiral nematic liquid crystal colloids into knots and links of arbitrary complexity by using laser tweezers as a micromanipulation tool. All knots and links with up to six crossings, including the Hopf link, the Star of David and the Borromean rings are demonstrated, stabilizing colloidal particles into an unusual soft matter. The knots in chiral nematic colloids are classified by the quantized self-linking number, a direct measure of the geometric, or Berry's, phase. Forming arbitrary microscopic knots and links in chiral nematic colloids is a demonstration of how relevant the topology can be for the material engineering of soft matter."

https://openalex.org/W2160781585,"Long-term spaceflight induces hypokinesia and hypodynamia, which, along microgravity per se, result in a number of significant physiological alterations, such as muscle atrophy, force reduction, insulin resistance, substrate use shift from fats to carbohydrates, and bone loss. Each of these adaptations could turn to serious health deterioration during the long-term spaceflight needed for planetary exploration. We hypothesized that resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenol, could be used as a nutritional countermeasure to prevent muscle metabolic and bone adaptations to 15 d of rat hindlimb unloading. RES treatment maintained a net protein balance, soleus muscle mass, and soleus muscle maximal force contraction. RES also fully maintained soleus mitochondrial capacity to oxidize palmitoyl-carnitine and reversed the decrease of the glutathione vs. glutathione disulfide ratio, a biomarker of oxidative stress. At the molecular level, the protein content of Sirt-1 and COXIV in soleus muscle was also preserved. RES further protected whole-body insulin sensitivity and lipid trafficking and oxidation, and this was likely associated with the maintained expression of FAT/CD36, CPT-1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) in muscle. Finally, chronic RES supplementation maintained the bone mineral density and strength of the femur. For the first time, we report a simple countermeasure that prevents the deleterious adaptations of the major physiological functions affected by mechanical unloading. RES could thus be envisaged as a nutritional countermeasure for spaceflight but remains to be tested in humans."

Most P450s accomplish monooxygenation by reductive activation of molecular oxygen using NADPH or NADH to produce compound I (oxoferryl porphyrin π cation radical). P450s also use H2O2 to generate compound I, but the efficiency of this reaction is poor compared with that of reductive activation of molecular oxygen. In 1994, Matsunaga et al. (28Matsunaga I. Kusunose E. Yano I. Ichihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) isolated P450SPα (CYP152B1) from Sphingomonas paucimobilis and reported that it exclusively uses H2O2 as the oxidant and catalyzes α-selective (100%) hydroxylation of long alkyl chain fatty acids (29Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although P450SPα is the first P450 to be classified as a family of H2O2-dependent P450, its crystal structure has not been determined despite its potential as a biocatalyst. The first crystal structure of H2O2-dependent P450, P450BSβ (CYP152A1), which has 44% amino acid identity to P450SPα, was reported in 2003 by Lee et al. (30Lee D.S. Yamada A. Sugimoto H. Matsunaga I.

The crystal structure of a substrate-bound form of P450BSβ (Protein Data Bank code 1IZO) revealed that P450BSβ lacks general acid-base residues around the distal side of the heme, although this arrangement is highly conserved among peroxidases and peroxygenases (31Poulos T.L.

Instead of the general acid-base residues, the terminal carboxylate group of the bound fatty acid interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg242 located near the heme group. The distance between an oxygen atom of the carboxylate group of palmitic acid and the heme iron is 5.3 Å, which is similar to that observed in chloroperoxidase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago; the distance between an oxygen atom of glutamic acid side chain and the heme iron is 5.1 Å (34Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 35Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 461-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The location of the carboxylate group of palmitic acid bound to P450BSβ suggests that the general acid-base function for the facile formation of compound I is accomplished by the carboxylate group of the substrate (Scheme 1). Recently, we have shown that P450BSβ is able to catalyze H2O2-dependent monooxygenation of foreign compounds such as styrene and ethylbenzene in the presence of a carboxylic acid with a short alkyl chain (C4–C10), a so-called “decoy molecule” (36Shoji O. Fujishiro T. Nakajima H. Kim M. Nagano S. Shiro Y. Watanabe Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3656-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a heptanoic acid (C7)-bound form of P450BSβ was analyzed, and an interaction between Arg242 and the carboxylate group of heptanoic acid was detected. We also resolved the crystal structure of the substrate-free form of P450BSβ and found that binding of fatty acid or substrate analogues did not induce any notable structural change, whereas the substrate-free form of P450BSβ never reacts with H2O2 (37Shoji O. Fujishiro T. Nagano S. Tanaka S. Hirose T. Shiro Y. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2010; 15: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations further confirm that substrate binding initiates the formation of compound I via a salt bridge between Arg242 and the carboxylate group at the active site. cytochrome P450 cytochrome P450 isolated from S. paucimobilis (CYP152B1) cytochrome P450 isolated from Bacillus subtilis (CYP152A1) cytochrome P450 isolated from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) cytochrome P450 isolated from Pseudomonas putida (CYP101A1) (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid β-hydroxymyristic acid α-hydroxymyristic acid myristic acid chloroperoxidase. P450BSβ oxidizes the α- and β-positions of fatty acids in a 40:60 ratio, whereas P450SPα exclusively oxidizes the α position. To elucidate the cause of this selectivity, we need to study the crystal structures of both enzymes. Although the crystal structure of the substrate-bound form of P450BSβ is known, that of P450SPα has not been resolved. Therefore, we crystallized P450SPα and succeeded in preparing high quality crystals of P450SPα. Herein we describe the x-ray crystal structure of P450SPα containing a fatty acid at a resolution of 1.65 Å and examine enzymatic properties of its mutants to study its highly selective α-hydroxylation of fatty acids. We also compare the structure of P450SPα with that of P450BSβ in the context of similarities and differences among H2O2-dependent P450s. P450SPα WT was concentrated to 13.4 mg/ml in 50 mm MES (pH 7.0) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol by centrifugation using Amicon Ultra filter units (Millipore, Co.). A 2-μl aliquot of the concentrated P450SPα solution was mixed with 2 μl of a reservoir solution composed of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) and 35% (v/v) MPD. Crystals of P450SPα were grown by a sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C for 6 days. The P450SPα L78F and F288G mutants were crystallized under the same conditions used for the WT. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected on a beam line BL41XU instrument equipped with an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector at the RIKEN SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) with a 1.0 Å wavelength at 100 K.

The resulting model had a final Rfact of 15.1% and an Rfree of 17.3% (Table 1).

All of the protein figures were depicted using PyMOL (52DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Moleular Graphics System on World Wide Web. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0–120 μm myristic acid (C14) (0–60 μm for F288G and A172F/F288G), 50 nm P450SPα or P450BSβ, and 200 μm H2O2 in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 min, and then the reaction was quenched by adding 500 μl of dichloromethane followed by vigorous mixing. After the addition of 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid as an internal standard, the products were extracted with dichloromethane. For derivatization of the extract, 50 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1% (v/v) trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was added, and the mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. The derivatized products were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Shimadzu GC/MS-QP5000 and Rxi™-5ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA) to identify the products. The GC/MS analytical conditions were as follows: column temperature, 50 °C (1 min) to 40 °C/min (5 min) to 250 °C (8 min); injection temperature, 250 °C; interface temperature, 280 °C; carrier gas, helium; flow rate, 0.9 ml/min, mode, split mode; and split ratio, 1/50. To quantify the products, derivatization of the extract was performed by adding 9-anthryldiazomethane and incubating the solution in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. For quantification of the products, reverse phase HPLC analysis was performed using an Inertsil® ODS-3 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm; GL Sciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) installed on a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system controller equipped with Shimadzu LC-10ADVP pump systems, a Shimadzu RF-10AXL fluorescence spectrometer, a Shimadzu CTO-10AVP column oven, and a Shimadzu DGU-12A degasser. The HPLC analytical conditions were as follows: flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; acetonitrile/water = 99/1; column temperature, 30 °C; excitation wavelength, 365 nm, emission wavelength, 412 nm; and retention times, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (6.41 min), β-OH C14 (10.7 min), α-OH C14 (11.9 min), and C14 (21.5 min). Chiral separation of the products was performed on a CHIRALPAK AD-RH column (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) installed on the same reverse phase HPLC system as in the case of the quantification. The absolute configuration was assigned by comparison of the product ratios in the hydroxylation of C14 by P450SPα WT (53Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Ayata M. Ogura H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and P450BSβ WT (54Matsunaga I. Sumimoto T. Ueda A. Kusunose E. Ichihara K. Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The HPLC conditions for the chiral separation were as follows: flow rate, 0.9 ml/min; linear gradient, MeOH/water = 85/15 (0–10 min) to 100/0 (100–120 min); column temperature, 40 °C; excitation, 365 nm; emission, 412 nm; retention times, (R)-α-OH C14 (34.2 min), (S)-α-OH C14 (37.6 min), (S)-β-OH C14 (49.8 min), and (R)-β-OH C1 (53.2 min). UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2400 PC spectrophotometer at room temperature. X-band EPR spectra were recorded using an E500 X-band CW-EPR instrument (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) at 10 K. A cryostat (ITC503; Oxford Instruments Co., Abingdon, UK) was used for measurements at low temperatures. The structure of P450SPα was resolved at a resolution of 1.65 Å (Fig. 1). One molecule was observed in the asymmetric unit. The overall structure exhibited typical P450 folding with 17 α helices and three β sheets. It has a trigonal prism-shaped structure with the heme buried deep inside the protein. The I helix lays across the interior of the P450 molecule on the distal side of the heme group. Two channels connecting the active site cavity with the protein surface were identified (Fig. 1). Channel I is composed of hydrophobic residues (Ile73, Leu77, Leu78, Phe169, Ala172, Ala245, Phe287, Phe288, Pro289, Leu398, and Pro399) (Fig. 2A). Channel II includes hydrophilic residues (Gln84 and Asn238) as its constituent residues. A cluster of water molecules with a hydrogen-bonding network was observed in Channel II (Fig. 2D). We expect that Channel II would be used for the ingress of H2O2 and the egress of water during the reaction. Phe288 is located at the border of the two channels, but the two channels are not clearly separated because the entrances of the channels are wide (Figs. 1, B and C, and 3A).FIGURE 2The heme cavity of P450SPα.

One of the ends of this electron density, located near Arg241 in the active site, has a Y-shape. Because the shape of this electron density is very similar to that of a long alkyl chain fatty acid observed in P450BM3 (21Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and P450BSβ (30Lee D.S. Yamada A. Sugimoto H. Matsunaga I. Ogura H. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9761-9767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we assumed that this electron density corresponds to a long alkyl chain fatty acid originating from Escherichia coli cells (55Allen E.E. Bartlett D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, GC/MS analysis of the extract of the purified P450SPα with dichloromethane showed that palmitic acid and stearic acid were coexistent, even after purification (supplemental Fig. S1). It was difficult to deduce the length of the alkyl chain of the fatty acid based on the electron density of the substrate(s) because the electron density of the substrate was shorter than the alkyl chain of palmitic acid, possibly because of disordering. Therefore, we tentatively assigned this electron density to palmitic acid. In addition, because the Y-shaped electron density adjacent to the Arg241 was accompanied by an additional electron density, two alternative conformations with occupancies of 0.7 (Conformation A) and 0.3 (Conformation B) were placed and refined (Fig. 2, B and C). The terminal alkyl chain of palmitic acid in the final structure is highly disordered, indicating that the terminal alkyl chain is loosely fixed. It is noteworthy that the A′-helix, B′-helix, and F–G loop have relatively high B-factors (Fig. 3B) and that the entrance of Channel I is open wide (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this region is flexible even though the substrate was accommodated. The substrate access channel and B-factor of P450BSβ are shown in supplemental Fig. S2 for comparison. The charge distribution on the surfaces of the proximal and distal sides of P450SPα is shown in Fig. 4. In contrast to the charge distribution typical of P450s such as P450BM3 (56Sevrioukova I.F.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 608-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), negative surface charges were observed on the proximal side of P450SPα. A positive surface potential on the proximal side of regular P450 is important for the recognition of reductases in the electron transfer step of oxygen activation in the P450 catalytic cycle (58Nagano S. Tosha T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42844-42849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The negative surface potential on the proximal side of P450SPα may preclude binding of a reductase. This unique charge potential distribution of P450SPα is an indication that P450SPα does not need binding of a reductase and prefers the H2O2 shunt pathway. P450BSβ also has no positively charged region on the surface of the proximal side. In addition, a long loop structure was observed on the proximal side (349QGGGDHYLGHRC361) (Fig. 5), whereas P450s that require electron transfer from reductases have short loop structures. P450cam, for example, has a short loop structure, 350FGHGSHLC357. P450BSβ (352QGGGHAEKGHRC363) (30Lee D.S. Yamada A. Sugimoto H. Matsunaga I. Ogura H. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. J.

https://openalex.org/W2024278252,"Derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) opens a new avenue for future applications of regenerative medicine. However, before iPSCs can be used in a clinical setting, it is critical to validate their in vivo fate following autologous transplantation. Thus far, preclinical studies have been limited to small animals and have yet to be conducted in large animals that are physiologically more similar to humans. In this study, we report the first autologous transplantation of iPSCs in a large animal model through the generation of canine iPSCs (ciPSCs) from the canine adipose stromal cells and canine fibroblasts of adult mongrel dogs. We confirmed pluripotency of ciPSCs using the following techniques: (i) immunostaining and quantitative PCR for the presence of pluripotent and germ layer-specific markers in differentiated ciPSCs; (ii) microarray analysis that demonstrates similar gene expression profiles between ciPSCs and canine embryonic stem cells; (iii) teratoma formation assays; and (iv) karyotyping for genomic stability. Fate of ciPSCs autologously transplanted to the canine heart was tracked in vivo using clinical positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. To demonstrate clinical potential of ciPSCs to treat models of injury, we generated endothelial cells (ciPSC-ECs) and used these cells to treat immunodeficient murine models of myocardial infarction and hindlimb ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2166167634,"A growing awareness indicates that many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exist as homodimers, but the extent of the cooperativity across the dimer interface has been largely unexplored. Here, measurement of the dissociation kinetics of a fluorescent agonist (ABA-X-BY630) from the human A(1) or A(3) adenosine receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells has provided evidence for highly cooperative interactions between protomers of the A(3)-receptor dimer in single living cells. In the absence of competitive ligands, the dissociation rate constants of ABA-X-BY630 from A(1) and A(3) receptors were 1.45 ± 0.05 and 0.57 ± 0.07 min(-1), respectively. At the A(3) receptor, this could be markedly increased by both orthosteric agonists and antagonists [15-, 9-, and 19-fold for xanthine amine congener (XAC), 5'-(N-ethyl carboxamido)adenosine (NECA), and adenosine, respectively] and reduced by coexpression of a nonbinding (N250A) A(3)-receptor mutant. The changes in ABA-X-BY630 dissociation were much lower at the A(1) receptor (1.5-, 1.4-, and 1.5-fold). Analysis of the pEC(50) values of XAC, NECA, and adenosine for the ABA-X-BY630-occupied A(3)-receptor dimer yielded values of 6.0 ± 0.1, 5.9 ± 0.1, and 5.2 ± 0.1, respectively. This study provides new insight into the spatial and temporal specificity of drug action that can be provided by allosteric modulation across a GPCR homodimeric interface."
https://openalex.org/W2088979187,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of endogenous cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) receptors do not reach the cell surface but are instead associated with endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Using calcium imaging and intracellular microinjection in CB(1) receptor-transfected HEK293 cells and NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells, we provide evidence that anandamide acting on CB(1) receptors increases intracellular calcium concentration when administered intracellularly but not extracellularly. The calcium-mobilizing effect of intracellular anandamide was dose-dependent and abolished by pretreatment with SR141716A, a CB(1) receptor antagonist. The anandamide-induced calcium increase was reduced by blocking nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate- or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent calcium release and abolished when both lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum calcium release pathways were blocked. Taken together, our results indicate that, in CB(1) receptor-transfected HEK293 cells, intracellular CB(1) receptors are functional; they are located in acid-filled calcium stores (endolysosomes). Activation of intracellular CB(1) receptors releases calcium from endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomal calcium stores. In addition, our results support a novel role for nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate in cannabinoid-induced calcium signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2095929959,"Many central metabolic processes require iron as a cofactor and take place in specific subcellular compartments such as the mitochondrion or the chloroplast. Proper iron allocation in the different organelles is thus critical to maintain cell function and integrity. To study the dynamics of iron distribution in plant cells, we have sought to identify the different intracellular iron pools by combining three complementary imaging approaches, histochemistry, micro particle-induced x-ray emission, and synchrotron radiation micro X-ray fluorescence. Pea (Pisum sativum) embryo was used as a model in this study because of its large cell size and high iron content. Histochemical staining with ferrocyanide and diaminobenzidine (Perls/diaminobenzidine) strongly labeled a unique structure in each cell, which co-labeled with the DNA fluorescent stain DAPI, thus corresponding to the nucleus. The unexpected presence of iron in the nucleus was confirmed by elemental imaging using micro particle-induced x-ray emission. X-ray fluorescence on cryo-sectioned embryos further established that, quantitatively, the iron concentration found in the nucleus was higher than in the expected iron-rich organelles such as plastids or vacuoles. Moreover, within the nucleus, iron was particularly accumulated in a subcompartment that was identified as the nucleolus as it was shown to transiently disassemble during cell division. Taken together, our data uncover an as yet unidentified although abundant iron pool in the cell, which is located in the nuclei of healthy, actively dividing plant tissues. This result paves the way for the discovery of a novel cellular function for iron related to nucleus/nucleolus-associated processes.

This result paves the way for the discovery of a novel cellular function for iron related to nucleus/nucleolus-associated processes. Metal ions play multiple structural and catalytic functions in living cells. Iron is among the most important essential metals because it serves as a cofactor in many metabolic processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, cell division, and fatty acid and branched amino acid biosynthesis. Most of these reactions take place in intracellular organelles that represent as many sinks for iron. The subcellular distribution of iron and its dynamics between compartments are scarcely documented and rely mostly on fragmented biochemical estimations. For instance, with a complete electron transfer chain containing 22 iron atoms, chloroplasts are considered as obvious sites of high iron accumulation in plant cells (1Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In animal cells, mitochondria and lysosomes, in particular those involved in autophagic degradation of iron-rich macromolecules, are expected to contain rather high concentrations of iron as well (2Kurz T. Terman A. Gustafsson B. Brunk U.T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 389-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because iron can react with oxygen and generate oxidative stress, living cells prevent both iron-promoted toxicity and iron shortage by maintaining a strict balance between transport, storage, and recycling of iron in each compartment. The deregulation of iron compartmentalization is very often associated, in animal systems, with neurodegenerative pathologies. For example, mutations of the mitochondrial protein frataxin result in increased iron accumulation as well as altered iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria, causing a human disease called Friedreich ataxia (3Gordon N. Brain Dev. 2000; 22: 465-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Ristow M. Kispal G. Lill R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Likewise, the etiology of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases is associated with the accumulation of iron deposits in specific regions of the brain (5Zecca L. Youdim M.B. Riederer P. Connor J.R. Crichton R.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). In the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, the alteration of iron distribution in two important organelles, the chloroplast and the vacuole, severely impacts plant growth. Indeed, the disruption of the FRO7 gene, encoding a ferric reductase located at the chloroplast surface, results in decreased chloroplastic iron accumulation, severe leaf chlorosis, and impaired growth on iron-limited soils (6Jeong J. Cohu C. Kerkeb L. Pilon M. Connolly E.L. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, the vacuoles were identified as the main storage site of iron in mature Arabidopsis embryos (7Roschzttardtz H. Conéjéro G. Curie C. Mari S. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). During embryo development, iron loading into these vacuoles is mediated by VIT1, an iron/manganese tonoplastic transporter (8Kim S.A. Punshon T. Lanzirotti A. Li L. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Kaplan J. Guerinot M.L. Science. 2006; 314: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), whereas the remobilization of this vacuolar iron pool during early germination requires the efflux activity of the two cation metal transporters NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 (7Roschzttardtz H. Conéjéro G. Curie C. Mari S. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Lanquar V. Lelièvre F. Bolte S. Hamès C. Alcon C. Neumann D. Vansuyt G. Curie C.

Abolition of vacuolar influx in a vit1 mutant or efflux in an nramp3 nramp4 double mutant similarly impairs post-germinative growth under iron-limited conditions (8Kim S.A. Punshon T. Lanzirotti A.

Crucial in both studies was having recourse to elemental imaging techniques (synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence for the study of VIT1 and energy-dispersive x-ray microscopy for NRAMP3 and NRAMP4) to reveal the subtle changes in iron distribution occurring in seeds of the mutants, not detectable otherwise. These two studies perfectly illustrated the power of combining molecular genetics with sophisticated elemental imaging approaches to unravel the function of several transporters in metal homeostasis. We have undertaken the analysis of iron distribution in plant cells using several imaging approaches. In particular, we have utilized the Perls/DAB 3The abbreviations used are: DABdiaminobenzidineμPIXEmicro particle-induced x-ray emissionμXRFmicro X-ray fluorescence. histochemical staining method, which we had previously adapted to plant cells and which is characterized by a sensitivity and resolution high enough to allow intracellular iron detection (7Roschzttardtz H.

Here we report on the unexpected finding that the nucleus is also an iron-rich organelle in plant cells. It is likely that this compartment has been ignored, or at least overlooked, in the past because high spatial resolution iron distribution has so far been addressed in very few reported studies. Pea embryos were dissected from developing seeds of pea plants (Pisum sativum) grown in pots in a greenhouse and irrigated with water. Embryos from pea and leaf fragments from A. thaliana and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) were vacuum-infiltrated with the fixation solution containing 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 1% (w/v) caffeine in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) for 30 min and incubated for 15 h in the same solution. The fixed samples were washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) three times and dehydrated in successive baths of 50, 70, 90, 95, and 100 ethanol, butanol/ethanol 1:1 (v/v), and 100% butanol. Then, the tissues were embedded in the Technovit 7100 resin (Heraeus Kulzer) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and thin sections (5 mm) were made. The sections were deposited on glass slides that were incubated for 45 min in Perls stain solution, except for negative controls. After washing with distillated water, the glass slides were incubated in a methanol solution containing 0.01 m NaN3 and 0.3% (v/v) H2O2 for 1 h and then washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For the intensification reaction, samples were then incubated between 10 and 30 min in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) solution containing 0.025% (w/v) DAB (Sigma), 0.005% (v/v) H2O2, and 0.005% (w/v) CoCl2 (intensification solution). Rinsing with distilled water stopped the reaction. The thin sections were first stained with Perls/DAB, as described above, and then stained with DAPI. The glass slides were incubated in a 2 μg·ml−1 (w/v) solution of DAPI for 5 min in the dark and rinsed with distilled water. Observations were realized using a Leica DM6000 microscope equipped with an A4 filter (excitation, 340–380 nm; emission, 450–490 nm). Embryos, dissected from seeds, were immersed in optimum cutting formulation (OCT, Sakura Finetek, Leiden, The Netherlands) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The solid blocks obtained were then sectioned (30–40 μm thickness) using a cryomicrotome (the sample holder was kept at −50 °C, whereas the sample atmosphere was set at −18 °C). The resulting slides were deposited on Ultralene films (Spex Certiprep) and kept in liquid nitrogen until introduced in the analysis chamber of the Light for Ultimate Characterization by Imaging and Absorption (LUCIA) synchrotron beamline. The pea (P. sativum) embryo was chosen as plant material in this work for several reasons: (i) its high iron content (200–400 ppm) that is above the detection threshold of elemental imaging techniques (micro particle-induced x-ray emission (μPIXE) and micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF)); (ii) the large size of its cells and organelles that facilitates imaging analyses; and (iii) the fact that, together with other legume seeds, it represents a widespread staple food for humans, which makes it an excellent target for biotechnological engineering of seed nutritional quality. In a first approach, pea embryos were dissected from developing seeds and stained with Perls/DAB. Pea embryonic cells exhibited a strongly stained structure (Fig. 1b), invisible in control sections without Perls (Fig. 1a), which resembled a nucleus (Fig. 1a). The nuclear identity of this compartment was confirmed by counterstaining the histological sections with DAPI (Fig. 1, c and d). Although we had previously established that the Perls/DAB technique is specific for iron, we sought to confirm this result with an elemental imaging approach (7Roschzttardtz H. Conéjéro G. Curie C. Mari S. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Unstained histological sections were thus analyzed by μPIXE using a proton beam of 1-μm diameter at the AIFIRA facility (10Carmona A. Devès G. Ortega R. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2008; 390: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As expected, whenever a nucleus could be identified by light microscopy (Fig. 1, e and f), the μPIXE imaging analysis revealed the presence of high concentrations of iron (Fig. 1, g and h), confirming the existence of a pool of iron in the nucleus. This observation is not a particular feature of pea embryos because in leaf cells from A. thaliana and tomato, the nuclei were also strongly stained with Perls/DAB (Fig. 1, i and j, respectively). To rule out the possibility that this iron distribution was somehow caused by sample processing for histological analyses, we then performed synchrotron radiation μXRF on cryofixed and cryosectioned pea embryos. The cryosections were kept in liquid nitrogen until the introduction in the beamline chamber, and the following analyses were performed in cryogenic conditions (130 K) to maintain the cellular and chemical integrity throughout the process of elemental mapping. The average size of a pea embryonic cell, its vacuole, and its nucleus are, respectively, 60–70, 40–50, and 15 μm. Given that the lateral resolution of the synchrotron beam utilized is 2.5 × 3.5 μm, we could analyze zones of 100 × 100 μm and obtain elemental mapping within compartments of a whole cell. The mapping of potassium was used as a canvas to locate the vacuolar compartment, where most of the potassium is stored, and thus depict cell-to-cell limits and focus on a single cell (Fig. 2a). Iron detection showed a strong 20 × 10-μm signal (Fig. 2b), a size that is compatible with that of the nucleus, clearly visible on a histological section of a comparable cell (Fig. 2c). Merging both iron and potassium maps clearly showed that the iron-rich zones are adjacent to the potassium-rich vacuolar structures (Fig. 2d), which again is consistent with iron being located in the nucleus. By increasing the fluorescence scale so as to saturate the nuclear signal, several other pools of iron appeared in the cell periphery and in the vacuole (Fig. 2, e and f). Taken together, these results clearly establish that, besides the usual organelles, the nucleus represents a novel site of massive iron accumulation in the cell. A detailed observation of the Perls/DAB-stained iron pool within the nucleus indicated that it is restricted to a subnuclear domain (Fig. 3a, see also Fig. 1d) that is reminiscent in size and shape to the nucleolus. Because one of the features of the nucleolus is its disorganization during mitosis, we followed the fate of the Perls/DAB-stained nuclear structure during the different stages of cell division, easily identified in pea embryo histological sections stained with DAPI (Fig. 3, i–n). Clearly, the iron-rich structures, still visible during interphase (Fig. 3, c, i, and o) and prophase (Fig. 3, d, j, and p), disappeared from metaphase to telophase (Fig. 3, e, f, g, k, l, m, q, r, s), reappearing in the daughter nuclei at the interphase stage (Fig. 3, h, n, and t). This observation unambiguously identifies the nucleolus as the iron-rich structure in pea cell nuclei. Consistently, fine mapping of the nucleus by μXRF showed that on a section representing a 20 × 10-μm-large nucleus, iron concentration is highest in a 5 × 5-μm sector, a size that is compatible with the measured size of the nucleolus in pea embryo cells (Fig. 3, a and b). The analysis of subcellular iron localization by histochemistry (Perls/DAB) and elemental microanalyses (μPIXE and μXRF) has established without doubt that the nucleus contains detectable amounts of iron. This finding was not restricted to pea because strong nuclear iron staining was also observed in leaves of other species such as A. thaliana and tomato (Fig. 1, i–j). Furthermore, we have shown that within the nucleus, the iron concentration in the nucleolus is the highest encountered among the intracellular compartments. This result is novel and completely unexpected. Indeed, the accumulation of a highly reactive and potentially toxic metal in the very close vicinity of DNA and RNA is rather counterintuitive. In mammals, the nuclei of healthy cells barely contain detectable amounts of iron (11Carmona A. Cloetens P. Deves G. Bohic S. Ortega R. J. Anal. At.

Therefore our findings challenge the widely admitted idea that in animals, the presence of iron in nuclei is a sign of disease. Our finding raises the important question of the role that nucleolar iron plays in plant cells. If the nucleolus requires such high amounts of iron, it is conceivable that iron atoms might be associated to a very abundant class of molecules. Because the main function of the nucleolus is to synthesize ribosomal RNA, it is tempting to speculate that iron is somehow involved in the metabolism of rRNA. Moreover, because it is difficult to conceive that such a high amount of iron corresponds to the cofactor of a specific enzyme, a possibility exists that iron in the nucleolus might be directly bound to rRNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, rRNA has been shown to bind high amounts of iron, both in vitro (17Honda K. Smith M.A. Zhu X. Baus D. Merrick W.C. Tartakoff A.M. Hattier T. Harris P.L. Siedlak S.L.

It is thus possible that in plants, iron is required during ribosomal RNA biosynthesis in the nucleolus, either by promoting or stabilizing the secondary structure or by catalyzing maturation of the different rRNA subunits. Taken together, our data have revealed a new intracellular site where high amounts of iron atoms are needed, for a function that remains to be identified. Consequently, this finding should lead to reconsidering the overall scheme of iron requirements and distribution at the intracellular level in plant cells, including the nucleolus as a new player from now on. This work has clearly illustrated that healthy cells can accumulate and tolerate high amounts of iron in their nucleus without being a sign of a particular dysfunction. This peculiar feature of plant nuclei could reflect the fact that iron plays a plant-specific function. Plant cells must have evolved highly efficient mechanisms, still unidentified, to protect the nucleus from the potential deleterious effects of iron.

https://openalex.org/W1985385208,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is often a consequence of excessive mechanical loading of cartilage, which produces hydrostatic stress, tensile strain, and fluid flow. Application of high fluid shear to chondrocytes recapitulates the earmarks of OA, as evidenced by the induction of cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandins (PGs), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here, we delineated the signaling pathway by which high fluid shear mediates the temporal regulation of IL-6 synthesis in human chondrocytes. We determined that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and caveolin-1 are binding partners in chondrocytes. Their expression is temporally regulated by fluid shear via the sequential up-regulation of microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and L-PGDS. High shear stress rapidly induces an 8-fold up-regulation of TLR4 expression via an mPGES-1-dependent pathway, whereas prolonged shear exposure concurrently down-regulates TLR4 by >4-fold and up-regulates caveolin-1 expression by > 2.5-fold in an L-PGDS-dependent manner. TLR4 and caveolin-1 exert opposing effects on the activation of ERK1/2, PI3-K and PKA signaling pathways, which, in turn, regulate the NF-κB-dependent IL-6 synthesis in a time-dependent fashion. Reconstructing the signaling network regulating shear-induced IL-6 expression in chondrocytes may provide insights for developing therapeutic strategies to combat osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2037714888,"Arrestins bind active phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors, blocking G protein activation and channeling the signaling to G protein-independent pathways. Free arrestin-3 and receptor-bound arrestin-3 scaffold the ASK1-MKK4-JNK3 module, promoting JNK3 phosphorylation, whereas highly homologous arrestin-2 does not. Here, we used arrestin-2/3 chimeras and mutants to identify key residues of arrestin-3 responsible for its ability to facilitate JNK3 activation. Our data demonstrate that both arrestin domains are involved in JNK3 activation, with the C-terminal domain being more important than the N-terminal domain. We found that Val-343 is the key contributor to this function, whereas Leu-278, Ser-280, His-350, Asp-351, His-352, and Ile-353 play supporting roles. We also show that the arrestin-3-specific difference in the arrangement of the β-strands in the C-terminal domain that underlies its lower selectivity for active phosphoreceptors does not play an appreciable role in its ability to enhance JNK3 activation. Importantly, the strength of the binding of ASK1 or JNK3, as revealed by the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation, does not correlate with the ability of arrestin proteins to promote ASK1-dependent JNK3 phosphorylation. Thus, multiple residues on the non-receptor-binding side of arrestin-3 are crucial for JNK3 activation, and this function and the receptor-binding characteristics of arrestin can be manipulated independently by targeted mutagenesis."

However, its function in inflammation is not known. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in solar UV light-induced inflammation. In this study, we found that TOPK negatively regulated the activity of p38α by phosphorylating the p38α-specific phosphatase MKP1 and enhancing the stability of MKP1. Notably, the absence of TOPK in mice resulted in a striking increase in skin inflammation. Therefore, we conclude that TOPK has a protective function in solar UV light-induced inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2050875658,"Conformational changes acutely control protein kinase C (PKC). We have previously shown that the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate must be removed from the active site in order for 1) PKC to be phosphorylated by its upstream kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), 2) the mature enzyme to bind and phosphorylate substrates, and 3) the mature enzyme to be dephosphorylated by phosphatases. Here we show an additional level of conformational control; binding of active site inhibitors locks PKC in a conformation in which the priming phosphorylation sites are resistant to dephosphorylation. Using homogeneously pure PKC, we show that the active site inhibitor Gö 6983 prevents the dephosphorylation by pure protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or the hydrophobic motif phosphatase, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP). Consistent with results using pure proteins, treatment of cells with the competitive inhibitors Gö 6983 or bisindolylmaleimide I, but not the uncompetitive inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide IV, prevents the dephosphorylation and down-regulation of PKC induced by phorbol esters. Pulse-chase analyses reveal that active site inhibitors do not affect the net rate of priming phosphorylations of PKC; rather, they inhibit the dephosphorylation triggered by phorbol esters.

These data provide a molecular explanation for the recent studies showing that active site inhibitors stabilize the phosphorylation state of protein kinases B/Akt and C. PKC isozymes comprise a family of multidomain proteins that are under exquisite conformational control. Two major mechanisms control the conformation of PKC family members: phosphorylation and second messenger-dependent membrane binding (1Newton A.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E395-E402Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 2Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). First, newly synthesized enzymes undergo a series of ordered phosphorylations that lock the enzyme into a stable, catalytically competent, and autoinhibited species (3Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 4Cameron A.J. De Rycker M. Calleja V. Alcor D. Kjaer S. Kostelecky B. Saurin A. Faisal A. Laguerre M. Hemmings B.A. McDonald N. Larijani B. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This species is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation by a pseudosubstrate segment that blocks the substrate-binding cavity, a conformation that also protects the priming sites of PKC from dephosphorylation. The inactive species are localized throughout the cell, often tethered to scaffold proteins (5Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This processing by phosphorylation is constitutive and required to protect PKC from degradation; unphosphorylated protein is rapidly degraded (1Newton A.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E395-E402Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Second, binding to lipid second messengers allosterically controls the enzyme by facilitating the release of the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate segment from the substrate-binding cavity (6Newton A.C. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S266-S271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, this conformational transition is acutely controlled by activation of receptors that signal using diacylglycerol as the second messenger. The membrane-bound conformation has an increased sensitivity to phosphatases by 2 orders of magnitude (7Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and prolonged activation, as occurs with phorbol esters (functional analogues of diacylglycerol), results in the dephosphorylation and subsequent degradation of PKC (8Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation converts newly synthesized PKC into a stable, degradation-resistant conformation, and membrane binding converts PKC into a catalytically active but degradation-sensitive conformation. The PKC family is composed of nine genes (9Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J.

Although the phosphorylation of PKC isozymes is constitutive, occurring with a half-time of ∼15 min following its biosynthesis (19Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of PKC is agonist-dependent. Dephosphorylated PKC is rapidly degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway (20Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol.

Phorbol esters promote the “down-regulation” of PKC because they recruit PKC to membranes, expelling the pseudosubstrate and thus increasing phosphatase sensitivity. The recently discovered phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) selectively dephosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (23Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), an event that shunts PKC to the detergent-insoluble fraction, where it becomes dephosphorylated at the remaining priming sites, ubiquitinated, and then ultimately degraded (8Hansra G.

Thus, the steady-state levels of PKC are set by the balance of phosphorylation versus dephosphorylation. Indeed, modulation of the levels of PHLPP in mammalian cells by either overexpression or genetic silencing directly sets the levels of intracellular PKC, thus setting the gain of the PKC signal. Decreased levels of PHLPP in colon cancer cell lines have been shown to directly correlate with greatly elevated PKC levels (23Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanisms to control the phosphorylation state of PKC impact the steady-state levels of the kinase. Two recent studies have shown that inhibitors increase the steady-state levels of phosphorylated PKC and its close cousin, Akt (25Okuzumi T. Fiedler D. Zhang C. Gray D.C. Aizenstein B. Hoffman R.

In the case of Akt, which is not basally phosphorylated, treatment of cells with active site inhibitors increased the steady-state levels of phosphorylated Akt (25Okuzumi T. Fiedler D. Zhang C.

In the case of PKC, which is constitutively phosphorylated, Parker and co-workers (26Cameron A.J. Escribano C. Saurin A.T. Kostelecky B. Parker P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of cells with active site-directed inhibitors resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation state of a catalytically impaired PKC that is not normally phosphorylated. This construct, in which the Lys that coordinates the α-β phosphates of ATP is mutated to Met or Arg, accumulates as the non-phosphorylated species under normal conditions, but accumulates as the phosphorylated species when cells are preincubated with ATP analogues such as bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I). Whether these inhibitors increase the steady-state levels of phosphorylated PKC by increasing the rate of priming phosphorylation or by protecting phosphorylated PKC from dephosphorylation was unresolved. This latter possibility is supported by previous data showing that occupancy of the active site by the pseudosubstrate, peptide substrates, or ATP protects PKC from dephosphorylation (27Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Srivastava J. Goris J. Dilworth S.M. Parker P.J.

Here we address the molecular mechanism by which occupancy of the active site with ATP analogues affects the phosphorylation state of PKC. We show that active site inhibitors prevent the dephosphorylation of pure protein in vitro and prevent the phorbol ester-mediated dephosphorylation of endogenous and overexpressed PKC in cells. Pulse-chase analysis reveals that the inhibitors do not alter the net rate of priming phosphorylations of endogenous PKC; rather, they protect from dephosphorylation.

COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfection of COS7 cells was carried out using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or the jetPRIME transfection reagent (PolyPlus Transfection). Homogeneously pure PKC βII (50 nm) was incubated with the catalytic subunit of PP1 (25 units ml−1) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 μm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.04 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 140 μm phosphatidylserine/4 μm diacylglycerol for 20 min at 22 °C. Where indicated, reactions were carried out in the presence of 6 μm Gö 6983. Reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody for PKC βII (BD Transduction Laboratories) that labels phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PKC βII equally well.

Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were pretreated with 1 μm Gö 6983 or 10 μm MG-132 for 30 min prior to stimulation with 200 nm PMA for the indicated times. The cells were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF), and whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For inhibitor incubations with Gö 6983 and Bis IV, COS7 cells transiently expressing WT PKC βII or PKC βII-F629A were treated with 6 μm Gö 6983, 6 μm Bis IV or DMSO for 30 min prior to stimulation with 200 nm PDBu for the indicated times.

For inhibitor experiments with chelerythrine and Gö 6976, COS7 cells were pretreated for 15 min with the indicated concentrations of chelerythrine, 500 nm Gö 6976, or vehicle (DMSO) and then treated with 200 nm PMA for 15 min. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. COS7 cells were rinsed with and imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Cellgro) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. For the chelerythrine experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 30 min prior to imaging. CFP, YFP, and FRET images were acquired and analyzed as described previously (30Gallegos L.L. Kunkel M.T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30947-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Base-line images were acquired for 5 or more min before ligand addition. Individual data traces were normalized to 1 by dividing by the average base-line FRET ratio, and data from at least three different imaging dishes were referenced around the ligand addition time point. The normalized average FRET ratio is the average of these corrected values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP statistical software, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). COS7 cells were transfected with WT PKC βII or PKC βII-D466N. At 24–30 h after transfection, cells were incubated with Met/Cys-deficient DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pulse-labeled with 0.5 mCi ml−1 [35S]Met/Cys in Met/Cys-deficient DMEM for 7 min at 37 °C, medium was removed, and cells were chased with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At the indicated times, cells were lysed in Buffer A and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 22 °C, and PKC βII in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKC α monoclonal antibody (cross-reactive with PKC βII) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected with UltraLink protein A/G beads, washed with Buffer A, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. For the inhibitor experiments with MG-132 and Gö 6983, cells were chased in the presence of 10 μm MG-132 or 1 μm Gö 6983 for 90 min and then treated with 200 nm PMA for 4 h. For the Bis I inhibitor/PMA experiment, cells were chased in the presence of 2 μm Bis I, and then at 90 min of chase, cells were treated with 200 nm PMA for the indicated times. Two recent studies reveal that treatment of cells with active site-directed inhibitors of PKC or Akt paradoxically increases the phosphorylation state of these kinases (25Okuzumi T. Fiedler D. Zhang C. Gray D.C. Aizenstein B. Hoffman R. Shokat K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 26Cameron A.J. Escribano C. Saurin A.T. Kostelecky B. Parker P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism driving the increase in steady-state phosphorylation levels, we asked whether binding of inhibitors 1) increases the maturation rate of PKC or 2) decreases susceptibility of PKC to dephosphorylation. First, we examined whether binding of active site inhibitors alters the sensitivity of PKC βII to dephosphorylation. We focused on PKC βII because its maturation by phosphorylation and its dephosphorylation have been extensively studied (3Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Pure PKC βII (from baculovirus expression and thus quantitatively phosphorylated at C-terminal sites and approximately half-phosphorylated at the activation loop site (17Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)) was incubated with pure PP1, either in the presence or in the absence of activating lipids (phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol) and Ca2+ and in the presence or absence of the active site inhibitor Gö 6983. This phosphatase removes all three priming sites of PKC (17Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of PKC βII was assessed by monitoring the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE that accompanies loss of the two C-terminal phosphorylations (7Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The Western blot in Fig. 1A shows that PKC βII was effectively dephosphorylated by PP1 in the membrane-bound conformation (activating conditions, lanes 3 and 4; faster mobility species lacking phosphates at the turn motif and hydrophobic motif is indicated by the dash) but not in the inactive conformation (absence of lipid/Ca2+, lanes 1 and 2; slower mobility species that is quantitatively phosphorylated at the two C-terminal sites is indicated by the asterisk). This result is consistent with our previous studies showing that membrane binding increases the rate of PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of PKC by 2 orders of magnitude (7Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, preincubation with Gö 6983 blocked the dephosphorylation of membrane-bound PKC βII; phosphatase treatment did not result in significant dephosphorylation of PKC βII either in the absence (lanes 5 and 6) or in the presence (lanes 7 and 8) of lipid and Ca2+. These concentrations of Gö 6983 had no effect on the intrinsic activity of PP1 as assessed by dephosphorylation of the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (data not shown); we have previously shown that lipid/Ca2+ do not affect the catalytic activity of PP1 (7Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these data reveal that occupancy of the active site of PKC βII with an active site-directed inhibitor, Gö 6983, locks the enzyme in a more phosphatase-resistant conformation. We next tested whether inhibitor binding also protects PKC from dephosphorylation by PHLPP, the physiological phosphatase that catalyzes the first step in the dephosphorylation of PKC (23Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar): removal of the hydrophobic motif phosphate. Pure PKC α was incubated with the purified phosphatase domain of PHLPP2, under activating conditions, and the dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (Ser-657) was monitored with a phospho-specific antibody. Quantification of the Western blot in Fig. 1B reveals that Gö 6983 reduced the rate of dephosphorylation by PHLPP ∼4-fold. These data support the finding that phosphatase protection by active site inhibitors is an inherent property of the kinase. We next addressed the effect of Gö 6983 on the dephosphorylation of PKC in cells. Dephosphorylation was triggered by treating cells with the phorbol ester, PMA, a potent activator of PKC. Fig. 2A shows that PKC βII expressed in COS7 cells migrates as an upper mobility band (lane 1, asterisk), reflecting quantitative phosphorylation at the two C-terminal sites. Treatment with PMA for 3 h resulted in the accumulation of dephosphorylated PKC (lane 5, faster electrophoretic mobility is indicated by the dash), which represents PKC quantitatively dephosphorylated at both C-terminal sites (17Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar); an intermediate band reflecting loss of phosphate at only one of the C-terminal sites was not observed. Loss of the activation loop phosphate also occurred with identical kinetics as loss of the C-terminal sites; Western blot analysis with a phospho-specific antibody to the activation loop site (Thr-500) revealed that the ratio of phospho-signal to total PKC migrating with the slower mobility was 1:1 for all time points (data not shown). Thus, all three priming sites are lost simultaneously. Treatment for 6 h (lanes 9–12) resulted in almost complete dephosphorylation (lane 9, dash). However, pretreatment of cells with the PKC inhibitor Gö 6983 resulted in a marked reduction in phorbol ester-triggered dephosphorylation as assessed by the trapping of upper mobility (phosphorylated) PKC (lane 10, asterisk). Specifically, the amount of phosphorylated PKC increased 2.5-fold from ∼30% in the absence of Gö 6983 (lane 5) to ∼73% in the presence of inhibitor (lane 6) following 3 h of phorbol ester treatment and from virtually undetectable (<10%) in the absence of inhibitor (lane 9) to ∼60% in the presence of inhibitor (lane 10) following 6 h of phorbol ester treatment. We also examined the effect of Gö 6983 on the phorbol ester-mediated dephosphorylation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, to prevent degradation of the dephosphorylated species of PKC. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor resulted in accumulation of dephosphorylated PKC, with modest accumulation (∼10% of total PKC) observed even in the absence of phorbol ester stimulation (lane 3, dash); this reveals a role of proteasomal degradation in maintaining the basal steady-state levels of PKC. Pretreatment with the active site inhibitor Gö 6983 reduced the amount of basally dephosphorylated PKC (compare the intensity of the faster migrating band (dash) in lanes 3 and 4) and more effectively trapped the phosphorylated species when compared with cells in which the proteasome was not inhibited (compare the intensity of the slower migrating band (asterisk) in lanes 6 and 8 and lanes 10 and 12). Thus, treatment with Gö 6983 prevents the phorbol ester-dependent dephosphorylation of PKC (upper band accumulation), and treatment with MG-132 prevents the degradation of dephosphorylated PKC (lower band accumulation). To investigate whether Gö 6983 affects the rate of down-regulation of endogenous PKC, COS7 cells were pretreated with or without Gö 6983 and stimulated with PMA, and the total protein levels of the predominant conventional isozyme in these cells, PKC α, were examined by Western blot analysis. Note that the rate-limiting step in the down-regulation of endogenous PKC α is the hydrophobic motif dephosphorylation step, and consequently, no dephosphorylated intermediate is observed (it is rapidly degraded) (23Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the disappearance of the upper mobility, fully phosphorylated species. The Western blot in Fig. 2B shows that PMA treatment resulted in the quantitative disappearance of phosphorylated PKC within 4 h, with a half-time of ∼1 h (lanes 1–6). Strikingly, Gö 6983 pretreatment of cells protected PKC from PMA-induced down-regulation, with no significant reduction in the level of phosphorylated enzyme observed following 4 h of PMA treatment (compare lanes 7 and 12).

https://openalex.org/W2043013271,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), initiating signaling cascades leading to cancer metastasis, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Knowledge of the pathway and kinetics of LPA synthesis by ATX is critical for developing quantitative physiological models of LPA signaling. We measured the individual rate constants and pathway of the LPA synthase cycle of ATX using the fluorescent lipid substrates FS-3 and 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-LPC. FS-3 binds rapidly (k(1) ≥500 μm(-1) s(-1)) and is hydrolyzed slowly (k(2) = 0.024 s(-1)). Release of the first hydrolysis product is random and rapid (≥1 s(-1)), whereas release of the second is slow and rate-limiting (0.005-0.007 s(-1)). Substrate binding and hydrolysis are slow and rate-limiting with LPC. Product release is sequential with choline preceding LPA. The catalytic pathway and kinetics depend strongly on the substrate, suggesting that ATX kinetics could vary for the various in vivo substrates. Slow catalysis with LPC reveals the potential for LPA signaling to spread to cells distal to the site of LPC substrate binding by ATX. An ATX mutant in which catalytic threonine at position 210 is replaced with alanine binds substrate weakly, favoring a role for Thr-210 in binding as well as catalysis. FTY720P, the bioactive form of a drug currently used to treat multiple sclerosis, inhibits ATX in an uncompetitive manner and slows the hydrolysis reaction, suggesting that ATX inhibition plays a significant role in lymphocyte immobilization in FTY720P-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1969468997,"A missense single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding the lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase (Lyp) has been identified as a causal factor in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the autoimmune-predisposing variant of Lyp appears to represent a gain-of-function mutation, implicating Lyp as an attractive target for the development of effective strategies for the treatment of many autoimmune disorders. Unfortunately, the precise biological functions of Lyp in signaling cascades and cellular physiology are poorly understood. Identification and characterization of Lyp substrates will help define the chain of molecular events coupling Lyp dysfunction to diseases. In the current study, we identified consensus sequence motifs for Lyp substrate recognition using an ""inverse alanine scanning"" combinatorial library approach. The intrinsic sequence specificity data led to the discovery and characterization of SKAP-HOM, a cytosolic adaptor protein required for proper activation of the immune system, as a bona fide Lyp substrate. To determine the molecular basis for Lyp substrate recognition, we solved crystal structures of Lyp in complex with the consensus peptide as well as the phosphopeptide derived from SKAP-HOM. Together with the biochemical data, the structures define the molecular determinants for Lyp substrate specificity and provide a solid foundation upon which novel therapeutics targeting Lyp can be developed for multiple autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2084889102,"The formation of amyloid-like fibrils is characteristic of various diseases, but the underlying mechanism and the factors that determine whether, when, and how proteins form amyloid, remain uncertain. Certain mechanisms have been proposed based on the three-dimensional or runaway domain swapping, inspired by the fact that some proteins show an apparent correlation between the ability to form domain-swapped dimers and a tendency to form fibrillar aggregates. Intramolecular β-sheet contacts present in the monomeric state could constitute intermolecular β-sheets in the dimeric and fibrillar states. One example is an amyloid-forming mutant of the immunoglobulin binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G, which in its native conformation consists of a four-stranded β-sheet and one α-helix. Under native conditions this mutant adopts a domain-swapped dimer, and it also forms amyloid-like fibrils, seemingly in correlation to its domain-swapping ability. We employ magic angle spinning solid-state NMR and other methods to examine key structural features of these fibrils. Our results reveal a highly rigid fibril structure that lacks mobile domains and indicate a parallel in-register β-sheet structure and a general loss of native conformation within the mature fibrils. This observation contrasts with predictions that native structure, and in particular intermolecular β-strand interactions seen in the dimeric state, may be preserved in ""domain-swapping"" fibrils. We discuss these observations in light of recent work on related amyloid-forming proteins that have been argued to follow similar mechanisms and how this may have implications for the role of domain-swapping propensities for amyloid formation."

https://openalex.org/W2073557699,"The complete mechanism of labor induction in eutherian mammals remains unclear. Although important roles for the fetus and placenta in triggering labor have been proposed, no gene has been shown to be required in the fetus/placenta for labor induction. Here we show that Nrk, an X-linked gene encoding a Ser/Thr kinase of the germinal center kinase family, is essential in the fetus/placenta for labor in mice. Nrk was specifically expressed in the spongiotrophoblast layer, a fetus-derived region of the placenta, and Nrk disruption caused dysregulated overgrowth of the layer. Due to preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome in placenta, Nrk heterozygous mutant placentas exhibited a similar defect to that in Nrk-null tissues when the wild-type allele was paternally derived. However, the phenotype was weaker than in Nrk-null placentas due to leaky Nrk expression from the inactivated X chromosome. Crossing of Nrk-null females to wild-type and Nrk-null males, as well as uterine transfer of Nrk-null fetuses to wild-type females, revealed that pregnant mice exhibit a severe defect in delivery when all fetuses/placentas are Nrk-null. In addition, Nrk was not expressed in female reproductive tissues such as the uterus and ovary, as well as the fetal amnion and yolk sac, in pregnant mice. Progesterone and estrogen levels in the maternal circulation and placenta, which control the timing of labor, were unaffected upon Nrk disruption. We thus provide evidence for a novel labor-inducing fetoplacental signal that depends on the X chromosome and possibly arises from the placenta."

The inflammatory cytokine TNFα promotes inflammation-associated carcinogenesis by activating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (4Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) signaling (5Chan K.S. Sano S. Kiguchi K. Anders J. Komazawa N. Takeda J. DiGiovanni J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα causes oxidative stress, enhances the population of >4N cells, and contributes to tumorigenesis (6Yan B. Wang H. Rabbani Z.N. Zhao Y. Li W. Yuan Y. Li F. Dewhirst M.W. Li C.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11565-11570Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the activation of oncogenes such as NF-κB or STATs cannot fully explain why inflammation can kill tumor cells and yet promote tumor growth. This discrepancy further implies that there may be a molecule (or molecules) that plays a dual role in both killing and promoting tumor cells in inflammation. The transcription factor CEBPD 3The abbreviations used are: CEBPDCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δAURKaurora kinaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastAURKAaurora kinase AAURKBaurora kinase BAURKCaurora kinase C. was suggested to be a tumor suppressor because it can induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells (7Ko C.Y.

Wang J.M. Tsai H.H. Sharan S. Anver M. Leighty R. Sterneck E. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 4106-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CEBPD can also support tumor progression, most likely through a role in hypoxia adaptation (8Balamurugan K. Wang J.M. Tsai H.H. Sharan S. Anver M. Leighty R. Sterneck E. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 4106-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, opposite to CEBPD up-regulated proapoptotic and growth arrest genes (9Pan Y.C. Li C.F. Ko C.Y. Pan M.H. Chen P.J.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ aurora kinase mouse embryonic fibroblast aurora kinase A aurora kinase B aurora kinase C. In mammals, the aurora kinase (AURK) family consists of three members: aurora kinase A (AURKA), aurora kinase B (AURKB), aurora kinase C (AURKC). AURKs play important roles in the control of centrosome and spindle function, kinetochore-microtubule interactions, cytokinesis, and cell division (13Liu D. Lampson M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Liu D. Vader G. Vromans M.J. Lampson M.A. Lens S.M.

Abnormal chromosome segregation can result in aneuploidy, which is associated with the majority of early embryonic loss in human, when it occurs in the germline (17Delhanty J.D. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2001; 65: 331-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aneuploidy is also characteristic of cancer cells. The dysregulation of AURKs is correlated with chromosomal instability and clinically aggressive cancer (18Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 19Hu H.M. Chuang C.K. Lee M.J. Tseng T.C. Tang T.K.

AURKC is localized at chromocenters in diplotene spermatocytes and centromeres in metaphase I and II and persists to a lesser extent in round spermatids (22Tang C.J. Lin C.Y. Tang T.K. Dev. Biol. 2006; 290: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Similar to AURKB, AURKC can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10 (23Crosio C. Fimia G.M. Loury R. Kimura M. Okano Y. Zhou H. Sen S.

Yoshioka T. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7334-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recently, AURKC was found to be overexpressed in primary colorectal cancers and thyroid carcinoma as well as in several cancer cell lines (28Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 29Ulisse S. Delcros J.G.

Therefore, the deregulation of AURKC expression during tumorigenesis appears to be highly relevant and important. In this study, TNFα was found to stimulate CEBPD expression in non-hematopoietic cells. Evidence that links the increase of CEBPD and the induction of aneuploidy was established. Briefly, CEBPD induction resulted in increasing aneuploidy, and caused abnormal DNA segregation, and a prolonged mitotic phase. Moreover, we identified that CEBPD specifically induced expression of AURKC in response to TNFα. The clinical evidence that correlates CEBPD with AURKC expression in inflamed cervical tissue was also demonstrated. HeLa, E1A-immortalized 7V7 (wt cebpd+/+ MEF) and KO5 (cebpd−/− MEF) cells were cultured in complete medium containing DMEM, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. HepG2 and U373MG were cultured in complete medium containing DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. Stable pMT-HA/CEBPD HeLa (HeLa#6 and HeLa#7) and pMT-HA/CEBPD U373MG (U373MG#10) cell lines were generated by transfection of zinc-inducible HA/CEBPD expression vector. A stable AURKC/HeLa-off (HeLa-AURKC#11) cell clone was generated by transfection with pcDNA3/AURKC-myc expression vector and selection with hygromycin B. HeLa and HeLa#6 and HeLa#7 cells were grown either with or without ZnSO4 (100 μm) for 60 h and then 50 ng/ml of nocodazole was added for 12 h. The round-up cells were collected and plated onto a coverslip for 30 min incubation. The experimental cells were fixed by ice-cold methanol:acetone (v/v = 1:1) for 20 min. The fixed cells were then individually probed with α-tubulin (DM1A-FITC, Sigma, 1:50) or CEBPD antibodies (GTX115047; Gene Tex, 1:100). For the immunofluorescence analysis, the primary antibodies of the reactive samples were probed with Alexa 568 FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, 1:200). After washing with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, coverslips were mounted and the images were observed by a laser scanning confocal system (FV1000; Olympus). For the time-lapse microscopy analysis, the round-up cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes containing 1 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342, and incubated in a heated stage (37 °C) with 5% CO2. Phase-contrast and Hoechst images were captured every 3 min for 4 h by a laser scanning confocal system. ChIP assay was carried out essentially as described by Ju-Ming Wang and colleagues (30Wang J.M. Ko C.Y. Chen L.C. Wang W.L. Chang W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sheared chromatin fragments of experimental cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to CEBPD or control mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. After dissociating the DNAs from immunoprecipitated chromatin, the DNAs underwent PCR amplification with four pairs of specific primers of AURKC-F1/−283, 5′-GGGTGTATGCGTTGTTCATTCCCAC-3′, and HACP-R/+84; AURKC-F2/−1375, 5′-TGTTTGAACCTAGGAGGCGGAGG-3′; AURKC-R1/−1149, 5′-AGTCGACTCTATCTGGGGAGCAG-3′; mACP-R1/−998, 5′-GGTCACTTCCAAGAGGAGCAAGTG-3′, mACP-F1/−1194, 5′-GGGCAAGGGATGACAAACAAAAAAGG-3′; mACP-R2/−1797, 5′-CCCATTGTATTCCCTTTGCATAGTC-3′, mACP-F2/−1985, 5′-CCTCAAGCAATAAAAACTAAAACTGG-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 3 min at 94 °C; 32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 25 s at 56 °C, and 50 s at 72 °C, and one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. To correlate the expression status of CEBPD, AURKA, and AURKC expressions with tissue inflammation, a retrospective immunohistochemical study was performed on 4-μm thick sections from representative archived tissue blocks of normal cervical tissue (n = 10) and cervicitis (n = 10). In brief, sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and immersed in citrate buffer at pH 6.0 in a microwave for epitope retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 15 min and sections were then incubated with 10% normal horse serum to block nonspecific immunoreactivity. Primary CEBPD (1:50), AURKA (1:500), and AURKC (1:50) antibodies were subsequently applied and detected by using the DAKO EnVision kit (DAKO, K5001, Ely, UK). To evaluate the immnostaining in cervical squamous epithelial cells, the percentage of moderately to strongly stained epithelial nuclei were regarded as positive and recorded as labeling index. As mentioned above, TNFα causes enhancement of the population of >4N cells and contributes to tumorigenesis. In hematopoietic cells, CEBPD is induced by inflammatory stimuli including TNFα (31Reddy K.V. Serio K.J. Hodulik C.R. Bigby T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13810-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To assess the potential involvement of CEBPD in TNFα-induced aneuploidy of non-hematopoietic cells, we first determined if long-term TNFα treatment can promote aneuploidy in the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line. As shown in Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1, TNFα treatment indeed increased the >4N cell population in HeLa cells regardless of nocodazole treatment. We next examined if CEBPD induction contributed to TNFα-induced genomic instability. We found that the TNFα-induced >4N HeLa cell population was reduced when CEBPD expression was attenuated by two RNAi (Fig. 1B), suggesting that CEBPD plays a functional role in the TNFα-induced genomic instability. Next, we examined the effect of CEBPD on TNFα-induced transformation using an anchorage-independent growth assay in soft agar. We found that the insensitive induction of CEBPD upon TNFα treatment caused larger HeLa cell focus formation on soft agar (Fig. 1C, left panel), in agreement with the hypothesis that CEBPD acts as a tumor suppressor. Interestingly, when we examined the CEBPD expression in smaller foci, sensitive induction of CEBPD upon TNFα treatment (Fig. 1C, right panel, compare lane 10 with lane 11) showed a coincident effect on TNFα-induced focus formation (Fig. 1C, right panel, compare lane 7 with lane 8), and attenuated CEBPD expression reduced TNFα-induced anchorage-independent growth activity (Fig. 1C, right panel, compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 11 and 12). This important discovery suggests that CEBPD, depending on its expression level, could play a dual role in determining long-term TNFα-induced tumorigenic transformation. As mentioned above, genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer cells and is suggested to play a critical role in shifting the cells from normal to the malignant stage. To further confirm whether increased CEBPD affects genomic integrity, a CEBPD-inducible system was introduced into HeLa cells. Consistent with the results presented above, the induction of CEBPD resulted in the increase of >4N cell population in synchronized cells (Fig. 2A). It is known that abnormal chromosomal segregation during mitosis impair genome integrity. We therefore assessed the role of CEBPD in chromosomal abnormality. We observed that CEBPD induction caused an increase in the number of tripolar nuclei, DNA bridge occurrence, and micronuclei formation (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that CEBPD can affect genomic integrity through induction of abnormalities in chromosomes and centrosome. Cancer cells are known to contain extra chromosomes. Therefore one would expect that their mitosis are prolonged. We examined the possibility of prolonged mitosis by CEBPD-induced genomic instability by phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy. The results in Fig. 2C show that CEBPD-activated cells take an average of 103.7 min (n = 91). The results show that CEBPD expression increased the duration of cell division. In addition, to assess the effect of CEBPD on genomic integrity, GFP-stabilized wild-type Cebpd and GFP-stabilized Cebpd-deficient MEF cells were individually generated. After culturing for several passages, GFP expression was lost more readily in wild-type Cebpd MEF cells upon long-term TNFα treatment (supplemental Fig. S2), which indicated the greater ability to induce genomic instability. Taken together, these results show that CEBPD contributes to genomic instability. Deregulation of AURKA, AURKB, and AURKC has been demonstrated in many cancers (32Katayama H. Brinkley W.R. Sen S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether AURKs are responsive to TNFα treatment. We found that in HeLa cells, TNFα induced the expression of CEBPD and AURKC, slightly reduced AURKA expression, and had no effect on AURKB expression (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these data, the results of reporter assays suggest that the TNFα-induced AURKC expression was due to activation of the AURKC gene promoter (Fig. 3B). AURKC plays a functional role in mitosis and increased AURKC was observed in many cancers (27Kimura M. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7334-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of the increase in AURKC in disturbing genomic integrity is unknown. We found that induction of ectopic AURKC alone was sufficient to increase the >4N cell population (Fig. 3C, left panel), and the incidence of tripolar nuclei, DNA bridges, and micronuclei (Fig. 3C, right panel). To further assess the effect of AURKC on genomic integrity, stable HeLa-off AURKC#11-GFP and HeLa-off GFP cells were individually generated. Over time, GFP expression was lost more readily in AURKC-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results show that AURKC contributes to genomic instability. Both CEBPD and AURKC activation showed a concomitant increase in genomic instability and responsiveness to TNFα treatment. However, CEBPD is not directly located on the condensed DNA during mitosis (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the CEBPD-induced chromosomal abnormalities may be caused by a transcription-dependent manner. These observations led us to test whether AURKC is the downstream target of CEBPD. Transcripts of AURKC, but not AURKA or AURKB, increase in response to CEBPD induction not only in HeLa cells but also in the U373MG astrocytoma cell line (Fig. 4A). Moreover, this CEBPD/AURKC axis is also observed in other cells responding to TNFα treatment (supplemental Fig. S4). On the other hand, loss of Cebpd attenuated TNFα-induced Aurkc transcription in MEF cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether CEBPD and Cebpd activate AURKC and Aurkc gene expression through promoter activation, the AURKC and Aurkc reporters were cotransfected with human CEBPD and mouse Cebpd expression vectors, respectively. As shown in supplemental Fig. S5A, Cebpd can transactivate the Aurkc reporter, whereas CEBPD transactivates the AURKC reporter. Moreover, activation of the AURKC reporter is specifically regulated by CEBPD but not LAP1, a C/EBP family member (supplemental Fig. S5B). Furthermore, the lentiviral-mediated expression of CEBPD shRNAs significantly attenuated the TNFα-induced AURKC reporter activity (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis verified that CEBPD knockdown abolished TNFα-induced AURKC expression (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results show that CEBPD plays an important role in TNFα-activated AURKC promoter activity. There are five putative CEBPD binding motifs within 1000 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the AURKC gene (Fig. 5A) identified by the PCDBM program. We further shortened the AURKC promoter from −996/+84 bp (AC1P) to −593/+84 bp (AC2P) for the purpose of determining the CEBPD-responsive region. As shown in Fig. 5A, CEBPD-dependent transactivation of AC2P reporter activity is similar to AC1P reporter activity, suggesting that the AC2P reporter contains the CEBPD-responsive element(s). We next performed an in vivo DNA binding assay to determine whether CEBPD binds directly to the endogenous AURKC promoter. Both exogenous HA/CEBPD and TNFα-induced endogenous CEBPD were found to bind to the proximal 5′-flanking region of the AURKC promoter that contains the CEBPD-I and -II motifs (Fig. 5B). The same approach was conducted to assess whether Cebpd binds to the Aurkc promoter region. This result showed that the binding of Cebpd is detectable on the Aurkc promoter region upon TNFα treatment (supplemental Fig. S6). Furthermore, to specify the function of CEBPD-I and -II an in vitro DNA binding assay was conducted. The results show that the CEBPD-I motif exhibited a higher CEBPD binding activity than CEBPD-II in a gel shift assay (Fig. 5C). To determine the role of these elements in TNFα-induced AURKC promoter activity, the reporter assay was performed with AC2P, AC2PM1 (AC2P mutant on mutant CEBPD-I motif), or AC2PM2 (AC2P mutant on CEBPD-II motif). Mutation of the CEBPD-I site reduced the basal activity of the AURKC promoter (Fig. 5D, compare the first lane with the fourth and seventh lanes). However, both elements contribute to the response to TNFα in a CEBPD-dependent manner (Fig. 5D, compare the second lane with the fifth and eighth lanes). These data suggested that the CEBPD-I motif plays an important role in basal AURKC promoter activation and that both CEBPD-I and -II are critical for TNFα-induced AURKC promoter activity. The evidence presented above demonstrated that CEBPD is an important mediator of TNFα-induced AURKC transcription. To assess the clinical relevance of the correlation between CEBPD and AURKC expressions in inflamed tissue, immunohistochemical staining was conducted on a clinical cervicitis specimen compared with normal cervical tissue. The results showed a simultaneous increase in expression of CEBPD and AURKC, but not AURKA, in inflamed cervical tissues (Fig. 6). These data strongly support clinical relevance for CEBPD-induced AURKC expression. Although it is clear that cell proliferation alone does not cause cancer, sustained cell proliferation in an inflammatory environment combined with accumulation of genetic abnormalities contributes to initiation and promotion of cancer (33Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11047) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that demonstrates the link between inflammation and cancer (34Colotta F. Allavena P. Sica A. Garlanda C. Mantovani A. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism remains uncertain. Two inflammation-responsive transcription factors, NF-κB and STATs, have been suggested to initiate tumor growth by interfering with genomic integrity (6Yan B. Wang H. Rabbani Z.N. Zhao Y. Li W. Yuan Y. Li F. Dewhirst M.W. Li C.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11565-11570Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that an additional inflammation responsive factor, CEBPD, affects genomic integrity at least in part through the activation of AURKC transcription. Due to a tight feedback control between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, normal inflammation, but not chronic inflammation, is a self-limiting process to prevent the persistence of immune responses (35Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing scenario of inflammation serving as a two-edged sword to both suppress and promote tumor formation and cancer progression. Previously, CEBPD was reported to act as an innate inflammation-responsive factor (36Litvak V. Ramsey S.A. Rust A.G. Zak D.E. Kennedy K.A. Lampano A.E. Nykter M. Shmulevich I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which persists in high concentration in chronically inflamed tissues (9Pan Y.C. Li C.F. Ko C.Y. Pan M.H. Chen P.J. Tseng J.T. Wu W.C. Chang W.C. Huang A.M. Sterneck E. Wang J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 5770-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, unlike nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), the level of CEBPD is low during tumorigenesis, as confirmed in multiple cancers (7Ko C.Y. Hsu H.C. Shen M.R. Chang W.C. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30919-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Pan Y.C. Li C.F. Ko C.Y. Pan M.H. Chen P.J. Tseng J.T. Wu W.C. Chang W.C. Huang A.M. Sterneck E. Wang J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 5770-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that an epigenetic regulator, the polycomb group/DNA methyltransferases pathway, increases CEBPD gene hypermethylation, which results in CEBPD being resistant to external stimulation (7Ko C.Y. Hsu H.C. Shen M.R. Chang W.C. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30919-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whereas these reports are in line with a tumor suppressor function of CEBPD, the results of this study suggest that TNFα-induced CEBPD mediates in part the transforming activity of TNFα. Genomic instability is observed in most cancers, and although tumorigenesis has been attributed to the dysregulation of mitotic checkpoint proteins (37Rajagopalan H. Nowak M.A. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation-related chromosomal instability associated with tumorigenesis are poorly understood. For example, the mitotic regulators that control genomic stability in chronic inflammation-induced tumors remain relatively unknown. Increased cyclooxygenase 2 is known to induce genomic instability, and we previously reported that cyclooxygenase 2 is a CEBPD-responsive gene (38Wang W.L. Lee Y.C. Yang W.M. Chang W.C. Wang J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6066-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which suggests that a sustained CEBPD expression may play a role in oncogenesis. Moreover, based on the current study, the association between aneuploidy and chronic inflammation can be linked to CEBPD-mediated AURKC expression. This study not only highlights the role of chronic CEBPD expression promoting genomic instability but also suggests that CEBPD could account in part for the connection between inflammation and tumorigenesis. The accurate expression of mitotic proteins, such as AURKs, plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity (32Katayama H. Brinkley W.R. Sen S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that AURKA and AURKC are inactivated and activated, respectively, in response to TNFα, and that AURKC is specifically up-regulated by CEBPD. Although the mechanism of AURKA reduction during inflammation remains unknown, TNFα-induced CEBPD indeed plays a functional role in transcriptional activation of the AURKC gene, which subsequently causes aneuploidy and genomic instability (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Induction of AURKC was reported in the G2/M phase, which is coincident with or followed by, an increase in AURKB expression (25Sasai K. Katayama H. Stenoien D.L. Fujii S. Honda R. Kimura M. Okano Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Nigg E.A. Earnshaw W.C. Brinkley W.R. Sen S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, following cell cycle progression we found that the expression of AURKC is comparable in asynchronized and synchronized HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S7A). Furthermore, CEBPD showed a slightly shifted pattern, but not an increase, during the synchronized condition (supplemental Fig. S7A). In addition, CEBPD induction not only induces AURKC expression but also promotes the phosphorylation of histone H3 (supplemental Fig. S7B), which is known to associate with chromosome condensation and segregation (39Wei Y. Yu L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the promotion of genomic instability regulated by the CEBPD-mediated TNFα-dependent induction of AURKC transcription uncouples mitotic control of cell cycle progression. Cervical human papillomavirus infection is not believed to be inflammatory in nature (40Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is some epidemiological evidence, albeit weak, to suggest that inflammation might be linked to cervical cancer, perhaps as an human papillomavirus cofactor (41Jones C.J. Brinton L.A. Hamman R.F. Stolley P.D. Lehman H.F. Levine R.S. Mallin K. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3657-3662PubMed Google Scholar, 42Herrero R. Brinton L.A. Reeves W.C. Brenes M.M. Tenorio F. de Britton R.C. Gaitan E. Garcia M. Rawls W.E. Cancer. 1990; 65: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, populations with high rates of cervical inflammation are associated with high incidence rates of cervical neoplasia (43Castle P.E. Hillier S.L. Rabe L.K. Hildesheim A. Herrero R. Bratti M.C. Sherman M.E. Burk R.D. Rodriguez A.C. Alfaro M. Hutchinson M.L. Morales J. Schiffman M. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 1021-1027PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that long-term TNFα treatment increased aneuploidy and anchorage-independent growth of the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line, which was attenuated by blocking CEBPD expression (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, we suggest that inflammation-induced CEBPD expression may promote human papillomavirus-mediated tumorigenesis in cervical cells through inflammation-disrupted genome stability. Accurate mitotic protein levels play a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity. Primary Cebpd-deficient MEFs also exhibit genomic instability and centrosome abnormalities (44Huang A.M. Montagna C. Sharan S. Ni Y. Ried T. Sterneck E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be important to precisely regulate the levels of CEBPD protein to maintain genomic integrity. In addition, cells that survive TNFα-induced CEBPD-mediated genomic instability may be similar to cells that escape mitotic failure-induced apoptosis and contribute to the risk of tumorigenesis. In summary, this study shows that CEBPD can cause genomic instability, which provides a new mechanism by which it may promote tumorigenesis. The dual role of CEBPD may in part underlie the dual functions of TNFα in both suppression and promotion of cancer progression and the complex role of inflammation in cancer.

However, the molecular and cellular basis of the T332I mutant is not understood. Here, we show that ARHGEF10 has a negative regulatory region in the N terminus, in which residue 332 is located, and the T332I mutant is constitutively active. An N-terminal truncated ARHGEF10 mutant, ARHGEF10 ΔN (lacking amino acids 1–332), induced cell contraction that was inhibited by a Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 and had higher GEF activity for RhoA than the wild type. The T332I mutant also showed the phenotype similar to the N-terminal truncated mutant.

The small GTPases Rho family regulates the actin cytoskeleton to influence many cellular processes, including morphological changes, migration, and cytokinesis in various cells (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar). The Rho family consists of 20 members (2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Among them, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are well known to induce the formations of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively, in fibroblasts (3Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Rho family GTPases serve as molecular switches by cycling between an active (GTP-bound) state and an inactive (GDP-bound) state. In their active state, they can interact with a variety of downstream effectors (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar).

The activity of the Rho family is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors.

In addition, one missense mutation in ARHGEF10 identified as an amino acid substitution of threonine (T) to isoleucine (I) at codon 332 (T332I) is associated with slowed nerve conduction velocities and thin myelination of peripheral nerves in humans without any obvious clinical symptoms in the affected patients (13Verhoeven K.

Because the molecular and cellular basis of ARHGEF10 T332I mutant is unknown, we have investigated this and shown that ARHGEF10 has a negatively regulatory region in the N terminus and that T332I mutant is a constitutively activated GEF mutant. Our results might provide the insight into the mechanism of T332I-associated phenotype observed in the peripheral nervous system. The cDNA of human ARHGEF10 (KIAA0294) was kindly provided by T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). Although ARHGEF10 coding sequence used in a previous study (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) started at position 512 of the nucletotide sequence NM_014629.2 (GenBank accession number), in this study it started at position 179 of that. The full-length of ARHGEF10 wild type (wt) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the mammalian myc- and GFP-tagged expression vectors pCMV-myc and pEGFP-C2, thus generating pCMV-myc-ARHGEF10 wt and pEGFP-C2-ARHGEF10 wt. The N-, C-, and N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification with pCMV-myc-ARHGEF10 wt as a template and subcloned into pEGFP-C2. ARHGEF10 T332I was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with pEGFP-C2-ARHGEF10 wt as a template and subcloned into pCMV-myc and pEGFP-C2. ARHGEF10 T332I ΔDH (lacking amino acids 397–583), T332I/S407A, and T332I/L547A were also generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with pCMV-myc-ARHGEF10 T332I as a template and subcloned into pEGFP-C2. RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC were obtained by reverse transcription PCR from mouse kidney, and they were subcloned into the HA-tagged expression vector pEF-HA. All sequences were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencers. The GST-tagged expression plasmid pGEX-5X-1-Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin was obtained as described previously (18Yamada T. Ohoka Y. Kogo M. Inagaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody (American Type Culture Collection); mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (InvivoGen); rat monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Nacalai Tesque); rabbit polyclonal anti-S100 antibody (DAKO); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories); FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). TRITC- phalloidin, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C), and a specific ROCK inhibitor Y27632 were purchased from Sigma. HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Primary Schwann cells were obtained as described previously (19Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Briefly, sciatic nerves of Wister rats at postnatal day 2 or 3 were dissected from 8–12 animals and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in 3 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml collagenase, followed by incubation for 20 min after addition of 100 μl of 2.5% trypsin. The turbid suspension was passed through sterile square nylon gauze to remove debris and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. The suspension was plated into the 10-cm dish and incubated for 1 day. Then, the medium was removed, and DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μm Ara-C was added. After 3 days, the cells were incubated in the same medium for another 7 days to select Schwann cells. Selected Schwann cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Schwann cells were identified by immunostaining using anti-S100 antibody. All cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out with the calcium phosphate method for HEK293T and HeLa cells except for the reporter gene assay, or with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for Schwann cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T and HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/dish, transfected, and cultured for 48 h for HEK293T cells and 24 h for HeLa cells. The fluorescence images of living cells were obtained with a digital camera (DP70; Olympus) equipped with a microscope (OPTIPHOT2-UD; Nikon), and GFP-positive cell numbers were counted. Cells floating in the culture medium were excluded from counting. For Y27632 treatment, cells seeded at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were cultured for 16 h after transfection and treated with 10 μm Y27632 for 24 h for HEK293T cells and HeLa cells for 8 h. The number of GFP-positive living cells was counted as described above. Schwann cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 48 h after transfection. After then, Schwann cells were stained with Hoechst33258. The fluorescence images of living cells were obtained with a digital camera (DP72; Olympus) equipped with a microscope (IX70; Olympus), and the number of GFP-positive cells was counted. Cells with the DNA fragmentation or the chromatin aggregation, and cells floating in the culture medium were excluded from counting. Cells were seeded onto round 10-mm glass coverslips coated with polyethylenimine in 35-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish, transfected, and cultured for 48 h for HEK293T cells and 24 h for HeLa cells. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with blocking solution (5 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm glycine, 2% goat serum, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS). Cells were stained with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin for filamentous actin (F-actin) in blocking solution (1:1000 dilution) or primary antibodies including anti-S100 antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS three times, and DNA was stained with Hoechst33258 in PBS (1:5000 dilution) for 3 min. Fluorescence images were obtained with a digital camera (DS-Qi1-U2; Nikon) equipped with a microscope (ECLIPSE E600; Nikon). GST-fused Rhotekin-RBD was purified from Escherichia coli XL1 Blue transformed with pGEX-5X-1-Rhotekin-RBD. Cells were treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation. Harvested cells were lysed in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged. The supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The beads were washed with extraction buffer six times. Concentration of purified protein was quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with primary antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of active RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC was performed as described previously (18Yamada T. Ohoka Y. Kogo M. Inagaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP- or myc-tagged ARHGEF10 and HA-tagged RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC. After 48 h, cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm PMSF), and centrifuged. The supernatants were mixed with GST-fused Rhotekin-RBD beads and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed with lysis buffer four times, and bound proteins were eluted by SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The band intensity in the immunoblot with anti-HA antibody was quantified with National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and the amounts of RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC-GTP were normalized to the total amounts of them, respectively. Reporter gene assay was performed with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well and in 24-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well, respectively. Cells were transiently co-transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 (150 ng), pSRE.l-luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) (43 ng), and pRL-TK control vector (Promega) (7 ng). After 48 h, HEK293T cells or HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 40 or 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), respectively. Five μl (for HEK293T cells) or 10 μl (for HeLa cells) of the supernatants was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega), and luciferase activities were determined by luminescence intensity. Luciferase activities of the reporter plasmid were normalized to those of the control vector. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated with a Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. The N-terminal regions of several RhoGEFs often regulate negatively their GEF activities (21Yu B. Martins I.R. Li P. Amarasinghe G.K. Umetani J. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Billadeau D.D. Machius M.

Biol. 2009; 9: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the role of the N-terminal region of ARHGEF10 in which Thr-332 is located. Until now, at least two start codons at different position in ARHGEF10 have been selected in studies about the function of ARHGEF10. Mohl et al. selected position 437 of the nucletotide sequence NM_014629.2 (GenBank accession number) as a start codon (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas Aoki et al. selected position 179 of that as a start codon (17Aoki T. Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study we chose position 179 as Aoki et al. did. Thus, when our initiating methionine is at residue Met-1, that selected by Mohl et al. is at residue Met-87, and they studied an ARHGEF10 protein starting at residue Ala-112 (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of ARHGEF10 was first analyzed by focusing on its regulatory role on GEF activity. An N-terminal truncation mutant (ΔN) that lacks 1–332 amino acids existing in the upstream region of DH domain was generated in this study (Fig. 1A). To investigate the effect of the N-terminal region of ARHGEF10 for cell morphology, HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-tagged ARHGEF10 wt, GFP-ARHGEF10 ΔN, or GFP as a control. GFP images of living cells were obtained using fluorescence microscopy. Expression of ARHGEF10 ΔN significantly induced cell contraction compared with wt or GFP (Fig. 1, B and C). To characterize the cell contraction, cells were co-stained with TRITC-phalloidin for F-actin and Hoechst33258 for DNA. The cell morphology represented by fluorescence of F-actin was similar to that represented by the fluorescence of GFP (Fig. 1D). F-actin was often observed in the periphery in the cells overexpressing GFP-ARHGEF10 wt or ΔN. In most contracted cells, the DNA fragmentation, the chromatin aggregation, or a metaphase plate of aligned chromosomes was not observed, suggesting that these cells are neither apoptotic nor in metaphase of mitosis. Because a recent study (17Aoki T. Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicated that ARHGEF10 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication, the effect of overexpression of ARHGEF10 ΔN was examined on centrosome duplication by using the fluorescence microscopy. No effect was observed on the number and localization of centrosome of HEK293T cells (data not shown). Rho-ROCK signaling is implicated in the cellular morphological change (6Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, 7Amano M. Ito M.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). We next examined whether ARHGEF10 ΔN-induced cell contraction is mediated through this signaling or not. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 ΔN and treated with a specific ROCK inhibitor Y27632 for 1 day. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, ARHGEF10 ΔN-induced cell contraction was significantly inhibited by this treatment. This result indicates that ARHGEF10 ΔN-induced cell contraction is mediated by ROCK, suggesting that this cell contraction is mediated through Rho-ROCK signaling. To test whether the ARHGEF10 ΔN-induced cell contraction is dependent on Rho activity, active RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC were evaluated by a pulldown assay using GST-tagged Rhotekin-RBD (20Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was significantly more active RhoA in lysates from cells expressing ARHGEF10 ΔN than in lysates from cells expressing wt (Fig. 2, C and D). This result revealed that ARHGEF10 ΔN has higher GEF activity for RhoA compared with wt. Previously, Mohl et al. showed that ARHGEF10 activates RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RhoB and RhoC activities were also enhanced in the cells expressing ARHGEF10 ΔN (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, we could not detect GEF activity for Rac1 and Cdc42 of ARHGEF10 ΔN (data not shown). These data suggest that the N-terminal region of ARHGEF10 functions as the domain required for repressing its GEF activity for RhoA, RhoB, and/or RhoC. To investigate the negatively regulatory region of GEF activity of ARHGEF10 in detail, we generated another N-terminal truncation mutant (ΔN′), which lacks 211 amino acids from the N terminus of ARHGEF10 wt (Fig. 3A). To examine the effect of expression of this mutant for cell morphology, HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 wt, ΔN, or ΔN′, and GFP images of living cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing ARHGEF10 ΔN′ did not significantly show cell contraction in contrast to ARHGEF10 ΔN (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine whether or not this mutant has lower GEF activity for RhoA compared with ΔN, we evaluated the active RhoA by a pulldown assay using GST-Rhotekin-RBD. There was significantly less active RhoA in lysates from cells expressing ARHGEF10 ΔN′ as well as wt than in lysates from cells expressing ΔN (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that the region containing amino acids 212–332 of ARHGEF10 is the region necessary to repress its GEF activity. To investigate whether this region inhibits GEF activity of ARHGEF10 ΔN, ARHGEF10 ΔN-induced cell contraction was examined in HEK293T cells co-transfected with this region. The co-expression of residues 212–332 could not inhibit ΔN-induced cell contraction (data not shown). This observation suggests that the region containing amino acids 212–332 is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibition of GEF activity of ARHGEF10. Previously, Mohl et al. reported that both full-length ARHGEF10 and ARHGEF10short, which is a splicing variant of ARHGEF10 and lacks residues 282–320, have a similar level of GEF activity toward Rho (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ARHGEF10 282–320 is involved in the negative regulatory effect on GEF activity, HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 ΔN or 265–1344 (lacking amino acids 1–264). Both ARHGEF10 ΔN and 265–1344 induced cell contraction at a similar level, suggesting that they have a similar level of GEF activity for Rho (data not shown). Our data support the idea that ARHGEF10 282–320 is not a negative regulatory region for GEF activity. It was reported that the C-terminal truncation mutant of ARHGEF10 showed lower GEF activity for Rho compared with full-length ARHGEF10 (16Mohl M. Winkler S. Wieland T. Lutz S. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 373: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate in detail whether the C-terminal region is involved in GEF activity, two C-terminal truncation mutants, each of which lacks 2 amino acids (ΔN/ΔC) or 41 amino acids (ΔN/ΔC‘) from the C terminus of ARHGEF10 ΔN were generated (Fig. 3A). To examine the effect of expressions of these mutants on GEF activity including cell contraction, HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 wt, ΔN, ΔN/ΔC, or ΔN/ΔC′, and GFP images of living cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. ARHGEF10 ΔN and ΔN/ΔC but not ΔN/ΔC’ significantly induced cell contraction compared with wt (Fig. 3B, C). Then the levels of active RhoA of cells expressing ARHGEF10 wt, ΔN, ΔN/ΔC and ΔN/ΔC' were evaluated by the pull-down assay using GST-Rhotekin-RBD. The levels of active RhoA were higher in lysates from cells expressing ARHGEF10 ΔN or ΔN/ΔC but not ΔN/ΔC' than in lysates from cells expressing wt (Fig. 3D). The results of active RhoA assay coincided with the results of the cell contraction assay. ARHGEF10 ΔN/ΔC as well as ARHGEF10 ΔN showed higher GEF activity than wt, whereas ARHGEF10 ΔN/ΔC' showed lower GEF activity compared with ARHGEF10 ΔN and ΔN/ΔC. These data indicate that the region containing amino acids 1304–1342 of ARHGEF10 is required for its GEF activity, but the last 2 amino acids of the C terminus of ARHGEF10 is not necessary for the GEF activity. Our data described above indicate that the region including amino acids 212–332 of ARHGEF10 contains negatively regulatory domain for its GEF activity. From these data, we speculated that the substitution of threonine to isoleucine at residue 332 might affect GEF activity of ARHGEF10. To investigate this hypothesis, the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 T332I was transfected into HEK293T cells and GFP images of living cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A). Similar to ARHGEF10 ΔN, ARHGEF10 T332I significantly induced cell contraction compared with wt (Fig. 4, B and C). Similar results were also obtained using HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). To characterize ARHGEF10 T332I-induced cell contraction, cells were co-stained with TRITC-phalloidin and Hoechst33258. Morphology represented by the GFP fluorescence of GFP-ARHGEF10 wt and T332I was similar to those represented by the TRITC fluorescence for F-actin (Fig. 4D). F-actin was particularly concentrated in the periphery of HEK293T cells expressing GFP-ARHGEF10 T332I, which show round and contracted morphology (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S2C). In most contracted cells, the DNA fragmentation, the chromatin aggregation, or a metaphase plate of aligned chromosomes was not observed, suggesting that these cells are neither apoptotic nor in metaphase of mitosis. No effect was observed on the number or localization of centrosome of HEK293T cells, in which ARHGEF10 T332I was overexpressed (data not shown). Expression of ARHGEF10 ΔN induced cell contraction in a Rho-ROCK-dependent manner. We examined whether or not ARHGEF10 T332I-induced cell contraction is also mediated through Rho-ROCK signaling. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-ARHGEF10 T332I and treated with Y27632. This treatment significantly inhibited ARHGEF10 T332I-induced cell contraction (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that ARHGEF10 T332I-induced cell contraction is mediated by ROCK. Next, we evaluated the amount of active RhoA in cells expressing ARHGEF10 wt or T332I by a pulldown assay using GST-Rhotekin-RBD. There was significantly more active RhoA in lysates from cells expressing ARHGEF10 T332I than in lysates from cells expressing wt (Fig. 5, C and D). Moreover, we measured serum-response element (SRE)-mediated transcriptional activity using the luciferase reporter assay"

Hearing loss in Waardenburg-Shah syndrome has been thought to be caused by an Ednrb-mediated congenital defect of melanocytes in the stria vascularis (SV) of inner ears. Here we show that Ednrb expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in inner ears is required for postnatal development of hearing in mice. Ednrb protein was expressed in SGNs from WT mice on postnatal day 19 (P19), whereas it was undetectable in SGNs from WT mice on P3. Correspondingly, Ednrb homozygously deleted mice (Ednrb(-/-) mice) with congenital hearing loss showed degeneration of SGNs on P19 but not on P3. The congenital hearing loss involving neurodegeneration of SGNs as well as megacolon disease in Ednrb(-/-) mice were markedly improved by introducing an Ednrb transgene under control of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter (Ednrb(-/-);DBH-Ednrb mice) on P19. Neither defects of melanocytes nor hypopigmentation in the SV and skin in Ednrb(-/-) mice was rescued in the Ednrb(-/-);DBH-Ednrb mice. Thus, the results of this study indicate a novel role of Ednrb expressed in SGNs distinct from that in melanocytes in the SV contributing partially to postnatal hearing development."

Although FTY720P is an agonist of the S1P1 receptor, its therapeutic benefit is derived from its long term down-regulation of S1P1 signaling. Upon stimulation by the natural ligand S1P, S1P1 is internalized in endocytic vesicles, which subsequently recycle S1P1 back to the plasma membrane. In contrast, activation by FTY720P selectively leads to internal sequestration, ubiquitination, and degradation of the S1P1 receptor (18Oo M.L. Chang S.H. Thangada S. Wu M.T. Rezaul K. Blaho V.

The immunosuppressive actions of FTY720P are dependent on the down-regulation of S1P1 surface expression on activated T cells, thereby rendering the T cells unresponsive to an S1P gradient in the blood and unable to egress from secondary lymphoid organs (20Pappu R.

Besides its effects on the immune system, the therapeutic benefit of FTY720P in multiple sclerosis might rely on S1P receptor modulation in the central nervous system.

Previously, we have developed and validated a computational model of the ligand-binding pocket of S1P1 that was used to successfully screen the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Library for two non-lipid S1P1 agonists (26Fujiwara Y.

In the present study, we set out to identify the structural basis of the lack of activation of S1P2 by FTY720P. Based on the high degree of sequence similarity between S1P1 and S1P2, we first hypothesized that a computational homology model of the S1P2 ligand-binding pocket derived from the validated S1P1 model might reveal critical interactions with S1P that are lacking with FTY720P. To test this hypothesis, we generated a library of S1P2 receptor constructs with point mutations to alter the charge, steric, or size properties of residues predicted to line the ligand-binding pocket. We also generated S1P1/S1P2 swap mutation receptors in which we replaced one or more amino acids of S1P2 with the corresponding S1P1 residues. We examined the effects of these mutations on ligand specificity in an effort to uncover the negative selectivity of S1P2 for FTY720P. However, none of these S1P2 mutations could recapitulate S1P1-like activation by FTY720P. This led us to hypothesize that the FTY720P selectivity determinants in the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors might not reside in the ligand-binding pocket; therefore, chimeric receptors were generated with domain exchanges between the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors. Testing the activation of and ligand binding to these receptors using S1P and FTY720P identified a minimal region of S1P1 in the first intracellular loop (IC) and second transmembrane domain (TM) that confers activation by FTY720P in a chimeric S1P2 receptor. Modeling studies indicate that FTY720P binding selectivity is a function of the entropic contribution to the binding free energy rather than enthalpic contributions. Preferred agonists retain substantial flexibility when bound. Using the S1P1/S1P2 chimera, we tested other S1P1-selective analogs including (R)-FTY720 phosphonate (FTY720PN) (21Valentine W.J.

Interestingly, neither FTY720P nor FTY720PN caused the selective internal sequestration of the S1P1/S1P2 chimera characteristic for S1P1, indicating that additional structural elements are required for the selective trafficking of the S1P1 receptor to the degradative pathway by these types of ligands.

The remaining S1P2 chimeric structure, S1P2(a,b,c,d)S1P1, was created in the MOE program by splicing the IC1-TM2 segment of the S1P1 receptor model in place of the corresponding IC1-TM2 segment of the S1P2 receptor after superposition of two residues before and after each splice. Constructs were minimized first with the backbone fixed and then without positional restraints. Chimeric S1P1 receptors with varying levels of FTY720P selectivity were generated from the S1P1 receptor complexes. One construct, S1P1(b)S1P2, was created by mutating motif b residues RPMYY found in S1P1 to the SAMYL residues found in S1P2. Hydrogen was added to the mutated residues. The remaining S1P1 chimeric structure, S1P1(a,b,c,d)S1P2, was created in the MOE program by splicing the IC1-TM2 segment of the S1P2 receptor model in place of the corresponding IC1-TM2 segment of the S1P1 receptor after superposition of two residues before and after each splice. Constructs were minimized first with the backbone fixed and then without positional restraints. Each receptor-ligand combination was used in molecular dynamics to observe the differences and similarities in structures and dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations used the same force field and solvent treatment as minimizations. Three or four molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each complex depending on consistency between different simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations used the NVT (mole number, volume, temperature) ensemble and 2-fs time steps with light atom distance restraints with temperature raised to 300 K over 30 ps followed by a production phase of 100 ps at constant temperature. Root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of ligand atom positions relative to the starting structure were determined from each simulation, and averages for each ligand atom were computed from three or four independent simulations. N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged human S1P1 and S1P2 receptors in pcDNA3.1 were generous gifts from Dr. Timothy Hla (Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY). S1P2 point mutants were generated at specific residues using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); all constructs were verified by complete sequencing of the inserts. To generate chimeric receptor constructs, we first constructed a panel of receptors in which the N-terminal sequence of either S1P1 or S1P2 was fused to the C-terminal part of the other receptor to create single splice site chimeras. The splice overlap extension method was used to generate the N-terminal FLAG-tagged chimeric receptors in pcDNA3.1 (33Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The single splice site chimeric receptors were used in a second round of splice overlap extension PCR to generate the domain replacement chimeras containing two splice junctions. The S1P1, S1P2, or chimeric receptors were fused in-frame at the C terminus to the GFP from Aequorea coerulescens by subcloning the receptors into the pAcGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The receptors in pcDNA3.1 were amplified using primers engineered to introduce a KpnI restriction site 5′ to the N-terminal FLAG epitope. For receptors with N-terminal FLAG-S1P1 sequence, the forward primer 5′-TCA GAT CGC GGT ACC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AGG ACC CAC CAG CG-3′, which also introduced a silent mutation to abolish an ApaI restriction site at the third amino acid of the S1P1 sequence, was used. For receptors with N-terminal FLAG-S1P2 sequence, the forward primer 5′-ACC ATG GGC GCT TGT ACT CGG AGT ACC TGA ACC CCA AC-3′ was used. For receptors containing C-terminal S1P1 sequence, the reverse primer 5′-GAC CGG TGG ATC CCG GGC CCC GGA AGA AGA GTT GAC-3′ was used to introduce an ApaI site to fuse the receptor in-frame at the C terminus to the GFP polypeptide. For receptors containing N-terminal S1P2 sequence, the reverse primer 5′-GAC CGG TGG ATC CCG GGC CCC GAC CAC CGT GTT GC-3′ was used. PCRs were carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using the following conditions: denaturation (95 °C for 2 min) and 30 cycles of annealing/extension (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) followed by an anneal/extension step (72 °C for 7 min). Purified PCR products were digested with KpnI and ApaI (Promega, Madison, WI) and ligated into the pAcGFP-N1 vector. Positive clones were verified by complete sequencing of inserts and splice sites. McArtl rat hepatoma RH7777 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), rat hepatoma HTC4 cells (a kind gift from Dr. Edward Goetzl, University of California, San Francisco), and HEK293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. For cellular Ca2+ assays of the N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild type (WT) and point mutant S1P2 receptors, the constructs were transfected into RH7777 cells using Xfect transfection reagent (Clontech). The receptor constructs were cotransfected with an equal amount of Gαq plasmid to allow the receptors to couple effectively to Ca2+ mobilization. For cellular Ca2+ assays of the N-terminal FLAG-tagged S1P1, S1P2, and chimeric receptors, HTC4 cells were cotransfected with an equal amount of Gα16 plasmid and receptor plasmid using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HEK293 cells were transfected with N-terminal FLAG-tagged S1P receptor constructs fused at the C terminus to GFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected HEK293 cells were selected for stable expression in growth medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Expression of receptor constructs on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry using indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-FLAG M2 antibody as described previously (26Fujiwara Y. Osborne D.A. Walker M.D. Wang D.A. Bautista D.A. Liliom K. Van Brocklyn J.R. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2374-2385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ligand binding assays were performed as described previously (27Valentine W.J. Fells J.I. Perygin D.H. Mujahid S. Yokoyama K. Fujiwara Y. Tsukahara R. Van Brocklyn J.R. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12175-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and the following day transfected with 0.6 μg of receptor constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days later the cells were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The cells were then incubated in binding buffer containing 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 3 nm [32P]S1P on ice for 45 min in the presence or absence of 3 μm unlabeled S1P or FTY720P as a competitor. The cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml BSA and then lysed in 0.5% SDS, and binding was quantified by scintillation counting. Quadruplicate samples were measured for each condition. To examine the impact of point mutations on receptor activation, N-terminal FLAG-tagged receptor constructs were transiently expressed in RH7777 cells. After 6 h, the cells were detached using HyQtase Cell Detachment Solution, replated into poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates (30,000 cells/well), and cultured for 16 h. The culture medium was replaced with Krebs buffer, 4 h later the cells were incubated with Fura-2-AM in Krebs buffer containing 0.001% pluronic acid for 30 min and rinsed with Krebs buffer, and the Ca2+ response to S1P, FTY720P, or FTY720PN was measured using a Flex Station II fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The ratio of peak emissions at 510 nm 2 min after ligand addition was determined for excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm. All samples were run in triplicate, and assays were performed at least three times with a different transfection for each receptor construct. The response elicited by the agonists was measured, and maximal activation (Emax; efficacy) and potency (EC50) were determined. Activation of the FLAG-tagged chimeric S1P1/S1P2 receptors constructs was examined in transiently transfected HTC4 cells, which show no endogenous Ca2+ response to S1P. The assays were performed similarly to the assays that utilized RH7777 cells except that the HTC4 cells were replated into poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well microplates 16 h after transfection at a density of 40,000 cells/well and cultured for 24 h before performing the Ca2+ mobilization assays. HEK293 cells stably transfected with S1P receptor-GFP constructs were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates (30,000–60,000 cells/well). Forty hours later, the complete medium was replaced with serum-free medium. After 3 h, cells were treated with either vehicle (100 nm charcoal-stripped BSA in PBS) or agonist for 30 min. The cells were either washed in ice-cold PBS and fixed for 15 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C or in some cases rinsed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium that contained 15 μg/ml cycloheximide before fixation. Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope. To validate and refine the previously published S1P2 computational model (31Pham T.C. Fells Sr., J.I. Osborne D.A. North E.J. Naor M.M. Parrill A.L. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2008; 26: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 22 residues in TMs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 predicted to line the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 1) were mutated to alter their charge, size, and/or steric properties to create 37 point mutants. The receptor constructs were transiently expressed in RH7777 cells, and the cell surface expression was measured by anti-FLAG epitope flow cytometric analysis. The constructs showed variable expression at the cell surface, ranging from 5 to 41% FLAG-positive cells (supplemental Table 1). WT S1P2 plasmid was diluted with different amounts of empty vector plasmid and transfected into RH7777 cells to determine the effect of cell surface expression on EC50 and Emax values in cellular Ca2+ mobilization assays. Transfection with receptor plasmid that was diluted 6-fold resulted in only 8% FLAG-positive cell staining compared with 20% for cells transfected with undiluted receptor plasmid; however, EC50 and Emax values were similar to those obtained for cells transfected with the undiluted receptor (supplemental Table 2). Seven of the S1P2 point mutant constructs, F3.33A, F3.33S, L3.43E, W4.64A, K5.38A, K5.38N, and K5.38Q, showed less than 8% cell surface expression and were excluded from further analysis. For the receptors that did show at least 8% surface expression, we assessed the effect of each mutation on receptor activation. The receptor constructs were transiently coexpressed in RH7777 cells with Gαq protein to facilitate coupling of the receptors to cellular calcium mobilization, and the EC50 and Emax of the Ca2+ responses elicited by S1P and FTY720P were measured (Table 1).TABLE 1Properties of S1P2 receptors with point mutationsReceptor constructS1PFTY720PEC50 ± S.D.EmaxEC50 ± S.D.Emaxnm%nm%S1P2 WT10 ± 3100359 ± 6956Mutations of residues interacting with the polar head groupR3.28AnanananaR3.28K191 ± 9896nanaE3.29A>1000106nanaE3.29QnanananaK7.34A123 ± 7558nanaK7.34R28 ± 697383 ± 6352Mutations in the hydrophobic binding pocket that retained wild-type-like activation by S1P (EC50 < 30 nm and Emax > 80% of WT S1P2)V3.40T22 ± 5101892 ± 41940V5.44C18 ± 1287210 ± 20852V5.45T14 ± 794384 ± 34549F5.48A8 ± 397509 ± 14256I5.51A8 ± 38377 ± 3356I5.51L10 ± 1111473 ± 52443H7.36E22 ± 8107379 ± 25945F7.38A10 ± 496292 ± 9256F7.39L9 ± 392132 ± 7446S7.42A23 ± 8100518 ± 9951Mutations in the hydrophobic binding pocket with moderately diminished activation by S1P (EC50 > 30 nm or Emax < 80% of WT S1P2)L3.36A50 ± 2376nanaV3.40A32 ± 1879nanaV5.44A48 ± 1688nanaV5.45A16 ± 676nanaV6.37T37 ± 9102nanaW6.48E30 ± 9102nanaS7.46H40 ± 17112nanaMutations in the hydrophobic binding pocket with impaired or abolished activation by S1P (EC50 > 50 nm or Emax < 70% of WT S1P2)A3.32KnanananaA3.32M93 ± 27118420 ± 13259L3.36QnanananaV5.41A25 ± 1459nanaF6.44A56 ± 2862nanaW6.48AnanananaS7.42L15 ± 1167nanaS7.42H81 ± 2854nanaS7.46LnanananaS1P2 receptor constructs with multiple point mutationsCVVTI5.43-47FCTTV7 ± 289nanaCVVTI5.43-47FCTTV+F7.30L14 ± 684nanaSII5.49-51TLL7 ± 389nanaFAVST7.39-43LVLAV9 ± 651nana Open table in a new tab In previous studies of the S1P1 and S1P4 ligand-binding pocket"
https://openalex.org/W1975277929,"Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH/DDX25) is a testis-specific gonadotropin-regulated RNA helicase that is present in Leydig cells (LCs) and germ cells and is essential for spermatid development and completion of spermatogenesis. Normal basal levels of testosterone in serum and LCs were observed in GRTH null (GRTH(-/-)) mice. However, testosterone production was enhanced in LCs of GRTH(-/-) mice compared with WT mice by both in vivo and in vitro human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation. LCs of GRTH(-/-) mice had swollen mitochondria with a significantly increased cholesterol content in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Basal protein levels of SREBP2, HMG-CoA reductase, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR; a protein that transports cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane) were markedly increased in LCs of GRTH(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. Gonadotropin stimulation caused an increase in StAR mRNA levels and protein expression in GRTH(-/-) mice versus WT mice, with no further increase in SREBP2 and down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase protein. The half-life of StAR mRNA was significantly increased in GRTH(-/-) mice. Moreover, association of StAR mRNA with GRTH protein was observed in WT mice. Human chorionic gonadotropin increased GRTH gene expression and its associated StAR protein at cytoplasmic sites. Taken together, these findings indicate that, through its negative role in StAR message stability, GRTH regulates cholesterol availability at the mitochondrial level. The finding of an inhibitory action of GRTH associated with gonadotropin-mediated steroidogenesis has provided insights into a novel negative autocrine molecular control mechanism of this helicase in the regulation of steroid production in the male."
https://openalex.org/W2018249701,"The dsRNA genome of mammalian reovirus (MRV), like the dsDNA genomes of herpesviruses and many bacteriophages, is packed inside its icosahedral capsid in liquid-crystalline form, with concentrations near or more than 400 mg/ml. Viscosity in such environments must be high, but the relevance of viscosity for the macromolecular processes occurring there remains poorly characterized. Here, we describe the use of simple viscogens, glycerol and sucrose, to examine their effects on RNA transcription inside MRV core particles. Transcription inside MRV cores was strongly inhibited by these agents and to a greater extent than either predicted by theory or exhibited by a nonencapsidated transcriptase, suggesting that RNA transcription inside MRV cores is unusually sensitive to viscogen effects. The elongation phase of transcription was found to be a primary target of this inhibition. Similar results were obtained with particles of a second dsRNA virus, rhesus rotavirus, from a divergent taxonomic subfamily. Polymeric viscogens such as polyethylene glycol also inhibited RNA transcription inside MRV cores, but in a size-limited manner, suggesting that diffusion through channels in the MRV core is required for their activity. Modeling of the data suggested that the inherent intracapsid viscosity of both reo- and rotavirus is indeed high, two to three times the viscosity of water. The capacity for quantitative comparisons of intracapsid viscosity and effects of viscogens on macromolecular processes in confined spaces should be similarly informative in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2111076278,"The aspartate:alanine antiporter (AspT) of the lactic acid bacterium Tetragenococcus halophilus is a member of the aspartate:alanine exchanger (AAEx) transporter family. T. halophilus AspT catalyzes the electrogenic exchange of l-aspartate1− with l-alanine0. Although physiological functions of AspT were well studied, l-aspartate1−:l-alanine0 antiport mechanisms are still unsolved. Here we report that the binding sites of l-aspartate and l-alanine are independently present in AspT by means of the kinetic studies. We purified His6-tagged T. halophilus AspT and characterized its kinetic properties when reconstituted in liposomes (Km = 0.35 ± 0.03 mm for l-aspartate, Km = 0.098 ± 0 mm for d-aspartate, Km = 26 ± 2 mm for l-alanine, Km = 3.3 ± 0.2 mm for d-alanine). Competitive inhibition by various amino acids of l-aspartate or l-alanine in self-exchange reactions revealed that l-cysteine selectively inhibited l-aspartate self-exchange but only weakly inhibited l-alanine self-exchange. Additionally, l-serine selectively inhibited l-alanine self-exchange but barely inhibited l-aspartate self-exchange. The aspartate analogs l-cysteine sulfinic acid, l-cysteic acid, and d-cysteic acid competitively and strongly inhibited l-aspartate self-exchange compared with l-alanine self-exchange. Taken together, these kinetic data suggest that the putative binding sites of l-aspartate and l-alanine are independently located in the substrate translocation pathway of AspT."

https://openalex.org/W2127868557,"In connective tissue cells, IL-1-induced ERK activation leading to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 expression is dependent on cooperative interactions between focal adhesions and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As Ras can be activated on the ER, we investigated the role of Ras in IL-1 signaling and focal adhesion formation. We found that constitutively active H-Ras, K-Ras or N-Ras enhanced focal adhesion maturation and β1-integrin activation. IL-1 promoted the accumulation of Ras isoforms in ER and focal adhesion fractions, as shown in cells cotransfected with GFP-tagged Ras isoforms and YFP-ER protein and by analysis of subcellular fractions enriched for ER or focal adhesion proteins. Dominant-negative H-Ras or K-Ras reduced accumulation of H-Ras and K-Ras in focal adhesions induced by IL-1 and also blocked ERK activation and focal adhesion maturation. Ras-GRF was enriched constitutively in focal adhesion fractions and was required for Ras recruitment to focal adhesions. We conclude that Ras activation and IL-1 signaling are interactive processes that regulate the maturation of focal adhesions, which, in turn, is required for ERK activation.—Wang, Q., Downey, G.
